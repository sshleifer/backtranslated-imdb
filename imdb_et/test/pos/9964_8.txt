Venetian merchant 8/10 <br /> <br /> (This review requires basic knowledge of the story and so it can be thought that it contains a spoiler for anyone who isn't familiar with the story.) <br /> <br /> The famous Shakespeare game as a film version, the Venetian merchant does what Polanski's really sharp Macbeth has done, because it takes the spirit of the game and brings it not only well, but better than a game that one could play alone. <br /> <br /> Mr. Ring Jackson, Director of Rings, has argued that there are three ways to customize a book or game: try to reproduce the original as perfectly as possible, use the original idea as inspiration, but take a full film editing license or (which it preferred) ) stick to the original as much as is cinematic viable, but makes such changes as are necessary for the film while remaining in the original intent or spirit. In Macbeth, Polanski used rainy beaches and realistic rape and murder to convey what is a bloody and terrible period when the game was set up, recalling the terrible context in which characters cause such badness. decisions. It is different (say) from Branagh's Hamlet, which achieved new loyal renditions, but otherwise they offered little new. Macbeth, on the other hand, may have allowed Shakespeare to evaluate some of the dramatic perfection of a fresh audience without extensive research; Similarly, a more familiar audience can find greater depth than without a stepless performance. Such an interpretation plays an important role if the audience is to be fully involved not only intellectually but also emotionally with the points that Shakespeare wanted to do. <br /> <br /> Radford's Venetian merchant adaptation is what makes this happen. It takes very important moral dilemmas involving religious beliefs or promises, and conveys them with a minimal degree of confusion in the spirit of the faithful original story. <br /> <br /> The first one, religious belief, gives meaning to Shylock's otherwise extreme behavior. We see Jews from a time that is placed on a walled getto, only allowed when you wear an identifying red cap. Not having real estate is one of the few ways they can make a living by borrowing money. This makes them both useful to their Christian oppressors and at the same time the object of their misery. The idea behind the idea of ​​banning biblical (both old and new wills) is probably due to not making a profit by helping your friends. It has expanded by expanded Christians to see those they spit on (we see that Shylock not only spits, but also other Jews thrown into the waterways of sport - in an atmosphere that can only be described as threatening). <br /> <br The topicality of the film is curious because the hope of right-wing Christianity (like the post-Bush Americans) has become a full circle because they are now the main supporters of Zionism and Jewish political leaders bite their Palestinian neighbors, as Shylock tries to bite Antonio (if he thinks the law gives him the power to do so). Psychology is self-evident - call the dog repeatedly and it becomes cruel. The ring continues easily because the victims of oppression themselves lose their sense of moral values ​​and become accentuated. <br /> <br /> Strict hands that hidden Portia uses to rescue Antonio are somewhat useful, both cleverly interpreting complex laws played by Venetians as both rue and moral. Shylock may, according to his contract, "pound his body" but may not be blood. It is possible that there is a simple analogy in warfare and terrorism - fighting against fighters or attacking malicious people is much easier if soldiers or criminals are the only victims - if there are big guarantees, like innocent citizens including women and children, hundreds of hundreds of people, the arguments of the heaters (are they warm, Israeli, Palestinian or US Americans bear much less popular support. <br /> <br /> It has long been argued that Shakespeare was anti-Semitic in this story. One wonders whether he had to end up largely with a Christian audience who had little to do with the Jewish people. Far from teaching him greater good, ending at the end of Shylock's Christianity and humiliation - this is of course just a pent up annoyance. Both bearings look just as bad - just having more power than the other. An easy correction of the judgment gives the Christian judges a better public image or Bassanio so sharply (denotes the selection of boxes and solving the puzzles to win the hand of Portia): <br /> <br /> An error in religion, but some sober eyebrows bless it and approve it with the text when is the ornament of honesty? It's not that easy, but assumes that there are some signs of virtue in those parts outside. <br /> <br /> Of course, the great story applies to organized religion (not to spirituality), especially when it is organized for political purposes, but that which is easy for ordinary god-scary people who are not habitual. Goodness, mercy (in jealousy), which is so important for true Christianity, is a wonderful degree in Jewishness, as in most religions. The Jewish religion distinguishes between goodness and charity, effective ways of practicing, and ways to make it part of being rather than just an exterior exhibition. Both Shylock and Antonio are great and use their faith to abuse another religion. Although Shakespeare highlighted the goodness and lack of goodness established by different religions in practice, the film version can reduce the window of interpretation of anti-Semitism and bring greater reality to psychological reasons. <br /> <br /> Keeping promises (men to your wife) is treated less well, as are the elements of comics that are characteristic of cross sections. Bassanio, though strong in his love for Antonio (whether there are homosexual elements?), Cannot make reasonable moral decisions by showing his gratitude to the judge, and thus interrupts his promise (for which Portia forgives him, showing a triumphant character to women) not only highly intelligent and witty, but also truly merciful and attentive than others than his big male counterparts, including his wife.) <br /> <br /> Some actors are a bit cunning and too many regional (English) accents, but all The Venetian Merchant offers Shakespeare's fresh and rewarding experience. I enjoyed the actor, as well as Hayley Westenra and the other very beautiful soundtrack, the songs by Shakespeare and Edgar Allen Poe. All in all, the Venetian merchant is a remarkable British achievement (as far as any film can say that they have a specific citizenship today) cinematography.
