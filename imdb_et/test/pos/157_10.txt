I didn't have any summary for you, you probably already know them. And hopefully you are already familiar with Park Chan-Wook's work. <br /> <br /> I disagree with some other commentators saying "Park is not a trilogy of revenge blah blah blah has moved on." Because you know what? He is !!! The trilogy of vengeance from the beginning was different from the style, how can even the meaninglessness and nuance of "Vengeance compassion" be compared to "Oldboy" with frantic and extravagant? Park Chan-Wook has an incredible style, but his movies don't share the SAME style! It has been true and is still true with the release of "Thirst". <br /> <br /> "Thirsty" is an incredible picture that literally has everything you want in the movie. Cumbersome violence, tasty gore, great humor, incredible intercourse and even very realistic sex events. The story is so crazy that you can't guess what happens at some point. I'm very pleased to say that Park is behind this fantastic dark-comic-vampire-love story. Check it out as soon as possible!
