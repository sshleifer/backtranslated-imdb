I think I like this movie and also I know; it is not perfect, but under the heading "Lily americanization", this charming and memorable semi-musical satire can be more desirable, and are still loved by those who know their special fragility, smart humor and strong narrative produced by Blake Edwards. The unlikely but delightful story follows Lili Smith, the German spy, in a much simpler and less black-and-white war; Lili Schmidt, who passes through Smith, also helps his pathetic uncle in Germany, but not cruel or political, just opportunistic. Lili's target is William Larrabee, a charismatic US stadium leader who can provide his valuable information. The thickening of the plot takes place when Lili loves Larrabee, her eyes are open to the consequences of spies in her games and sees fighting the consequences of the disease for wounded men and understands what it can mean to her men she has met and likes. He gets jealous of Larrabee's affection, he understands that he can no longer do what he has done, and is giving up spy action. The logical end of the film comes after the terrible WWI has ended when it sings in the movie "Wishing" in a dark theater, one by one with members of Larrabee squadron, including his lover, showing that he has forgiven him and their former opponents; and even Uncle Kurt enthusiastically joined the singing "It's a long-lasting Tipperraree" to show that everything is well with the world again. This is a brutal and sometimes brilliant storyline written by the director Blake Edwards and William Peter Blatty for the fame of John Goldfarb; and it is a delightful narrative. This lively movie is performed by Larrabee's squadron, including inebria, who keeps crashing and other loved ones. and the feeling of this stylish and glowing film is almost epic, both in scope and realization. The credit must go to Jack Bear and Donald Brooks for their costumes, Reg Allen and Jack Stevens, Fernando Carrere for another beautiful production, Henry Mancin for his sensitive and suitable musical score, and Russell Harlan for his cinematography. In the beautiful film material, the main actors are Julie Andrews like Lili, Rock Hudson as Larrabee, Keremy Kemp as outstanding as Lili's uncle Kurt, Michael Witney, Lance Percival as inebriate pilot, proud Gloria Paul as Lili's striptease rival and many other fine actors in smaller parts. It's hard to say enough nice things about the pace or wisdom of this wide comedy; Edwards introduces this element to the preparation of real warfare horrors, such as an almost comic-based approach, whereby men fought back to the innocent era of civilization. This comedy also helps to prepare Lili for the non-critical acceptance of the obligation imposed on the German state by accepting the reality it does and potentially what it can cause. It is a rare "lifestyle" movie about Lili's "Americanization", its affirmation in the real world and then, among other things, before the tragedy. It is haunting, I find and beautiful in many ways. I think this is the head of Blake Edwards management; and under the heading "Lili's Americanism", I hardly believe in the changes that could have been recognized as a polished sapphire.
