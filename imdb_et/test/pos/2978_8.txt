This movie took me right from the start, showing that a sweet-looking girl can only see the grave, then Elton John's powerful song "Friends" will play when she has shown her to walk alone through the streets of Paris, carrying a suitcase. naively unknown car theft and prostitution around him. The whole movie is a beautiful, dreamy, romantic collection of youth love scenes that live in the country, live freely, wild horses that run freely around the fields, fields, sunsets, wine delights, campfire evenings and fun. general innocence, all set for romantic music from Elton John. It's magical. <br /> <br /> Somehow I miss this movie when I was growing up. I'm sure it would have given me a strong impression when I saw it. I remember the movie radio ad in 1971, talking about how it was a special movie with Elton John's music and the choir of "Friends" on the ad ("Friends of Makin" for the world) ... ") but I never heard anything about it and these days it could never be seen until I rented it out of the video shop 35 years later, by that time, it was censored and all angry people who were angry with the political agenda used all kinds of ugly words to describe the film. What can I say? <br /> <br /> The story is that a 14-year-old girl is forced to move to her cousin in Paris when both her parents die. (It was their tomb that she visited at the open event.) One day when she was alone in the zoo , he meets a 15-year-old boy, they hit it and agree to meet the next day. It was his father's car, he could not go home with his father's anger, so that two teenagers would live in the French countryside with a mutual background that both hated their lives at home. They are vacant in the cottage, the boy takes himself for unpaid work to support himself, their supposed friendship becomes romantic, the girl gets pregnant and has a child at home. Everywhere there is a boy's father, a police who tries to find his missing son. On the anniversary of a couple of flights, the police finally found a boy by a personal investigation of the employer and they are told that they will see the boy at work next morning. The next morning, the boy is shown to leave his job, saying goodbye to his girlfriend / husband and happily doing carts when the scene captures with his girlfriend who says goodbye. At least it saw the video form I saw. This is an unexpected, albeit well-timed, end, presumably depicting the last moments of bliss before the boy is taken back to his parents' home and his happy life with his wife and child is broken. <br /> <br /> As beautiful as the story and the pictures are, the plot is terribly unrealistic and very viable. I think it's better to just enjoy the real fantasy of a movie as a young dreamer and not go further into the analysis because the whole logic and credibility will break down quickly as the story is explored more thoroughly. Why leave a fully furnished and equipped cottage without supervision if the door is unlocked and undiscovered throughout the year? What were they going to do when the owners came back? Why should a girl trust a car to get pregnant? Didn't they think that other people's homes and food would be unethical? How could they ever expect the necessary dental care or other emergency care outside society? How could a boy be on the road in an accident without collisions and other cars? Where are the places near the civilization where the natural horses are free? How is it that a teenage man does not have his main thing when he takes a girl in the zoo? (Elton John's song lyrics just don't fit.) Why do they take clothes when sleeping outside at night when it's about cold? And so on. Scenes from wild horses are memorable for girls, as well as the unrealistic "friendship before romance" and all back-scouring and tickling scenes with predictable results, blooming through flower fields toward each other, blurry filters, scenes shot in the foreground with natural flowers, baby parties, etc. It works, but it is certainly natural. <br /> <br /> However, this film is about youth and freedom, and this ideal has not changed since the 1970s. Today, the police are being treated as both young and lost pets when they are regarded as mature people with the same needs for romantic love and freedom as the adult in the world and being responsible if it is freedom. Therefore, the message is universal. It's clear why the sequel doesn't work: this story is a magical, year-long real world. It would never be possible to prolong such a situation indefinitely, assuming that this may also happen first and the story of real life after that would not be a magical complaint of such an unrealistic state. I really hope that no teenager will take this movie seriously enough to try such a stupid stop. I am equally hopeful that the teenagers who impressed the film in the 1970s learned something about it, and have since tried to make such a magical world a more realistic reality for others than to preserve the various hate and repression of society. especially for your children.
