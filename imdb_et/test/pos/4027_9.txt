We saw La Spettatrice last night @ Chicago International Film Festival and we were both enormously moving. It is an enchanting story of loneliness and unanswered union, where the longing for intimacy is contrary to our fear of exposing too much of another. All three leaders (Barbora Bobulova Valeriana, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo) are excellent and the dynamics between them are surprising. After all the films that devalue older women, it is wonderful to see Flavia (a professor of law at the University of Rome) who is beautiful and sensual and seductive and powerful. We are due to believe that when a younger woman enters a "mix", the older woman becomes jealous of the younger woman, the man leaves the older woman for a younger woman, and so on. emotional truth is much more complicated. Highly recommended.
