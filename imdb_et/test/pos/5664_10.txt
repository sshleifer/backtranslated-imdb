This is definitely not the best movie. But it is definitely worthy of people with a special mind. So one who loves sorrow and depression and scares fairy tales at night and wolves and real madness - welcome! If you find a copy, of course :) As for me, I can only stand it once ... But since then, wolves and Saint-Lucy and children's drawings have been living and Christ stops in my nightmares.
