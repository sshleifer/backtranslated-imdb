I thought this movie was pretty good! OK, so maybe he had a couple of scenes that could make people think of other horror movies, but I've seen many more pathetic movies that got much higher ratings! Many movies have been rebuilt to a more modern version today and there is nothing wrong with it, which keeps the story alive. I don't think this movie was at all pathetic and I just don't say that because I'm a big Chad Michael Murray fan, but because I enjoyed it. I was at my seat for most of the movie and my friends, and I really enjoyed it and we talked about it all over the house! I'd tell my other friends watching this movie. I'm not saying it's the best movie ever to hit a post office, but it's much better than some people describe it. Everyone has their own opinion, so if you really want to know if it's good or bad, check it out and decide.
