Imposing Missing Japanese Forces in Philipines is a military force in the utter sense of war. This is the effective representation of Japanese pacifist views after World War II. In the film, Japanese soldiers have been left in the jungle of Philips. Faced with the impending hunger, they are using cannibalism and are gradually losing the little humanity they have left. Naming this movie would be frustrating. The viewer is left with a sense of lost value in a completely desperate life in today's fight. The final scene is almost too nihilistic, but the film is a worthy statement not less. Highly recommended.
