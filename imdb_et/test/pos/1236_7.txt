Once again we are happy to see a wonderful opening campaign where the work of the artists is fully restored and we see it in the corner of the old-age food store where the snow gently falls. The room has rich colors of all commodities, from production to canned and carved goods to candy and the like. <br /> <br /> In essence, this is the story of the goods that "come to life", such as animals on animals or pies or even packets of cigarettes. <br /> <br /> The whole "show" is told by "Jack Bunny", Jack Benny impersonator, music conductor Leopold Stokowski, who was so much Looney Tuned animated short pants, I've lost the census. A lot of humor is topical, so it's worth knowing who "Little Egypt" and other characters are. Busby Berkeley-type "aqua" number with bathing suits with sardines that come out of the jar and the tomato-dance-dancing was so smart! All of the above, and everything else, was on the first half of the comics of a little longer than the normal length. The other half was about King Kong type, which escapes the "Animal Crackers" box and terrorizes everyone. This part wasn't much and ended up somewhat stupid. So ..... "A" to the first half, "D" to the other, which makes it about C-plus or B-minus total.
