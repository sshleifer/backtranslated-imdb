Okay, that there was a strange hole on the plot where you could drive zeppelin, but how well was the emotional stuff handled? It would have been so easy that it could have entered the hair, but the writer pulled it away. The image of a former female cyberman, who makes a noise of noise when she saw her thoughts after the recovery of her emotions, is what remains with me forever. It is twice now that the monsters have shown a soft side and a brief sympathetic presentation, the former being the last of the first Dalek series, but Jove has worked. Add other ex-women who were "upgraded" on their wedding eve, and Jackie Tyler, who admitted his wife after "cybercrime", and you have a one-time persistent throat. Keep it up!
