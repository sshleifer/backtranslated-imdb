When in one country, Spain, the forces of Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali joined to create a benchmark for short-term cinematographic surrealism, Un Chien Andalou, Walt Disney, and his co-author Ub Iwerks, made Steamboat Willie in America, the earliest synchronized audio screen (it turned out that it was not the first, unlike other reports). It's also Mickey Mouse's shorts (which are still quietly filmed - the only sounds are small and Mickey and animal hits). It also goes quite quickly in less than ten minutes. However, at these minutes you can directly understand how fun Disney is with your characters and how the use of the new sound changes how his work uses animals as musical instruments. There is no story to talk about, just the random things that happen and occur because of Mickey's (mistake, steamer Willie) on this boat on the river. And as Mickey Mouse's shorts are better, his lack of speech is an advantage. This is a must-have if you haven't seen it as a child, but if you still have it, it may be another worthwhile one.
