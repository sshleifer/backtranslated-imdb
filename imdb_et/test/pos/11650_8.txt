It was once a meaningfully provocative film of the capital! It refused to recognize one-sided and emotional emotions as real as possible. In this film, one of the "human" (and I use this term in a good sense) was of compassionate religious nature! This movie actually made me find and read a book (which is rare for me). Sister Helen published more spiritual tone than religious (which is also rare). And it was a problem for both sides, so people on both sides of the film didn't feel the point was out. And we have a director to thank for that. It's not an entertaining movie. But this is a film that gives a message that can reach your heart. I don't think of another such movie.
