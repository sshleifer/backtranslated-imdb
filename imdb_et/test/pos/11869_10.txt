this movie makes me laugh, even thought about it. such a smart comedy! very accurate but simple. casting cannot be better. all participants are the best choice for their roles and they all play the best, and are not stupid to laugh or scream through the film. the layers and story progress perfectly together and the rhythm flows smoothly. most importantly, the village people YMCA has been introduced, which highlights the importance of the Indian statute, which was only briefly highlighted in the film, making most comedies the smartest and the funniest. I give him ten especially many times comedies are so underrated.
