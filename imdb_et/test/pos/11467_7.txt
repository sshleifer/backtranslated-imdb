PUBLIC MORE is a kind of return to the gangsters' life stories of the early 1960s, such as the MOBSTER PORTRAIT, MAD DOG COLL, and ROARING TWENTIES KING. Although it is cheap, the film has a lot of energy and overall, especially Eric Roberts and Frank Stallone are pretty good. Theresa Russell may seem too glamorous than Me, but she has some very good moments. Noteworthy are the two scenes that are worth noting: shooting at a hotel and fighting a machine bomb in the middle of the street between the Barkers and the FBI. Both sequences are well done and, compared to other low-priced gangsters, such as DILLINGER AND CAPONE, this film is shining.
