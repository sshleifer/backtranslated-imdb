To see the fictional biography "The Phenix City Story", I have to enter the fields where US filmmakers have rarely dared, director Phil Karlson received his "Untouchables" TV mega-hit, mostly "Kansas City Confidential" and this film; and it has become one of the most admired and most imitated films. A rarer example of US filmmakers seems to be a heroic targeted anti-crime film or television series; I remind the viewer that the very "Kainsada" and "Hardcastle and McCormick" and even "Untouchables" producers had to work to produce something, but episodes that are largely devoted to the wrongful behavior of criminals, not to their episodes. , the freezer and the very hot film have their own style, and its lesson seems to be detailed about the opponents and victims of crime organizations and their gangs, twelve minutes of intent where the reporter Roberts interviews the real players in the city of Alabama who were fighting with its corrupt gangs of resistance. grew out of Fort Benning's presence across the river and the presence of nearly a century of vice dens in the region, describing John Patterson's return from Germany, where he was a prosecutor, his father, the Attorney General of Alabama, refusing to join his 14th street vicelord, despite several provocations including beating her son, which Patterson apologized for. There are a number of well-developed signs, including Ellie, who works in one of the clubs and her honest boy, the syndicate leader, Patterson's and John's wife, Ed Gage, the vice-rector, and Zeke Ward, the honest black man against them. The art of Harry Neumann and the artistic direction of Stanley Fleischer are in B / W and are very similar to the news film, adding the film to realistic power. Harry Sukman's music helps the film work effectively. Writer Daniel Mainwaring and Crane Wilbur made a quick pace and a simple story that divides into parts. The first part illustrates a small town empire within one of its clubs, showing the victim's destiny paid by the police for the mobile. In the second part, Albert Patterson refuses Mobi leader, the intelligent Rhett Tanner. In the third part, Patterson returns and after several incidents, including his capture with Mob's head, to take his beating, he decides to lead his father to the Chief Public Prosecutor. His wife is scared; and Mob kills Zeke's daughter Ward and throws her body in Patterson's house with a warning that her children are next. Some more incidents, including the disappearance of the trial, where Pattersons proved that the goon killed his friend who had found a car related to the murder of a little girl, and see how the investigation announces the accidental death, persuading Patterson to run, and winning the Democratic Statewide nomination, despite Mob's statistical tactics - and it will be murdered immediately. John Patterson stops the vigilant crowd from starting the 14th Street Mobile War and uses his voice to summon capital and claim war rights to Phenix City. The clubs are closed and the equipment is confiscated, but not until the Mobi goon murders the inside girl, and Zeke Ward must stop Patterson from killing Tanner instead of giving him the law. The end of the drama is enchanting; but the city forecast is less than painted; In fact, the mob was trying to come back, then Tennessee moved. In this well-functioning classical anti-crime filmmaking class, Richard Kiley is young but very strong as Patterson playing it without accent. John Mcintyre as his father is very good, while Edward Andrews as Boss Tanner is the prize quality. Others are cast by Kathryn Grant, who is a girl, Ellie, Jean Carson, and Kathy Marlowe as Mob women, John Larch as their goon, Biff Mcguire as a young victim, James Edwards as Zeke Ward, Lenka Peterson, John's wife, and some good character actresses as Citizens and Mobi bosses. I advise you to say hard things about the reality and absence of the movie; this is definitely one of Phil Karlson's best guiding efforts. Karlson also made "The Scarface Mob" later "Walking Tall". Reasonable and inspirational look at the simplicity of satisfaction of democratic citizens in the public interest with tyranny and how some honest men can teach them to fight for their rights.
