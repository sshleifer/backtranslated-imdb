Short-lived "The Amazing Spider-Man" was one of the best TV versions of the most famous comic book hero. Only "Wonder Woman" (Lynda Carter) (the best genre and "The Incredible Hulk" (Bill Bixby, Lou Ferrigno)) were better. <br /> <br /> "Amazing Spider-Man" classifies in 1966. 1968 "Batman" because their high camp elements often destroy the adventure. "Spider-Man" classifies all three Superman - "Lois and Clark", "Smallville" and, of course, George Reeves television interpretations Superman, "which brings up. Spider-Man" had its very talented stuntman, who made the controversial cruel acrobatics, his name was Fred Waugh, who created a ridiculous costume for action, Nicholas Hammond, better known as one of Julie Andrew's children in the all-time "Sound of Music" class at Spider-Man. it also had its secre t identity as Peter Parker, similar to Christopher Reeve - Superman / Clark Kent, Adam West-Batman / Bruce Wayne and of course Lynda Carter as Wonder Woman / Diana Prince. <br /> <br /> that only the series had 13 episodes, because when the first episode hit an air stream in November 1977, the whole country looked at it on Wednesday night, CBS should soon release its pilot episode and "The Deadly Dust", "Captive Tower", etc. . "Spider-Man" was short-lived but had a cult, and I think it was much better than the famous comic book hero who played Toby McGuire. <br /> <br /> may be uncertain to release these episodes for two reasons. (A) For them, there may not be a wide market based on the lack of longevity of the series and the generation of children and young people who were not born in the series originally released in the 1970s. (B) One of the early "Spider-Man" episodes dealt with a World Trade Center designs terrorist who was attacked twice a year after this show on 9/11/1993, the country where the towers were destroyed and many innocent lives lost. <br /> <br /> But I don't think this "Spider-Man" episode release would be a bad taste even if the show was an adventure derived from the comic book and camp in the wild. For the "Amazing Spider-Man", there is no great but following cult. If and when CBS gives it out of DVD, this culture could be explained with the episode of Spiderman in 1978. I like to watch the news, but I also like Science Fiction / Fantasy. I am therefore eagerly awaiting the release of "The Amazing Spider-Man DVD".
