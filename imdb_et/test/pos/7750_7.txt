Haruhi Suzumiya's melancholy is based on the somewhat pat formula of the Japanese school drama anime. The formula is somewhat like this: <br /> <br /> 1. The main protagonist comes from the outside world and has superlative power. <br /> <br /> 2. Supporting role is very beautiful and sexy girl. <br /> <br /> 3. There is a normal character that shares the main role of the story. <br /> <br /> 4. Unusual things happen in normal social settings. <br /> <br /> 5. Sometimes there is a story about the main character and the normal character associated with the existence or destruction of the world. <br /> <br /> 6. Everyone does not make any effort to get all the magical powers. They just have it. <br /> <br /> 7. People who are next to this intense group are usually not aware of their superpowers and continue their daily lives. <br /> <br /> So you have it. Suzumiya Haruhi's melancholy has been made on the line that became a successful formula for comics and anime in Japan. Although it follows the pat-formula, the series is perfectly designed and the episodes are always set in an interesting backward recession in normal social conditions that always make Haruhi Suzumiya unusual circumstances. Every player in the story gives you some unusual insight into everyday life that we don't usually know. The philosophical twist of these perceptions is what makes this series extra fun. Visuals are first-rate and beautiful. The crazy idea that Haruhi always feels with the complicated settings of the story can occasionally give you headaches. This is even more complicated by the fact that episodes are played in a sequence that adds confusion. When I looked at the episodes in chronological order, some of the plots were finally affected. I suggest you do the same. This series is much more entertaining to watch.

Let me know if you also have it.
