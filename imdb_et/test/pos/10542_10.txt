this movie is the best horror movie I've ever seen. it is terrible and the plot leaves much to be desired, but the doll gave me horror for weeks. seriously, if you have little children, let them see it. of course I am a bit biased because it is an insecure fear of dolls and dwarfs. also the body of a dual laptop, which is made by a man who makes a minute to beat the troyer. and some free nudity free, which must be any low budget horror movie. all other horror films will be rated forever in my book.
