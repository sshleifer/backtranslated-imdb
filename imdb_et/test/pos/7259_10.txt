This movie has almost everything. The activity is cool, it's funny, 2 big leading men and a really unpleasant villain that I really hated. Many movies have no bad guys at BAD. Just mainly comic books. Jake Scott really has the talent of his fathers to find out how to make great visual images. The direction is flawless and has an irresistible sense of light. Normally, I don't like old-time movies, but I really liked it because it's boring because so many other period movies are (Sense and Sensibility, Age of Innocence and the absolute worst ... Lady and the Duke). It will restore your faith. Mainly for the amazing result of Craig Armstrong. Music is both atmospheric and ethereal and it is very exciting in action scenes. <br /> <br /> The DVD is Dolby 5.1 and has a very grainy and muddy appearance with 2.35: 1 anamorphic image.
