Just to improve something in this previous review, I don't think this film is only for people who know London, it's a very specific situation used to make universal comments. Jack Rosenthal says in the introduction of the published script that it was supposed to be about the characters who, if this exhausting knowledge comes, acquire some self-knowledge. the most complete writings I've seen: technically it is extremely adept at delivering relatively complex details, but it's also a joy in how it connects you. At first, you no longer know about this London knowledge test as the main characters, but you will be with them until it is crucial to you. You are immensely proud of those characters who succeed and you are crushed for those who don't. Especially one whose fall, somehow anyway, will make your hands fly on your face. You don't have to know it, I don't say it's crucial, but it's a drama dimension: if you've seen it, you want everyone to be and you gospel about every detail. <br /> <br /> I hope you see it. <br /> <br /> William
