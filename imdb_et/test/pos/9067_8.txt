Peter Lorre was born to play Stephen Danel on lines like "Mr. Smith, you shouldn't keep my wife like that." and "I said I didn't keep the monkey inside the house!" The poster of this movie is a terrifying green and Peter Lorre's letter that will make you ever go to your penalty colony / island. This movie is not available on DVD, although it is classic and very rarely seen on television. What exactly is the relationship between Stephen Danel and the monkey? Why the monkey disturbs him so much. We never know. The movie should be painted by someone and extracts should be made into Kinks videos. The film appeared again in the 1950s, and only a few of Peter Lorre's biographies spend text on this film. Casablanca was just around the corner. Bogart could have been on this island, but they certainly didn't have a budget for him
