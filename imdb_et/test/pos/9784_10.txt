Critics say this movie is one of the worst films. The observers also claim this. But there is a backside for this coin. They are wrong, very wrong. It's the smartest movie I've ever seen ... <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, you see a story that is unrealistic. A story that reflects the real world. This movie is like a mirror. You see yourself in other ways that people see you. To really understand the directors, you need to see it for the second time ... <br /> <br /> If you see this movie ... Try to understand the story (and see the background) ... Listen to the words of the music ... And smell the industrial complexes. <br /> <br /> This movie is kind of. You hate it (most people) or love it (and you understand it completely). <br /> <br /> Ernest Hemmingway once said, "The world is a good place and worth fighting for". I agree with the second part.
