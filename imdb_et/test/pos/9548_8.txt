I saw the movie in Izmir as the final movie of Izmir Film Festival. I didn't know anything about it, but now I'm glad I didn't refuse Ding-a-ling-less! This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen and believed I've seen zillions in movies! (I'm a film critic!) Smart Scripts and Dialogues ... Smart Details ... What else to say? An Indie masterpiece that has a completely unique sense of humor ... You can't wonder what she is capable of now. Ding-a-ling fell less than five years ago and I'm sure director Onur Tukel is now more mature. I heard that her next function is political satire and I really can't wait to see her previous works like "House of Pancakes" ...
