Although it is for HBO cable television, this is an enjoyable movie and an exciting look at the world of television upside down and doubling. Allowing the viewer to look at the late-night chat scenes in the early 90's, as Jay Leno and David Letterman competed as host of today's exhibition. Kathy Bates gives a memorable presentation to Leno's mercury leader Helen Kushnick and may feel empathy about what Leno / Letterman TV leaders were doing. Nowadays it is so timely considering recent events related to ABC's failed attempt to replace Nightline Letterman. No matter how many times I have seen this movie, I still have the pleasure of seeing how I did it when it was first released. If it ever appears on a DVD, I'll definitely add it to my collection.
