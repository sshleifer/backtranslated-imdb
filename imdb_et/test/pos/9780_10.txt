Having been a great grandfather and sent to Changi during World War II, I was hesitant to watch it on TV for the first time. My grandfather kept a diary in captivity when he died there, his companions bought it back and I have been fortunate enough to read it and feel that I have at least some ideas that Changi really liked. br /> <br /> This is a fantastic idea of ​​what happened to those poor generations who were sent to Chang Prison and show what difficulties and cruelty they showed to protect their country. It is a terrible story about companions, devotion, and the spirit of Aussie, which does not give up. It is worth checking out whether you like Australian history or doing something with the Second World War. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this mini very much and gave it to 10 out of 10.
