The first Disney animated film without the strong involvement of Disney's own is suffering because this story is not very original or interesting (this is, in my opinion, the only animated Disney movie from the 1940s, which is NOT the basis for a book or other work, but rather an original story) . As others have pointed out, the plot is essentially a cross between Lady and Tramp's romance and 101 Dalmatian robbery / journey story. <br /> <br /> To overcome this shortcoming, the filmmakers have successfully used many of the best features of most of Disney's animated films from the past 10-15 years: Phil Harris (Jungle Book), one of the main characters, follows his duet with Louis Prima in the previous in the movie with another Scatman Crothers here. The high-quality visual appearance of this film is practically taken over by "Dalmatians" (some beautiful arrows for French impressionism) and the villain here (butler) also strongly resembles the handbags of this film. (This is probably one of Disney's most memorable villains.) The main story goes between cats and the persistent difficulties of the sander with two rural dogs (with great voice Pat Buttram and George "Goober" Lindsey). Different animal signs are similarly familiar to those who have seen "tramp" and "dalmatians." A cat owner with a striking visual resembling mother does not suffer from any unpleasant features of this character and is inappropriate. very warm and generous. <br /> <br /> The true strength of the movie is voice work, after you start practicing the most familiar actors in Jungle Book, the tactic continues strongly here with Disney veterans Harris and Sterling Holloway Jungle Book and Eva Gabor (who would make a very similar character in the later movie The Rescuers), as well as Crothers and Nancy Kulp, are all great here, especially in Harris and Gabor. Aion is as good as one would expect, showing well different emotions. <br /> <br /> Minor children may be disturbed by some short episodes (escaping from a speeding train, almost sunken by). one of the children) but they are not presented in a particularly frightening or dark way and they are very fast. In general, in many other Disney classics, scary scenes are scarce. <br /> <br /> One small nuisance is the way some of the visual aspects of 60's cultures are claimed to be jazz cats in 1910. Paris; can not help but do not know why this story was not firmly in the current state, except that Paris had changed a lot during its appearance. In fact, this would have made sense. <br /> <br /> Songs, pleasing and sometimes very enjoyable, are not very memorable. Nonetheless, the general energy, excellent voice work and good animation used here contribute to the elimination of relatively few and small weaknesses. Far from the classic 10 like Pinocchio or Aladdin, not quite up to '9', which can give sleeping or 101 Dalmatians, it's probably quite marginal in 8 out of 10; or 7.
