Nothing leaves the mood for this film that is kept together by fully realized characters with some depth. Even hooded tormentors have body language. Jannings' performance is brilliant, with all the will, desire and need. Henry VIII, as he was supposed to be. Henny Porten is perhaps more luxurious and cleaner than Anne Boleyn, but she plays a part as written: a victim who has hit a large (big) baby's jaw. <br /> <br /> Sparkuhl's cinematography is excellent in restoration, the colors are sensual. Lubitsch lets those characters breathe and show their corruption to the smallest. He takes his time, which can try patience when the audience is used to acting, but it is worth spending time. Slow down your heart and watch this little German silent movie.
