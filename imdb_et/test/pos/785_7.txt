Well, I'm an Italian horror big fan and I love movies directors like Argento, Fulci, Bava Sr and Bava Jr, just quote the most famous. "La villa delle anime maledette" is one of the most unfamiliar films of this genre, when this cinema started its current crisis, and director Carlo Ausino sounds completely new in my ear (althoug directed six films). It is the price that Italian directors pay for working in Rome ...). But the film is not so bad. And it's not absolutely right to talk about the trash. OK, the plot is not so original; it reminds me of things like the Amytville series (the year is the same as "Amiano's possession" by Damiano Damiani) or "Shock", the last of Mario Bava's work. But you have to think it's an operator's movie (like Mario Bava's movies); so the most important thing is the atmosphere, not the story or the characters; an atmosphere that is very well created due to light and camera movement. The rest remain in the background. I think the movie works; is not so good but works; it's definitely better than many Hollywood productions like "Haunting" with a higher budget but no bigger ideas ...
