Battleship Potemkin is now the oldest film I've seen, and it's also the first movie ever seen. I heard a lot of good things about this movie, so I got a tape at home and I watched it. When it ended, I thought it was a classic masterpiece. The story is based on the Russian battleship Potemkin. You don't think this, but some of it was sad and disgusting. It is sad that the mother dies and the stroller rolls over the staircase and the nasty creature they have to eat with the maggots of rotten meat. <br /> <br /> Today it is still considered one of the best quiet and Russian films ever made. I think everyone should see it (if they find it.) You'll be surprised how good it is. It must be classic. 5/5
