The 1916 silent film remake based on Maurice Leblanc's 1909 novel. The series of detectors is being made over the years in the UK, USA and France for numerous games, films and TV series. This 1932 version marked the brilliant Barrymore brothers John (Duke) and Lionel (Detective Guerchardina). They would also celebrate together with the Grand Hotel, Dinner at Eight and several other years. Sonia (Karen Morley) appears in Duke's bed on the side of this pre-Hayes code film; first the lights go out in the bedroom, then they go to the main dance hall, then look for bright and missing jewelery as well as other missing valuables ... You can say that talkies were not too long because they still use title cards. Also observe a new type of safety that does not require a combination. Well-considered plot, no big holes, but there are no big surprises here either. Not a bad early film. The smart ending.
