Just reading why this show was canceled makes me quite steamed. It was my favorite as a child and I looked at it whenever I came, no matter how many times I saw this episode. Of course, these effects were not great, but they were also not terrible. They did a good job with the costume, and the beautiful of the 1970s was what was always enjoyable to see and hear, because the music was also very 70's. It wasn't really a comic book comic, but most of the comic book adaptations were not very little of the actual super-crooks of the comics. Spidey's powers were also a bit different here, he had Spidey's mind and he could climb walls, but he wasn't nearly as strong as the comedy Spider man. He was very strong, although I remember the episode where he broke the space by interrupting the door button, he was simply not the driver of the comic book. The exhibition was set in Los Angelos, so there were no mansions there to tilt, but they were fine on the web. It's nice that this show actually has web shooters, not movie shooters. I love movies, but some of me want them to start and do more smart pants with mechanical web shooters. This show was a good star, like Peter Parker, and he was okay Spider-man, it's nice to see Spidey, who doesn't live in the slums like he's in the movies. Neither this show nor the film has a Spider man who is a quick comic insult. However, this show was fun, as funny as the Batman show.
