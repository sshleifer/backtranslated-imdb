This off-beat horror movie seems to get nothing but bad reviews. My question is; why? I think this movie is pretty good. Dee Snider did his first (and only) time management very well. He also plays as an antagonist, Captain Howdy (Carelton Hendriks). This film seems to be forward-looking. Although it came out in 1998, it seems to be modern. Internet predators seem to be the basis here. Although it is on the second level, this is the problem we are still facing. I testify that the story was a few times short, but it doesn't make it a bad movie at all. Robert Englund is even in this movie, which makes it automatically better. The action was not bad, the characters were pretty good too. Hendriks was, in my opinion, a pretty good antagonist. I'll give this fear 7/10. Recommend to Saw fans.
