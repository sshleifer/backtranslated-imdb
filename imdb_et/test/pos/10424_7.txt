It was a very nice soft core film for both men and women. A lot of nudity / sex, but without a general attack you usually get. They would not have been able to do a better job of casting when the whole ensemble was stunning. Trust me if you want to get your wife's mood with Bobby Johnston! And I'm sure Monique Parent, Samantha McConnell and the rest of the women would do it for every heterosexual man. Unfortunately, Bobby and Monique do not share a common scene and if you know the movie they are doing, please let me know! I would like to know. Photography was much better than usual. So was the story. Predictable, but nice, sweet and romantic. At least this was not one of those tedious predictions of murder that were filled with a bottle of blonde women with big fake breasts. I'll give it 7/10!
