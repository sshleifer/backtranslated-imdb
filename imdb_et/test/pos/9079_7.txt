Someone I know said this movie is called flatliners, which was probably on my street. I was told about this movie after viewing the final destination 2 and looking at the extra function about the deth experience. <br /> <br /> I bought a flatlin DVD at a modest price of Â£ 5. I got home and watched it. And I couldn't help but smiled and I felt good that this movie hadn't been in my life before. The film has a group of medical students who are trying to see what is after the death experience. But then the sins have indeed come back and they can physically harm them. <br /> <br /> The action of Kevin Bacon and Keifer Sutherland is great, as you should expect from a couple. And Joel Schmacheur made this great movie as he lost on boys. <br /> <br /> This is a nervous and stylish thriller who is required to provide some type of film fans.
