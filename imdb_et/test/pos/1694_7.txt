In the landscape after the battle, Andrzej Wajda depicts his emotional and psychological confusion in the second Nazi prison in Poland, which was released immediately after World War II. <br /> <br /> The hand held camera examines many extreme close-ups and vivid colors. The final credit, like graffiti on the sides of freight trucks, ends the film symbolically. The soundtrack is great, except for Vivaldi, which sounds like a pop-art sticky opening sequence.
