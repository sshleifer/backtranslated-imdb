It can't be considered a movie review, but commented on the movie I saw when I was young. I remember coming home to the evening, full of wonder I saw. I tried to listen to the story of my parents, but they listened well without understanding what was so strange when two children stayed on an island who fell in love and grew up and had a son. As you now have to guess, I refer to the blue lagoon (1949) that has kept me and was overwhelmed over the years (almost 50) and is now amazed at the anxiety and disgust that has prevented the film from being available on a tape or DVD or anything. I've spent a lifetime sharing the opportunity to get it one day and nobody knows about it. What waste really is! Sorry if my English is not technical or scientific at all, but my mother tongue is Spanish. I will do my best to understand myself. Thank you, My name is Juan and I am writing from Uruguay to S.America.
