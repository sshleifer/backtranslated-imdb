I've never seen an example with so much story, mystery, tension, and heavy strokes. i oder looks at the television anymore, but its own every season of this show and it's amazing. Every episode has worked very well, written and drawn. At the end of the show, I felt that the stories had been drawn too far to stay in prison, but the actors pulled it away. Sopranos absorb immensely compared to OZ. in fact, every cable network, HBO, or not just a cant show that OZ has a candle. I wish it was another season. if this happens, they will probably kill every character in the show, but hey, we must always go. as far as the characters, I would say that O'Reily and Alverez were my favorites. both were a tough scene, but their individual stories thought they were the strongest, except of course Beechers, but still ... somehow the best show, the best network, some of the best actors, PERIOD!
