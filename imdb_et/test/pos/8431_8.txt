It was intimidatingly close, but the Chinese syndrome was the worst advertisement when it happened in a theater release, an accident at three Mile Island nuclear power plants. I still remember that the whole country's attention was glued to lesson plans coming out of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. And don't you know that a Chinese syndrome scholar describes the worst case scenario that makes Pennsylvania's largest area uninhabitable. <br /> <br /> Less than ten years later in Chernobyl, Ukraine, the Soviet Union in the last few days has been dealing with a crisis that didn't get right in time. The Chinese syndrome was again an important film. <br /> <br /> Film is more about cutting corners of safety than anti-nuclear. Jack Lemmon is a man who lived with nuclear power as the captain of the submarine power of all his life. What makes her angry and puts her up to create a confrontation that extracts the film is the stupidity and greed of the leaders of power companies. But crazy and greedy is a commodity every day. Their problem is that there are places where it can be less tolerated in society. <br /> <br /> Lemmon shares the settlement of stars with a couple of famous Hollywood offspring Jane Fond and Michael Douglas. Jane is a TV news reporter who has been constantly assigned to the Puff function stories and it happens that in the event of an accident it is a nuclear power plant. His own station and his subsequent meeting with Lemmon cut off the chain of events depicted in the Chinese syndrome. <br /> <br /> Fonda's best scene, which I still thought was a news host with Peter Donat, with his station. Take a look at his facial expressions when Donat captures the importance of the story and tells him that his very beautiful demands stick to the bottle pieces. Fonda knows he has something and sticks. <br /> <br /> Michael Douglas plays his iconic operator, which was his usual part. With his TCM respect for his father Kirk Douglas, Michael said he chose sensitivity roles. However, I could have seen part of the young Kirk Douglas in this regard. <br /> <br /> What to do with energy for industrialized and industrialized countries, a complex problem that is repelling our government for a couple of generations. This film shows what can happen to nuclear power. Our current problems in the geopolitical world are partly due to dependence on fossil fuels, especially oil. Everything we use has some unforeseen consequences. <br /> <br /> The real hero of the movie, in my opinion, is Wilford Brimley, a Lemmon colleague at the nuclear power plant. In the end, Brimley really comes to the disc. <br /> <br /> Look at the Chinese syndrome to know what I'm talking about.
