I'm not from the US, I'm from Central Europe and I think the exhibition is amazingly good. It's easy to compare with married children. My title says it's not visible to a conservative public. I mean, I'm not that liberal, but it can be a slight difference between European conservatism and men. Anyway, the show in our area is very popular and it is very bad that it only contains two seasons. The last episode opens up a number of continuous and funny moments. Anyway, I and many nations would be happy if it continued. The last thing I am happy about is moral education, which is very nice packed in humorous scenes. I mean, I've seen many comedies that are tragic in the tragic scenes of over two and even more sad, which is absolutely incompatible with comedy. The war does not contain anything like this and is meant to laugh. It's like the Simpsons and the married ones, who have no sad or even uncomfortable moments. I apologize for your terrible knowledge of English, but I hope you understand what I was thinking.
