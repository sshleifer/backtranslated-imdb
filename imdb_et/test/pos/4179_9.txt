Because this movie flipped to the office and is still struggling for the credit it deserves today, it's a big pity - but somehow quite appropriate. The commercial suicide of monkeys committed in making this film is reflected in the metaphoric suicide they show on the screen. To be so cruel to its carefully designed image as a healthy American alternative to the Beatles, it is courage, as in the entertainment sector, not only pawns, but trapped (in the film, literally) within them. artificialness. Monkees' TV series were not as conventional, but HEAD is completely pointless ... although in the end there is actually some kind of circular logic. The consistent sequence of events that are not limited to the actual scene is, in turn, fun and rather distracting. The biggest irony is that the monkeys effectively signed their death penalty as a commercial force when they reached their artistic peak. Their research into psychedelics came to their sound with HEAD (all the songs are memorable for the film), one of the sixties landmark albums. Monkee began to disintegrate after the movie's failure, but HEAD is a noble legacy.
