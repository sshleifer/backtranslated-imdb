If someone had "Ray" in me for about 15 minutes and asked what I mean by Jamie Foxx in the title role, it would have been time to stare empty. What is this (fictitious) person talking about? It wasn't on the big screen of Jamie Foxx. It was Ray Charles. This is one of the best performances of recent years. Like the soundtrack, Jamie is like Ray with a solid look. <br /> <br /> The dark soul genius (who took a revolutionary step to mix the gospel with R & D) died during production. The film about his hard life is good, not big. The direction of Taylor Hackford and the James L. White script follow a well-worn bio-region. Super-talented youth battles fail, gain size, while destroying oneself, then choose to be happy out of the end. The film shows Charles's mistakes (heroin abuse, chronic female baking, persistent bastard-father) even when sucking you with his beautiful music. <br /> <br /> Kerry Washington and Regina King are the main women in Ray's life, one of her long-term wife, and her second long-time lover. Both actors fit in with Foxx. What brings him to another level is his deep understanding and the embodiment of a great musician. The whole cast is effective, especially Sharon Warren, who is his main mother, and Curtis Armstrong as the music master. Hackford stars are likely to be rewarded with trophies and --- even better --- with more characters. <br /> <br /> I wasn't a Ray Charles enthusiast before Ray. Obviously, the film has left a lot (like all biopsies), but this image works as an old-fashioned crowd and a brilliant brilliant / restless person. For those who lure Foxx really didn't sing (if it somehow reduces his performance), take the hike. No actress can sing anyway like Mr. Charles. You don't get everything. What a talented star does in this picture is about as close as everything we probably see for a while.
