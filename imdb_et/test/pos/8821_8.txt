It is (mostly) a "docu-drama" of the later years of KW's life, with almost all the parts played by the participants (but what the TV-contestant himself plays!). It was made for the BBC4 art channel, but I think soon syndicates and DVDs will appear. KW plays great with excellent Michael Sheen, who repeats his previous stage role very successfully. Most supportive pains are also very good, and a nice touch is restoring the era of TV performances with new players. But it's not easy to see - anyone who knows KW's diaries and general unhappy behavior already knows how he spins later in life - so don't wait for an 80-minute Carry On-style outbreak because the pressure is decisively down. Recommended, but it's really comic.
