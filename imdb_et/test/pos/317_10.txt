As I introduce the hundreds of comments that IMDB's loyal readers have posted on this film, I find it very interesting how little, "in the middle of the road," has comments. Everyone loves or hates it. Having seen the Apocalypse about 30 times now and having recently cut it off on a DVD (how did we ever live without these magical digital devices ?????), I can hesitate to say that I am one of those who has a very special place in my heart for this movie for. "Why would you want a movie that's so messy?" ask many of my companions. The answer is: forget the war, forget the brutality .... This is a classic story of a society that defended itself for those who refuse to comply with the status quo. Brando represents an individual who has his own way of working. They (Big Brother) sent him to work, he did it too well, without observing the approved standards of death and destruction (am I the only one who is worried that we have "standards" and destruction of death ????), so they send out a "Compliance Police" to eliminate an individual. Hmmmmmm .... Draw parallels between this and the things you see every day? Deepest to Mr Coppola, whom I believe is the best of all times, I think he overstepped his original film intention and probably didn't even realize it before the movie was released. The subtle sub-text that passes through the film is too much to design and portray; Instead, it seems to have "grown" like some natural flowers in the middle of a vegetable garden. Again, I have to repeat: I think FF Coppola did all this production, as well as the cast and team, bang-up work, but the amount of film exceeds the individual effort ten times. So if you haven't seen the movie, rent it, watch it, then watch it again, and maybe a couple more times, and look for all the general parallels with everyday life. Only then decide on the quality of the film. Those who saw it, look at it with the previously described mindset. I think you may have a brand new recognition for the movie. Or maybe not! Whether you love it or hate it, be sure and give credit to Coppola for your masterful story style!
