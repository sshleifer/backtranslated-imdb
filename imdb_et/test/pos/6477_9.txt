It is hard to imagine, on this day and age, how popular and influential the Norwegian immigrant and chemist was on the American public, and how many national tragedies his sudden death in 1931 was seen. But Knute Rockne was an extraordinary person who both revolutionized and popularized college football and put a small, catholic college on the map. <br /> <br /> I have heard of Rockne's famous Pep-talks and it makes no sense how Pat O "Brien perfectly got his voice and slip. Pat O'Brien strikes his career role, which is Rockne's honesty and fighting spirit Rockne is well assisted by Gale Page, as Bonnie Stiles Rockne, who complained about her home at the Notre Dame training camp, but did not throw anyone out of her house. <br /> <br /> Rockne's first impact on football was Notre Dame is not a coach. One good day on the other side of the lost football game, heavily favored by the army, Rockne and teammate Gus Dorais, played by Owen Davis, used a deliberate attack as an offensive weapon. the bigger boys got to you and ran through the defense. Rockne couldn't find it forward, but he popularized it and the football got into play after the strategy and after that in the jaw. <br /> <br /> Rockne also knew the work of the media.not only was his players inspired. They were well-publicized and it was much for him that college football became a great sport in this golden twenties of sport. <br /> <br /> Plays a small but key role with Ronald Reagan. When George Gipp, the first player at Rockne, was able to achieve size, Reagan could not only get a good result, but forever after a name that was useful in his later political career. What Rockne swore was accurate was a Republican struggle, so many of the GOPs went to Gipper to win one. <br /> <br /> I still remember the widespread photo of 1981, which was one of the first restorations of President Ronald Reagan with Notre Dame's old friend Pat O'Brien. Reagan always credited O'Brien and Dick Powell with all of that era's Warner Brothers than those who were the most favorable and encouraged the young player who was trying to do good. <br /> <br /> Notre Dame itself owes its prestige to Rockne. It is quite possible that Notre Dame would be a covert little Catholic college without bringing football. <br /> <br /> Although George Gipp and the later four horsemen had their place in the sun, they were in the sun. was Rockne, who had a reputation. It is no coincidence that Warner Brothers received Amos Alonzo Staggi, Glenn 'Pop' Warner, Howard Jones and William Spaulding, Rockne's modern and trainers who have a great reputation for appearing at Knute Rockne, All American. It was a way to respect a man who was one of his profession. <br /> <br /> I think more than football fans can enjoy Knute Rockne, All American. Although you can be one after watching a movie.
