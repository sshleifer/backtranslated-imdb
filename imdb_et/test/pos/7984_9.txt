Tim Burton is essentially an expressive filmmaker who is not interested in the dimensions of character and is obsessed with the Gothic dimension by choosing a style throughout his career. However, when his style is so amazingly pleasing, I forgive as many other cinema teachers all the countless mistakes that can be found in many of his films and get into the essence of a hundred million dollar art film. <br /> <br /> It is almost embarrassing for me to see a poetic, emotionally inclusive spirit in the second part of the mediocre franchise, especially when this franchise is targeted at 15-year-old boys. Batman's return should have been as commercial as his predecessor, ensuring that ticketing and cheap (actually very expensive) excitement would be entertaining without really involving his audience. If this were to happen, Tim Burton would certainly be required to manage the third installment. Instead, Burton offers something that can really be defined as "out there". <br /> <br /> The melancholic opening, where a high-society couple throw a prison-like bassette that includes their newborn deformed baby on the river, is clear that Batman is back, not a Buckingham Palace picnic. Cut thirty-three years later, when the political speech was made by the bad boy business world Max Shreck (Christopher Walken), the Red Triangle Circus Gang is attacking Gotham City. Batman (Michael Keaton returns to this role) makes his first appearance with a new logo that saves the day. The circus gang will soon abduct Shrecki and send a black letter confirming the child's political return, now a fully grown penguinman (Danny DeVito, a terribly perfect make-up) whose motives for return are only suspicious to Batman. At the same time, Shreck tries his nervous and uncomfortable assistant Selina Kyle (perfectly played by Michelle Pfeiffer who, frankly, earned more recognition for her performance) who would become a tasty sexy and psychotic Catwoman, revenge, and harbors for some inexplicable reason, a deadly brother against Dark Knight. <br /> <br /> Batman's return is gloomy. The production project is breathtaking, offering a cold haunting Gotham City, with an even more apocalyptic feel than its predecessor. The result of Danny Elfman is a great support for the film, from the moment of recovery to the tragic. The overall tone and direction of the film itself is highly categorical, such as the sad nightmare, the Burton direction overshadowing what is a fairly devilish scenario with an almost irrelevant plot and at the same time perfect for Burton's visual style. . And while Burton's lines of action struggle for joy, the real thrill is that the decline of every major character shows trends, penguins die, Catwoman's mental state, and Bruce Wayne's lonely destiny. <br /> <br /> Warner Brothers hated it, while critical and audience reaction was confusing. After all, they wanted Batman's sequel, not a strange, somewhat terrible horror film, where deformed psychopathic orphans try to rob and execute small batches of babies while vomiting what can only be described by green mucus. The production company wanted an audience-friendly feature, something for the McDonald's clan to promote their happy food, not a movie that was terribly irrevocable, including a sexually repressed secretary, pushed out of the skyscraper and revived with the power of the cats that it brought. unconscious with chewing his bloody ice cold fingers. <br /> <br /> It's easy to understand the massive disappointment that followed Batman's return. The film never felt like a Batman blocker. It is questionable whether Burton really knew who Batman really was, or even if he took care of his character, when he took care of a film that suits his usual themes, which were a beautifully haunting artistic direction and misinterpreted, lonely characters who rarely meet social standards and expectations. That's why Burton couldn't create a great Batman movie. He did, however; create a nostalgic and stunning, buggy movie that will remain my personal and nostalgic favorite. <br /> <br /> It may not be a big Batman movie. But this is a great Tim Burton movie.
