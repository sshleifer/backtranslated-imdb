I like the money! Last week, I hit this local video store in this brilliant movie. Not sure what to expect. Bring it home, put the player on and then my journey of stupidity began. The first look I made a lot of fun, did not laugh out loud really. It was only after watching the second film that I really got hold of it and humor was so much more fun. It reminded me of Austin Powers, the first look was fine, and real fun started talking to people. I'll make all my friends watch this movie. This movie can be one of the most accurate "future" movies ever made. This movie is more than 84 minutes of entertainment, it is a warning to the future of our civilization. Mike Judge, the fantastic mind that brought us, Office Space has brought us a vision for an automated future. Luke Wilson's dead put humor as "average" Joe repaired the movie much more. Watch this movie when you're done, READ MORE! WRITE MORE! THINK MORE! For futures, if not for yourself!
