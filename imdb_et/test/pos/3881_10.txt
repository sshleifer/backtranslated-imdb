For those who want to think intelligently of intelligent people who love the movie, there is good attention to detail and enjoy indie movies with funny, smartly written dialogue, so this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> For those with bad attention, high expectations and no brain ... well .. um .. you can get bored and find things that occasionally drag. <br /> <br /> This is a charming, modest and fast-paced movie with actors that give their roles a real depth and warmth. I smiled pretty much. <br /> <br /> This movie is a small pearl.
