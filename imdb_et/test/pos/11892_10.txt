We stopped screening El Padrino in Australia. Phenomenal filmmaking. We look forward to much more movies from Mr Chap in the future. It was wonderful to see that such a well-assembled film is such a relationship and story that will remain a classic for a moment. Seeing a great quality movie really describes Chapa's serious potential and her skillful skills as a writer, actor, director and filmmaker. Chapa has been impressed with his victorious "blood and blood", and now he is a critically acclaimed filmmaker with true artistic control for everyone who sees his works. Kilo Vasquez is the leading combination of Milo Velka and Blood in Blood Out and Scarface Al Pacino.
