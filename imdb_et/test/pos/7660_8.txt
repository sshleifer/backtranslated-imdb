Hercules' son is seriously wounded when the lion cools down. Hercules (a strong and interesting Regef Park) is committed to the evil and dangerous alternative dimension led by evil and revenge by Gia Earth Goddess (Gia Sandri's deliciously imaginative imagination) and to fight with various monsters to save her son's soul. At the same time, Gia is equally disgusting son of Antaius (the perfect hatred of Giovanni Cianfriglia) as Hercules and takes over the city as a cruel and merciless tyrant. Director Maurizo Lucidi constantly associates the tempting story and maintains a serious tone. This movie begins a little bit slowly, but it really starts to bake when Hercules enters the foggy and dangerous underground spirit world: Hercules, who fights against a humanoid lizard, is highlighting Rousing, and Hercules climbs a giant cage and Hercules is a striking rotten zombies against the attack. Better yet, the bizarre world of spirit just reeks the ghostly atmosphere (you have to love that persistent thick vortex fog!). Light harsh, harsh, heavy physical contradictions between Hercules and Antaius are also completely stones. Of course, we also get a big mondo destructo climatic volcanic eruption. Allvaro Mancor's crisp, widescreen cinematography gives the film an impressive range. Ugo Filippin's powerful, striking score is very majestic. Okay, so this flick is obviously a cheap cute "paste" that uses "Hercules haunted the world" as well as "Hercules and Captive Women", but it's still very lively and fun.
