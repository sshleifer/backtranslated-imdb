This music has a deep meaning, which is appreciated by some. Intelligent sees the wisdom contained in what is most appropriate. <br /> <br /> This music can restore popularity when world consciousness rises. This is a land that is "far from it" where "the living entity has room to grow." His people are "living and growing together" mentally and mentally faster than biological ages. <br /> <br /> Lyrics help us recognize the "world that rotates" and "look to yourself; it's where truth is always." The absolute level of consciousness is more real than the ever-changing world of mind. <br /> <br /> I've been looking for video for years. When I find it or appear on a DVD, it will help "rejoice" "Shangri-la" again. Burt Bacharach's music and Hal David's lyrics made a masterpiece in troubled times, which are now ready to fully appreciate. <br /> <br /> Does this CD inspire you to find your "lost horizon" or recognize how "mind of peace" has found you. - LostHorizon.org
