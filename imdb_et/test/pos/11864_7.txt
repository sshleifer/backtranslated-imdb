Okay. Here's the thing. I've read comments from other viewers --- some tricky movies and some say it's the funniest, darker, and darkest comedy ever made. Tarantino prisoners, etc. Well, not exactly. But what do you think? It's still enjoyable and finally a funny movie. Not brilliant, not a trash. Liv Tyler gives you a great result and you can't take your eyes down. She is a woman with very strong decorating ideas ... Matt Dillon, a very underrated and undervalued actor, is wonderful as ever. He always manages to get in touch with a gentle line and soul, and he pulls the comedy out beautifully. Ditto John Goodman (although religious scriptures, probably funny scripting, don't really work). Paul Reiser is very good --- definitely better than he was on television. <br /> <br /> Usually intolerable, Michael Douglas is really big in this role. Well, look at her movie, look at the movie. This and "Wonder Boys" are reminded that Douglas can act. The film laughs in parts. Okay, not just laughing at your stomach, but I'm sure I'm amused. If you rent it, waiting for another "Pulp Fiction", forget about it. But if you want something clean and a little fun, this is a good choice for the devil.
