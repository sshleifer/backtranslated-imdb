Inferno gives Los Angeles what it deserves - baptism in fire, death from above. An excellent obsession that could remain and sweat out crowning crown masses, but it would not be fun and certainly not dramatic. A really flat review of Variety criticized the characters that they were concerned about their personal redemption instead of banning the world from being saved. But what this great heat is refreshing is that nobody can do it. We are therefore not mercilessly subjected to the "heart warming" of fascist presidents and other big-impact statues, as they collect incredible plots to save the Deep Impact of the chosen humanity. Here's a sweaty and covetous dirty side of a dozen working out their redemption or facing their personal oblivion in an obsolete way - with individuals or ... alone. Great television movie all. Obviously, the destructiveness of the exorcists of the overwhelming network did not denature. I highly recommend.
