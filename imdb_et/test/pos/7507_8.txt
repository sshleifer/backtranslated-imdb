Dr. Bock teaches in the hospital and he is pretty good. His thing is that he is depressed. Dr Bock and her husband left, her children are deviant, she can't be in the bedroom and she feels she's not doing a good job for healing people. She becomes suicide but meets Barbara who makes her ideas better. This whole story is a mystery of murder and a group of angry protesters outside. <br /> <br /> The film is well done and Dr Bock's character is well played. It's a little sad, somewhat funny and somewhat dramatic. It was good to see a few stories that surrounded the hospital, even if they were somewhat related to what Dr. Bock did. Great movie.
