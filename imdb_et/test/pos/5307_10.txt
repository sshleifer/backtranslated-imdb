It's a great movie and it was put right in my top ten (trust me, I know movies!). It's one of the movies that really thinks, not necessarily the story, but about yourself! The film is about fifteen years old (Leland Fitzgerald), who kills an autistic boy. he will be sent to a juvenile hall where he will meet his teacher Pearl Madison. His relationship with Pearl grows slowly and eventually Pearl decides to write a story about Leland and his peers, but when he comes closer to finding out about Leland's motive, he has to deal with his problems first. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie and great music with thumbnails and fantastic results! Look out!
