George Hearn really went out and up, which was great in this case. I've heard Len Cariou's version, but it was too annoying. George was magnificent in nature - very expressive. <br /> <br /> Angela Lansbury was perfect for this part. He gave an excellent result. He gave Mrs Lovett a great evil and comic personality that balanced the blind story. <br /> <br /> I love dark humor when Angela Lansbury sings her songs as well as her physical expressions and George's angry emotions. Hearn your songs with rage, revenge and stress. <br /> <br /> I've been viewing this game 20 times since 1985 when I saw it in PBS. I bought it on video (after it was copied in 1985 independently) when it came out in 1990, and I definitely bought a copy of the DVD in 2004.
