Probably the best football coach in the game. Knute Rockne led the football game out of the "Stone Age" with innovations such as forward and offensive shifts. But she is probably best known for her motivational dressing room calls. Along the way, he brought fame and respect to a small, little, unknown Catholic school in Indiana. Pat O'Brien is incomparable in Rockne's role. An amazing majority that includes Ronald Reagan, who gives an excellent performance as the first true superstar of Notre Dame, George Gippi. <br /> <br /> For football dogs, this is the biggest football film ever made. Take your preference and rent a black and white version. (Some versions have deleted scenes for some reason) If you have a good version, look for a short display of Jim Thorpe immortally, as he sticks to a dressing room with Rockne and the crew just a few minutes before the second half of the year.
