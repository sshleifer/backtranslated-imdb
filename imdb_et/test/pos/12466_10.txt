I do not understand why this is so underestimated in IMDb. This film is just perfection. Better customization of all time Tarzan sold! In French, I can say that this is a better role for Christophe Lambert, which is ridiculous in many films, but here it is absolutely wonderful, charismatic, incredible! The plot is great, well-told, great story, direction, atmosphere, music, all things are perfect! How are these sequences with Elgar's music just plain perfect .. <br /> <br /> Greystoke is a truly incredible film that is underestimated here, I don't know why, but I really appreciate
