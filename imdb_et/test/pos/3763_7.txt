I love this movie a lot. I have to get it on a DVD. I have 2 copies of VHS, but the quality is so bad that you can't read one written joke over the church door. I'm amazed forever that Blankfield did nothing later. He did so dr. Jeckle as well as Mr Hyde are absolutely credible. <br /> <br /> The movie is being plagued by its low budget. (One terrifying editing jumps to the middle of the word and it was described as "Siskel & Ebert".) But there are thousands of jokes, signs of vision that have fine references that are more than compensating. I have often quoted rows (or singing, "I have nothing to hide") and from time to time I describe a scene that is suitable for a conversation. There are at least six scenes that are my favorite music bits of all time. <br /> <br /> Viewers without cocaine can leave a lot of gags. <br /> <br /> "Here, take it." * Visual ride when he hits the window. * "I said," Is that taken? "" Nice Burn! " Visualization of knees, headgear, jockstraps and swimwear. * "Yes. I have a better hand." * "I! Me!" says a woman who is trying to sell. * "Bernie loves them." * "It's my feet, Jack." says black legs. * "Why should we tell you?" ... "SHE'S SUPERMARKET!" * "Ivy!" supermarkets PA. * Whole Cart Loading Ambulance. * etc.
