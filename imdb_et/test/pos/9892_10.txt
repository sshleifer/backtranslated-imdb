When I first heard that the challenge was a self-conscious suicide, my first thought was that it was sick, tasteless, and then comedy. I was skeptical. But I was dead wrong. I loved it completely. The cast, funny liner and especially the surprise end. Suicide is a delicate issue, but it was very well addressed. Comic yes, but offer where it was needed. Verification also includes other common questions that I believe many families can interact with and tactics and humor. I highly recommend checking. WE HAVE TO BE TAKEN. I look forward to its release.
