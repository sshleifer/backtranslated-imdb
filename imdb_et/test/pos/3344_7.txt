I wouldn't have bothered to comment on this movie if I was not disturbed by the fact that porn movies have been constantly being broadcast here in North America. Our obsession, considered to be pornographic or what should be considered, remains the remnant of the "management" that filmmakers have offered by Hayes Committee many years ago, and now is the time for us to go into the past. So far, we have by far not been far from an arbitrary division between what we now understand as 'soft' and 'hard' porn, both bearing the same pornographic mark. It is time that we all understood that this movie was an R-release (soft porn?) Release version or an unrated version available on DVD (heavy porn?) Wasn't pornographic at all. <br /> <br /> The legal concepts of pornography are defined by its ability to deprive or corrupt. Many classic books, such as Lady Chatterley's mistress, Fanny Hill, women in love, O story, or Moll Flanders, have been prosecuted for pornographic content, tried by the jury and solved by definition, but in practice most ordinary citizens are not interested in what they consider legal to be wrong, and apply a simpler test that is quite close to a book or movie that is very close to the line, but that serves most of the other pornographic divisions. Although Hayes's code would have judged AIW as unacceptable for both nudity and sexual depiction, most people today accept that if a book or film's main message is clearly designed to develop long-term stable family relationships where participants find real fulfillment, it cannot be considered pornographic ( this does not mean that works that represent unsatisfactory or unstable relationships should be recognized as pornographic, but that they may require a more complex assessment). In AIW, we have a film about a young female librarian who has been quite hidden in education, and keeps her protector in the length of the arms because she feels that it is what morals require. After she is too disappointed and threatens to leave her, she sleeps the dreams she is carrying on a wonderland (based on the characteristics of Lewis Carrol), where everyone she meets is completely unhindered with her sexual needs. He is shocked, but he is a kind person who takes things when he finds them, so he finds his prejudices that gradually melt before long. She wakes up when her boyfriend returns to interrupt her things, but her attitude to her has changed so completely that their relationship has been completely restored and the movie ends with those who live "happily after" with their children at home and the family dog - an end that is clearly aimed at those romantic people who are still very young in the heart. <br /> <br /> Pornographic? - Hardly! <br /> <br /> Suitable for children? - Probably not quite unless they have very advanced parents. <br /> <br /> R rating? - PG would be more appropriate today. <br /> <br /> Entertainment for viewers in most age groups? - Yes, but the film has its own mistakes - they are discussed in many IMDb comments, but most comments are welcome and enjoyed. <br /> <br /> I believe that the only pornography associated with this film was the "scientific evidence" of an anti-pornography activist claiming that the picture of Kristin deBell's magazine was a photomontage of ten-year-old facial images of different parts of adult models. These and other comments seriously undermined the career of a very promising young actress, but today it seems that film is becoming a cult class, several home video productions have been published in both VHS and DVD formats; the latter was a DVD containing both the R-rated and unrated version of the film, released by Subversive Cinema in 2007. Its copies were readily available until a few months ago, now they are almost exhausted and mailers still have copies in stock selling them several times at their starting price - this situation usually creates a new DVD quickly. This continuing interest, almost 35 years after the release of the original film, refers to an almost classic state. <br /> <br /> Commentators from this database should also provide other viewers with useful guidance on whether the film is worth it or even worth the collection. The purpose of my comments was to emphasize the continuing damage to industry, which is still due to the pressure on large studios to respect Hayes' own censorship recommendations. In this database, readers quickly note general comments such as "not helpful" and rarely do them; but fortunately I still have room to add that in my opinion this movie is quite unusual and worth a look or even buy. It is faulty, but Kristine deBell delivers excellent performance and the movie offers a rather unique and rewarding viewing experience. In general, I would rate it with 7 stars and buy a copy of the next DVD edition when and when it appears. If Mrs deBell is still alive, I would like to hear her comments about the attempts to suppress this film and the belated recognition she has gradually achieved.
