It is a story of long and uncomfortable love. Here is the daily life of a 50-year-old woman and people around her. His everyday life is so common and routine that I doubted who was the real leader at first. Then the viewers know that the woman and the man who were in her high school class had a very small association. The woman has done the same job - a dairy worker and a supermarket - for so long. There are so many slopes that the delivery of milk bottles is a very difficult job. The man was married to another woman who now dies of cancer. She works in the town hall and cares carefully about her home. They never see straight or each other and don't talk to each other. <br /> <br /> The original Japanese title means "Some time reading books". But of course, when the man said, "Now I want to do what I've always wanted to do," he had to hug and love him. He writes to the radio disk that "If God gives us time to speak, we need at least the whole day". Dreaming of that day, she has sublimed the desire for work and reading books. I personally know a woman who has loved a man for a long time, even after she married another woman and died of an accident. Therefore, the story is not so special. Rather, this film depicts well-spoken romance in many ordinary men and women. Through this movie you recall your romance, which has long since disappeared. This is a permanent film.
