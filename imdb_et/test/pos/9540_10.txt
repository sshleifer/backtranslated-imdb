Rail children are perhaps my favorite movie of all time, just the brilliant operation of creativity, the warm and humane communication of three children and the people they live in near the beautiful rural countryside of England. Jenny Augutter is especially believable in the role of her "elder" sister, Phyllis, and brother Peter. The adventures they discover and the relationships they have in their new home and surroundings are very real and exciting. The landscape is lovely, trains part of Great Britain's history and the sound is very mobile. This warm-hearted film will never bring tears to my eyes, either every time or as a home help. I often don't know if I should have been born in this age because I think I would be as good as people treating each other with such a ritual and with dignity. <br /> <br /> I have to say briefly that this film is a bit of a masterpiece and must be seen by anyone who considers himself a "sensitive or caring type". Nesbit wrote this story around the beginning of the 1900s and what a wonderful story it is. More children now have to read it or watch a movie instead of playing a violent video game. If we had more movies of this kind, the world would become a better place.
