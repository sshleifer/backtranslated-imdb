We open in some kind of medical room. The girl is sent to the doctor. She asks her questions. Silence follows. She continues to ask questions by ignoring the obvious traumatic atmosphere of girls. <br /> <br /> The story is about two girls who have come home after some time in the mental home after the "incident" that happened before hand. They are welcomed on their arrival for their capture-too-hard-to-be-nice-but-completely-evil Stepmother, who girls will probably annoy. When the time goes home, the evil stepmother finds out how to torture her daughters. And if it's all turned off, there is a ghost of revenge that doesn't help girls to recover far ... <br /> <br /> This movie is amazing. It is twisted, turns, and definitely leaves you with a lot of thought without meaning. The relationship between the two girls is so warm-hearted, it almost makes you cry a bit (I know I had a teardrop moment, more specifically a "cupboard scene"). But what I love the most about this movie is the feeling of fear for all the running credit. The soundtrack is flawless, the interior of the house and the use of color are fantastic. Pure pleasure for the eyes. This is a firm vision for all Asian film fanatics. Or a movie fan! Easy 10/10.
