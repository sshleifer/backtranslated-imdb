A group of bandits kidnap this gold shipment train. When they escaped, the bandits were divided. One thief who knows where the gold is hidden is killed before he is able to speak. Three men have a different part of the "hint" that leads to gold. Can a banker, a bandit and a bounty hunter find a lost loot? Or do they kill each other first? - The plot is obvious Leone's good, bad and ugly move. Various scenes from the film are also picked up from other Leone, Corbucci and other films. But for me it has been done in a way that does not show disrespect for the original work. Instead, each weapon can play lovingly in parallel with some of the greatest films in Western history. The three men in the city and the final face between the three main stars are a wonderful tribute to the previous SWs. <br /> <br /> - Castellari adds a lot of nice touches - a reflection of spilled wine, a strange entrance to a lively red background and a playful way to finally discover gold. Although many fighting scenes are incredible, they are well-staged and targeted. Two fighting scenes (fighting the market and fighting the bath) are especially well done. He is also not afraid to try different things with his camera. Close-ups, aerial shots and shots around the corners are common in all weapons. <br /> <br /> - Another plus is what Castellari has to do. George Hilton is always good in these films. Gilbert Roland literally plays Gilbert Roland. And SW's newcomer Edd Byrnes owns his two SW veterans. Supported cast features include SW regular Gerard Herter. <br /> <br /> - Every weapon should not be taken too seriously. A nice sense of humor can be found at a nice movie. If this is possible with SW, it's more of a "feel good" movie - very much like Terence Hill / Bud Spencer.
