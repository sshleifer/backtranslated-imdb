I saw this movie so many times, it's so good. Perhaps because I can relate to Tittas' life, why. Not everyone can find it for their taste. It also heals my Italy after every viewing. Am I a sad case? Thank you, Mr Sorrentino. Waiting for your next movie. Although I didn't see the movie in the cinema, I have a DVD and I encourage someone to buy it. Specials alone are worth the price. During the time the director spends the film, it is rarely appreciated, the DVDs add an excellent insight into making the film. As for the story of the film, I am biased. I am talking about all of my friends, but as I said before, I am very concerned with the main owner who is an individual in a situation that is not his own. Mafia in Sicily uses Titta to fund her money in a Swiss bank. He owes them payment for them. Millions of dollars a year ago in the stock markets that went wrong.
