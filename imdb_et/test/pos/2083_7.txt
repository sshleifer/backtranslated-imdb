Annually, 30-51 years when he died of a brain tumor, Zachary Scott made 70 films. He was introduced in 1944 to Jean Negulesco's Dimitrios Mask, where he played Dimitrios. Next year in 1945 he made three films, one of which is one. He is best remembered by cineastes as Jean Renoir's The Southerner, one of the 1945 films, a star in which he was compassionate. However, he often played horrible characters and in this film he is sociopathic for the money of a killer of women. So what happens here? She lives in a house with three women, so be careful! Faye Emerson, who also appeared in "Dimitrios", plays the house of two daughters of the house. She falls in love with Scott and they go secretly. Then his "cute boy" returns to his younger sister (effectively played by Mona Freeman, who looks like Bonita Granville in appearance and behavior) back from school and randomly talks to Scott that she has inherited her order so that Scott turns her sights instead of all the terrible jealousies despise in the household that had to awaken. Things get tense and then they get tenser. Meanwhile, Skandin's calculations are moving forward with the plans for murder. But it turns out that he is not the only one with such intentions. He is also being searched for as a result of his last killing, which the film has opened to let us know the story of his back. James Wong Howe gives this talk an effective rhythmic cinematography led by Frenchman Robert Florey who moved to Hollywood some time earlier. The film is an effective psychopath-in-the-house mystery that can cause a little wear on the edges of some seats, with their slopes.
