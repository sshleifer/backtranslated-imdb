One thing that came to me when I was watching this movie was that it was cast and fun / exciting for the team; I felt they were passionate and devoted to the budget constraint, because they seemed to be attracted to the people involved. <br /> <br /> I tend to like B-movies that are original and have a heart, and I think it's one of those jobs. It seems to me that the actors put their hearts there more than usual, perhaps due to the good direction of the leading actress / director, and they were obviously clear enough to make a single, observable work of art. <br /> <br /> The critics of this movie, which say more or less, "Why not just rent a hardcore porn movie," suggest why they didn't like the movie. Visiting this movie, hoping for a lot of R&D without patience for the plot material, is why it is so pleasant for them. It could be said that the movie is more romantic than a soft porn movie, although I take this star from my soft porn. I think he finished. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is not a large part of the film written, like Tarentino's film, but the plot is decent and the twists are original and sometimes fun. Particularly the end is not disappointment, but joy, a wild guy / heroine and a "leading man" who learns from his complex network of feelings. <br /> <br /> I understand that the producer got these three movies. Hats to prove some tens of thousands of dollars can go a long way if you have some artistic sensitivity and pride. <br /> <br /> Gabriella and other girls with nudity scenes were pleased with the heat, not just the bust of the head, so that a fantasy piece of erotic science with some amazing nude art, even B-border borders, not disappointment.
