Jim Varney Performances Harem Girl and A.U. is amazingly funny - at a level above Chaplin and Keaton. Linda Kash is great for her lifelong role, which is the winner of her hometown of adventure. Unfortunately, the remaining 90% of the films were badly bad because of their strikingness. Ernest Goes to Africa did not bring the creative challenges inherent in low-budget film production. You only need to see the cable.
