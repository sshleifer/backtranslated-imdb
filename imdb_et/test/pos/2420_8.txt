I read a few comments on the film and impressed that it was not as good as the previous Karate Kid contributions. Although my favorite is still Karate Kid II, I felt that this fourth installment of the movie was in line with others and had some important lessons. Unlike previous versions, a karate student is a teenager who takes a different kind of study trail than a male teenager. Maggi thinks it is a bit more complicated, but it rises to the event. The plot revolution is plausible and predictable. I found that bad guys are little one-dimensional, but this weakness is in varying degrees in all parts. The work of the camera is impressive and from time to time has made some beautiful landscapes. Zen Monastery is so harsh and charming. Zen monks add a bit of humor and lightness to the narrative flow. I liked the Zen Bowling scenes, a humorous counterweight to the more serious Zen archery scene before. The quality of the movie is like a good TV series. The music chosen in the background is very good, especially with the Little River Band, who plays "Listen to Your Heart". The film's lessons are valuable and worth learning. They feel they are faithful to the karate spirit and make sure they do not fight the battle. All in all, I enjoyed it.
