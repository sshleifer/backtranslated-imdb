This program is definitely my favorite non-sitcom television comedy. Australia produces very few good programs - most of the TVs I watch (and I live in Australia) come from the US and England. <br /> <br /> The fun part of this show is how controversial it is. Like when they passed the numerous security breaches at the APEC Summit, who pretended to be Canadian diplomats. </p> skits. All of these come together to make a fabulous, very funny TV show. Segments like "Ad Road Test" and "Message from Osama bin Ladin" are fun. For anyone looking to have a fun satirical television comedy - this is definitely the display you should look at. <br /> <br /> All boys are great and do a great job for you for half an hour of entertainment. <br /> <br /> I appreciate this 10/10.
