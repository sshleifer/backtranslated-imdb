It was really a pleasure to see; the dialogue was - mostly - quite prominent (I thought the roles of women were a little better, which is a nice surprise). The performances were equally good. Frank Gorshin surpassed him when he went into his various disadvantages, but it may be his overcompensation for what I see as weaknesses in writing his character; he's very good. Harry Groener is doing just as well with a little signed character (Tony) that moves somewhat with more characteristic scenes. Ursula Burton is a great sister Theresa, who really carries the film because of some of her weakness. Seymour Cassel and Louise Fletcher are a bit unused here, although I always liked their work. Shirley Jones, Wendie Malick, Jill Eikenberry and Faye Grant are also very good (I couldn't think of Grant reminding me of Catherine O'Hara here); Cloris Leachman rather tears his role with reasonably good results. <br /> <br /> I want a more secure hand behind the camera. Sometimes framing or staging seemed a bit out of place or uncomfortable. The neighborhoods seemed to me overwhelmed (or used). And we don't always go from scene to scene as smoothly as we like. Some of the "tougher" approaches to a federal agent (music, costume) were too topical for me. And few fantasy stories really worked. But there are things that were very well done; for example, the order of opening in 1970 in Buffalo. And frankly, all the scenes concerning the work of the Theresa church (I suspect that the writer and the actress liked much of the character that helps). Scenes between Malick and Eikenberry are very good. <br /> <br /> The piece is probably a bit overfished - it looks like you can keep them all at once, and there are too many schemes between couples. I got a little too much. And I was a little bothered with ending it (if we really had to root our biggest coni to succeed?), But driving along the road is very enjoyable. It would be nice to see more of these independent movies as it was. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
