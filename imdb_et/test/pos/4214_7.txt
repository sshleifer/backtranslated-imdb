Authentic Asian superstar Jimmy Wang Yu directed and wrote this film, which I have only seen on dubbed video tape. Widescreen (Shaw Scope!) Shape disappeared and the original actor's voice was missing, but it's still good to see. The story is a regular martial arts school that fights with Japanese land plots when our young hero finally beats a lot of mixed thugs. <br /> <br /> Fighting gets better if the movie doesn't disappear. At the beginning of the film, it seems stiff and boring, but later there is a big scene where Wang Yu fights with joint gambling stories, then walks into a snowy scene and takes more crooks with a knife, sword and fist. This part is very exciting. <br /> <br /> Then it's pretty good, but it would be interesting to see a non-duplicated widescreen version if it exists.
