EFFICIENCY The need for someone to play the role of public taste and political correctness can always get under the skin. It seems that they are self-determined, self-improving, pseudo-intellectual types appear everywhere; be it in the family, in the church or in the bowling league. <br /> <br /> These are the men who would have completely ignored society and ignored everyone we had before; if, of course, whatever it is, do not drive to the "general" standards of "acceptable" language, customary practices, and "right" behavior. <br /> <br /> This is that the last day of high-tech book burners is aimed at much of Hollywood's greatest achievement; namely, their participation in their alliance propaganda through their unspeakable messages and themed games. <br /> <br /> BULLY BROWN IN YOUR GENERATION, The Forbidden Code and the Unacceptable List From now on are expanding into wartime cartoons that don't meet the new funny, socially-designed official attitudes; these "Think Police" have abandoned us. <br /> <br /> We were really surprised to see that there are many such animated short themes. Most of what we know are Warner Brothers' LOONEY TUNES and MERRIE MELODIES; Bugs, Daffy, Elmer & Porky, all in contradiction to Hitler, Goerring, Il Duce, Tojo and others. Surprisingly, we found numerous MGM, Walt Disney, Lantz, Paramount-Famous Studios and Brothers Fleischer cartoons. <br /> <br /> You are SAP MR. JAP (Famous Studios / Paramount Pictures, 1942) is a great example of what we are talking about. <br /> <br /> Being virtually unrecognizable from the cartoons that were from the Max and Dave Fleischer studios in the 1941 business coup that brought them out, bringing the new name "Famous" Studios, YOU'RE A SAP MR. JAP did not carry any blatant plot elements that would reduce the last day of Popeye cartoons to the final short film level. <br /> <br /> We all remember how we would have Popeye and Olive Oyl together. Enter Blutos, usually with a wolf's exponent, and an acceptable version of the male response to feminine pulchritud. The Olympics are less than respectable for Bluto; Until she gets a little too physical and always blurred, "Hey Babe, how to kiss?" Right now we hear "Help! Help, Popeye and tiny sailors come up to save the day; filled with spinach with a compulsory jar! Are we exaggerating, Schultz? ONE again this JAP SAP comic is nothing like that. The Fleischer brothers put a little boy in service in 1941 to match the country's mood and open gesture for the men who are currently appointed. The first peace project in the history of the United States: Max and Dave even put Popeye into the mythical battleship USS Pensyltucky. /> <br /> The OUR point is just that. SPINACH FER Great Britain is not in the true sense of the theater program for vehicles with comic strips, but rather like the "big metropolitan newspaper", they are another illustration of the panel. charac who are very symbolic and represent nations, ideas and ideals like fair and In most cases, the hero (Popeye, Bugs Bunny or whatever) is alone with the enemy symbol. Both are highly exaggerated visual metaphors of abstract concept and thought; even if they are hidden in humorous traps for a wider taste. <br /> <br /> Our liberal stupidgencia (the opposite of intelligence) may not see itself in this way; but for such behavior they are no longer than the book burners of the Neo Nazis. <br /> <br /> PLEASE allow future generations to view and evaluate contemporary events that are both historical and humorous. > <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
