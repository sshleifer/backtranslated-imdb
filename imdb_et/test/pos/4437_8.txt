The best documentary film nominee for the 2004 Academy awards follows my architect, Nathaniel Kahn, his father, the legendary architect Louis I Kahn. Lou Kahn died in 1974 when Nate was 11 years old, leaving behind incredible but limited work, outstanding debts and three different families living a few kilometers away. <br /> <br /> My architect follows Kahn's life by chronologically exploring his buildings and mixing their beauty with a charismatic but selfish and emotionally immature genius. Since the son Lou did never openly acknowledge during his lifetime, Nate's story has been very complicated without the ability to focus. <br /> <br /> When exploring the excellent Salk Institute in California, Nate creates her father's mythical space and use of light in her buildings, making her a peaceful and exciting experience for the viewers. The Nate Roller Skating Picture of the Sate's Smoky White Meeting Point highlights the harmony of nature with nature. It's breathtaking. My architect also includes Louis Kahn's difficulties in accepting his designs. Several fantastic buildings exist only on paper released by more practical architects and real estate developers. Only when Louis Kahn went east was his visions enthusiastically embraced. In India, where he built the Indian Institute, a former associate describes him as a guru. In Bhangladesh, where he built a magnificent National Assembly building, citizens consider him a father of democracy. <br /> <br /> Viewing my architect is a great way to start or continue learning the importance of architecture and space. But it is the irony of Lou Kahn's egoism with his inspirational misconduct. 4 stars.
