"Tourist Trap" is a strange thriller that appeared in the 1970s, about 5 friends Molly (Jocelyn Jones), Jerry (Jon Van Hess), Eileen (Robin Sherwood), Becky (Tanya Roberts) and Woody (Kevin McDermott) SLAUSEN'S LOST OASIS Museum, a curious and frightening roadside museum. The gold coin of this decaying but strange life-like dummy is led by exclusive Slausen (Chuck Conners), but apparently harmless. Slausen has one warning for young people: away from Dave, reclusive and disturbed brother of Slausen. <br /> <br /> The young people's curiosity gets the best of them and they're going to explore. The trap is pulled! In the midst of flying objects, the doors, scarves in the brackets, lurking on their own, by some hidden forces, slowly close the trap. "Creature" Davey and his murderous mannequin army make friends quick and brutal until only one remains. <br /> <br /> Although Slasher's movie "Tourist Trap" still does not contain elements that touch on movies, such as Chase scenes and lurking, and the killer carries a mask. <br /> <br /> Killer's seemingly telinetic abilities to lock bolts and animate wax dummies are accustomed to very high impact. Perhaps the most frightening dummies in this movie, which are scary enough to start, but here are rallies. The film will succeed despite or perhaps because of a bad budget. These wax figures are coarse plastic dummies, but it only gets more frightening when their eyes move with an incredible person. Working is really pretty good, Chuck Conners gives well-rounded and horrible presentations like Mr Slausen, Jocelyn Jones is big as a female.
