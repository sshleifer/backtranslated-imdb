Team A still repeats daily on Dutch television (RTL7, about 1800 hours) and still watch it! I don't like the A team ... I adore them absolutely! It's just nice to see Justin's former team members. Returns memories of old times when I was young. I would have given you 10 great rewards, but Justin looks like he manages the former A-team members himself. Of course, this is the only bad thing about the documentary. Too bad Justin doesn't look for Melinda Culea ("Amy A. Allen"). But it's nice to see Mr. T.'s action back. Too bad for her, she doesn't show the party at the end. But this party is too short to laugh again and see everyone again.
