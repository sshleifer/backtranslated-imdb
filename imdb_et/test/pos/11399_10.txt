One of the things I like about PT Anderson is that he has the courage to take the talent that most people have on the side or have entered the side and change the stars. Example, wash ... Burt Reynolds offers great results in this movie. And when Adam Sander proves that he can be a Punch Drunk Love, it's not enough ... here comes Mark Whalburg ... as you have never seen before. <br /> <br /> I think many people go through "Boogie Nights" because they are anti-porn, or just flat out to hate the adult industry and can't forget this aspect of this movie. But there is a great story below that the characters lose everything and fight back. It's a beautiful movie ... and it's too bad that enough people see it.
