Shia LaBeouf has impressed me before my ability to act, but I can honestly say that I am looking forward to seeing her in her 20-year-old Francis Ouimet, who ignores his father's demand that golf is not his, and enters 1913. US Open Tournament in your hometown ... the start of the movie will pull a bit, but it is necessary to build a sub-block that Shia works so well ... the whole cast is well chosen and they work very well with the story based on the actual event is the end that anyone can discover before seeing the movie ... but even knowing that this information doesn't spoil ... Josh Flitter is wonderful as Eddie Lowery, Francis' caddy, who keeps her grounded and loose, but at the same time it becomes invaluable part of Francis's aspirations ... Stephen Delane is outstanding because Harry Vardon, the legendary British golfer who is not afraid of Francis idolizes. ..and who knows the background Francis comes as he was a humble beginnings ... Bill Paxton takes the film with the formula and makes it worth it ... Bravo Mr. Paxton and wins cast ... pictures of the story of the people who live it, it's a movie, with which to get, enjoy and enjoy ... it's nice that we get such movies that we feel good looking ...
