I feel at a loss, so this movie is great. Kieslowski is a writer, philosopher; and as a great filmmaker, his greatness lies in his writing; and "red" is his paradigm. This film is a metaphysical study of the artist's assessment of the creation of his fictional world; about how an artist tries to live through his art - even his own - even if he does not know that, regardless of how he enters his own story, it is still a fiction and he is still outside of him to restore the world that is still burdened with the unreality and the reality of the life he has tried to articulate. And magically it is not all about the mystery of love and fate, and the living characters of this story, the least priceless story, a pre-rated place. If I had to choose, I can name the biggest movie ever made.
