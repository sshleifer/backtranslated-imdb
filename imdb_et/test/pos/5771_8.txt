This Knotts outing includes one of his finest ties, Frank Frank. Welker makes a movie. Knotts and Welker compete for a laugh and both get a lot. Knotts works for a small "no where" city where some of the most unrecognizable officials run the city. If things go wrong with the city's fathers, let Knotts fall. Frank Welker's character communicates with Knotts, and together they stumble with a mess and Knott's good name. This film shows the usual character of Knot's fear of death, which made him famous for years on television and film. This can be Knot's last good outing. If you have another 90 minutes, get a good old-fashioned laugh at the big icon, Don Knotts.
