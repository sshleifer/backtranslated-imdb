I can't believe how many great actors will be on one screen. This is realism and subtle functioning that makes it real. It must be the best comedy created to date and I love Seinfeld and everyone loves Ramondi. It's just fabulous and it seems like everyone in my family agrees. This is not my own opinion. It seems that the whole world is talking about different incidents and they are trying to rebuild them. To my hat team. Some exhibitions have an actor who makes the whole exhibition. This plot comedy has eight (8) of them. This makes it so amazing. Some people pray for health, wealth, or fame. I pray that the show will never end. Sicerely John. LKHUBBLE2@talkamerica.net
