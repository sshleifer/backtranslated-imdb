What the hell are these horror films waiting for these days. Is there something like "SAW" or is it just a mess ... ??? Now, I do not claim to be a knowledgeable expert, but I am about 47 years old, have seen and literally have thousands of movies, and I honestly think this director really gave this film a really good sincerity. Believe me, I was ready to go right after the dialogue started. Prove that it was terrible and I was pleasantly surprised. This is not a Mameti script, it's sure; but THERE !!! the whole HORRIBLE garbage out there, ONLY in the horror, I thought it was closer to the top of WAY ​​than most. <br /> <br /> The director used many nice, smart corners of the camera; the soundtrack was great and moody, perfect for the atmosphere needed for such a movie. Editing and timing were very good. And hasn't used a tired, worn cliché related to excessive violence; For example, ***** MINOR SPOILER ***** Fully delightful and totally free (but tasty ..., uh, I mean tasty) to the naked shower scene I look forward to getting sliced ​​and diced; but, EFFICIENTLY, we can just enjoy our heavenly love and that is ***** END MINOR SPOILER ***** The tension was also set very well, leading to a very ambiguous end, where you are not quite sure what is. ***** SPOILER ***** Especially where the psychiatrist leaves the girl and Pinnochio alone in the office; We see the doll talking to her, but we don't do it in video recording. The mother also sees Pinnochio moving and being quite disgusting; so is both mother and daughter mentally ill ... ??? There is also the original "killer" and what the mother had supposed about the possible effects of evil. But even for that, we are still not quite sure that the WHO will kill ***** END SPOILER ***** In conclusion, I believe it was a good, strong and sincere effort for some good ol 'Early Moon type and a lot of violence. And without throwing a typical SLEAZE for some reason (just lovely, innocent, beautiful shower scene that I remember until the end of my days ...) Compared to the absolute MINDLESS that's out there, DEFINITE, strong 8/10 !!!
