I saw this movie in Galway Film Fleadh, where he won the best short film. I have to say that I thought the direction was fantastic and the members of the key people were very memorable. Both the main cast are definitely the names that are intended. happen. The kiss was definitely a big challenge, made with great enthusiasm! <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the film has been filmed, and I've heard that the DOP won the Tribeca Film Prize for the work he did for his movie and I have to say ... I earned it. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who was a teenager in the 1980s. It brought back some great memories and some frightened.
