Hitchcock's very clean spin leads Larry (Billy Crystal) and Owen (Danny DeVito) to unpleasant lives: Larry's former husband has become rich when he published the book he wrote, and Owen has the most sense to imagine a mother. When Larry tells Owen that he calmly watched "Strangers on a Train," Owen gives the idea that they should make some murders in the film. And like in the movie, Larry thinks it's a joke, but Owen's serious. <br /> <br /> How they came up with the idea of ​​"Throw Mom's Train", which I never know, but it's a fun movie. There is no dull moment in this. And that end was hoot. Crystal and DeVito are the best, and Anne Ramsey is as much as "The Goonies" here. Modern classic.
