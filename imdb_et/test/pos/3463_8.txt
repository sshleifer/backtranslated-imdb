It's rare that I get the chance to watch an IMDb movie that is so closely related to my own life. However, if someone lives with cerebral palsy (though less difficult than Michael, one of the main characters in the film), I don't want to give this film a "free passport" just because it deals with a substance that has rarely approached; and if it does, it is usually treated seriously. There were little problems with the film; and I would like to look at the first to make sure that this is not my situation, which has made my assessment of this overall great movie! <br /> <br /> * Some of what I felt was disgracefully calm at the expense of reality. If I had every pound every time a good-natured member of the public told me I had racing, I would be a much richer man; but personally speaking, it is more suited to the public perception of how we deal with our shortcomings, not the reality that is actually happening. The same thing goes to the pub to spend time watching people with disabilities - it's not a big deal for those who actually do it, as far as it can be admirable for foreigners. I appreciate that this has been previously hidden from the perspective of Michael; but I think he's focusing on enjoying experiences rather than thinking about what the big thing was, he was actually there. So how much time we spent on seeing them seemed to be a bit too much. <br /> <br /> * I felt that the terminal nature of Rory's disease was brought too late for us; that is, it was simply used as a cheap sentimental device to come between a couple, not something that everyone knew it had to be dealt with. <br /> <br /> To balance these criticisms, I also have to praise. Although I thought some of the scenes that showed them the capture of normal life were touched superfluous; the script also rose to some complicated places that I wouldn't have expected, and it comes out with a lot of credit. For example, raise the question of love and relationships; and show everyday devices that are often used to assist and assist non-working people. Also, despite the fact that we are being destroyed by a deadly emotional shock tactic, the film as a whole is far less gentle if anyone has the right to expect such films to be. <br /> <br /> Brenda Fricker can and has played a powerful role in the autopilot, which seems to have been around for years; but Robertson and McAvoy share a special interaction that needs to be noted. Inside, I make cartwheels that a group of people somewhere have finally made a movie that justifies the lust of many people with disabilities.
