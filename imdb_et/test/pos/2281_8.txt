I am very impressed with the reviews I have read about this movie - generally well-read, thoughtful and informed - probably people who like and think about movies. I couldn't add anything to the excellent review work already done by IMDb members. If I would like to, I would like to correct a small but widespread misunderstanding in many reviews: Mr. Baseball was American and behaved in an ugly way, but he was not an ugly American. The original unsightly American was Homer Atkins, one of Burdick's and Lederer's novels of 1958's novel, and Mr Baseball. Homer was an American archetypal and archetypal engineer - he went to Vietnam to work with people, respected and liked the people he met, he used the appropriate and sustainable technology with his hosts, and they liked and respected him precisely because he showed democratic values ​​and virtues of America. His ugliness was purely facial, only skin deep; his personality and humanity were deep and genuine. Mr. Baseball illustrates everything that is unknown to Europeans and Americans so often to other cultures; Homer Atkins, an ugly American, was the other side of our coin, representing our humanity and dignity. I believe that the ugly Americans still exceed Mr. baseball; they are still our last, best hope.
