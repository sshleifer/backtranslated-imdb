When I first watched this movie, I thought it was a very strange film. But I know the director almost always has a goal in making a film. So I decided to check it again. The second time I looked at it, I realized that Albert Puyn is a very talented and very original filmmaker. At first, the viewer was told that the film took place ten years after the fall of communism in Eastern Europe. But they had clothes and cars that were typical for the 1950s. They had plutonium, which I think is a symbol of futuristic trade. I think this means that the movie is not specified in real time. The movie has music that creates a long music video that tells lyrics about some real fun, especially for intro and outro. <br /> <br /> Albert Puyn uses a red and blue background color when he shows symbols of the Communism (red) and capitalism and Western world (blue). You have noticed that Ice-T has the name Mao (Communism) and that if it is in focus, the background color is red. The American policeman who plays Burt Reynolds is always filmed with a blue background color. The club where Mao and his gang are getting is also with a red back color. The crazy month is between red and blue. <br /> <br /> The white little dog Mao was beginning to symbolize, I think, a control force. Mao was at the beginning of the dog, but the policeman finally took it. It symbolizes the fall of communism and the replacement of capitalist thinking from Western Europe in Eastern Europe. <br /> <br /> I think Crazy Six is ​​a very well made movie. Albert Puyn creates a sci-fi / action movie with political depth. This is a different but very special film about Communism in Eastern Europe. <br /> <br /> I look forward to watching another remarkable film about Albert Puyn.
