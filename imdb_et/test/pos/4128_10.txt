"The Buddy Holly Story" shows the beginning of the famous singer in Dunk Lubbock, Texas, until his stardom, his tragic death in air defense. The fact is that Gary Busey, like Holly, is playing his instruments, this film is in the purest form. There are some things that seem a bit hackneyed, namely the Lubbock people, considering the rock 'n' roll as devil's music, but the masterful performances outweigh all the weaknesses. If there is only one thing in this great world, Buddy Holly's music will never be hidden. Whether it's "it's going to be a day," "Peggy Sue," or any of his songs, all these years will sound great. He is one of the greatest singers in history. <br /> <br /> Just to show what Lubbock really meant to his most famous son, they didn't call him up to 37 years after his death! What is the number of ingrates!
