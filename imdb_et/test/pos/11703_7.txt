I was modest to see this flick before I read the external comments and user reviews here. Why? First of all, because Mick Malloy's humor can (in my humble opinion) be quite a crass and a top, as evidenced by his bad TV screen a few years ago. And secondly, because the good Aussie comedy films are, unfortunately, as rare as Tassie Tiger. <br /> <br /> Mick has reasonably limited his natural comedy in his surprisingly watched movie. Who would have thought that the season club would give one of the most fun Australian films for years. The cast is great when familiar local old timers all unbelievably prominent. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to see John Clarke playing a criminal in this book. This is a one-dimensional part, but JC still adds some class, as always. Good to see that Judith Lucy also gets to Guernsey or whether I saw the bowls evenly on the big screen. He is a true talent, regretted that several of his retorts were being hit. His own material is a lot of wittier. However, it is an interesting character. Bowls reporter on local cloth. How low a journalist in the food chain! <br /> <br /> Crackerjack may not be the funniest movie I saw this year, but it is definitely a pleasant deviation to look at. Many other people obviously agree with me because this year's the biggest Australian film. It's good to see that someone finally makes a distinctive, delicate comedy without trying to laugh as much of Australia's "comedies" as it is. Finally a little trivia. If you don't know which Aussie rules team supports, he checks the flag at his workplace. Also look at your old criminal partner, Tony Martin, who makes a final bowl scene. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
