I have to say that I'm an avid fan of horror, and now I'm not getting enough foreign fear. Because the US horror depends too much on gore. <br /> <br /> This movie is fantastic. This movie reminded me a lot about M. Night's SIXTH SENSE. The way the movie was directed was great. The director took the time to set everything up. It took about 40 minutes to bring the movie to the top of the movie. I thought this movie was just a drama. This movie comes up and there is not too much fee. <br /> <br /> I've never done this before, but that's the main reason why I liked the movie. I really cried out loud because one scene just amazed me about hell ... which is pathetic .... but for making a movie, it's great.
