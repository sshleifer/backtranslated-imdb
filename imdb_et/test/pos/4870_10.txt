OK, so in all Wile E. Coyote-Road Runner cartoons we know that WEC is going to build all kinds of traps for RR, but always maim. This will definitely happen in "Beep, Beep." Predictable? I think it is, but when you think about it, these cartoons show you how much you try to harm someone else, the more you harm; like Daffy Duck always tries to undermine Bugs Bunny's integrity, but Bugs sees it. <br /> <br /> Generally, this is another classic crowd of the Terite Terrace terminal. Sometimes I think that if we really wanted to relieve the tensions of the Cold War, we could just have let the Soviet Union see the cartoons of Looney Tunes; I'm sure they would have loved them. Another great. <br /> <br /> PS: I learned about "Jeopardy!" en Wile E. Coyote's average name is Ethelbert.
