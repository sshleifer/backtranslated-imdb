The main reason I loved this movie is that IMx (formerly Immature) was in it. They were in House Party 3 when they were 11th, but they've all grown up now! I was somewhat shocked by some of the things they did in the movie (almost ready to drop their hair) but I had to realize that they were no longer my little boys. I think Chris Stokes did a good job, because it was his first film.
