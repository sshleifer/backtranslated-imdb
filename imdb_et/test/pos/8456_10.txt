When CHINA SYNDROME appeared, this film was destroyed by many right-wing critics and pro-doll supporters, especially since its three leading stars were all known for their liberal politics and their apparent distrust of nuclear energy. The wear of the three-week and almost catastrophic accident took only three Mile Islands to close their critics. <br /> <br /> Fonda and Douglas are LA news that are potentially disgusting in the Ventana nuclear power plant. Douglas filmed the event through factory-soundproof glass; but the TV channel does not let the film air, map a massive case. So Fonda and Douglas have come to the truth, despite the massive interruption of the factory owners to cover the accident. <br /> <br /> But a conscientious shift supervisor (Jack Lemmon) has discovered some flaws in the factory pump support structure. He believes these errors were the cause of the accident and that, while no repairs are taking place, it would be extremely costly and lengthy, the next accident being apocalyptic. But he can't get someone to work with him to believe his story. The result is a horrible climax that pulls together various stories of political, technological and human interest into one disturbing package. <br /> <br /> Although it is clearly politically liberal, CHINESE SYNDROME, well-run and co-written by James Bridges (PAPER RESULTS), is also basically a film about the common threats of technology and nuclear power. In principle, nuclear power can never be made safe, because people can never be perfect. The film says that. and in a very entertaining and arresting sense, he says it perfectly.
