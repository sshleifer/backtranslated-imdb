I'm not sure how I can make ten lines of this question, but I'm trying. <br /> <br /> When Julie went dancing and they danced the music slowly. What was the name of the song that played and who played it? <br /> <br /> I love this song! And I watch the movie over and over to hear this one song. <br /> <br /> I made several searches online and even watched the soundtrack, but I can't find this song. /> It may be because the song they were dancing was not a complete song and just partial. Thank you. <br /> <br /> Frank
