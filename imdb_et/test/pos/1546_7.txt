The recently released British DVD has a good movie (as long as you have a focus and IQ more than a fruit ball). It's not as frustrating as it could have been, it's a kitchen bath that's the most dirty. Terrance Stamp is great, music is sweet, Carol White is very believable as one mother cake that can't stop loving criminals. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is where Carol and his friend who work in the pub with him (one with a huge bee haircut that falls over one eye) are sitting outside and rumoring all the men who are in the past. Caroli's first husband, but if you get it, you're fine. And Donovan offers some of the most burning, soft, bitter songs that come out of the 60s.
