I looked at it briefly in the PlanetOut movies. Starcrossed was a very cute, sad, little film about two brothers in love. Both male leaders are some big, fine. Often, it seems that the films on this topic are too busy with the plot's controversy and the value of the shock they forget that there is a real story. Fortunately, the writer James Burkhammer does not do it, but lets the story play fairly. The sequences of the two boys who first fall in love are very sweet.
