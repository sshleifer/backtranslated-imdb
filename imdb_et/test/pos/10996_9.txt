I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a relaxing, fun, thought-provoking movie. For the most pleasant evening, the lack of sex, vulgaris and violence. I especially liked the Buffalo scene, but it's probably because I live far away. However, this film could have been in any city; this is an issue that is so important here. I'm just grateful that Manna from heaven fell on us. Try it ... you like it!
