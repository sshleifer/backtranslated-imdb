Okay, so I don't understand why people get so deep about this movie. So I thought it was a normal movie by Amanda Bynes, but it wasn't. It was good, okay, so the acting wasn't the best, but I thought the performances were still great. You can also say that the actors did this fun in making the movie. In other films that have surprisingly won prizes where actors didn't like to work on the film, you might want to say that. All participants had chemistry and it also showed. <br /> <br /> In fact, many people are hanging on the football skills that participants have. Yeah, so they're not perfect ... get over! They are actors, not football players. I've been playing football all my life and trusting me, it's hard to learn, so stop ripping to the level of skill they have. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was stupid, but it was really funny. How Amanda Bynes and Channing Tatum can make a joke, even saying something is not funny. I found myself laughing in this movie. <br /> <br /> Generally .. I love it!
