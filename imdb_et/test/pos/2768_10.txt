This movie is very good and the whole family would enjoy watching it. When Susie Q promises her big night, she dies during a fatal car accident when kids who are drunk and high are on their way. Susie's house is sold and the family moves into the house she loves. If the boy who lives in the house now sees Susie and is the only one who can. Two teams together with their little sister and trying to save Susie's parents Amy Jo Johnson as Susie Q. This film fell into your heart comedy, sadness and laughter. I hope you see this movie because it's very good. But nobody seems to see it on DVD or VH. no more TV.
