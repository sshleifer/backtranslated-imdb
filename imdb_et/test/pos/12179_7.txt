pretty good, don't wait for a high culture ....... if the actor is bad, the story fails, but it's still pretty nice to watch the movie. why? because it's dark, a bit stupid, like unpredictable and just fun and fun to watch. don't expect anything like I said, just see it myself and you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that has no plot or memorable effect, but there are enough scenes that make you laugh, cry, or at least make yourself forced to finish it ... <br /> <br /> that's all I wanted to say .... <br /> <br /> 7/10
