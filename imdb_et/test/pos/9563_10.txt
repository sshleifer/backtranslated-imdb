I recently saw this movie for the first time. I enjoyed it so much that I went straight out and bought a DVD. This movie is a pure genius and becomes more funny every time you watch it. Anyone can write jokes or a funny dialogue and let the participants remember them, but the basis for this movie is better! How do they do that? Thank you, Christopher Guest!
