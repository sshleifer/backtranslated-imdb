Garlin did a great job. A nice concept well done and tightly produced. A very sincere story came over. As a fan of "Curb Your Enthusiasm", where Jeff was pretty much a boy-role, I was delighted with how much depth he gave this role through simple but effective portrayal. <br /> <br /> Much of this humor was underestimated and subtle and highlighted the momentum I really liked, rather than breaking or explaining. And there were some nice little surprises and turns. Convenience merchandise vignettes were a pleasure. <br /> <br /> When I say it is a wonderful "little" movie, I don't mean it in terms of budget or quality. It's simple, intimate and hand-made. It speaks of a very plausible everyday life. Relax and watch it. Let it wash you and you feel good.
