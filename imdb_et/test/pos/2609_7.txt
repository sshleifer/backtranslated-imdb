I couldn't believe that the adult swimming boys of that character. I laughed for the day when I thought about this show. After finally seeing the pilot, I think I will have some more episodes. Assy is pretty funny and the whole police figures team is around, but Assy is hard to understand and it was a bit frustrating. Most humor revolves around the fact that the title of the title is literally a walking ass with nothing but legs that the sport tights pantyhose and legs with a traditional wing tip. Drink too much and "play with your rules" as you thought. The only other funny moments are Assy shooting many, lots of people and spending time at home - in the bathroom. It's not Squidbillies funny, but it's worth it.
