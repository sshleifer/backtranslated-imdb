I saw Bon's trip 2 days ago and I found it as a great production. The movie is considered entertainment and it is! It mimics the style of the 30's American screwball comedies, but the Von Trip is more accurate. Adjani and Depardieu are just great in their roles. The plot is easy. The film starts with people who are involved in many situations that probably shouldn't do anything between them. It is very funny how these situations are binding during the film. With a sense of humor, it's good to see a French movie. I think this is a film in which love is the main theme. Peter Coyote, as a German spy in France, shows again that he is a great actor.
