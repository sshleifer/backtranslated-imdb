Very observable movie and what was waiting for the trailer several times unexpectedly. <br /> <br /> The whole thing looks great, from the super-high-end ridiculous efforts that they're taking away from mediocrity. In a sub-class of contamination that tries to keep its head silicon, the film filmed perfectly in the spirit of the 18th century. <br /> <br /> Jonny Lee Miller plays Maclean very well, although this part is not stretched out, and Robert Carlyle seems to have been wasted on Plunkett, a Miller colleague across the road. <br /> <br /> The real sign was undoubtedly Ken Stott, who plays Mr Chance (a 1740 police commander) with an evil glee that put him out of the rest of the pain. <br /> <br /> The big movie and everyone who enjoys the color and style of Peter Greenaway's films love its appearance, though the plot's air becomes evident before 2 hours. <br /> <br /> Worth viewing.
