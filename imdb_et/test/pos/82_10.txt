When the circus arrives in the city and places the lion cage directly over Bugs Bunny's home, the Bugs will reach somewhere in the range that is varied and intrepid. Despite the title "Acrobatty Bunny", it is only at the end when Bugs and lion fill acrobatics. But even bringing it up is totally funny, which Bugs don't eat; somehow he can always use the weakness of another character against him and then pull thin air into any convenient object! Bugs later entered the circus "Big Top Bunny". I liked it better because the latter got the drug down slightly, giving the antagonist an Eastern European accent (I know it was during the Cold War but still). I recommend it. <br /> <br /> Finally, we can confirm that it is never Aloha Oe with this comic.
