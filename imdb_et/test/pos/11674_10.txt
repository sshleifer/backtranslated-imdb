Spheer's debut must be one of the best documentary films of all time. And as far as I know, it is the only one that focuses on the L.A punk explosion in the early eighties. It's all there: not only big, big bands like Black Flag, Fear, X, Germs, whose names may not mean much to you today, but whose influence on today's alternative rock music cannot be overestimated, but also the media and first of all the audiences - pants - are all depicted in a way that makes you laugh, tremble and amaze the energy, anger and rage that these young people put into their music. Where is it today? Eighties could have nurtured a lot of time to highlight music, but the land was swinging. If you need evidence of this, look at the fear of Fear. Unbalanced. Great movie! How is it not available on vid, LD or DVD? P.S. Follow-up Discard Pt. II is also fun
