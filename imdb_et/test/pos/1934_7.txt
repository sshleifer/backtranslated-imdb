One of the latest films, directed by Lionel Barrymore, is "Ten Cents Dance" as Barbara Stanwycki's "Barbara" Dance Hall in her sixth role. Stanwyck sees it quite common and opens when the ballroom manager chews it. Then comes the rich man Bradley Carlton (Ricardo Cortez), who wants to wipe him off his feet. (Cortez and Stanwyck had made three films in the thirties.) Then he meets Eddie, who is very different from Carlton. Writer Jo Swerling had worked with some biggies (his wonderful life, boys and dolls and gone past the wind) so I was surprised that its characters and scripts were so common. The story begins more interesting about one and a half and is very similar to "The Bride Walks Out" since 1936, starring ALSO Stanwyck .... T.B.W.O. is a lot smarter but also amazing about killing Hays code ...
