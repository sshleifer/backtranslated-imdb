I did a little bit of courage today when I watched this movie. I tried to wean myself from a strange movie. Of course, when this movie was originally distributed, it probably played a piano point. Often the director chooses the score himself (Charlie Chaplin often produced a score for his later silent films). But most of the music you hear from VHS on silent movies is in no way the same music you had to play when you first released your movie. And then again, there were many silent movies that were played without a score. I don't know the history of Potemkin's score, so I decided to watch the media that this artwork produced in the film. Shortly after I turned off the music, without the screen (or I should prevent it) from the musical interpretation of the screen emotions, I got the movie completely. Visually, this is just one of the most stunning movies. Eisenstein was the captain of the composition. Eelinstein's most famous (editing) editing, perhaps cinematic technique, is extraordinary. The mood of this movie is anger, and it was my violent confusion. The silent film, especially the drama, takes a lot of effort, but films such as Potemkin Battleship prove that this effort is worth it. Come on! You owe yourself to watch this movie! Your education is incomplete without it.
