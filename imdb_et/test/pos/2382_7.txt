good work.It is how i describe this animated Scooby-Doo adventure.It's still the best animated Scooby movies I've seen.i liked the story.i thought it was some depth of it. the film is also well paced.It can't get a minute boring.It is also an interesting group of characters (besides Scooby and Shaggyi and gang, of course) plus, the movie was a real blast.i have fun watching it. i also liked great Scottish music.it was very memorable and infectious.naturally, we know that scooby and gamg solve the mystery, but it is still fun to get that point.the animation is also pretty good with this movie.i would love it, when they made a 3D animation of Scooby's adventure, but we just have to wait and see. For me, Scooby-Doo and Loch Ness are a monster 7/10
