The first time I saw the poster, I was calm and beautiful. The city of Istanbul has since been haunted since then. <br /> <br /> Not much dialogue, not much music, the whole movie was filmed as accurately and aesthetically as sculpture. It is the landscape itself. <br /> <br /> In fact, the movie has a lot of things, but the director deliberately left out the most dramatic parts and left them to our imagination, creating a truly flat life. ** (light spoiler) Mahmuti's nickname is in the toilet and then leaves without words, but not in their fight; it can be seen that Mahmut is in the hospital with his mother but not against his illness. The most dramatic scene of the film for me is Yusuf, who laughs at the soldier of the game bought for a smiley girl, and that is when it almost broke my heart to see a boring and lonely life. /> <br /> Due to all life cancellations, this story tells all the characters about a clean inner world, their sadness, anxiety, loneliness, regrets ... And when the story was kicked out, I finally grabbed my desperate situation where their emotions were not really a way out external things were not interfered with, which is exactly what every single man tries to keep at all costs, especially for the irresponsible artist like Mahmut. <br /> <br /> I've just finished my second look. Last night, I rushed to my deck, I had a bed next to the bed and went through the movie trance. I felt there were two real lives, one next to the screen, one inside the screen. I felt free from all the loneliness and anxiety because the inward people experienced it. I had removed all of these things. <br /> <br /> We cannot deny the universal communication problem, and loneliness puts us far behind it and it becomes a vicious circle. I bet Mahmut can't finally live. That's why he stepped out of his room to find answers to the outside environment, cold and landscape.
