Marco Polon (Costas Mandylor) was born in Bronx. Although Polon has been known for its pastry products for decades, business has fallen in tough times. Meanwhile, Grace Carpenter (Lauren Holly) is Manhattan's most talented dessert, but she doesn't seem to be the main confectionery product because of the glass ceiling. The casual meeting between Marco and Grace leads to a conversation about both possible solutions. In the near future, a high-level bake-off, The Golden Whisk will take place, and Marco wants Grace to partner with him. There is a huge amount of "dough" at stake for the winners, which is enough to set Grace up in business and save Polon's place to eat. Grace reluctantly agrees. But there are also complications. Some judges and co-competitors can have both Grace and Marco. Even though Marco and Grace are both familiar with the other, Grace has a long, very rich boy. Did Marco and Grace win the race? This is a lovely movie for a romantic heart. First, it is nice to cast. Holly has always been a beautiful actor with a remarkable husky voice that promotes her sights. In this movie, he is perfectly cast as a solid but beautiful Grace. Mandylor, a newcomer, is also happy to be a good looking competitor. The rest of the participants, including Brenda Vaccaro as the mother of Marco, are pretty nice. As a Hallmark movie, costumes, kits and production options are surprising and the script can look fresh and funny despite some familiar topics. Pamper yourself, romcom lovers, to get the sweetest confectionery, making sure you watch this movie. This is definitely a big box of chocolate quality in chocolate.
