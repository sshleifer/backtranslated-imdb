This great movie, starring Elizabeth Montgomery, has long been calling for DVD release. The same can be said about his earlier, also excellent, film "Rapeseed". I can only hope that my comments encourage some entrepreneurial souls to put BOTH Elizabeth Montgomery on one DVD to make it available to many fans. I think that this wonderful actor's role was unfortunately stereotyped with his role in Bewitched, and as a result no serious actions were taken on him. I am sure that if these two films, perhaps even a trilogy with the legend of Lizzie Borden, appear in DVD format, its fans would record a record of how high they are about their serious ability to act.
