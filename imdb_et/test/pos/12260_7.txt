BROADCAST NEWS opens with a series of short vignettes, a smart way to launch a story about television anchors who have no idea what they are reporting. <br /> <br /> Talked before the group - Journalists, all of whom are bored with his presentation, most of them leave. When the latter leaves, HOLLY HUNTER, the co-author of the event, says quietly, "I don't think there would be any questions." A subtle line of great-written low-key comedy, a farce TV show anchoring show. <br /> <br /> WILLIAM HURT is an anchor of unsuccessful news that finds itself as an anchor for HOLLY HUNTER. Hurt badly needs help with the repair report and Holly refuses to feed - at first. He knows he's only capable of seeing well, but he's not a reporter. He has proven to be a quick study as long as his earpiece is running and he receives accurate information from the executive producer Hunter. <br /> <br /> Holly's second anchor friend (ALBERT BROOKS) is helping his information to hurt him. Of course, he is in contradiction with his feelings for the recent reporter Brooks and the same strong attraction to the beautiful boy anchor Hurt, who owns his own employee with a real worker. <br /> <br /> You have to wait up to 20 minutes before the end of the movie to find out what kind of person he can get. Brooks tells him that Hurt is wrong because he represents everything he is against. This unpredictable comedy doesn't tell who Hunter (neurotic heroine) is coming. <br /> <br /> HOLLY HUNTER, WILLIAM HURT, and ALBERT BROOKS were all oscars (a supportive role for Brooks), such as the film itself and director / writer James L. Brooks. All in all, there are seven well-earned Oscar nominations. <br /> <br /> The script does not choose the usual lucky end - and in this case it is the only mistake for the brilliant scenario. I felt deceived and somewhat fell into the delightful conclusion.
