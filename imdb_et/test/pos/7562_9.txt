I haven't seen this movie for over 20 years, but I had the effect of remembering that I remember credit and several minutes after full awe. This is one of the most underrated films of the decade when it originally appeared. I just ordered a copy of the DVD and paid for the overnight stay and can't wait until it arrives. It is sometimes resurrected and also very dark and somewhat disturbing. This is a story of a nearby regular child band that grows up in the city center and makes one feel like they are actually sitting aside, not watching a movie or television. It's hard to explain, but that's something you need to experience. The story begins with childhood and monitors the lives of the four main characters through high school and when they start their journey. The whole work was amazing and it is the best job of Jodi Thelen's career. I hope the DVD lives in my memory and plans to watch it on a good friend on Friday.
