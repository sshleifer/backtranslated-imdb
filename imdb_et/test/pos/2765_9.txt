I'm short: I usually hate movies like poisonous ... but there's something that just draws me and doesn't let me go. It has been said that it has some big mistakes (some show the best and sometimes so poor it is funny), but there are enough redemption features to make it traceable. <br /> <br /> But what are they? Well, it has a cool little plot - it is by no means original, but it's better than other kind of movies. The three main stars (Whalin, Johnson, Long) made quite decent performances that more than compensate for the lack of high-quality casting (fat policeman and coach Quinn really mistaken) and scripting is slippery and clever (even if it is weak in places). <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this movie is so CUTE: I virgin all over it and it's a place in my video collection just because it can rejoice anyone. You really need to have some kind of humorless wear that wouldn't like it (I SHOULD somebody sit it out without a stack!). <br /> <br /> I recommend this if you want a simple, fun, and - above all, enjoyable look. You won't regret it! <br /> <br /> ~ Top $ ~
