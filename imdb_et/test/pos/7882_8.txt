Dennis Patrick plays a man who involuntarily kills his daughter's boyfriend and then opens his secret bar at a local bar. Joe (Peter Boyle), the bigot who gets there, starts to joke at first, but then the story is confirmed in the evening. Instead of calling police officers or the like, Joe decides that as the boy killed the hippie, they must be relatives spirits! He gives man his palm. Initially, the film seemed tough and judicious, but when it appeared itself, it actually became a rather complicated portrait of today's society. Yes, I think it exaggerates a bit, but in a fun way that does not really damage the power of his messages. Susan Sarandon made her debut in this movie and it's a shock to see how pretty she was about 23. See it deserves.
