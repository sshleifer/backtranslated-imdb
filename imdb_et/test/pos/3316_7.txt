This is a movie that is much more enjoyable than its 7-year rating. In many ways it is like the 50-year-old VALLEY OF THE DOLLS - a large number of VALLEY exaggerations and slippery polished up to the 1959 audience. Like later, both are about three young ladies who are successful - although this time it is a publishing environment instead of the entertainment industry (although one woman has the best way of everything, Broadway's aspirations). <br /> <br /> Film Starts Hope Lange came to the company for her first working day. He has been appointed to the head of the tough nails, Joan Crawford, who has appeared in his first supporting role for decades. Regardless of how Crawford seems to be, Lange has decided not to do it - to do this work. And over time, he quickly moves into ranks from the secretary to the editor. At the same time, his two new roommates are trying to get up - one through the stage and one through the rich playboy. Like all white organs, they all have their ups and downs (mostly downs), but at the end of the movie, there is hope that at least some of them will do it - beat and bruise, however. <br /> In this movie, men are mostly pigs. The only person who looks decent is Stephen Boyd, so of course Hope Lange misses him for a good ex-boyfriend. As for the boys played by the veteran actor Brian Ahern and the rest, they are sexist and you finally understand how Crawford became so bitter and disgusting. , abortion, etc., and it is certainly not an artistic triumph. However, thanks to the excellent production values ​​and the juicy script, it is a pleasure to see. Just don't wait for Shakespeare!
