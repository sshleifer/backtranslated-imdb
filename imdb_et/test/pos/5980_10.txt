Larisa Shepitko of ASCENT (1976) is an extraordinary, debilitating report on the partisans' struggle against the Nazis in German-occupied Belarus, The rise shows Russia's obsession with the horrors of the Great Patriotic War, but unusually both are under religious symbolism. and willing to admit less than the presence of a great Russian partner. The real battle is not with the Nazis, who are merely annexes in the background, but between the Russian Nazi researcher and Sotnikov, who has tried a partisan who believes that spiritual strength is unbeaten for his death. With its many references to the crucifixion, the story of heroic proportions that respect the martyr's suffering and its impact on future generations is the story. Notable work.
