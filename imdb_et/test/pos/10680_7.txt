When I saw that the movie was on late night television, I decided to leave it initially. I'm glad that I started watching. Yes, special effects are the same as Gerry Andersen's puppetry. Some of the actors / actors are from his other productions, later used by the same composer because the soundtrack of the cheese might have come from just one of his productions and the plot is as slow on the wet weekend. All this and you have a movie that shows interesting opportunities. Is the planet a sun? Is this a double land? Is it all the opposite and, if so, do they speak the opposite of English? I love this dated SF only for Gerry's great model cars, planes, buildings and spaceships. Some of them have not been pulled so far as they seemed. And did you see the logo of the European Space Center? Very much like today's euro logo. Stop the faith and spend a few hours watching it, you will be happy.
