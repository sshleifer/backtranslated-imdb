It was the second Cinemascope performance that Fox produced after Robe. Note how some novel sets have been corrected for Egyptian collections. The film is produced by all the first-class elements, beautiful photography, mixing soundtrack (Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann - see if you can tell which composer hits certain scenes). But the main action is a bit weak. It seems that Edmund Purdom has a limited number of emotions and it is interesting to look at. The best performances come from Peter Ustinov as one-eyed slave and Polish actress Bella Darv as the Babylonian temple "Nefer". I find that this film is generally strong when the big glasses produced at that time are rare. All in all, the film does an interesting and fun job with the social commentary that the Egyptian society would have seen.
