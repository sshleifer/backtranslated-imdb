Four characters on the road say, "If you are looking for fun ..... You don't need a reason ... All you need is a gun. It's a rabbit season!" <br /> <br /> In the woods, we see hundreds of "Rabbit Season" characters on every tree. We are seeing more and more signs that point to the Bugs Bunny hole. Who puts all these characters up? Daffy Duck! <br /> <br /> Daffy puts the last login, pulls away and tells us the audience, "I know I don't like it, but I know! It's really a duck season." <br /> <br /> From that moment on, we can now see Elmer Fudd, a shotgun ..... and the battle between Bantsi and Daffy is won every time. Only on cartoons, luckily, we see that someone gets five times with a shotgun head and continues!
