I thought it was a wonderfully written film. I love a little Scampi and a clever angel. This movie is very easy for small children to understand, but it is also a good film for adults. I liked this movie because it continues the Lady and Tramp original, and this movie is classic. Lady and Tramp 2 Scamp's Adventure was full of new characters, memorable songs, brilliant animations and unforgettable classic characters. I've loved this movie the first time I saw it. I also loved how they showed the different personalities of each character. It also shows the good benefits and good things of making new friends. My favorite song in the movie was always there because it showed different characters to share their views on how they feel. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who was the fan of the original Lady and Tramp.
