These comic book writers are unreliable with their fit (and fun) punches. The first blow we see here is the island's prison, whose big gates are the following: "Alka-Fizz Prison - Noos are not good." The first sign of what we see in prison is, "Welcome: sit down." They then show the electric chair. <br /> <br /> Corny still gives you the chance to be smart because our favorite wolf is seen behind bars. With a pen in his hand, he literally pulls next to him and then escapes through it! In no time has he crossed the United States, pulled out of Canada and is in the north of this country. This is where we see the Canadian royal police installed and of course our hero Droopy, known here as "Sgt. McPoodle". He has the task of catching a big crime from Alka-Fizz. So he goes out with his faithful little blue horse to look for a deliberate wolf. <br /> <br /> From this moment on, we get a normal story: Droopy is always a step in front of the wolf regardless of what the latter is doing .... and both characters are involved in some wild and very funny views. Droopy even jumps on top of a hill with an eagle egg. There's no wolf to go anywhere - or do (plastic surgery!) To escape terribly "Sgt. McPoodle". By the way, somebody, in the history of caricatures, may not have exaggerated reactions than this wolf every time he sees his non-emancipation! His screams, faces and body stretched out every day into a scary part of the sight. <br /> <br /> You think this one comic cartoon would be monotonous, but it's not. This is Tex Avery and more of the gang, but one of the 24 comic "Full Theater Collection" DVDs with marvelous and restored images.
