This is a very good black comedy with a great view of how different people are from the same situations. The three main characters met the girl Jewel, played by Liv Tyler, who is a different male fantasy for every three men. All three men are in the same situation, but when they talk to others, their perception is different. This is a very good concept, probably not entirely original, but it works very well in the movie. The plot is very good, very bizarre and extreme, which makes it a good black comedy. The actors are equally good, no actor was looking out or out of their league. Comedy is very black, in some scenes black, and many people will certainly offend it, but black comedy fans will probably enjoy it. In general, this film is not for everyone's taste, but most people who like black comedy will probably love it because it is certainly one of the best black comedies. 7/10
