Wow! the French are indeed hanging on it. When we look at our first Asterix movie, we see a good story with nice actors (especially thanks to Gerard Depardeule) but a very special effect. The fantasy story like special effects of Asterix is ​​really important. Well .. they did it right this time! It looks terrible. Personally, I think Cleopatra is the best Asterix story ever written. The film is not a moment boring. Go and see it! One thing! they did not go exactly to the script, which I think it is a little bit. For example, in the comic strip Obelix breaks the sphinx nose, and all the small storekeepers start to break their miniature sphinx. (Really funny to see). Well, they didn't put this movie, but they buried under the nose sphinx. Asterix: "They'll never find it here" (think again). It was funny, but not as good as the original. The other thing I didn't like about the film was the choice of their music. It made the film for the kids. But never less ... It's black C! <br /> <br /> Grz Da Jean Holland
