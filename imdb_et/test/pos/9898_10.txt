I saw "Check out Out" at the Philadelphia Film Festival. What a great combination of warmth and great pain. Director Jeff Hare has done an outstanding job of inviting audiences to a scattered but fun world of Morris Applebaum and his family. Family life is presented in such a way that we enjoy craze, but we still feel each other's real pain and anxiety. <br /> <br /> Normally, I am not a fan of Peter Falck, but he is Morris Applebaum and plays a role with great humor and humanity. <br /> <br /> I hope everyone can see this wonderful movie and enjoy it the way I did. <br /> <br /> Hats for the director, cast and a team for a good job!
