If this is the meaning of the messages, if not to discuss and share thoughts about the next season ... Here is my prediction: 1. The hatch was indeed blown, but somehow everyone had lived inside. But let's see it. 2. The episode at the end of the tent is an observation team that monitors the tracking device installed on Penny's Desmonds boat. Now that the magnetic shield was lifted around the island, the station took the signal and sent rescue. 3. After the hatch has been destroyed, the island is no longer isolated and other ships / planes arrive 4. Others will eventually share their secrecy with poor observers <br /> <br /> It actually confirmed that LOST is 4 seasons? <br /> <br /> Mike
