The game is now outdated, right? <br /> <br /> Jokes have been made. It's all over. The natural genius that led the first two games of this game was eventually lost. <br /> <br /> The game is still healthy, jokes are here, people. Of course, they're all over again, but so was Monkey Island 2. And 1, that's why. <br /> <br /> Difficulty is well placed, somewhat lightly 1 and ridiculously challenging 2. Ship In the lower gaming tradition, fighting a sub-game is badly inappropriate. And this game is the best joke in the series. If you are asked to choose your membership on an exclusive beach, always choose "You don't need to see my identification". This is a worthy game for yourself.
