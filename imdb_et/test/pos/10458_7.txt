The film begins almost slowly, "romance" (awake), which seems to be on track (all part of the plan ...). Then there is about one hour in this festive movie The Feast. It is worth paying attention to this first hour. The party is still festive, but humorous. Suddenly, the canceled and tiny characters come to life, and all (you and the characters) leave the enriched hours of experience. <br /> <br /> Women love it. For all Christians, deep faith is shown by the symbols. Not my favorite movie all the time - there are no dinosaurs OR laser beams, but definitely a movie that I'm happy to see. Don't forget. <br /> <br /> Jim
