Why did Ramón (Carlos Fuentes) lead his five college companions to a horrible abandoned schoolhouse that served a wealth of black sheep children? This answer can simply be in the diary he has in his dead father's possession. What they encounter is actually a revived episode involving another six groups, five of which are expected to meet with graphical feats of a sadistic security guard (Paul Naschy), which took place 20 years ago. But when they look for the chance to escape from this place, the fearful awaits them as the group runs their lives, often in a panic, because the killer starts to hunt and destroy them in a different bloody way. Did Ramón and any of his palms live in the evening as a horror or become the same night as ghosts for the ghosts that were before them? Some funny exchanges between the characters in their dialogue are pop culture references to American horror movies that may disturb some viewers. Demented Naschy is really wild with his childhood as he attacks them cunningly ... is a bloodthirsty maniac who performs his violent behavior with joy. I found the white musical hints a bit annoying and the filmmakers often use feedback from the earlier events to remind the audience of reminders. I don't think these tricks are necessarily necessary, but I felt the director wanted to communicate with the viewer thoroughly with clues and setbacks. The slight deviation from the plot of the film moves and the camera follows the characters and how they respond to the chaotic situation they are presented with. Enjoying your movie can ultimately fall if you agree with the paranormal supernatural aspects of the park model. The moments of time changed and the killer, who continues his work from the seemingly grave. The appeal seems a bit jarring and steep, but it may (.. or may not) work, bearing in mind how the story plays, why Ramoni's father has been shown among the ghosts that reintroduce these harsh events two decades earlier. I say that this film does not appear in detail, but as a slip, it is the breath of fresh air.
