The throwing of the velvet has only appeared in the United Kingdom three weeks ago, and I am already looking at countless letters flooding into national papers and television, claiming to have a thin plot, weak results and even a weaker script. You'll find me lured. It's heresy. <br /> <br /> I would really like to dispel all the doubts first of all to congratulate Andrew Davies to allow Geoffrey Sax to create this magnificent Sarah Waters novel drama, softening him with such a fantastic script. Kudos. But I'm afraid I'll have to change now. <br /> <br /> I saw one of the premiere TV guides here in the United Kingdom (unnamed), relentlessly describing the Velvet tilt as a "lesbian love story". If they are, and I assume they are trying to interest the film, this is a totally wrong way to go about it (besides being a disappointingly inaccurate description). In saying this, they are either a) turning away those who instinctively reject that "this" topic or b) attracting people who only look to see some "serious girl activity". Buy a video! By showing this serious caution, it and other magazines are cheaper, which is a great adaptation of one of the greatest works of recent literature. Tilting a velvet is a story of love, passion, movement, loss, and heartbreak. It's not a lesbian love story. No siren. <br /> <br /> The end result is a stylish thing with great performances everywhere (especially Stirling, Hawes, Chancellor and May). Direction, it is intoxicating and surrounding - sometimes fast, sometimes not - but it no longer ceases to be less than effective. All in all, it is polished and well-supplied, sex is done with tenderness and delicacy - and while many do not classify it as a true "movie", it remains my favorite for some time.
