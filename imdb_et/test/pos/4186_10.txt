Very weird, psychedelic, esoteric (and I said weird?) Experience. <br /> <br /> But at least on one level - it did exactly what it was supposed to do. It created a gap between fools, produced by Hollywood, look at teen pop idols, which was a Monkees TV show and an adult, musically growing and developing, but still somewhat stupid of the 70's and distant monkeys. The most important feature of the film is Mike Nesmith, "If they think we're plastic now, wait until they see how we do it." The fact that the monkeys were tired of all the negative comments about their image and their work is record-breaking. They said it over and over again in the interviews. They had to do it again and what better way to deform and fun to fool the machine that created them. At the same time, they commented on our entire society (news, movies, art, everything) and said, "Hey, why choose from us - not everything is made at one time or another." These are the oracle's "proles" (Monkees represented the persecuted "forever" even in their heaviest TV series), pulling down "Big Brother's" pants and kicking him a very worthy butt. <br /> <br /> ideas, loved music, loved effects, loved movie! But then, as Peter Tork in the movie says, "But why should I speak because I don't know anything?" :)
