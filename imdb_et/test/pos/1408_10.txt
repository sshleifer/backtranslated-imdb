William Haines glows this story in the middle of a cadet who thinks West Point is really something he has now arrived at. Haines' astonishingly cheerful comic performance was his trademark - it made him in 1928-1932. The top box office star and one of MGM's biggest stars. Joan Crawford and William Bakewell are also good. And while this story may seem like a fidelity, it was a big hit by placing Haines and Crawford College football (national craze in the 20s). After Haines often breaks his mouth too often, and his cadets almost shine, he turns to excellent performance when he swallows his pride and gets into the navy. Even with a broken hand, he wins the military game and takes his place back at West Point. This movie is easy to see and show people (always underrated by Marion Davies) why Billy Haines was a great star of the time. He needs and deserves to be remembered!
