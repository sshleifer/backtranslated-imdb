When Alfred Hitchcock's Patricia Highsmith's "Strangers on the Train" was adapted, Guy Haines (Farley Granger) and Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) meet for the first time on a train journey and discuss two ideas for murder. Rather, striking Anthony suggests he could murder Haines 'incredible wife and Haines' murdered Anthony's dominant father. The absence of any link between the murderer and the victim should in any case ensure that both crimes remain unresolved. The tenor of the conversation gives Haines a simpler impression that the proposal is not entirely serious. The complications arise later when Anthony murders Haines' wife in the amusement park and then continues to Haines to keep her bargain. <br /> <br /> The differences between the two men are clear from the beginning. Haines is a professional tennis player, respectable and fairly modest in his achievements, while Anthony's life is not going anywhere, and he admits he has been thrown out of three drinking and gambling colleges. Haines is in a relationship with the senator's daughter she wants to marry. Anthony characterizes this as a cynical maneuver in the Haines section to give himself a career shortcut. Character differences are also visually reinforced. Anthony often lives in shaded areas and rides in a boat called "Pluto", while Haines is often seen from a more heroic perspective provided by the low angle of the camera. <br /> <br /> There are some outstanding visual sequences, such as: - <br /> <br /> (1) Haines' wife's murder, which is shown through the reflection of her glasses that fall to the ground when she struggles to get rid of Anthony. <br /> <br /> (2) Imagining Anthony alone, dressed in black and watching very small light against a huge white Jefferson Memorial. <br /> <br /> (3) If all the spectators on the tennis courts move their heads uniformly, follow the action, while one head (Anthony) will still cool down to see Haines. <br /> <br /> (4) A scene where the roundabout goes wildly out of control and finally strikes remarkably. <br /> <br /> Repeated use of "punches" throughout the story, for example, Haines and Anthony are originally released from 2-p foot taxis and go on the train. Since the train pulls out of the station, there are two tracks, each of which gives you the choice of two options. Two men discuss the murder of two potential victims and order 2 double whiskeys. Hitchcock's cameraman sees that he is fighting on a train with two bass. Haines feels twice over if his wife renounces an agreement he had to look at for a divorce lawyer. Haines' wife goes to an amusement park with two boyfriends. When Anthony faces her before her murder, she lights up her cigarette lighter and produces 2 glasses. Later Anthony becomes very embarrassed when she meets the senator's younger daughter, who she sees twice for Haines's wife. Anthony also knows a double crossing when Haines refuses to go on with another murder. When Haines travels alone on a train that goes to Metcalf, he sees two men in the same ship accidentally striking their feet in the same way as he and Anthony were. <br /> <br /> The action of the whole movie is especially fast, and performances by Robert Walker and Patricia Hitchcock (Senator's younger daughter) are especially powerful.
