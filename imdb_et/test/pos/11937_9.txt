I think Toy Soldiers is a great movie. This is one of the only films that have an unknown majority in addition to some famous actors that actually work. In my opinion, the plot is enchanting. This keeps your attention without being a terrible story that can't happen in real life. I think everyone would enjoy this movie. Sean Astin always seems to choose the perfect movies that are presenting her talents. He is very undervalued and does not appreciate what he deserves. The other films she has had with other actors have been in the spotlight, but this movie and Rudy really show her because she's the main character of both. I hope he will get the ranks he deserves for his decorations one day. If you want to see a great movie, you have to check it out and if you're a fan of Sean Astin, you definitely like this movie.
