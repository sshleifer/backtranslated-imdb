The comments of the previous user are indeed tough. One wonders if they have seen this beautiful sweet movie. What's so nasty about this writer / director, it's just rude! For people who grew up in the eighties, this is a funny nostalgia and a sweet story that has worked and produced well. Irish cinema has a lot of bitter anger associated with it, and the commentary on this spleen flow is evidence of it. give out and wake up people who actually go there and do things or do something for themselves. I know which one is easier ... Make a profit and watch this movie and see how the short film is made ... you are not disappointed
