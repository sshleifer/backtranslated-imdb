This picture has no big explosions or expensive tracking sequences. But it really has a wonderful show and an extraordinary script that puts it at the top of my "indie-must-see-list". Taylor Nichols and James Remar are terrible together. The young cast surprised me with truly consistent action. Usually, indie pictures have some weak links, but there are no weak links here. Impressive. Go here.
