This movie was really funny. People who waited for the Oscar-worthy comedy should overcome themselves. It was a fun movie to see interesting and funny characters, plot lines, dialogue quotes and catch phrases. I appreciate the movie a 10 when I bought a DVD, or in that case a video tape, and I've watched it several times and then still laugh out loud. There are about 12 movies in my collection with a rating of 10 and about half have nothing to do with the Oscar. Again, it was just a fun and easy movie. I hope it will appear on DVD. I highly recommend checking this movie if you are a desperate comedy.
