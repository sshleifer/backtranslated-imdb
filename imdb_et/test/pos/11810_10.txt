For all viewers who have seen Cure, I would agree with the comment that this is a great movie and very cordial. Joseph Mazzello and Brad Renfro prove their film quality with Dexter's (Mazzello) mother Annabella Sciora. <br /> <br /> When I first watched Cure on TV, I didn't know what to expect, but when I looked at this masterpiece, it soon became clear what it was. Dexter An 11-year-old boy who suffers from AIDS is sitting in his backyard playing his toys when he meets one of his neighbors Eric one day, initially uncomfortable with two boys, but they quickly became good friends. <br /> <br /> During the movie, I was still thinking about what happens to the two guys as they thought of me. I was wondering how the hell they would get to New Orleans, sitting under the door of a sea cookie, pulling an inflatable crocodile behind it. There were other great scenes in the movie. <br /> <br /> But the part that came to me was that part of Dexter's health deteriorating. You just couldn't wonder if he was going to do that, but finally you know. I thought the first prank they played Dexter was really dead, he probably wasn't, silly. But when they play the third, there is something very wrong. Dexter won't laugh or see any laughter. At this point, the victim of these janots will soon announce that the poor Dexter was dead. In this part I lost it. I put my eyes out and I cried out of this scene. You just have to. After all, you begin to understand Eric's loss, and then the movie ends with a nice note, where the Dexters shoe will swim so slowly along the river. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie was great. It has laughter, adventure, emotion and sadness, etc. When you put it in the blender, you get great, you have to watch the movie. Peter Horton has done an excellent job of managing this movie and I believe it is definitely his best. But now I try to search for this movie on DVD if it exists. Once again a great movie that will take you to an emotional rollercoster.
