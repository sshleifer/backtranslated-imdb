While I agree that this film lacks real content and should not be taken seriously, it is aimed primarily at fans of this series who are looking for a quick solution. Bronson (Paul Kersey) goes back to the streets (giving permission to kill the chief police) and moves to his friends' apartment (which you thought you) killed by a street gang who has taken over this neighborhood (which looks like Beruit). It's funny that people in Bronson have a habit of killing. The Bronson systematically kills them one by one because neighboring people are being used against him. There is some dynamics between Bronson and Fraker, who leads the gang of the street, you can say that both enjoy their work. At one point after they captured the city in jail, Fraker says, "I'll kill you a little old lady, I'll try it in 6:00 news." "Giggler", a wallet thief who laughs when he commits crimes, is also pleasant to watch. The film was made in 1985 and most people are likely to be identified with stereotypical city groups in the film. It is enjoyable looking at the Bronson (Paul Kersey) on the streets of these thugs. See how Wildey Magnum, the serious hardware that Bronson uses, appears. I also liked the soundtrack of this movie.
