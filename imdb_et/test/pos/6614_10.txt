I remember when skateboarding was reborn in the 1970s. I asked my parents for a second skate used by a friend for money. It was a piece of junk, with a clay wheel and everything. I also remember reading about Skateboarder Magazine and being so impressed and full of frightened Dogtown team. Ice skating never became a lifestyle for me, but in some ways it has always been part of my life, whether it uses on-board transportation or just friends who are skating. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great documentary about the actual birth of today's skating. Watching this team skating on a flat boring pastime was a vertical lifestyle. <br /> <br /> It's amazing that since then there are still plenty of movies to create this movie and thank God for that. The film is brilliant. It gave me a feeling of watching the old Buster Keaton movie: I've seen some tricks that Keaton has repeatedly read about other movies, but when you go back and see the first person doing this trick, it's amazing that they were not just the first person who tried it successfully, but lived through it and made it unknown. It's a feeling that this movie gave me. Yes, I've seen people skate pools before, but to watch FIRST people skating in the pools and invent the tricks that finally got the basics of today's skating is like watching the facade of the house fall on Keaton, leaving it standing safely in the frame window. It is absolutely brilliant to look at something that hadn't been tried before, but since then it has been tried by almost everyone. <br /> <br /> This movie is beautiful to watch and incredible to listen to. The soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard in the movie. This is a movie that attracts people whether they like skating or not. I have been talking to a couple of friends who were following their movie after a tough protest, and they all said their girlfriends were at the end of the movie and loved it as much as they did. <br /> <br /> As for previous comments on the board that complain about the film being too self-confident, I think it's an unfair neglect. I liked to see these men flee for their past. They created something that influenced their sport and changed it forever. They have the right to go behind. They were the stars to do what they loved to do. Most of these men / girls have never achieved the amazing success that Tony Hawk enjoys today, but roller skates could not use that success. Of course, they had some success, but more importantly, they have been able to live a life that does what they love to do, and, as we can see, almost all of them surf, skate or work on surfing / skating in the industry. How many of us can say that we have been able to live and live successfully, breaking all the rules and doing what we love? They will. My hat is for Dogtown and Z-Boys to be themselves and the world of rollerblading forever.
