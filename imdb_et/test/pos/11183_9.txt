Monkey Island's curse has always been my favorite. A lively visual look, a great soundtrack and brilliant voice lighting create a memorable and humorous adventure. <br /> <br /> Graphics is definitely not a game. While some corners are cut, the overall feel of the game is reminiscent of Disney Feature Length animations. Gameplay is simple and even a beginner can hang it fast enough. The game also offers slightly more experienced players in their Mega Monkey mode. <br /> <br /> Voice dialing is one of my favorites. Dominic Armato's affectionate voice makes Guybrush complete and Alexandra Boyd is just as charming as Elaine. Earl Boen is doing a great sin, but overflowing for a long time, LeChuck. The charm of the game has also been added to memorable characters like Wally (Neil Ross), Murray (Denny Delk) and one of my personal favorites at Haggis McMutton (Allan Young, Scrooge McDuck's voice). My hat goes too late, with great Kay Kuter and his memorable secondary role, such as Griswold Goodsoup. <br /> <br /> Michael Land's tropical and wonderful soundtrack repeats Monkey Island's adventure, which consists of some of the best stories in the company. The game is not perfect and some local areas are not as detailed as others, but I had no grip on the simple ending of the game, which I found very satisfying.
