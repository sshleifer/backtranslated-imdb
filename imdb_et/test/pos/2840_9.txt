This movie can bring you. The film was a worthwhile dark trip to WELL. Betty (Renee Zellweger) is a single "acceptable" soap group there. His character is so charming and convincing that you will find yourself forgiving if he is such a fool. I can even allow myself to get lost in Bettys' divine fantasy if it wasn't true that Dr Rake's real name is George ... and talks about the devil; "looker" Greg Kinnear performs his role very well. When Charlie (Morgan Freeman) wants to make his wish come true, Wesley (Chris Rock) makes you want to lead him. And Rosa (Tia Texada) will take you back to the friendships of these bright class students. The Sheriff encourages you to wear food and lose your name. The rest of the majority fits well. There's never been a double movie, except for the sister Betty. One of them long, cold, needs something to smile on winter days.
