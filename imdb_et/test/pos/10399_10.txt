Above the clouds is a strangely beautiful, elegant work of art. The overall softness of the light that this film has turned on changes the touch of the screen. Deep mood was won by only the director who has seen many summer experiences. Or, in other words, the old man. I don't know any other movie that captures and uses the softness of light and seasonal moods with such an amazing quality as Beyond the Clouds. Almost everyone in this movie is beautiful when your idea of ​​a beautiful woman is not a pneumatic blonde bimbo. Dialogue is not really too much, not because there are many, and like storylines, forget about it. Some movies exist as visual experiences, one of them. Don't worry if you want "easy entertainment", it's not for you. <br /> <br /> I could attract the visual perfection of this movie over the days, but I don't want to. If you're interested in cinematography, photography, film guides, etc., check out this movie.
