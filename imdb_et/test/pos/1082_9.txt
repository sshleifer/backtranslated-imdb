It seems to have been given, but if the viewer forgets the context, he may lose the opportunity to enjoy pleasure. <br /> <br /> It is a simple carp of high heights, styles and prices of the 21st century. Great Year of Depression; but the intelligent viewer remembers that the magic word, "context", and better understanding and thus "the occurrence of accidents". Among the actors, Ronald Reagan showed himself to be good-looking and friendly again and gave a better result. <br /> <br /> The history of Gloria Blondell played by a nasty woman, but it was wrong: she plays a concessionary officer with the character of Reagan, Eric Gregg, but keeps her hands as long as she is married. <br /> <br /> Gloria was cute. Not as lush as her sister Joan, she was still an attractive and good actor. Perhaps he was looking for a somewhat similar Joan that he succeeded in a more successful career, and that is definitely our loss. <br /> <br /> Sheila Bromley was Mrs Gregg and played it well. <br /> <br /> The other players included Dick Purcell, and the big Earl Dwire was able to play something beyond the frightening cowboy. <br /> <br /> Again, most players did not achieve the "household name" status many of them got away with, but they gave gosh good results here, a story that's still relevant.
