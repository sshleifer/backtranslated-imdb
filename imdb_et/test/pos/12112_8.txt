"Buffalo Bill, Far-West Hero" director Mario Costa's unsuccessful spaghetti from Western "Beast" with Klaus Kinski could only have been produced in Europe. Hollywood never dared to make the film a protagonist about the sexual predator in the West. Don't forget that Kinski is perfect for the "mad" role of Johnny. He plays the individual completely without compassion, ironically dressed with his head toe, white suit, pants and hat. There is nothing like this on this low budget oater. The typical breathtaking Spanish landscapes around Almeria are not proven. Instead, Costa and his photographer Luciano Trasatti, who shot another Kinski west, "And God told Cain", this horse's opera was reflected in the everyday life of Tor Caldara, Lazio, Italy and Monte Gelato, the River Treja, Lazio, Italy. Nonetheless, The Beast qualifies as a western part of the continent because it deals with completely careless characters and activities can be categorized as a movie poet, because the hero and heroine are trapped in intolerable circumstances that force them to exploit criminal activity. Predictably, their well-planned plans come largely because of Kinski's character. Indeed, the resembling Kinski sign is similar to Wily E. Coyote's type. Consistently, he struggles to have sex with several beautiful women, but whether lawyers or laws violate each of his aspirations. Ultimately, "Beast" means a tragic character study that is passionate about irony. Stelvio Cipriani's orchestral performance sounds like Tony Anthony's West The Stranger Returns. The Mario Costa scenario takes place in San Diego and the west of Mexico, which is terrorized by the notorious Mexican bandit Machete (Giovanni Pallavicino "We Still Kill Old Road") and his gang. They rob stagecoach and no one is safe from destroying them. For the first time, when we see the "crazy" Johnny Laster, he stops to refresh himself in the stream and shakes a cheerful woman who is washing clothes. She slips behind her and attacks her, but a bigger rifle-armed man is interfering and she has to flee. He appears in a nearby city and snuffing gunslinger recruits him to help a rich man, Mr. Powers, on the track and rob him. They stop killing him and not getting money. Mr. Snuff-sniffer accidentally leaves his snuff and sheriff arrests on suspicion of murder. "Hull" lets your accomplice from your hotel room so he doesn't have to worry about participating in a crime. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, the young couple is in love with their way into the world. . Riccardo (Steven Tedd, "Requiem for Bounty Killer") lives in his ranch Mexican pair and helps them raise their real son Juan. In the village, Riccardo's lovely girlfriend Juanita (Gabriella Giorgelli's "Stranger in Sacramento") sings and dances in a cantina. Riccardo and Juanita are going to get married, but the last place where Juanita wants to go is dusty ranch. She dreams to live in the city, but life in the city requires more money than Riccardo or she has. They compete with the blonde's legal name Glen (Paolo Casella, "Shoot the Living and Pray for the Dead") and they're going to rob Mr Power's daughter Nancy when she gets her legacy. Glen makes a fatal mistake to help Crazy Johnny, because Glen knows that Johnny needs women to get women. <br /> <br /> They kidnap the daughter of the authorities and keep her in a distant cabin with Johnny's permanent guard over her. Meanwhile, Juanita is a ridiculous daughter of Powers and appears in the city to get money from Powers' lawyer Gary Pinkerton (Giuliano Raffaelli, "Blood and Black Lace"), but she is growing suspiciously because Juanita sees nothing like she remembered Nancy. . Riccardo celebrates his sixty and warns Pinkerton that they have kidnapped Nancy. Unfortunately, for Riccardo and Juanita, Pinkerton can put his hands on only $ 50,000, because Machete has struck such fears in the heart of everyone that the full legacy of power cannot be carried through the territory. Meanwhile, horny Johnny is trying to rape Nancy, but she expresses her, knows her out of the chair that she is alone when she's dressing. When he knocks him unconscious, he steals a buggy and drives this city back. Johnny recovers, continues with him and murders him while Glen, Riccardo, Juanita, and Pinkerton meet with him. They inform Johnny about the complications that have arisen during the Machete terrorist attack, and give him $ 12,000 in money to cut it. Pinkerton is Nancy's bleeding in the body and threatens Johnny. Of course, the weapons Johnny cold blood on the spot. <br /> <br /> Things are starting to get worse when the San Diego law attempts to defeat Machete. Glen, Riccardo, and Juanita return to Mexico, while Johnny attacks two women on the ranch and flees narrowly. He drives to Mexico, finds a blanket in the blanket and goes down when the ball hits the revolver's face. Johnny admits he knows where they get more money when they release him. The men of Machete follow Johnny and grab Juanita. The villagers join Riccardo to attack Macheta and Johnny rescues Juanita, but he dies later after a big shot. Riccardo is now alone. Machete and his men responded to their parents, not only to kill, but also to a little Juan. Everything Riccardo and Juanita dreamed about the smoke of dreams in the clouds to an unhappy end. "Crazy" Johnny dies and can never exhaust his lust. If you think of Costa's uncompromising sagebrusher, "The Beast" will appear in a film of the West to study and practice an interesting character, where everything is punished.
