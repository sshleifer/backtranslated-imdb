I'm a fan of the action film, but so far I've never seen a preview or advertisement of this movie in Italy, so I went to watch The Long Kiss Goodnight pay-TV, hoping for something special. <br /> <br /> But what a surprise! This movie is great! The only problem I have found is the presence of some holes in the plot, but the rest is the most fun, intriguing and funny action movie ever made. it seems a good idea for amnesia to recover from the blood vessel. Places and stunts are the best I've ever seen. Samuel L. Jackson adds some of the best features I've ever heard, and his chemistry with Geena Davis is good. <br /> <br /> And how does Geena? He's wonderful, he's playing the best action of a hero who has ever seen and does strong, convincing and fantastic tricks. the role of the female leader is difficult for the public. <br /> <br /> 9/10
