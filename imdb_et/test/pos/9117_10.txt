I had the chance to see this movie preview through the UCLA foreword program and let me tell you this movie is inappropriately good !!!! I've seen many movies, but few have laughed at me as well as talked about it afterwards. I had good respect for Tenacious D before I saw the film and now I'm MAD about them. I will definitely buy my album when it is published on the 14th day, and I can see this movie again. <br /> <br /> If you were on the fence, watching this movie, SEE OR NOW! The price of movie tickets is worth these days because you will definitely laugh at the whole wrap. <br /> <br /> Apart from comedy, brilliant and divine music flowing from KG guitarist, JB's voice is inspiring. The audience is left to stupor that such beautiful harmonies and amazing reefs can be created with such ridiculous (and fun) words. If anything other than the music itself is worth it, it is worth the entrance price. <br /> <br /> An amazingly unified story that links almost all aspects of traditional "D" history and features, great new songs, fun comedy, and some pretty fantastic comets, this movie will get up there! Go look at it !!
