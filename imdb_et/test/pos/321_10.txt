Recently, it was a pleasure to see this emotionally charged film directed by Mani Ratnami at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival. I've given my highest award to the film festival with this feature. Make sure you don't let this cinematic heritage pass ... but be careful: this movie will make you tear if you belong to a homosexual species! 10!
