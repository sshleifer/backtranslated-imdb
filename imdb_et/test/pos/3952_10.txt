Pictures of dark places are great. The action will guide you completely, even though the film is a bit long. Ultimately, all you think is the positive points of the movie. Leading participants have the most incredible screen. The story is hearty. The result of the film is well underestimated. Fully moving in your powerful way. Not your usual melodramatic dance. Trance-like moments add poetic resonance to tempting narratives and terrible visual compositions. I hope you have the opportunity to see this movie. It deepens into some dark area, but you come out of the tunnel when you see only white light.
