A great dictator is a great movie. Charlie Chaplin manages to be so funny and witty, but at the same time he makes a strong statement against fascism in his satire. Chaplin's anti-Nazi speech with its values ​​is one of the greatest moments of the film. Throughout this film, I felt that there was some higher intelligence at work that was not truly intelligent.
