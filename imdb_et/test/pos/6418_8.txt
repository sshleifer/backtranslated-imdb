OK ... At the end of it, there may be something to complain about when it came before ... And Klaus Kinski should have stopped his 10-second look ... But it doesn't come as a real thriller for the Euro thriller. .. I can not believe I have not seen it so far ... Good to know that there are movies that are still worth it ... And that's really ... Stunning ... Haunting ... And builds amazing The atmosphere ... The Florinda Balkan is perfect as our heroine ... And the scene on the beach of Nicoletta Elm is one of the most relaxing and perfect things you can see ... Lila Kedrova is a city visitor who may or may not be the one she feels. .. If you forget the Euro cinema hay days, then follow it ... There is a decent widescreen printing ... And please get it out of the restored DVD for someone ... They did it with directors "Fifth driver" ... And that's a lot better film
