It is one of the biggest short stories ever written, which this father-son team brought to the screen perfectly and poetically, unfortunately, working for the first and last time. This is suitable for John Huston to finish his high note of his career by bringing his favorite author's work to the screen, which is simply the best customization of Joyce's screen. Huston made a career in adapting major literary works to film, usually quite successfully. It is sad and somewhat puzzling that Tony Huston began and ended his career in the film, adjusting his father's final project and raising the Oscar nomination he deserved in the process. <br /> <br /> I once had the privilege of sitting in a big screenwriter / playwright, Horton Foote, who referred to this movie in recent years as one of his favorites (at a time when it was still quite recent). As a pretty fruitful screenwriter himself (and the bright screen adapter of his own works, as well as the big authors such as Faulkner, Steinbeck and Harper Lee), it was obviously the first effort of Tony Huston and perhaps equally puzzled by his lack of production. If anyone has the knowledge to share a topic I would like to hear more about.
