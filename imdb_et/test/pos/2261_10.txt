If you've ever been to Ukraine, this movie is a lot of fun. Of the teenagers wearing the gold chains, listening to the hip hop and breaking the dance with the adjacent jokes about cars and waiters who have come together at a vegetarian meeting, this movie really pulls Ukrainian bits and pieces that you never know if you didn't go there. I spent most of the movie beating my head and thinking, "Yes, that's exactly right." It's a lot of fun if you understand Russian as subtitles don't always make it fair. The actors are so plausible and Elijah Wood is doing a great job playing a socially unfair Jewish child. My favorite character is definitely Sammy Davis Jr. Jr., the grandfather's "seeing eye dog" who is really a psychopathic limb. The characters are so eclectic and they like to believe they are real people.
