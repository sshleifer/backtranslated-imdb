I went to this movie who has no idea what to expect. In fact, I took this date for the first time in theaters. We both enjoyed it thoroughly and helped us see it after seeing it. <br /> <br /> I only recommend watching this movie when you evaluate non-mainstream movies. It is not as divorced as liquid skies or as fantastic as a forbidden zone. The original plot is very easy to follow. Here's a lot of subtle humor. <br /> <br /> Here's a quick summary of the plot if you are completely lost. Suddenly a new person appears and he has no data (he seems crazy). He may or may not be the second coming of Christ. Too cautious government goes mad to find her and discover her true motives. The ruler is also obsessed with immortality. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are frantic, while others are completely low-key. We follow the leading character when it meets all the different people in society. br /> <br /> Split was also shot around Santa Cruz and San Francisco.
