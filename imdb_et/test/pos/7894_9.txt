I was amazed at how emotionally I invested in this movie. Peter Boyle is a training force that is a socially conservative bigot, Joe. In fact, I made some of his complaints. Of course, he does not mention the historical socio-economic reasons for many of his prejudices. The film also offers an interesting overview of the rapid change that American society was experiencing at that time. Entertaining drugs, casual sex, and the challenge of parental authority changed over time and replaced the fact that more time was respected in the traditions of respect for God, the state, and seniority. The fans of Susan Sarandon are happy. Joe is his film debut. He also offers visual treatment to the audience at the beginning of the film. Recommended, 8/10.
