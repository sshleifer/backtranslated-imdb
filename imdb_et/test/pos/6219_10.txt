This enchanting film is based on Arto Paasilinna's novel. Best Selling is one of the best books I've read. Here's a story: <br /> <br /> One day, journalist and photographer Kaarlo Vatanen decides to leave his past and start a new life that travels through Finnish forests and rural areas. He has a companion with him, a young ride that hit the car. The Vatanen has to take care of the rabbit because it is wounded so they start traveling together for each other. <br /> <br /> With their adventures, hunters are almost beaten by the police, meet with many people, and eventually reach Lapland, where they live peacefully until a group of foreign visitors disturb their privacy. The rabbit gets sick and they have to return to the vet to visit the vet. <br /> <br /> Vatanen has found an ideal way of life, but today's society is trying to tie him back to his duties and taxes. In Helsinki, Vatanen was drinking, imprisoned and imprisoned, but eventually he and the rabbit fled.
