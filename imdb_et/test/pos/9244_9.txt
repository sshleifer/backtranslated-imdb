I found this to be an entertaining review of the challenges that an independent filmmaker might encounter (something I never thought). The movie was managed to keep my interest all the time and I laughed out loud more than once! I'm not a filmmaker, so I don't know anything about technology, but although I edited it and flowed smoothly. As a warning, I contributed to this effort after I gave music to a music file, but I didn't participate in the creation of this movie and I couldn't tell you anything about Repo Man except that I remember seeing it back when (I am not really a sci-fiend). I liked the comparison of the punk rock movie with punk-rock music. My wife went with me to see the movie and she knew nothing about it before and we had a great time.
