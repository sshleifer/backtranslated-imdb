In today's Sherlock Holmes story series with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, SHERLOCK HOLMES AND SECRET WEOPON is not one of the best movies - though it's fun. I think the problem is that much of the movie "dueling" between Holmes and his nemesis Moriarty (played by Lionel Atwill here) seems to postpone the actual point of the professor's work. <br /> <br /> Moriarty will release three Holmes movies with Rathbone. SHERLOCK HOLMES'S RECOMMENDATION was played by George Zucco, who made a real love for love for his role. For my money, Zucco was the best of a professor's score (his short production is even a short comedy when he is hiding from the "police sergeant" - as he prepares to sing "Police Party" from Gilbert & Sullivan ". Finally, Henry Daniell's intellectual Moriarty SHERLOCK at HOLMES and LADY IN GREEN, this is a typical gentleman, stylish presentation by Mr Daniell, but his opposition to Holmes seems to him to be annoying. They keep him from completing the basic plan. She really knows that Holmes is a nemesis who is in danger for as long as she is alive, but because of her matching of intellectual tennis between Rathbone and her, Rathbone (in her autobiography) actually knew Daniell's best movie from Mercy. > When Zucco struck love with the professor and Daniell appeared to be tired of Oxford Don (the professor is a respectable mathematician whose volume b Inomial Theorem was "European in fashion" and who wrote the intriguing book "DYNAMICS OF ASTEROID", says Atwill Professor is a pragmatic businessman. First, he sold his services (apparently) from Nazi to Germany. It has never gone, but one assumes (because it is before the Nazis began to collapse) he thinks they will win the war. Second, he's not stupid. When dr. Tobel (William Post Jr.) has shown that he is almost in a state of physical collapse because of the torture of Moriarty, the professor decides to rob another scientist who is assisting Tobel because he is as good a scholar as Tobel and able to assemble a bomb. I do not see in any way that Zucco makes such a reasonable decision on the spot, and if Daniell had to do it, he would be angry that his plans were another delay. <br /> <br /> By the way, one of the tricks used by all professors in the Holmes series is how to get rid of his movie. When you read Holmes stories, Moriarty appears three times as an attacker: the latest story ("THE PROBLEM OF THE FINAL PROBLEM"), SHERLOCK HOLMES FUTURE "The first story" EMPTY HOUSE ") and the last of four novels / short stories (HÃ„NGI VALLEY). She got so few appearances (she's also mentioned in two or three other wildlife - over), but thanks to her fate at Reichenbach Castle, the "FINAL PROBLEM" and "BLACK HOUSE", we always see her die. Zucco falls from the White Tower on the Tower Hill. imagination) Gregson and the police try to escape, but strikes when he jumps, and the wounded does not hold onto the wall of the adjacent building. It seems (here it is not visible but heard) that it falls into the trap of the door he has planted in the escape tunnel. after that it is really annoying to see the professor always belong to these films. One turns to Gene Wilder's comedy (really comedy) SHERLOCK HOLMES 'SMARTER BROTHER where Leo Mc Kern is a weird and unpleasant Moriarty (eventually ending with an Irish accent) who is not killed at the end, but just left bubbling - a patrol - how his careful schemes didn't work. I liked it better. <br /> <br /> The use of the "Dancing Men" code here, like the use of "Devil's Foot Root" in DRESSED TO KILL, pulls some of the mystery short story. "The desire of dancers" came back from SHERLOCK HOLMES and deals with a Holmes client whose spouse has received rather strange, bleeding messages in this code. Charles Higham, his biography, "THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CONAN, DOYLE" shows that Sir Arthur could get the code from the magazine in the 1870s, but we really do not know. The code is basically one of the letter substitutions for the number of dancing men. The story of the story is dramatic but deals with the triangle. The only innovation in the film is that Tobel makes some changes that are interfering with both Holmes and Moriart. The movie is entertaining, but I still think of the fear building, the fearfulness and the better films of SHERLOCK HOLMES FACES DEATH.
