I saw the world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival, a great movie. <br /> <br /> Real life wife and wife Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly celebrate Charles and Emma Darwin in the middle of their struggle to write and publish "The Origin of a Species". Their consideration of the consequences for their family and for the future of humanity will be communicated in such a way that only the out-of-screen pair is suspected. <br /> <br /> Jon Amiel (who gave an introduction to the heart) and John Collee are doing a great job of bringing Randal Keynes to life. They created some very enjoyable and human moments, great cinematography and sets, and great help in the theory of evolution that still divides the language-in-cheek. the nature around which the story opens in large numbers. She plays a premature young girl on the road. If this performance is something its star goes on, it should rise. <br /> <br /> All in all, it is a great movie, and although it is a periodic drama, the problems of that time are still very alive.
