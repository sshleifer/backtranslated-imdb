Death Wish 3 is just what a bad movie should be. Terrible action! Unlikely scenerios! Ridiculous death scenes! Creepy, evil-for-no-cause villains! The last 30 minutes of this movie could be the best films, especially in a situation where decent, hardworking citizens are putting the chain across the street, bouncing off the evil cyclists and then shooting them, but they are being celebrated by neighborhood children (!!!). And how can I forget an elderly woman with bones? She wipes out the scum! And if that's not enough, don't forget how quickly the reds will stop giving up after Fraker's killing. I just laugh about thinking about it. <br /> <br /> I also love Kersey's girlfriend's death scene. He just * walks * after seeing he's blown. These are the little things that make Death Wish 3 such a bad movie. And I'm not even talking about a strange soundtrack. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie for Martin Balsam, whom I seriously think is one of the best character actors (and who has beaten himself). scum "scene is fun" and i went away with a new favorite movie. Thank you, Death Wish 3, for making me so laugh. <br /> <br /> Some other things I forgot to mention: 1. Kersey's strange sound effect says, "Money!" used to buy a used car. Ha! It's so badly sounding. 2. MANDY Fraker. Mandy! Were the writers running out of harsh names? 3. The fact that the gangs have apparently "borrowed and rented" a truncheon exchange program: "I have some more guys." And that Mandy is a phone line in an abandoned building. 4. At the end of the movie, after Kersey strikes Fraker, is it just me or does it look like a street gang goes to choreography when they give up? Just look at how they sync when a female punk gives a "stop" signal. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. Nothing encourages me like Death Wish 3!
