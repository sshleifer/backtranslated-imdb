It is really good to see that Van Damme's film is slowly overdue, especially when compared to the C class flop "Derailed" and "Second in command", which were as tragic as not good. Sheperd: Border Patrol is a flick of good deeds with some very good action and combat sequences. It is good to know that Van Damme still knows how to see how his latest movie "To Death" was not at all in martial arts !!! <br /> <br /> This movie is significantly worse than "Up to Death", a very good move for Van Damme. "Up to Death" had no inscription on most of Van Damme's films, but it was dark and sharp, and showing the actor of Van Damme was surprisingly good in this film. Still, Shepherd is definitely a movie worth checking out especially for Van Damme fans or just fans of the feature film in general, but if you are looking for a bit more story line ..... you may want to skip I believe this movie was good enough, especially for this little budget that would have come. The only real problem I have with this film is the title; "Shepherd"? I can't get it! I think the "border guard" doesn't have the same ring without the word "shepherd"! <br /> <br /> My rating for this movie is 7 out of 10, but it's Van Damme movie standards not in any other movie category. <br /> <br /> That's good for Van Damme movie.
