Unexpected part of ATOR !! Directly joins JOE D'AMATO, a specialist in all forms of exploitation (subgroups) of exploitation and reinterpreted by MILES O'KEEFFE. the film's debut budget is insecure or minimal. Even though he is not a better entertaining film for his antecesor, ATOR 2 also has something that makes it an instinctive one. His introduction tells you that it explains to us the origin of ATOR with the first part of the pictures. The script is incredible, like every brilliant ROY THOMAS comic book. there are such fantastic elements inside SWORD and such a FANTASY world as invisible men, black gentlemen, cannibals - monkeys ... the role of this cabler that he interpreted as brilliant. The latter fights very well. little violence and blood but it does well. It's never boring. It has everything that was missing from ATOR 1. 4/5
