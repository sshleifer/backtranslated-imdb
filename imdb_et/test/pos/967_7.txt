A big fat liar is a pretty funny movie. But when I watched it, I thought something. Some of the events in this movie are incredible. So the movie is really big fat wrong. There is no way he could get it all. Here are all the incredible things. <br /> <br /> 1. When he falsifies his father, he was cutting the meat and behaving like his father. Jason (Frankie Munez) couldn't get it. Fortunately, we didn't do it. So it didn't stick with it, outrageous. <br /> <br /> 2. If grandmother was blind, she could still understand that she wasn't her granddaughter. <br /> <br /> 3. They didn't get to the plane flying to LA, they acted like coat sellers, sneak into the studio and then and then ... Well, some movies are a little incredible. But it does not make the wrong lie to tell the lie. Trust me, I'll do it all the time. <br /> <br /> A high fat liar, though at times incredible, is fun. It's also very funny. But let me just say one thing before continuing this review. If Paul Giamatti was not in this film, it would be a miracle. It would be terrible. A big greasy liar is also pretty funny, though at times. I'll give her thumbs. <br /> <br /> High fat liar: *** / ****
