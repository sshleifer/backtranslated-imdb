For readers who have already seen Miyazaki movies, he is still up and made another worthwhile experience. Okay, you don't have to read yet. <br /> <br /> I think most readers are older than two of its main characters, so I should say that Ponyo is not a family film or an opportunity to remember the feeling of a small child: discovering the world if you wanted to see it , forming your own rules and commendable enthusiasm when you do things for the first time. Ponyo is failing with many of the problems that all ages are dealing with. It never misses, all the characters have good hearts and plausible problems. <br /> <br /> The two main characters can be the two most believable children I've ever seen. They are not simple, arrogant or naive, just curious, enthusiastic and learning the way of the world. They are so easy to love, but even easier to identify. Many movies deal with children from the outside, as an adult is looking for a world where only a child can enter. Ponyo brings everything back to this world. Ponyos is the first time to learn and choose what you care most about, what the film really values. It's worth remembering it to feel it again.
