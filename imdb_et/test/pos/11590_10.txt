Alejandro Amenabar, a young and talented Spanish director, clearly shows that he is a serious filmmaker. Anyone who doubts this should look at his latest movie "The Sea Inside". This film has been honored with many honors not only in Spain, but throughout the world where this wonderful film has been shown. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen a movie, maybe you'd like to stay here. <br /> <br /> Ramon Sampedro is a person who is limited to bed. Being a quadriplegic, it depends on all the goodness of strangers. After an accident, Ramon thinks only one thing: how to end your life! This is the moral issue at the heart of the story, based on the true life of Ramon Sampedro. <br /> <br /> Mr. Amenabar talks about Ramon. There's nothing wrong or manipulation here. After all, he relies on facts that were well known in his country, because this incident became a "cause" for the benefit of euthanasia, which no one in this country wanted to deal with in Spain. <br /> <br /> Spain has become a predominantly Roman Catholic state that has become one of the most democratic societies in Europe, a distinction that is more noticeable because of the long years dominated by the dictator. Despite the progress in this society, most of its citizens are not something that is clearly not understood by the idea of ​​their own life, who still did not have to do this in their country. <Br /> <br /> Ramon Sampedro was a man who loved life. He lived an intense life as a young man, as a color for sailors to discover the world. In the absence of money, it was the only way to see other countries, to experience other cultures. Ramon's love for the sea is something people in Galicia learn to love from their childhood. Imagine how the same friendly sea is that takes the life of Ramon as he knew it! In seconds, Ramon goes to a living young man with vegetables! <br /> <br /> The Ramon family is breaking the experience. Suddenly they have to leave everything to take care of him at home. His brother and sister are stoic people who are engaged in reality. Their lives will become a bit late because Ramon's life is the first. They tend to sick people without protest or accusing Ramon of the victims they have to keep alive. <br /> <br /> Therefore, Sampedros does not think they can understand that Ramon wants to end it all. Didn't they give up their normal life to take care of him? This moral question heavily weighs these simple and simple people, because they think they do what was naturally. <br /> <br /> Another theme of the film is the legal issue and well-being of euthanasia, which means that suddenly they enter Ramoni's life if they want to suffer. There is Julia, a lawyer who is disabled and suffers from a rare disease. It is Rosa, a worker in the fishing industry who has attracted Ramon. <br /> <br /> Javier Bardem makes an excellent Ramon Sampedro. His transformation is complete. We have no doubt at one point that he is no other but a paralyzed man in that bed. Mr. Bardem can only use his face to convey all the emotions trapped in Ramon. Mr. Bardem makes this person real. This is probably the best career role for Javier Bardem. He crosses his award-winning competition, like the late Cuban poet Reynaldo Arenas, whom he described as "Before the Night Waterfall". In support roles, Belen Rueda is impressive as Julia, a woman struggling with her physical problems. Lola Duena is also an effective Rosa, a tribal nation who loves Ramon deeply. Celso Bugallo, like Ramon's brother, shows a man at the crossroads of his life. Mabel Rivera is making a compassionate Manuela, a sister who never asks for anything about life, but no doubt Ramon wants to do it at all. <br /> <br /> Mr. Amenabar has also produced a film of haunted music scores. He is a man who never goes beyond surprise. One wonders what his next project is, but wishes him success in everything he decides to do in the future.
