Simply put, there are two parts of this series that made me cry until my eyes fell. First, the part where he was washing the toilet, but ended up drinking water, imagining that it was a hot director who gave him a golden shower !!! (I laughed so hard!) <br /> <br /> Secondly, the part where he tried to prove the value of a swimming school instructor. He seemed to be a pro-dive, but as expected he couldn't swim (at least ^ ^). But its funny part was when he finally came to an end and said "how it was" or something. It was so funny, I couldn't laugh. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to see this anime series, I would definitely recommend it. One of the best I've seen. <br /> <br /> Definitely fun!
