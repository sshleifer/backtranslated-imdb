I learned a lot from the reactions of previous viewers. Is there one that does not mention "propaganda"? Too big. "Perception is dependent on the concept". I love Fred Astaire's music, great, great songs and Fred's equal grace. But comrades, when you see powerless, pointless, rich parasites, dancing weakened and unemployed, this is the criticism of the right capitalist propaganda. Every movie is in time and place values, not to mention who finances it? pipers who call. Great art transcends everything, like "Nevsky", as well as "All Silent to the West". I testify. I saw it for the last 40 years. But the pictures are burned in my brain. This is the biggest battle scene ever to be filmed. And it makes you frightened to be excited. Did anyone say that? This is the real death you look at. The real supplements died, doing so. "Real Search" is now a special effect that is defined. Similarly, "too long" - decreased in the age of attention? Mozart had too many notes? Propaganda, Catholic Church has been defeated? The Vatican was in STILL when they called the ancient favors to become a German Christian Democrat government. to recognize Croatia in the 1990s? remember chaos and genocide? Forget props, Nevsky lighting in the painted medieval world? like Breughel. Hampton Court Palace has one massacre. Maybe Dutch nationalistic propaganda, but it tears in the heart. Stylized actor? What is Henry V (Olivieri Film)? Naturalism? Does anyone believe that English medieval knight killers did so? As stated, Prokofiev's music is great. Only Ken Russell & Eisenstein had the 100 octane balls and genius to match the sound and the picture. OK, you want a snaffle & bit. I risk being nervous every time. Eisenstein did not copy the Wehrmacht helmets, but his model seemed to be the buckets suffered by Nazi races in the Nazi races of the 1930s. Eisenstein was a genius, but unlike Hollywood leaders, he had almost unlimited (non-commercial) time and funding. Modern Russian directors are free from political carts, but they have no money. Even Kurasawa had to make a late (big) film in Communist Russia. He was revered in his country but not funded (like Russell). How much propaganda is in the eyes of the viewer? Imagine nice people from another peace-loving world. How would they react to Nevsky? Does struggle or the exhausting of the dead dominate their cognitions? If we didn't know about the gas chambers and the SS, what is the "triumph of will"? Where to Get a Nevsky DVD, Cheap?
