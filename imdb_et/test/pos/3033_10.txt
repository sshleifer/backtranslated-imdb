An excellent story of dedicated young teachers who teach minority children from the South Carolina region. <br /> <br /> Jon Voight is just a huge, dedicated, dedicated, idealistic teacher who faces this challenge, regardless of the principal who believes in stern discipline and has barely taken into account modern educational methods and the tough old old school superintendent, who is happy with Hume Crony. Madge Sinclair is the main one who loves her children. <br /> <br /> As I am a retired teacher, I may be somewhat associated with this great film. The ignorance shown here and the lack of cooperation with officials are also quite obvious in urban areas. <br /> <br /> Voight understands that these children need much more than the classical teachings of the classroom. He's out there and experienced living outdoors while learning. <br /> <br /> The end is a definite downfall, but so real life. <br /> <br /> It is amazing that such returnees were affectionate to study and were disciplined. I think it answers my question. The behavior was there and they were motivated to succeed despite their environment. <br /> <br /> The end will just drag in your heart. It was memorable and so irritating.
