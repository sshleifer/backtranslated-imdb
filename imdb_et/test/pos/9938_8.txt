The young theater actor reluctantly accepts his first major piece as a staged game by Lady Macbeth due to the production of a dual falling in front of a moving car. Betty (Christina Marsillach) thinks that her prizes will win because the person responsible for prosecuting her is terrorizing her. <br /> <br /> First of all, his director boyfriend Stefano (William McNamara) deliberately shifted the knife when he has to look at a rope that has tied his uncle to the big mansion pillar, keeping his eyes closed with the needles attached to his eyes. by pulling the result when it flashes. Allowing him to escape, Betty finds again such a regrettable position as her Lady Macbeth's wardrobe has a particular gold chain that the crazy man was crushed when he killed the crowds that escaped from his cage in the equipment. by a dress designer who first knocked on the floor and then paired with scissors (.. its nasty cover to cover, the chain falls on his throat, where the killer has to open his throat. Dario uses this factor precisely, while Dario uses the scissor to achieve optimum effect when the camera retracts Inspector Alan Santini (Urbano Barberini, who played him coldly and at the request of Dario), but never can turn, because he promises to catch a psycho because Betty relies on his few friends who are comfortable, theater director Marco (Ian Charleson, GHANDI & CHARIOTS OF FIRE, who later died of AIDS, a sad footnote, Dario showed in an interview that Charleson informed him at the end of the shooting that he was HIV-positive, striving for a successful career in horror films, despite being rejected by critics, despite being rejected by critics, Mira (Daria Nicolodi, former Dario rather), her representative and sure, but the serum killer is quite motivated and in the theater, of course, there is a showdown between them, because Marco has added interesting changes in production using the crowds at his disposal. <br /> <br /> I think it's Dario's most forested and nihilistic. Though he has definitely made later fearsome films (such as his horrors masters and SLEEPLESS suggested), this film is truly a victim of violence against the psychopath. His method of making Betty look really was the Dario gag, which concerns the type of audience who want to look away from the more horrible parts of movies. I found myself rubbing my eyes whenever she just had to blink (.. great, Dario lets us get a hostile effect from our point of view, as if we were the ones with which the stitched needles held our eyes open). I like how Dario shows Betty's enlarged eyes, terrifying what she's been forced to look at, as little blood tears off the needles if she has no choice but flashing. Ronnie Taylor's photographic work is impeccable, for example, in the crow's end-of-the-night theatrical theater when she searches for murder. Or when the camera "travels" through the rooms in the theater to a killer who wants to see his museum box from the seat. Or, a dream order in which we take Betty's memory of an event that concerns her mother's death by a certain killer, the same mask and gloves that are currently causing her trauma. In my opinion, the ball-light order, which has been masterfully staged by all the participants, has been highlighted, as the camera follows a ball that pulls the eye through the victim, exploding behind his head, passing Betty over the phone. use for help. We even get a crow that grabs the killer eyeball (... to add this witch-like scene, the crow is shown as an eyeball that runs around its beak). The only aspect I did not care about, which was often pointed out by the film's naysayers, is the "final" end I personally felt a little unnecessary, but I think Dario wanted to point out that Betty wasn't really her mother, a woman with Sadomaskicistic tendencies that are twisted in relation to why the killer tortures our heroine. Rock music used during violent scenes didn't bother me because I felt these moments of malicious graphical attacks needed a punch that heavy metal can often offer.
