When I first saw this movie, I was so surprised and a bit shocked by the blatant vibrant. This is a very artistic drama that has incredible special effects, outstanding acting, not to mention the great work in the makeup department. Jennifer Lopez has pulled out of the upcoming roles that have been dug in her career, depicting a very sensitive child psychologist who works with a team of engineers to enter the minds of patients who have comedied with them. Vincent D'onofrio played amazingly well. His depiction of the sadistic serum killer was perfect for T. Emotional emotions in his performance are amazing. Vince Vaughn is not my favorite, but still very well. Symbolism and artistry were intriguing and titrating, sometimes surprising and otherwise shocking. Generally speaking, this is a great movie with great actors and beautiful works of art.
