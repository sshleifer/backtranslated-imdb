Although I saw this movie when I was very young, I had already known that the story of wild animals and shepherds escaped from Newgate Prison is <br /> <br />. the film follows more or less faithfully the true story. In this film, the temptation is to tilt against so many of the features of so-called historical films, but filmmakers must be praised for that. <br /> <br /> The performances are barely poor Tommy Steele is ideally cast. Good is Stanley Baker as Thief-Taker and Alan Badel are always good. <br /> <br /> Because film is a fact, it makes it suitable for viewing the whole family.
