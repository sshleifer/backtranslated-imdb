An important housewife and a perfect mother, Donna Reed (like Donna Stone) could do it. Place a spat on children or neighbors, take care of your hard-working pediatric wife Alex, and still have pancakes, three types of breakfast meat and a long glass of milk and OJ prepared for every child. morning before breakfast. <br /> <br /> Over the past fifty years, we have lost our distinguished ideal mother-in-law, family meals with a kitchen table, and a hard working wife preparing dinner when she arrives home. <br /> <br /> I want the show to be available on DVD - I will disconnect my cable at all!
