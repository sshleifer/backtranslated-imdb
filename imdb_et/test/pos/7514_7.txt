Should I never go to this hospital (or hospital if I want to be politically correct) [what ass did this asinine word in any case?] Anything other than how to get out of town. George C. made a masterpiece of burnt-down work with a claw who has come to the conclusion that his life has been a waste, but is helpless to change his environment or conditions even if they have been given a golden opportunity [which apparently was not so golden ]. I have several smiles from this brutal black comedy, but at the same time, the bone marrow was covered and often cooled because I fear that this atmosphere will pass through most healing houses as I write.
