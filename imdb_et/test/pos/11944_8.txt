Usually I have a hard time watching a TV movie, extra long commercial breaks break my concentration and give up and found a good book. However, it made me add up and ended up with it. I understand that the film was based on a real story, but it didn't show why Denny took so long? They had their own name and I assumed his social security number. When he moved a lot, he seems to be found as soon as his number is gone, and so on. The actors seemed partly old and the buried metal object, when dug, was not rust. These were only technical errors and were not taken from the file. For LifeTime Movie it was better than most.
