Another great performance at Kiefer Sutherland. I love his movies because he always plays his role very well. With a low budget movie, it was done very well and kept me on the edge all the time. I love this type of movie and I was glad to get it. I'll definitely buy a DVD or tape. <br /> <br /> 9/10
