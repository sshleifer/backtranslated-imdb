Something Park Chan-wook creates is guaranteed to be unique, brilliant and very complicated. Well, something that's not at least Cyborg. Park's newest movie Thirst is a vampire romance-erotic-thriller-dark comedy drama? yes, is it a lot of adjectives? inspired by the 19th century French novel Emile Zola titled Therese Raquin. The Park uniquely creates a vision of a Korean and unique park, a vampire tradition, and invites the audience to explore the dilemma of a Catholic priest who finds himself in a thirst for blood and a developing moral and spiritual crisis. Park offers the elements you expect, but it certainly does not match a masterpiece like Oldboy or even Lady Vengeance. Seriously swollen narrative, which often loses the audience less, thirsty thirst for another journey through the cutting room. It crawls when it should work, but fortunately it brings it back home before you lose the audience completely. The negative, as it may seem, is definitely negative, and the second volume is undoubtedly added to the dark and twisted Park Chan-wook movie Zeitgeist. <br /> <br /> Check out our rest overview at www.thefilmstage.com
