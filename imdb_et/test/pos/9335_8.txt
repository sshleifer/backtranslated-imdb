It may be a bit variegated, and it may never have an effect, but it is still an exciting reminder of what Michael Jackson can ever do. Looking back at it for the first time since it was first highlighted, no horror stories hit me - weird but fun and Vincent Price has never heard so genuinely, un-camply (sic?) Threatening - as its absorption horror film that allows Jackson to genre and make Behind the river give us a portrait of brave revealing men's sexuality. <br /> <br /> Because THRILLER is not really horrible, horror is not really horror: it is this old-age theme, the sexual awakening of a young woman. The movie opens in a cinema, where Jackson's girlfriend's images are inconvenient and aggressive. Of course, he's on a certain date and he's less frightened with the movie if he knows his boyfriend is waiting for it. <br /> <br /> The main shapes of the movie you are watching, the group's atmosphere all suggesting socially-driven expectations. It forces him not only to think of the body from disgust - so everyone breaks down ghouls; the loss of his innocence is considered to be a kind of death, but sexual rites are not only his boyfriend, but his peers, his society, and thus visualization as a gang violation. <br /> <br /> This is a great distracting stuff, the best thing ever made by director Landis. Jackson, the most popular artist on the planet, was still ready to show that the star's fixed image contained the people, not all of them soothing. The song itself is very well grown, horrible, demanding bass rhythm, exceptionally fun words, beautiful 70s disco ecstasy, who crushed the chorus, breaking the timelessness, revealing the desire for milk behind fear.
