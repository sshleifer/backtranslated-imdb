Early Coppola with a shift that most people didn't see (damage). There are other wonderful things - Shirley Knight's best results (undervalued actor), the late 1960s, James Caan's very restrained and mobile, Robert Duvall, which he was born to play (nervous, lonely, motorcycle policeman) and script F. Coppolaga behind the wheel. <br /> <br /> If it had been done by someone for five years, it would have been broken (so much for timing). Anyway, I recommend it to all people who don't need outdoor explosions and bad mom-in-law jokes or billions of dollars to sit for a few hours and watch the story. Give it one chance if you find it!
