Fran√ßois Villon was a real poet and fraudster who lived in Paris in the 15th century. But most of what is depicted in this historical film is actually a fiction - a game created in the early 20th century. When he met and got friends with Louis XI, he actually died in his 30s and never participated in such intrigues as he was in this movie. In fact, he wrote a cozy verse and was often the wrong side of the law - not a combination of a patriot and a similar character of Robin Hood as he is on the film. If you know that the film is about 100% of the fiction, then it's worth seeing - just guess it's a good history lesson. <br /> <br /> Villon has been played by John Barrymore. I was also very excited to see her three friends playing very familiar faces. Angelo Rossitto, who was a happy dwarf, played tons of movies over the years and had a very long career. Slim Summerville was a character actor known for adding comedy to the movie. Mack Swain is known as the silent film for many of Chaplin's short films and played with his partner GOLD RUSH. All four of these men did a good job and had no complaints - even with Barrymore's rather overwhelming treatment that resembled Douglas Fairbanks. However, I had a serious problem with Conrad Veidti as King Louis XI. Naming this "outrageous" would be a serious underestimation. He played a role like a college that thought he should be a stereotypical Richard III - who speaks and behaves like a demonic caricature. Though many of the films (both quiet and sound) were wonderful, they are just ridiculous here. <br /> <br /> As far as the story is concerned, it is full of terrifying adventures and activities - like a sliding film that has been abandoned by sailing ships. Sets worked well for this because they were used for NOTRE DAME HUNCHBACK last year. Both films were determined over the same time period. <br /> <br /> In general, this is one of the last major silent films. There's a lot of fun and the movie is a lovely combination of romance, comedy and action. It is worth noting, although it loses a few points for exaggerating the face, as well as how the film plays fast and loose with history. <br /> <br /> By the way, this film was made twice as much as I was in KING (1920 and 1938) and apparently these two films are closest to the original game. Altogether, Villon has six films and said that the same story will vary more or less!
