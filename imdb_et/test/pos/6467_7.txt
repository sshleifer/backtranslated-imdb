"Edge of the City" is another film that owes much to "Waterfront". From its NYC locations to this score, the belief that any trouble you may encounter can somehow correct your lies. <br /> <br /> Edge also deals with ideas such as loyalty and racism. In my opinion, this is not the success of the film as the "Waterfront". After 85 minutes, the movie speeds up the relationship and binds everyone so fast that it seems to be forced and unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Possible spoilers **** <br /> <br /> The relationship between Sidney Poitier and John Cassavette could have been further developed initially. I don't think these two characters from two very different places would have built such a strong relationship so quickly. <br /> <br /> I think the whole Cassavette love sub-block could have been eliminated. She is so uncomfortable with a woman that it hurts to look. The only reason this is in the movie is that he can motivate him to do the right thing at the end. There are other ways they have shown it. I would also have liked to see some Axel scenes in the army to show why he is as he is. <br /> <br /> Actress is great. Poitier has an excellent role that is beautifully written. His role as Tylerina is interesting and multi-layered and (especially in 1957) a man who is confident, honored and intelligent. Cassavettes, like Axel North, though very good, doesn't seem quite right for this part. Warden is fantastic as a boss who knows Axel's secret (although his struggle for a scene with Cassavettes has been stunned at the end. There are too many breaking packs). I thought Ruby Dee was great for Poitier's husband. <br /> <br /> Generally, the "city edge" is a clever, very good-looking movie that is trying too hard to be an interesting noir-style picture without taking the time to build a drama. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
