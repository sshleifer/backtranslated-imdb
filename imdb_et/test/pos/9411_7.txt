Yes, it's a little cheesy. But it's tense and fun and one of my favorites; there are some great actors in the film and they do praiseworthy work with regard to plot and character constraints. It is interesting to see David Soul's role as a "bad guy"; I thought he was quite believable - and rather chilling - than ever more paranoid CO. Robert Conrad is a long-time favorite - I think he will bring his character very well; and Sam Waterston has been in all of the films he was watching - in films or on TV. <br /> <br /> I watch this movie so often, but our tape (VHS TV copy I got) is such a bad quality that it's hard to enjoy it completely. It's a movie I think they should put on a DVD; maybe it wouldn't be searchable at all, but I'm sure there are many people like me who like this movie so there would be a DVD version. I continue to hope!
