I'm not sure why this movie in the IMDb is as low as it is all you could ever want in a horror movie. This is the concept of a horror film. I find myself a big horror fan and I have to say that this house is delivering goods. Wax House Have a story about college kids who are on the way to a football game that is decided to stay overnight and go local. Waking up the next morning, they make a terrible discovery and decide to go to the broken car part of the city. The city is horrible and I just stop. Because this is when the really merciful chaos begins. trust me when I say that if you are looking for a horror film, look at what you love. It is wonderfully devilish and inventive, because it is the scenes of killing, the story is interesting and the characters are properly directed with the actors who give them their personality. Paris Hilton contained what he did quite well with his part. The film is on a small surface, but it is so fun and caring. This movie should be eaten at the ticket office and all horror fans should participate. Go see the wax house with skinned skin, super-glued lips, dead animal carcasses, hot foam that is sprayed on a living person, the finger is cut off, intermittent, half through the head and more. I was fortunate enough to see this movie on Tribeca's premiere, and all the actors were on hand to promote the movie. And the boy has something proud of the House of Wax, the year's terrifying roller rolling! 9/10
