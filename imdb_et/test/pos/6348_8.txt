Let me first say that I am a big fan of the original Lonesome Dove series and the underlying book. I've missed looking at this stage because of the 10-year portion of the bad reviews I heard about it. If Tommy Lee Jones didn't play Capt Call, I didn't see this point. If Larry McMurtry wasn't involved, why should I care? How wrong I was. <br /> <br /> This is the order in which Lonesome Dove deserves so many ways, maybe even more than the dark mood of Laredo Street. Story, action, production, cinematography are all top-notch. Of course, the script is not as colorful as Loneome Dove, but it has moments. And to my surprise, there is a Lonesome bit in this series; The relationship between July and Clara, which has been completely rejected by prequelis, is almost identical to the book that is the most welcome surprise. The story is not all roses, it is also surprises. Far from surprising is Jon Voight's interpretation of the captain's invitation. Although Tommy Lee Jones's direct copy is not as faithful and unique to Voight credit. The cast is fantastic everywhere, and I don't think Rick Schroeder has done a better job than this series. Oliver Reed practically steals the exhibition here, he has a great role in making you look after your character just as you hate him. <br /> <br /> It is worth checking out if there is no bad criticism, especially that the DVD is so affordable (I got a 2-disc for $ 10.99, it is probably cheaper). It is not in any way disappointing that Dead Man's Walk turned out to be (well, it was for me). And MCMurtry was involved!
