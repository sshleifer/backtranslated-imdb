Two great stars and a legendary director created a wonderful fascinating love story that is memorable and moves on so many levels. <br /> <br /> Henry King led Jennifer Jones in his first hit Bernadette song and he redirects Jennifer Jones to this movie and Miss Jones is perfect in this role and gives a sharp, beautiful presentation that captures the character of conflict and Bill Holden, who hit home after l950s. 17, Born Yesterday, Country Girl, Picnic, and Of course River Kwai is great in this role. Be sure to imagine someone besides the Holden movie, which I loved to the end and cry every time I see it. Everyone who has ever loved and lost will understand. For those who do not, it is not.
