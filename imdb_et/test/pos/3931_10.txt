I don't think I'm alone when I say that 2005 is not a particularly horrible horror genre. Though "Cursed", "Hide and Seek", "The Two Ring" and "Amityville Horror" have shown all the points of interest and potential, they have hit more than hits. To prove it, see: "White Noise", "Boogeyman", "Jacket", "Mindhunters" and "Alone in the Dark". Imagine your surprise when "House of Wax", a tightly-written sibling of Chad and Carey Hayes, was a surprise. <br /> <br /> Carly Jones (Elisha Cuthbert) is a young woman traveling with her emergency worker Nick (Chad Michael Murray) and boyfriend Wade (Jared Padalecki). They are with Paige (Paris Hilton), Blake (Robert Ri'chard) and Dalton (Jon Abrahams) who want tickets for the last season's football game. Along the way, they get into a car and are forced to enter a destructive city where nothing seems to be. <br /> <br /> From hearing this about the classic Vincent B-film, I rolled my eyes. I didn't even want to think about what the newest manager of the disaster, Jaume Serra, had prepared for her audience. At a time when most high-quality horror films are disappointing, hidden in writing, static and amateur, I find myself happy that Serra and Hayes' brothers took a good, old-fashioned, horror shot. Unlike the disappointments I mentioned earlier, this flip pulls out and uses the cinematic trick of every book to give everyone exactly what they got. <br /> <br /> I'm glad Hayes actually took the time and effort to create pleasant and credible characters, making events much more urgent. It also gives these young actors something to grasp. As he did The Girl Next Door, Elisha Cuthbert proves to the audience what an experienced actor is. In a remake of the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Jessica Biel silenced the naysayers, giving crude and emotional performance that made the viewer there. Here Cuthbert does the same. Chad Michael Murray ("The Cinderella Story"), one of his first mature roles, is no joke like Nick. Murray publishes charisma and a hard edge, plus impressive athleticism. Murray and Cuthbert's gel perfectly and have tangible, family chemistry. <br /> <br /> More than anything else, the press and the American public have made a daily photo of Paris Hilton's main debut. As I expected, Hilton does not hurt itself. In fact, he's as good as someone else in the movie (do what you want). Like Cuthbert and Murray, Hilton also has a screen. She's sexy and playful. I can't think of one of the reasons why he's got the worst of the toughest film reception when they just pick him up. Jared Padalecki (TV 'Gilmore Girls') is able to memorably overcome his signed role. Robert Ri'chard (TV 'Cousin Skeeter') and Jon Abrahamsel ('Meet the Parents') do not have much work, but get a job. With only one scene, Damon Herriman ("Soar") makes an unforgettable impression and his presence hangs over the rest of the movie. Finally, Brian Van Holt ("Basic") is excellent and threatens a dual role. <br /> <br /> Once again, the defendants must always go to screenwriters to avoid clich√©s. Despite the popular opinion, "House of Wax" is quite unpredictable for most of the working hours. Take this, for example: The killer seems to be down for the census, and Carly falls down to get something out of his pockets. What are you waiting for? Watch the movie and understand what I mean. It is also refreshing to see a horror film where characters even show a nice sense. <br /> <br /> Unlike most horrors, John Ottman's ever-inspiring work never pays attention. But as with other Dark Castle publications, the visual aspects of Wax are venerable and raise the film above their genre charts. The talent of filmmaker Stephen F. Windon, production designer Graham Walker, artistic director Nicholas McCallum and editor Joel Negron highlight ghoulish images. Speaking of images, I believe that gore hounds are thrilled with many make-up and tricks here. Every scene of death is more abdominal than the last one. Given its past in music video and advertising, it is obvious that Jaume Serra is outstanding in style. His "face" approach is of great value for the success of this film. Just when you think the camera turns, it doesn't. It is also a very good layer of fear and atmosphere. One static picture is our introduction to the killer as he slowly grows out of the door. <br /> <br /> In this case, I would normally admit if I am in a minority (Shut, okay? I liked the "1000 Housing House!"). In this case, I am firmly convinced that the detectors have got it wrong. I'm not sure why people on this film are so hard given that it's much better than the latest genre entries. Maybe they are afraid the horror flick in Paris Hilton's head could be worth ... Who knows? It is a horror film and it is commendably stylish and effective. As a lifetime horror blower, I can thoroughly enjoy the "Wax House" in all its delicate and sadistic glory. I think this is a great achievement in today's horror, as well as (together with Sin City) the first totally satisfactory 2005 edition.
