As a child of films, one of the trilogys that I will soon forget is Karate Kid. You can put everything you want on Ralphi / Daniel, but it's an important movie that is important to respect all the beings who are big and small, but stand for themselves when time demands it. Going back to the current movie, it's pretty funny because I saw the guys cry and was really impressed by Hillary Swank's performance, and the second night I saw this example by turning the channels in the sea. and I didn't know during the first movie of the movie that he was in it. The story focuses on Julie, like Daniel, not knowing where to fit or even if she wants to fit, and the master teacher is introduced to help her out and drive her. I liked the addition of this series because it gave me a good feminine side and yes, even some of the equipment Hillary had kept me saying we were stimulated. <br /> <br /> Overall, 3.5 out of 5
