This begrudging and angry film is not only a war in which it was made, but a whole war. It doesn't care what war it is. This can be the most emotional experience I've had with Ingmar Bergman's work. Unfortunately, this effect has no drama on the sides of the two main characters that are not intimate on some ceremonial insignia, such as Bergman's usual, but clearly introduces people and their lives and exercises that Bergman has already proved to understand a person's reaction to the film. <br /> <br /> His top-runner Liv Ullmann and Max Von Sydow play an internalizing but striking couple who were once orchestral musicians. They are now living in a crumbled farm on the island. Part of the frustrations we share with the two people fertilize in details that nothing in their house seems to work. They are also not reclusive intellectuals. They are quite familiar marriages that have more or less left their lives and are basically apolitical; they will only receive the wind of distant rumors of the war that has lasted forever. Ullmann is concerned about their life-threateningness and children's desire. Her husband, Von Sydow, is falling off to war on them. Their serenity is interrupted when the screaming fighter planes fly low above their house, drop parachute on air travel, the arrival of suspicious troops, their inquisition, and ultimately their capture, which seems to be a local side, but loyalty has long been split. <br /> <br /> They are sent back to your home, witnessed free of charge and destroyed with such agonizing mistrust. This, one of my favorite Bergman aspirations, is a study of a couple who have been exposed to their safe self-ignorant life and corrupted manipulative despair by testing both of them to reveal who they really are. He lacks some compassion, self-service, and restlessness to suffer the destruction of his overflow. His emotional issues have led to the initiative and the initiative to repress a pleasant excitement. In the last 20 minutes that interrupted intermittently with the overwhelming images of the gray sky, one of the closest true emotions that Bergman once filmed. <br /> <br /> All dogma and belief systems are very important and portrait in this. People in charge of the main roles of Ullmann and Von Sydow are busy with the worsening world of war because they are accused of "compassion," but the film filmed by Bergman's small home island of Faro does not provide information on where or when it is set, who are both parties and what they fight . For one involved civilian, the knowledge base is probably quite similar. <br /> <br /> Ullmann and Von Sydow are not obvious companions for the enemy, but they are partisans for who is probably their side. This reactive allegory of 1968 could be for Iraqi, Kosovo, or Vietnamese or Israeli or Palestinian non-citizens, or ...
