Yes, you can watch the Babette party, which is a blow to some puritanical Christianity, but it is much more. The picture of how talented Parisian chefs flee to Paris after turning to middle classes and find that he is in northern Denmark in Jutland is just a fat that allows a deeper story to develop. <br /> <br Babette is an artist, one of the small armies of people who travel from the pillar to post over the centuries fatuous politicians, silk, greedy and arrogant, who kill profits for beauty, something politics always does, at the pace of National Endowment for Arts, that simply institutionalizes creativity for propaganda purposes. <br /> <br /> Babette is on her last leg when she arrives in a tiny village where two virgin sisters live, seeing their fallen devoted herd to their late pastor. They live in salted cod and black bread. <br /> <br /> Babette shows those simple, godly people whom God is glad and sensual and behavioral and spiritual in purity. He also shows them how this spiritual purity can lead to the insecurity that we all know about the governments of neo-authoritarian governments that would restrict our personal freedoms because they are somehow a crime against the state or as they would tell us, humanity. <br /> <br /> Babette cooks a French dinner to celebrate her late 100th birthday. The girls and their flock think the devil is among them and swear not to notice the food or drink. <br /> <br /> At the moment, Babette's winnings have been paid out in the French lottery to start tearing down. This is a trend that has arisen compared to the daily vulgarity and mendacity that floods our consciousness from morning to night through the maneuvering of the media and power mediators to get us all in the dark. <br /> <br /> The simple complexity of Babette's art spits out all the pretensions in our modern society and it is painful to look so wonderfully played in such a great movie. <br /> <br /> This is Fanny och Alexander (Bergman), my favorite movie, but I can only watch it once for a while, because like a rare wine bottle served with Blin and fresh oysters, it must not be over. <br /> <br /> A great movie that should be in every movie-lover library.
