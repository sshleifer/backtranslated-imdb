The "little" movie that the studios did, but rarely do it any more. Similar to the "breath" version of "The Last Of The Blonde Bombshells". Ian McShane is an excellent soul musician DJ and enthusiast who is obsessed with the idea of ​​reuniting classical souls, and the film follows the views of both his and his group members; cast with a real musical talent like Isaac Hayes, as well as actors Taurean Blacque, Derrick O'Connor and Antonio Fargas. It is in no way epic, but it is solid gold.
