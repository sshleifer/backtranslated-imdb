This movie started to get confused and grew into one of the best-seen movies ... The show was absolutely wonderful and when I didn't dry I enjoyed Meryl Streep, who was extraordinary. The film discusses the coping of a distant family with a mother who develops terminal cancer. The movie was very difficult to watch and heartbreak. The soundtrack fits this film. Brava Bette Midler! 5 stars will give it 4 1/2.
