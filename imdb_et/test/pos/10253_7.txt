This age drama that was placed in Chicago at the beginning of the 1960s follows a group of high-class friends as they move through the ups and downs of their lives. Two average characters are Leroy "Preach" Jackson (Turman) and his best friend Richard "Cochise" Morris (Hilton-Jacobs.) Both have promising futures. Preach is a great writer but a lazy student, and Cochise just got a college scholarship for basketball. If they don't talk to the local dining community when they take pictures with their friends, or in a house of friends or girls, they skip school, drive trains in Chicago, or go on a weekend at weekends. / / <br /> Things go wrong when Preach and Cochise make a mistake in dealing with two hoods and rejoicing in a stolen car. The police are continuing them and they are being arrested. But thanks to the efforts of the relevant teacher (SNL Garrett Morris), they are released. But these two hoods are not, and the promise to get revenge on Preach and Cochise, I thought they blamed the whole thing for them. <br /> <br /> This movie is very episodic, but it still works because it's life, many episodes. Some funny, some sad, some romantic, some odd. The film is never boring because all the characters are so well played and realistic, and the situation is all plausible and relative. Like Preach, who is romantic towards a beautiful girlfriend or a violent party, when some assholes decide to start a fight or deal with a younger brother. But even if the situation is not personally relatable, like boys pretending to be secret police, to get the money out so they can get all their friends to get a movie, the sequence is still fun. <br /> <br /> Cooley High was the basis for the classic 70s sitcom "What Happen!" It was in ABC in 1976-1979. Even if the exhibition is best known for Rerun's character, he is not in the film, nor is there any sign for him. The humor of this exhibition was very wide, but still funny. "Cooley High" humor is more real life and therefore more entertaining. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the soundtrack is great. Throughout the film, Diana Ross & The Supremes, The Temptations, Martha & Vandellas, and the classic songs of this movie add a movie to a fun, youthful, surprising tone.
