I liked this movie, I've seen it so many times, but I always enjoyed it :) The story is interesting and special. But the only thing I disagree with is that I don't think Max lived in the Romanian monastery or what it was: P They don't look so in Romania. Anyway, back to the story, Ghita Muresan played well, but as someone said before, she needs to improve English. <br /> <br /> And also some funny moments and some tragic / sad parts. It deserves sight, I thought it was lovely that the giant wanted to find his love. I advised you all. It's never the best movie ever, but it was great!
