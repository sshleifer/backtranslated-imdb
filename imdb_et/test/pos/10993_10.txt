This film - and in itself - truly "MANNA FROM HEAVEN" !!!! <br /> <br /> What could best be described as a "cute" movie, about 350 years of filmmaker's experience (all - giving or taking 100 years!) happily lights up the screen to tell the story of fraud, regret, and redemption of the Catholic family in Buffalo , NY. <br /> <br /> With a really good position to take your place in the "feel-good" movie genre, this quiet little independent movie, Burton Sisters' VIIS SISTERS PRODUCTIONS COMPANY, leaves a smile on your face and joy in your heart. Humanity. <br /> <br /> Buffalo, NY's spectacular opening scene, until the final credit, can tell the story that could have been said about every family, everywhere. But somehow it is family and "family reunion" in a small, not descriptive house in Buffalo, more than just a bill. If you have never been to Buffalo, you will leave the theater for a visit! Pictures of the cityâ€™s sights and surroundings help bring the film to its originality, the tone of the ground - that's just what it does. The silent beauty of the "Queen of the Great Lakes City" is a congratulation rather than a story of what is being said. If only more movies use the natural beauty of the "second city" of that country, so that somewhere out of the sound track, the end result would be so much more plausible. <br /> <br /> Shirley Jones' Great Performances Frank Gorshin, Wendy Malick, Jill Eickenberry and the rest of the ensemble will once again say that true talent goes beyond Hollywood's "taste of the week" anytime! <br /> <br /> SIGN THIS MOVIE! <br /> <br /> You've been lost in the Hollywood Desert for too long!
