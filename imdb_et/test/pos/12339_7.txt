A number of corporation girls make a new promise to spend the night in a horrible mausoleum. Of course, a recently dead person will not lose a long time and all hell will break. "One night of darkness" is an enjoyable horror of the 80s, with some ghostly bodies floating around Raymari, a dead psyche. not gore and nudity, but the mausoleum atmosphere is very scary. The actor is sure, but the script takes time to create characters up to the last 20 minutes when Raymar finally breaks out of his grave. Mausoleum is a great place for weather conditions. The movie goes so long as it goes and this is the main mistake.7.
