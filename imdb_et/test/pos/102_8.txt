Although Bullet In The Brain is undoubtedly better among short films, it seems to be rather short than film. And it's a little hard for a teacher to feel too bad when his smart ass's comments hit him. But after the ball reaches its brain, we begin to understand a little bit about why it first got to relax with life. This relatively short film offers a lot of details and makes me feel that it should have been extended a bit - it seems that it is almost too much to turn on at one time because the details fly fast to you. A little relaxed pace and a less pathetic narrator in the last part would have benefited a little from this movie. Despite these complaints, it cannot be denied that Bullet In The Brain is quite an amazing job compared to many short and even full-length films. The authors should be praised for trying to make such an essentially emotional and illiterate movie in the current atmosphere of fast jokes and Hollywood action.
