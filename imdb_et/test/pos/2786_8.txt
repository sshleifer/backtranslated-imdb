Surprising, clever, funny and fully involved in the film captures the little-known reality: a student studying in the Erasmus program. The beginning is great because the story begins, of course, it has paired pairs and sometimes the story moves away from the main branch, but the viewer does not bother - the film is young, fresh and light-hearted, although I disagree with the idea that if you are Erasmus and you come back, you no longer become part of this universe. But it's just me. The film is deep and at the same time very light. Cool and recommended.
