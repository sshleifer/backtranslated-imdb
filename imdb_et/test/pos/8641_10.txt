Spoiler Alert - Although it is a plot almost impossible to spoil, as it is perfectly explain. <br /> <br /> Mulholland Drive is the most successful expression of David Lynch's cinematic style and vision since the first season of his "Twin Peaks" TV series. As Lynch's enthusiasts know, his style and vision, uniquely blended with film, horror films, surrealism and parapsychology? a healthy dose of postmodern self-awareness and black humor thrown for a good measure. All these elements work impressively in Mulholland Drive, making riveting, hair-raising and a very satisfying movie experience? especially if no one is too obsessed to try to match all the plot pieces into a logical, mysterious devastating whole. <br /> <br /> The film has excellent performances by Naomi Watts and Laura Harring. young women, whose lives intersect in many ways in a Hollywood environment that itself is a mixture of contemporary reality with hallucination, retro 50's nostalgia, and satirical self-expression. Their seemingly casual initial meeting takes place after the film's opening, where Harring's character flees to an accidental, let alone terrible, car accident. From Mulcholland to Sunset Sunset Boulevard (the two most archetype of Hollywood passes), he takes a step forward that Betty (Naomi Watts) surrenders to his aunt Rutti, a supposedly successful actor to start a new film in Canada. Later on, Betty got herself from Deep River, Ontario, right after winning the jitterbug competition. <br /> <br /> A very energetic and stylized setback to the competition is one of the two pre-credit prologue sequences that are the innocent lover of the blameless star of Betty's origins against the wretched madness and somewhere in the pair. Unable to remember his name, then Harring's character takes the name of the film "Rita" to the classic "Gilda" film that beautifies the aunt of Rutti. (In fact, it turns out that Aunt Ruth has long died and with the apartment we really are is a good question to look at in the future.) Anyway, Betty will help Rital find out what happened and find its source. money and the mysterious blue key women find in Rita's wallet. These two women are beginning to gather clues that appear to be the true identity of Rita. By the way, they also become lovers, at one point radiating the kind of inflammatory chemistry that I do not remember the equality of the ordinary care of the lesbian lover's affairs (if a Lynch movie can ever be called "mainstream"). <br /> <br /> At the local Winkies restaurant (a repetitive location full of dreamy realistic facade behind his slag) Rita's attention was drawn to the waitress label that reads "Diane". This will remind him of someone called "Diane Selwyn" whose two women will soon be visiting and break at Betty's request. I will not disclose what they find, but it is enough to say that the scene is designed with vintage Lynchian creepiness. Then Rita awakens at night by talking Spanish and rushing to Bett throughout the night's magical exhibition / theater called "Silencio", where the art of illusion and lips / instrumental synchronization is practiced with manic intensity and where the blue haired lady is labeled as the final credit, it is presided over by the President of the Museum. The blue-haired lady with blue-colored, red cardinal Silencio theater captures the film in the last picture, perhaps as a symbol of controlling artistic imagination? Rather than Steven's "Blue Guitar Man", which is filtered through the ill-drug surrealism. <br /> <br /> During the Silencio series, and when Rebekah Del Rio stepped on her lip, she is synchronizing her powerful Spanish publication Roy Orbison. ") when Betty opens his wallet to find a blue box with a keyhole that obviously corresponds to the key in Rita's wallet, even if we don't move too deep into the Freud's sexual symbol for purses, for a moment, is the unique Hitchcock, because matching key and box brings What we thought was completely transformed, character relationships and meanings: at least these revolutions have revealed that Betty is the desired lover of Diane Selwyn and Camilla Rhodes (ie Rita) Camilla, in turn, is a Latin-Femme fatale film star Diane owes some small role that he managed to secure safely, and more importantly, to whom he is emotionally subordinated. <br /> <br /> After these and other discoveries in the last third of the film, the problem of counting the first two-thirds of the film is not so direct solved like “Vertigo.” Although the bits and pieces of images and dialogue suggest that Diane's own fever subconsciously predicts a lot u and not all of the previous material, other bits and pieces are likely to refer to supernatural interference associated with the "Twin Peaks", the direct inspiration of the characters, including Michael J. Anderson, who repeats his uneven power of dwarfish and the Bob variant hanging on Winkies and is the ultimate repository of blue box and id-like connections. <br /> <br /> One fits the pieces together, but the whole "Mulholland Drive" is much bigger ?? and more mysterious? than the sum of its parts. Lynch takes us to a wonderfully inventive, provocative and pleasantly disturbing mind. What's more, the film's cinematography is a stunning, soundtrack, full of a vivid atmosphere, masterful and superb leadership / editing. It may be America's greatest image of the 2001 best-known excerpts.
