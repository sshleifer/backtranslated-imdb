No beef and cabbage fed to him anymore. <br /> <br /> This little romantic comedy clings to the scene with some exotic twists (some imaginative scenes and a costume party). All of this is focused on the wife of the wife (s) who wants to break what Gloria Swanson plays (she's twenty here!). Both leading men have natural air that is convincing and of course Swanson is perfect for any mood, from frivolous and worrying promising. <br /> <br /> Behind all the games and with a clear heart, this is an old serious problem that is in love and not in love. There's a little corniness, but the director DeMille is on top to keep it gently and credibly in all. As with many films of this period, the subtitles simply do not talk about what they say (or think), but often give a sort of philosophical insight as to justify the tragedy (or race). And here's the higher goal, probably better without the text, but it's part of the narrative style and it's peculiar. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for visual or formal amazement, you will not find it here. But as a story, well-acted and filmed accurately and economically, it is really a great example. Events may not come as a surprise, but it is such a modern love story that is about a hundred years ago, a gas. And did I see that Swanson was perfect?
