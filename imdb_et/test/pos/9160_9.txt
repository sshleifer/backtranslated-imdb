This film allows fans of American warfare to get bored of their skull, but this boredom is born of ignorance. Intrusion operations are always such. Sit around and wait, get some whores, drunk, wheel and deal with a businessman, imprison a prisoner, cover the killing of a street retailer by a green private sector. Then, boom, two tankers and 10 minutes of small arms battle with one big caliber machine gun. Then wait until the brass is planning a way to defeat your fortress, and then finally kill some civilians who do. When reality doesn't work for Western viewers, Top Gun or Rambo (Top Gun Realistic? <br />) is always the best realism in Afghanistan as all planes fell like confetti. They had to do this because Carter and Reagan gave Mujahedin so many rockets. Mi-24's wave was also a great, better helo-attack even when Apocalypse. The sight and shooting of these missiles was a scene where the impending "death from above" whoever they were directed. <br /> <br /> It's funny how Soviet citizens were able to make their departure after a year of honest Afghan film, but it took six years for the US. Afghananskiy Izlom is as real as you apply it to the NATO occupation. Someone will pick up a gun and let you down because they care more about the land. This is a film that Westerners should look at. Unfortunately, I don't think anyone has ever made English subtitles; Maybe I should do some.
