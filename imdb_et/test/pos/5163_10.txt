Here's a brief overview without spoilers. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie yesterday at Cannes Film Festival. My first reaction is miracle and happiness. I am so happy that such films have been made in the age of our age limiters. <br /> <br /> Roy Andersson's new film "You, Life" is nothing more than a complete masterpiece. You, The Living, consists of about 50 vinyls that are filmed with a static camera. I don't give the content a scene here because I hate people even breaking the smallest details. But yes, most of the scenes made 1000 people in Claude Debussy's theater completely puzzled and surprised. When the movie was over, we praised for several minutes, we had no choice. <br /> <br /> What is "You, Life" then? Um, Andersson is not afraid to take on tough questions; History, guilt, gand Holocaust during World War is a big issue (and these things work very well). <br /> <br /> The images you create are great, sometimes deeper than "Second Floor Songs". <br /> <br /> Well, sorry for the prayer, praise. Check out the Flying House from the beginning! <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars - a masterpiece (I've never threw this class out).
