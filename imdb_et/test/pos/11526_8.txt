I love it. I had just sat halfway from the "Glass House" (it was turned off ... a god that is a land of predictable plot and bad behavior) and then I saw this movie. I thought it was terrible. I liked both Cameron Diaz and Jordana Brewster. I liked the whole environment, traveling to Europe in the 1960s, but they made it more realistic, showing the blind and all the bad things that could have happened. It took my attention completely, even though I thought the parts were incredible.
