This dark night is a difficult challenge: it is very difficult to write it exactly without destroying it for those who have not seen it yet. As it remains quite unclear, it covers almost everyone. The film hits those who are familiar with the well-known headlines of his director Joseph H. Lewis in the cycle of noir? Gun Crazy, Big Combo, even my name is Julia Ross, what's like her brevity? an odd choice. <br /> <br /> For beginners, it's based on bucolic French land. Steven Geray, a Parisian Deathly Medieval Detective, sets a vacation in Ste. Margot (or maybe Margaux). Quite unexpectedly, he finds himself in love with Inkeepers' daughter (Micheline Cheirel), although she is a tough local farmer. But the Parisian siren song is hard to resist, so he agrees to marry him, despite the differences in age, which inevitably turns into a city call. <br /> <br /> But at the night of her engagement party she will not be able to return to the inn. Soon, the mound will find its body along the river. His jealous, broken lover is a logical suspicion, but he is also dead. Then anonymous notes threaten more deaths. For the first time in his career, dying Geray finds himself inclined ... <br /> <br /> A particularly weak script, but not a movie; It plays like a bad Cornell Woolrich baptized by Roger Ackroyd's murder. But Lewis is proud of this proud vehicle. He takes his time near the beginning, but then the story? and storytelling? momentum (unfortunately, almost the time the script interrupts the axis). Burnett Guffey illuminated and photographed the film with an intriguing leitmotif that showed him out of the window; Hugo Friedhofer also has an effective score, which gave a phonetic threat to many young men. A lot of talent has been staged in such a dark night, but in the end it is no longer just a trick? and this is not a very good trick. This is a movie with one trick pony. <br /> <br />
