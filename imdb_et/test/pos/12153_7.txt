17/02/09 "More" (1969) Dir: Barbet Schroeder <br /> <br /> For a movie that most viewers have agreed, it is quite average, I am impressed by how many different interpretations have been proposed. . I'm just not washing the web for quite a short time, and I've already been informed that "More" is: 19th-century style romance, a hint of Icarus's story, an ordinary film full of dull people and interesting only for Pink Floyd graduates. It is therefore fair to say that critical reception is confusing. I would argue that these extremely different readings of Barbet Schroeder's 1969 director's debut are sufficient evidence that "More" is something other than a fairly average movie. <br /> <br /> It's also not a masterpiece. I approached "More" as I did "Easy Rider" and Antonion "Blowup" - a "time-capsule" film that is an epoch of the era, despite the differences in pace, style and content between these films. They all have similar bugs - either vague or even irrelevant characters that act as a bit of a relaxation, a relaxed edit, and steep endings that are outraged by the viewers. These films never try to be convincing or half-hearted - they are the ones they are, man. This is not a problem in itself if we have a souvenir of experience. Fortunately, "More" offers a number of truly memorable images, sounds and recommendations to the viewer. This is what saves it. <br /> <br /> Stefan is a young man who is coming to Paris for his studies in Germany. The first part of the film follows him when he coincides with a French hipster group, accompanied by a horrendously cool and self-conscious party and bar before the Estelle meets. Two characters are sexually and romanticly involved, and he promises him to his Ibiza, according to his friend Charlie. This is where Icarus's thing is playing - he's the Sun, he keeps on him. Now you can guess how it all ends. <br /> <br /> Ibiza is idyllic about the lively urgency of a populated Paris that naive Stefan knows must be good. Estelle remains striking and uneven and the island is less desirable. So far, I had little caring about either of these characters and their unreasonable effort somewhere to be truly free, but if this action is just these two, the film will suddenly become more dynamic. Only by exchanging one great dialogue in a distant villa, do they live in a place where their volatile love crystallizes, I went from watching silent optimism to being completely ruined. I can't think of many other movies that have done it. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Stefan and Estelle is real and human, because we see that it goes from life-defining intimacy to frustration and cruelty. They take a lot of drugs and keep naked on terraces, rocks and beaches. Their life revolves around each other and around the beautiful Mediterranean. For some time their situation has been the essence of freedom, emotional openness and experience for themselves. But Stefan is not in control and it is more than just his future in Ibiza. <br /> <br /> Pink Floyd's score is perfect for exoticism, proximity and "More" failure. . This is one of the most memorable entries with the mosquito net surrounding the Estelle bed and their hallucinogenic overflows around the windmill (appearing on the front cover of the soundtrack album). The scene in which they take acid to escape heroin deprivation illustrates a couple of basic mistakes - they cannot land without a disaster. Maybe they're too close to what they wanted. <br /> <br /> Stefan will never make contact with the family before Paris arrives. We have assumed that they have no idea where he is. While other 1960s Counterculture films are devastating, overly, from the media and voyeurism, Schroeder has given us a story focused on one person who relies somewhat in the corner somewhere in the world and quietly disappears.
