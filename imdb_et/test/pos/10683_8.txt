The fans of Gerry Anderson's directors recognize many actors and vehicles from the UFO (made after the Doppelg채nger) - and the various Anderson series sound effects. Barry Gray's great music (mostly unique to this film) adds a feeling of feeling. For these reasons alone, I think every Gerry Anderson fan is worth the Doppelg채nger. <br /> <br /> When you simply evaluate the film, you have to say that the Doppelg채nger is faulty. It is known that there were major problems in the production process and I suspect that this is why it is a time-consuming primer, which ends abruptly and which is not relevant to the rest of the story. Probably time / budget constraints prevented the emergence of importance. <br /> <br /> A very bad effect - better than any 1960s movie I know - has a special effect, disappointingly bad. But even with these errors, the main story of Doppelg채nger is well-known and keeps the viewer (or at least its viewer) whole. Finally, Anderson may not be expected, but at the same time it is typical for Anderson, and it is certainly appropriate. To find out what I mean, you have to look at it yourself. :)
