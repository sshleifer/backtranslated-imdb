Wow. I saw this movie and "up" the same day in one hour in different theaters. I first saw "Mr Bug" and then I was completely disappointed with the "up" follow-up. What a beautiful and touching movie! The films of the 1930s and 40s that we offer today can be melodramatic exhibitions and dialogues, but as an animation, the same melodrama and calm humor can be wonderful. And the 30's soft "organic" line AND music puts you in a nice comfortable mood and you can enjoy this example with all your little characters: ladybugs, grasshoppers, bees, snails, stinkbugs, flies, mosquitoes, beetles, crickets, and each of them all have its cute little (but not overwhelming) peculiarity. Communicating with the human world, from non-smokers (smokers of cigars, high bearers, innocent children), to friendly and unknown fighters is realistic and exciting. You care about mistakes, JA Dick and Mary. Actual Hoppity is not a perfect superman who gets "things right", but an optimistic optimist who takes everything along the garden path (literally!) And every time you think it will end happily in the 1930s, another obstacle will come along. .! I was much more than "Up" at the edge of my seat. I caught up with cinema and laughter: something that hasn't happened for a long time!
