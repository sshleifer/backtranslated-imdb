This movie is a very pleasant respect for Bogart and other old detective films. Robert Sacchi's nails Bogie and Michelle Phillips are truly timeless beauty like Gena Anastas. <br /> <br /> But the most remarkable part of this movie is the longest belly dance ever created on a Hollywood film. One well-known professional teacher commented that there is nothing else in the cinema to stimulate dance. <br /> <br /> The scene ending in a substantial part of the plot takes place in a lushly beautiful Middle East nightclub and is mesmerizing by all accounts. Pulsating music, rotating veils and ringtones, free-flowing mermaids and beautiful costumes - and a surprising twist that includes seductive Sybil Danning - build tension and excitement until the end. <br /> <br /> Three talented and beautiful professional nightclub dancers are headed by exotic Brunette Beauty Kamala Almanzar, one of the leading US belly dancers since the mid-1970s. The famous Armenian musician Guy Chookoorian, who traveled on his own orchestra. Guy's band is a lively band that dancers perform on the scene. When you look at the trailer on this site, you can see a glimpse of Kamala (playing a finger on the thumbs behind Sybil Danning). <br /> <br /> If you are not yet a fan of belly dancing, you look at this movie and if you are an enthusiast, it is very good after repeated viewing.
