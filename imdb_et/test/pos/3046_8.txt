Martin Ritt seems to be a director who is always interested in social issues (as a son of immigrants, he had every incentive to be so, especially since he was on the black list in the 50s). "Conrack" is based on Pat Conroy's novel "Water is Wide", from his own experience in 1969, teaching the school of impoverished black children from the outside world, much better than the fear of Hume Cronyn. The strength of the film is accompanied by a cultural and historical context: Conroy (Jon Voight) speaks disappointingly to another teacher about how many children do not know about Paul Newman, Sidney Poitier, the Vietnam War or even Vietnam. He illuminates them all these factors. <br /> <br /> Somewhere I read the complaint that when Conroy played music for children, he played only white music. The truth is that you can't blame this movie; it was based on Conroy's actual experience. In both cases, the film is a real gem.
