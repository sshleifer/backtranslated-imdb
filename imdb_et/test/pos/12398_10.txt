I just saw this movie at Showtime at night. I looked at the beginning with one eye, but instead of going to sleep, I invested in this cunning nails. It was very credible and interesting. I could have done a lot without it (like any David Mameti movie I can see), but I enjoyed this experience thoroughly. I know teenagers swear, but I don't have to listen to it. Anyway, there was a story of interesting surprises that I didn't publish, but if you have the chance to show this movie, I think you'll enjoy it as much as I have.
