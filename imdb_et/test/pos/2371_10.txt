If you loved the 1993 (erotic, sci-fiction) cyber "Nemesis", then you love it. I loved it in a minute when Elvis Pompadoured hero pulled out a samurai sword. Similar to "Nemesis", it takes place in the apocalyptic slum of the future. Both are police thrillers, where a well-armed hero must take up armed rebels to solve the clash against the unwashed masses. but where the similarities end. An ambiguous mayor dead or alive is trying to keep the masses soothing what he sells. The insurgents, assisted by mercenaries and cyber, are trying to get their suffocating off their subjects. After several attempts to repel the rebels, he sends his domination to murder the rebels. This movie follows the adventure of most activities, but is not afraid of color outside the line.
