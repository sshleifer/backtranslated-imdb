I loved this movie when I was a kid. I saw it theatrically. Randy Edelman made a good soundtrack. David Seville is Chipmunks' father and recording manager. Chipmunks is made up of Alvin, best known for his harmonious playing, Simon, who is a bright and spooky patrol and Theodore, the youngest and always hungry. There is a woman known as Miss Miller, who takes care of chips and has 3 daughters called Bretagne, Jeanette & Eleanor, all of whom have the same characteristics as Chipmunks. My favorite songs from this soundtrack are "Diamond Dolls", The Rock of Rock and Rolling "My Mother". Alvin really wanted to see Europe when Dave had to go there. Over the world in a 30-day video game that led them to compete against each other, doing a real thing.
