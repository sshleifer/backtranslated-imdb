Doctor Who's Amazing. It's a teapot for everyone. It must be. Boys love monsters and action and adventure, and girls love the emotions and feelings that go around. <br /> <br /> Billie Piper was extraordinary as Rose Tyler. He was so emotional and made Rose so real. <br /> <br /> David Tennant is both funny and funny and it's so enjoyable to watch. <br /> <br /> But now Billie has left and Rose is in a parallel universe where she is an off-boy Mickey and her mother and father (she died when Rose was a child, but this Pete Tyler is a parallel universe). This is very strange when Marta is a new companion because I've ever seen it with Rose (except for the Runaway Bride that came with Catherine Tate). <br /> <br /> Freema is better! <Br /> <br /> But nobody can win Rose!
