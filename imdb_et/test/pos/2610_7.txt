"Please don't kill me! I'm just an actor!" "Can you play dead?" It is difficult to describe this exhibition. It's like crime. How bad the cop is in the ass. Literally. What is very good to show is some Assy's great terrible one-liners. Cracking with gems like "Adios, Blimp," gives Assy Mcgee some big laughs at points. Unfortunately, it seems that the exhibition is slowly pushing forward, making it almost invisible. This is definitely an exhibition you love or hate. It's not the {Adult Swim} best show, but it has some strengths. It's worth exploring if you enjoy it. I know I did.
