Background - Movies Octopussy & Never Say Never Again were both made in the same year, 1983, so naturally people compare them. Moore vs. Connery. Bond vs. Bond. I've heard a lot of people claiming that "official film" Octopussy is much better. I just watched Octopus. Bond flies 100 miles per hour (impossible --- wind blows off) using legs to force the plane to the ground and then we jumped about 60 miles per hour (again impossible --- try again) jumping out of the car --- you stop the broken body . How should this octopussy scene be "good" in some sense? Suddenly, Bond has the ultimate human strength and titanium body. And does he do all these tricks at the age of 56? Complete crap. Unbelievable. Farse. <br /> <br /> ---> Now we will never say the never-before-mentioned Connery's unofficial ever: it doesn't have the same movie because of its independent movie status (less money), but at least you can believe Connery is real a threat that actually threatens. <br /> <br /> The film starts with Bond, showing her age (ultimately she's 50) and being sent out for recovery. Fully credible. But of course, the world-famous spy does not have something like "day off" and Bond finds himself in hospital quickly. From that moment on, the story strikes another adventure where Bond tries to find his killing attempts and ultimately stops nuclear weapons being stolen. <br /> <br /> As usual, Sean Connery did a great job and avoided - top / incredible stunts. This film seems to be the natural successor of the last film by Connery, the Diamonds Are Forever of 1971 ... Bondi's old style ... before the franchise was stupid. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
