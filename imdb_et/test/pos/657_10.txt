I saw this movie for the first time in 1980 and it touched a cord that reminded me of more innocent time. Opening Norman Rockwell narrative, music and paintings gave me a tone. You love a movie or hate it. Jan Michael Vincent was always the best and depicted Cpl Marion Hedgepeth in the most innocent and touching way. This movie is on the front of my all-time favorites, a shame that DVD or VHS is no longer available. The end was also great. John Hancock did an excellent job of capturing the essence of this time.
