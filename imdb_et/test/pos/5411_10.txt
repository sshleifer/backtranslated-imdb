Imaginary Heroes is clearly the best film of the year. It was a complete and complete pleasure to look. I was cursed. The whole audience at Sunset Five was riveted when the movie didn't end, spoke, nothing. I think this movie is the perfect example of what power drama has. Especially insofar as it gives an example of the quality of drama / work of this younger generation. <br /> <br /> There were moments in your movie, many, like at least seven, with so much beauty and emotional beauty that I couldn't really breathe for a while. And like a cataract junkie like me, it is about the best censored experience I could ask. It is a powerful, masterful storytelling and direction. Like heavyweight things like Burtolucci and these guys. <br /> <br /> Each film element fits tightly together. There was no error. The cast was amazing. I've been a big fan of Emile and Ryan for a long time and I thought they had never been better. I was / am / am constantly stunned with this movie. And I promise to drag every person I know to see. This should be seen. It should win prizes.
