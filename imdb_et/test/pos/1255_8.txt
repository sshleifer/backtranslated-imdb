When the first trailer of the film was viewed by me, I was curious what the angle would be. After all, many opportunities include the return of childhood itself. Bruce Willis does an excellent job in his role. I was surprised how well he could act in this regard. It's also a good career, as many others have said, but after I see it, I now agree. This movie is mainly a remembrance of the child you were with before and reaching the notion that you are not the adults you are planning. It is a great story and a thrilling story that makes us all think. Usually we scare the movies "What if ...". For example, Waterworld tried to answer the question "What if the world was covered with water and ...?" But honestly, no one cared. However, this film affects everyone in the theater. True, small children may not fully understand how to grow and all their dreams are burning, but it will have a big impact on their children 's adults and parents. This movie is definitely worth it. Although it is a second time better because you don't think so much about how the child got there and why and all things just relax and have fun. And take something when you leave the cinema. Take this childhood that you have forgotten and enjoyed.
