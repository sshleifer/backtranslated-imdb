William H. Macy in this Alfred Hitchcock-esque movie is terrible. Macy is a film critic who accidentally kills one of his girlfriends. The following characters are fun. James Cromwell gives an excellent deterrent to an extreme deterrent. As always, Macy is incredibly funny and gives a phenomenal result. Watch this movie whenever it is t.v. and check your video stores, because that's one you don't want to miss.
