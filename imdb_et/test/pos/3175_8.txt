Hookers was a great story for me every day, like someone you might have known. Just trying to do it, my big blow is right around the corner. Then the little temptations of life, the spoiler, collapsed again. How much, can your love be taken and given to a man who is not so bad, but human. I liked it, I was also in the movie for a premium. They played drums in the bar shots, along with the band made several walks, my green 66-inch body was in the motel party's frames. Wonderful cast and team, first-rate people, down to earth movie. I created with James Coburn on Mother's Day what a wonderful man, as I had known him for years, never forgets him. My dad spent the day with Slim Pickens and exchanged horse stories, Slim was really on the ground, I love these guys, we really don't. Real people who make movies of real people, thanks to Lyle, Gardner and Laven.
