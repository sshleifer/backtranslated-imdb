I recently received a video from SEVEN-UPS and I have to say that it was a very enjoyable movie. Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco are great as a policeman and a bunch and the young Richard Lynch is a great psychological man, Moon. The late Bill Hickman is pretty good for his companion Bo and is creating a brilliant car chase that will take you to the edge of your seats. The other three members of the Seven-Ups team are quite blissful, but it's only expected. <br /> <br /> I am glad that many people on this site have supported this movie. I think it should be a movie that should be released on a DVD and not just forgotten. I certainly enjoyed every minute. The last scene between the two leaders is great because a bad man has to face the consequences of his actions. SEVEN-UPS doesn't disappoint.
