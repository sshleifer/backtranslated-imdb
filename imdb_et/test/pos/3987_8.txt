With Billy's famous humor, this more modest comedy with heavy bittersweet oils is a great departure, pleasantly unexpected to Billy Crystal. This film has different tears, dramatic and serious basic themes (especially in the scene with Steven Seagal). This movie was so fun and serious, a movie about lost love, relationship with father-son, husband, friendship and values, good humor, especially at the beginning. The balance between drama and comedy is not always maintained as in the case of this type of classical genre, but the true message and motivation of this film is still certain. The discovery of Billy Crystal's talent / agent for a gigantic person in Romania is revealing and the scene's film agents look exciting. At the same time, the emphasis remains on the sensitive links between love and self-learning. Ten stars eight.
