AristoCats is such a terrific Disney classic that I just loved as much as a baby. Until today, I can't look at it, it's just such a wonderful and charming film that has great animation and beautiful songs. I really lack the animation films like AristoCats, they had the perfect voice, not to mention the hand-drawn animation that makes it ideal for the family. AristoCats is also very witty and wise, the story was just so wonderful. This movie is simply irresistible, I think the most memorable moment for me was the cats who played the piano, learning appecio, lol, it was just so cute with piano and painting. <br /> <br /> Douchess and her kittens are very fond of her big mansion, mainly because their lady is very rich and treats them as they were her children. But when a lady feels it is time to do her will, she will leave it to the cats and not to the butcher. Butler gets angry and takes kittens on the road and abondons them in the middle of the middle. Douchess and kittens wake up and with the name of the smooth street cat Thomas O'Malley, they lead back to their wife, but learn the coolness of the observation bags. <br /> <br /> AristoCats is just the perfect Disney movie, which I think has been a bit overhauled. I always recommend this movie to children or families, everyone could enjoy it. Songs and the story is just memorable. I always share the best song of the movies "Everyone Wants to Be a Cat", so big a voice. I also love dogs who watched a farm where cats were abandoned, they were just so cute. It's a great movie, look at it, you don't have to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> 9/10
