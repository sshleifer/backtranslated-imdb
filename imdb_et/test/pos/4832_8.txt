After all, having been able to get the DVD of the 1997 HBO movie, it's foreseeable. By the time I finished it, I also remembered the old saying: "Those who cannot learn from the past have been restored". The first four years after the first bombardment of the twin tower (and four years before the September 11 events) shows a series of meetings, flaws and official decisions close to Paradise that led to the first bombardment of the twin tower and the lessons we should learn from them. <br /> <br /> There are beautiful actors in Paradise Paradise. Peter Gallagher and Marcia Gay Harden were led by FBI agents John Anticev and Nancy Floyd, who are faced not only with terrorist threats but also with their superiors' lack of official interest with their NYPD colleague Lou Napoli (Paul Guilfoyle). Art Malik, Andreas Katsulas, Shaun Toub, and Tony Gillan are among those who plan and execute an attack, all playing their role as potential clich√©s, as real living people and making the film better. Of particular note is Ned Eisenberg, as Emad Salem, whom a man who would not be able to skeptical FBI officials would be informed of the plot. <br /> <br /> The film is also well produced. Despite the fact that it is a cable, it does not know the film at all with a low budget, along with its production values, especially in its set and New York locations. The film's exciting cinematography gives the film an almost documentary style at times. When all these elements are combined with a script, it all helps the film to make a sense of reality that makes the events even more annoying. <br /> <br /> The most annoying of his movie is its script. The film's events are true (minus any dramatic license that is always needed) and they are even more shocking afterwards, so they must be when the movie was first shown twelve years ago. The film explains how a group of men could bomb a bomb in the World Trade Center. They did so because of the lack of Arabic translators, government agencies that did not provide each other with information, ignoring the FBI's source and police department instructions, who could not accept the clues. What is even worse is that the inability of researchers to combine points is that many of the same things did not only allow 9.11 attacks, but in some cases (such as the lack of a translator) there are problems that continue today. Even more, cooling is the end that actually happened and looks too prophetic today. <br /> <br /> The Way to Paradise is a movie that should be seen today for a great viewing. Not only has the film worked well and produced, it teaches us a lesson we should learn earlier. Movie Lesson? Those who cannot learn from the past have been condemned. If you find this movie, check it out and learn about it.
