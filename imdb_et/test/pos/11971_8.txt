The bears are similar to Dean Koontz's novel, like Jessica Simpson's rocket scientist. After reading the book, I suggest that you put it as far as possible before watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Viewers are typical of you "The boy meets the dog, the dog is a super-intelligent laboratory lab test, the dog and the boy are a super-intelligent and emotionally disturbed monster created by the same lab, and oh yes, did I mention Corey Haim is a boy, Barbara Williams is her mother, Michael Ironside is one of the bad guys in the government and Sandy is a good dog (called Furface here; book). <br /> <br /> Monster effects are ridiculously cheesy, much of the dialogue is ridiculous, the script rarely makes sense or it is plausible - a good example is the unique adoption of Haim's character about dog intelligence, as if everyone from Fido Street can write messages on a computer keyboard or peel once and twice times if not! Hmm, this must be a puppy, is it? Haim's presentation is enthusiastic, but trembling because it leaves the stupid dialogue with the least skill. Ironside has been bad for many ade films highlighting and this is no exception. He gives the best result of the film, although I am forced to add that the dog (who is a pretty good actor himself!) Arrives in a second second. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a frightening dark movie and more. . . And yet I watched it three times a week. And yet I can't like it. Hey, what can I say I have a taste for junk - and Michael Ironside (not that I've ever tasted Michael Ironside - I'm sure there are laws against it). But every movie that can make me laugh that hard (yes, even involuntarily) can't all be bad. Criticize it with joy, "yes I know it's insulting silly, but I still like it" movie. <br /> <br /> It's hard to evaluate it. On a regular scale, I'm forced to give him D, but on my personal cheese scale, it goes to A. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know. I'm so weird.
