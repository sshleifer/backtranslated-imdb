I do not compare it to Le Placard, which IMHO had more comic moments, but the slow starter Romuald & Juliette definitely kept the whole movie, nicely paced and arrived at a warm-hearted conclusion :) There were many wonderful comedic moments, some brilliant snakes and realistic situations by all parties involved. <br /> <br /> It was usually a French film that faced prejudice and phobias, which in turn put the viewer on its drawbacks! I'm definitely glad it is in my library, and no doubt I'm looking at it again, which is a big movie mark for me.
