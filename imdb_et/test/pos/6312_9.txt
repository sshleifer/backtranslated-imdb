This is a very visual film. This means that the dialogue is rare, almost to the beginning of the mid-term of very quiet films, starting with the opening. <br /> <br /> Mute is, however, an amazing sound track that extends from inconsistent, staccato strokes to a haunting mixture of violins and mixed with songs that sound like dreams. It is a celebration of the ears as much as the eyes, one of the early visuals is the man who walks down the street, so he is interested in his formal wife, that he walks to the post office: one of the consequences of love and love. a metaphor about what's in store ... <br /> <br /> Long ago, another movie? Love Story (1970) - said love never has to say you are sorry. This narrative changes this idea in many ways, starting with the protagonist Titt (Toni Sevillo), apparently a harmless long-term resident, somewhere in Switzerland. Every day, weekly, he sits at the same coffee table, enjoying the passing world, his cigarettes, his coffee, his loneliness? and he has done it for ten years. She sits, she notes, and once a week she's dealing with three very surprising things you can find out when you see this little masterpiece ... <br /> <br /> Love is explored in other ways, the direct opposite of Titta's loneliness and reserved character: two parents the inhabitant is still in love, but the man wants to die impressively with his time, while his long pathetic woman makes him cheat with other cards, one of whom is Titta. Now Titta knows about her looting, their love, her cheating, her excuses for her wife and her whining. How? Surprising and black-comedy ... one of the surprising things I mentioned. <br /> <br /> But this is not really a comedy, although it concerns the idea of ​​human comedy Balzacia: the irony of life and what to do with it. This decision was made about Titta ten years earlier when he left his wife and started living in a hotel. He keeps the contacts from time to time and it is clear that he still loves his children (now grown) and his voice sadness speaks volumes. But there is more than just sad ... <br /> <br /> A life like Titta seems to be completely boring and it is actually from a number of perspectives. Only when we learn what lies beneath his almost post-mortem face, the fear of his situation has struck the eye of the viewer. But not until we know that the female bartender Sofia (Olivia Magnani) is very interested in Titt and gets her way to Titta's interest in her. <br /> <br /> And then things will start to go loose at Titta: she will eventually give up her femininity and will discover the consequences of love again. Ironically, if he does, he will finally understand what he has to do with his life and in the most prominent way. <br /> <br /> I know that all of the above is somewhat secret; But to say more would spoil the movie and the story for you. If you like Italian cinema? I love it! ? I ask you to see it. Action is great; the sound track cools the back; camera work is truly innovative; the direction shows the maturity of the true artist. <br /> <br /> I know I can see this movie again and again ...
