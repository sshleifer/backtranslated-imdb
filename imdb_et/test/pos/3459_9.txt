This is by far one of the best films I've seen for a long time. Top 20 in my lifetime. I laughed more than I have had since the Hitchhiker Galaxy Guide and shouted more than I have seen since the laptop. If you are looking for a touching film without a delicate border ... this is one. It's real and powerful. Look at it and you won't regret it. I was first of all reluctant and I only looked at it because I had to do a school project related to speech. But this movie is so much more. It's life, free and independent of how the world should have been for you. This concerns the shortcomings we all have, which keep us from seeing and what we yearn for, but let everyone else go.
