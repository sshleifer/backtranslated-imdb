Mighty Like A Moose is one of many short films directed by Leo McCarey, who played Charley Chase. What is this! Charlie and her husband both undergo plastic surgery to improve their strangeness to each other. Then they meet at the party and get into each other. Now they can't allow each other to be cheated. This is the uneven assumption of the frantic farce. Vivien Oakland, one of the few comic short drivers with a prosperous career long after the quiet, is ideal for Charley's long nose woman. Charley has a terrible dental teeth that is quickly sent to a dentist. After the police attack the parties for other reasons, practice the thighs, Charley and his wife are trying to avoid each other at home because they fear that changes in appearance will become known. Both are photographed with new party features. Home amusement culminates with Charley, who is trying to teach her no-head-nick with her husband. Of course, this is the new Charley, which his wife understands long before Charley teaches the lesson in faithfulness. This is one of Charley Chase's better efforts. *** 4 stars.
