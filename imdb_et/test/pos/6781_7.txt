Found a copy of this old-time classic with favorable sales. I played this dosbox on vista machine without any problems. It's graphically great, but what do you expect from a 12-year game! The game is a hybrid of the FPS / Adventure game. That's what I call pseudo 3D, you can't look up or down, just spin 360 (guess Wolf3D). Playing the game can be difficult with the very limited range of healthcare pockets and the somewhat moderate interface (Hint: Press I), but overall it is satisfactory. . This game uses a very full video, and although the actor is a b-class and the plot is very dirty, the game feels really horrible. It also does a good job of questioning 'good guys'. Do they really help, or are they just waiting to pull you back? Another great point of sale is the length of the games. There are 18 chapters in memory that range from 10 minutes to potentially hours during the game. My first game took me a week with a serious commitment. <br /> <br /> Date, yes, but if you forgot this year and find $ 5 for it, look at it. Cheaper than film and more fun than most movies.
