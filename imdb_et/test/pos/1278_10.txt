Given the string of successful films by Christopher Nolan, it makes no sense for me to look at his filmography to watch his debut film, which has come back in England in black and white, lasting less than 70 minutes. that contains all the features that have made him a master and storyteller. <br /> <br /> Although short, this film is less cluttered with its curving plot, which leaves you wondering, as the premise does not even lose the story that is quite amazing given the narrative's structure and depth of characterization. As said, we follow the writer wannabe called Bill (Jeremy Theobald), who starts with the usual obsession with the following random people he is attracted to in the voyeurist streets, which could initially be a research before he starts to make his own rules and break them. <br /> <br /> He meets a charismatic Cobb (Alex Haw) who turns out to be a robber with a peculiar sensitivity and modus operandi, and soon finds that he has hanged with him because they go over to burst and enter and speculate about the victim's livelihood, as well as continuing the femme fatale blonde (Lucy Russell), the mobster who rejects her every prepayment. <br /> <br /> There was a non-linear talk about scenes that at first seem to be inappropriate, it sets the film on multiple scenes as you explore how Nolan keeps this tension and intimacy with you when the audience is waiting and wanting more that can be done properly. Here are enough twists that spin the film into a dizzying crescend, where the open ends begin to come together and the story of the star shines. <br /> <br /> It is also amazing how, for the first time, a cheap shot, something that is smart and complex, may be thinking of his own experience when he's hit, because Nolan was involved in every stage of production, from writing to shooting, to production and production. the shoots that have worked with the project during the year can only take place on weekends. I think here is an example of successful filmmakers' humble roots that should be inspirational and inspire new filmmakers there. Now, I am patiently waiting for Christopher Nolan to start, which will come out later this year, with a trailer that is already tempted.
