Generally well done film. There were the parts that prompted me, and there were parts I threw in my hands, but I came up with something more than I went. <br /> <br /> I think the film suffers some serious excess goals. Without breaking it, let me tell you that the obvious references to Ramayana's fire are beyond what this film is about. Ramayana is epic. Not a 200-page book that puts women in India. The film is about two girls who are married to a very distinctive Indian family. While the basic principles of "unwritten laws" in family traditions seem to be conservative in India, let me assure my reader that I have lived (in Delhi for 12 years) whole parts that simply didn't call these watches. I mean some things and some activities are very true, but some other things are just out of the mark. Especially today. <br /> <br /> Delhi is difficult. India is complicated. The director tries to simplify both. And it doesn't work out quite unhappy. <br /> <br /> Why English? Can you imagine a movie about English Indians in English. Or French in English. Seriously beating. Even the servant spoke freely accented in English (though in the "credibility" language, a hint of spoken language). <br /> <br /> But the chemistry of drivers is felt. If you like this hot, it's a movie for you. I think this is the biggest sustainable arm - the story of true real life love. <br /> <br /> If this film was about Radha and Sita, it would be completely labeled from me. And as for them, he could have made a subtle statement. But this movie goes there to say it's what India is, and it's Indian society. And in this respect, it will succeed as much as it fails. Just take everything you see with a pinch of salt. India's dark secret does not appear. Only two girls fall in love. Just like it happens anywhere else.
