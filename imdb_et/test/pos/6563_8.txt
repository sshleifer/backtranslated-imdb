Wow .. I just saw this movie on the Sundance channel and it's really odd. I may not be a film expert, but this is probably the most bizarre film I've seen as a fan of the average movie. <br /> <br /> Who was with it was a great imagination. I'm a bit of a fan of Japanese dramas, and often the actors in the movies are actors (Matsushima Nanako, such as Ring's head, is a big j-drama star.) But it looks like it's the first movie for Kirie and Shuich's imaginators. I have to say that when they are really discussing here, they do a pretty good job. <br /> <br /> Kirie was a very sympathetic character, I thought she was easy to associate. She was kind and affectionate, maybe not the most popular girl, but more beautiful than some other catching girls. He was also pretty beautiful in the classic way. I hope he does more movies, but it has been a couple of years so he has no such plans. <br /> <br /> The end was strange. I'm not giving away, but the disbelief of the rest of the movie was disgraceful. <br /> <br /> Very strange but very creative and unique film. I would recommend it to Japanese horror fans, although I warn you, it is much more strange than Ring. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I would give it to 7.5 out of 10, for originality, for imagination. good character, above average and just intriguing.
