This is OK in the early 80's horror work, where a young girl (Meg Tilly) wants to take her "good two shoes" image and becomes part of a girlfriend called The Sisters. Their initiation for him consists of a mausoleum at night. Too bad a mausoleum is a "final" resting place for some psychological psychologists and he's not dead yet. It seems that this man found a lot of things in his apartment that seized his telinetic practice in the walls, and there are a number of young dead girls in the closet. All the evidence that hitchhiking can be dangerous, so listen to the girls. This man's daughter (Reymar) is more like his father's death and he is facing a man who said he knew Reymar and gave the tape to listen. His wife (Adam West, Batman's celebrity) is laughing and yelling there, not much more. But it seems that perhaps the daughter of Reymar may have some abilities that she does not understand. Anyway, if they have deposited their unfortunate promise to the mausoleum, the rest of the sisters will leave to get things (like masks, leaves, etc.) to come back and scare her nonsense, but there's little doubt about what's going on and they get more than those who they were scared. Because even in death, Reymar is a kind of busy man and he revives many spaces for entertainment. And it also seems to have a prison meal. In general, this is an acceptable horror, nothing is too intense, but not terrible. The Media Blasters DVD also includes a second version of the movie that has been severely cut, I think I just looked at it a little, so I don't know how different it is from the theater edition, but what I saw is "warts and all "presentation. 7 out of 10
