Oz is a TV show that is intense non-stop adrenaline. This exhibition, which is not aimed at a large audience, is specific because its themes are very adult oriented. Obviously, it did not succeed in the mainstream because it was impossible, but was famous for its audience and many famous actors, either marked by the guests or part of the exhibition. <br /> <br /> Oz has a number of fictional stories based on a prison located anywhere in the state of New York. There are many different ethnic groups that have a somewhat equal role in representation. These groups are Muslims, domestic children, Aryans, cyclists, Italians, Latinos, Irish, Christians, gays and others. Some have some kind of relationship with each other, such as cyclists and ares, while Aries are the enemy of many groups such as Muslims and Homeboys. <br /> <br /> Oswald Penitentary (its official name) has a policy of not having too many members of one ethnic group. It is the maximum security prison and regular prison, where sometimes prisoners are sent to exhibitions or called "general population" or "gen pop". The main character of the exhibition is Augustus Hill, who also talks about the story before and after the main segments that cross documentary and biographical. Hill is involved in using a wheelchair as a result of his unknown past. He is part of the "other" group that includes individuals who do not fit into other prison gangs. <br /> <br /> For many groups, they are smaller, able to prevent most of the time from being in conflict with each other. There are few remarkable signs: 1) Ryan O'Reilly is responsible for his fellow Estonians and is somehow always voluntarily involved in deadly activities for the weakest link. 2) Miguel Alvarez is a tracked Latino who is constantly fighting for his popularity in his gang and others. 3) Simon Adebesi is Nigeria, who was the former leader of Homeboys Gang. He is also very physically quite big and strong. These two reasons are why he is one of the most powerful prisoners in Oz. 4) Karim Said is a Muslim and Black nationalist who is very well defined in his opinions and wishes. He struggles for the rights of his people at many levels through the exhibition, his Islamic group, the broader black group, and even fights against all unfair power rules against all groups. It somehow characterizes an identical Malcom X, a famous black lawyer who was also a Muslim. <br /> <br /> In summary, his genre Oz is probably the biggest (fictional prison show or ethnic origin). relationships). If it doesn't seem like your own type of series is likely to be tried, but if it's interesting, it's definitely worth it. The biggest problem with the exhibition is how it creates addiction, some may feel wrong to see a lot of such material. Scientists say it is harmful or not, but in the end it is only a reflection of the world society we live in today. This means that it is an informant and an indicator of the world as an aggressor.
