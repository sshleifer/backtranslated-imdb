I don't know why people considered it uncomfortable or unpleasant; It's not like American Pie or anything. I don't know why people are offended by universal cuttings; Because it is part of a plot, advertising is excusable. <br /> <br /> This is a funny movie with a good dialogue, good exquisite, good story, good morals (which luckily won't be too gentle), great action and a cheesy ending. <br /> <br /> (small spoilers) The basic premise here is the classic story of the Muniz, who lives so much that no one believes him when the wolf (Giamatti) comes along. So she gets her best friend Kaylee (Bynes) and they go and drive Wolf crazy. <br /> <br /> Frankie Muniz may be annoying in other roles, but not like Jason Shepherd. He works perfectly well with the perfect trust of his character, and the apparently inadequate expression at first glance is truly perfect inadequacy. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes. What else to say? Girl got a gift. He is funny, talented, versatile and very, very attractive. (I'm only 6 months older than him. I'll have to get to California soon.) In fact, the best friend was originally a boy, but became a girl as soon as the makers saw Amanda's interest. What works pretty well, because this part would have been quite boring without blessing Bynes' abilities. <br /> <br /> Paul Giamatti is a very talented man. Although some play Marty Wolf as evil and devilish, Giamatti not only made him a jerk, but you, but a LIKEABLE jerk that pulls the screen up instead of deliberately dazzling it. And I doubt that many other participants can also pull the psychological breakdown that Wolf goes through. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a great movie. I enjoyed seeing Jale White mocking her. Loved to see all the little references and such in-built elements of the movie. (one of the party scene guests is the director, Shawn Levy, the other is Bynes' former co-star Kenan Thompson) The beloved saw Amanda in these sets ........ Take the DVD if you can. It has all the great extra materials, and the beautiful Mrs. Bynes is your guide through the menus. :)
