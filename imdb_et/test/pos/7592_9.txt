Although it is a little more than a pleasant 11-minute musical diversion (which is rightly considered "Tabloid Musical"), each Sunday is one of the most famous and valuable documents in the history of cinema, as it gives an invaluable look at two growing talents. the most talented and loved musical performers on the screen: Deanna Durbin and Judy Garland. <br /> <br /> Although they are often referred to as screen tests of MGM-type tests to check adolescents' entertainment from studio contraceptives, Durbin and Garland, whose choices were supposed to be upgraded, this statement is not entirely accurate. By the time each Sunday was produced in July 1936, Deanna Durbin's contract with MGM had already expired and he signed Universal one month earlier, in June 1936. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Durbin's MGM contract allowed the studio to use its services for up to sixty days, provided it had not yet started working with the picture in its new studio. Since Durbin's debut THREE SMART GIRLS wasn't ready to start filming, MGM decided to use his choice and, although officially signed by Universal at that time, Durbin found himself in a MGM party filming this delightful short theme with a male youth singing budding, Judy Garland. <br /> <br /> This, along with Garland's much more extensive professional experience / training (which included performances in several earlier short films), can explain why every Sunday often seems to favor Judy Garland Deanna Durbin, giving Garland more lines and singing songs, while Durbin offers Luigi Arditi's popular classical art song "Il Bacio". It would definitely make sense for MGM to prefer one of its own contracted players in another rival studio. <br /> <br /> Ironically, although Garland's character is most openly active. two girls in this short, Durbin's sophisticated and impulsive "Little Miss Fixit" screen person at Universal, which would push him immediately to the world's superstardom as the world's first "Teen Idol" with his debut mechanism THREE SMART GIRLS, while Garland's "wistful wallflower" younger image would see him as a generally supporting role in the opposite direction of frequent screen partner Mickey Rooney and (ZIEGFELD GIRL). Only when his fifteenth MGM function, 1942 “OUR AND MY GALI (which was also his first adult role), would Garland achieve a true superstar that Durbin had achieved, solo above the title billing and“ solo attraction ”status is therefore completely inaccurate claim that Garland was the attraction of the "superstars" of only two girls, because Durbin achieved this status with the public for almost ten years. before his MGM rival. The literal closure of the word at the time it was signed shows the evidence on the screen strongly that Universal was much more likely to realize Deanna's full superstar potential than MGM was with Judy, and it is worth noting that almost all of the remarkable achievements of Garland in MGM, the superstar's Celebrate vehicles specifically written for his talented articles and invite him to plant his footprints at Graumann's Chinese Theater in order to get his "talent" for recognizing his talent, Deanna Durbin well before his talented MGM. <br /> <br /> In any case, the daily Sunday is an amazing, totally modest musical short, with the plot line (Durbin and Garland using their song talents to save Durbin's grandfather from forced retirement by the city government) organizes his Sunday concerts in the park, predicts both Garland's Let's aa show musicals with Mickey Rooney and Durbin 100 MEN ANGAL D GIRL. Unlike Garland's later BABES movies, the short story never touches a serious story and it follows that his eleven minute driving time is driving. <br /> <br /> Of course, every Sunday's real magic is already a remarkable performance of Durbin's and Garland's talent / screen at the start of his legendary career. Both girls had an outstanding screen presence at an early stage, and they're all natural and unaffected by singers and actors. Garland explodes the screen quite vividly when he literally hits Americanale. When she moves the numbers with the right hands, Judy literally seems to chew when she snatches her mouth and she shines with her intense zeal to show what she can do. In contrast, the presentation of Durbin's "Il Bacio" is much worse and weaker. Although Durbin has made his "classic" choice perfectly suitable, the delivery of Ard's roll is a much more traditional "n song" variety than Garland's physically emotional gear. However, although "miniature god" does not turn Deanna's attention to her eye-catching eyes, dazzling smile and wretched delivery, she just keeps the screen "jazz baby" with Judy and their admirable "Americana" duet short. The finale also regrets that Joe Pasternak could never dream of linking Durbin and Garland to a music film (because Universal refused to borrow "Number One Asset Durbin out"). <br /> <br /> An invaluable document about the talents of two remarkable and completely unique talents. See if you have a chance!
