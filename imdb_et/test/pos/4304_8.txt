This is my favorite Columbo. Martin Landau (great!) Playing twins, one of whom may have been murdered. This Columbo is unusual because the usual murder scene doesn't give you any idea what it did! Peter Falk is an episode written by Steven Bochco (who also wrote "Murder by the Book", my second favorite episode) as usual. Julie Newmar (very underrated) and Jeanette Nolan as a caretaker, which Columbo is just bothering with, are particularly supportive casts. The family names of Martin Landau are here: "Paris". It was Leonard Nimoy's character mission Impossible. Coincidence? Or Steven Bochco's joke?
