Wolfgang Peterson's in the Fire of Fire is cunning and occasionally really white wheels, even if one or two times we feel like the way. How Clint Eastwood, right after (supposedly) closing his western heritage book, would probably not be able to close it with his sparse detective photographs (don't read Blood Work there). But there's more to it because Eastwood's character, here's a hard-bitten, daemon-driven and heavy nail secret service provider, has a bit of a charming side to him, even a more romantic side that no picture can see where he spouted his brand lines. Here are some of the complexities that are not based on the conventional rebellion, and it is worth noting how such a likely back story (not saving Kennedy in the 63rd murder) is somewhat plausible. his person, who mostly hides his wounds. Eastwood goes to the city to make a big presence in the film, and in such circumstances it seems that the character is tailored for him. <br /> <br /> But there is a danger that his role in the film is somewhat common (we still get "Harry" scenes that are smarter - and smart - everyone else in the room, and that they are folded and talked about the top copper, here the head, back), including here defending the president who (wisely) we never see or know at all. Even a romantic subset that is sort of malnourished when laughing at some men would make the picture a little sub-parameter if the second quasi-Dirty Harry aspect didn't come into the picture: an indelible villain. This time, there are some additional Hollywood gaps, but the brillaintly intelligent relationship (almost worthy of the rest of the movie deserves) with the character of "John Booth" played by John Malkovich's Oscar as an appearances as someone who is more described as a predator than an assassin. Eastwood's character may go wrong, but Malkovich wins some of his former cables with his colleagues, being extremely cool and incomprehensible (there is this devastating, shining scene where he kills the bank's customer and his roommate), and when his past has appeared , there is still the element "this devil is with this man" that keeps the audience and Eastwood agent guessing and extra paranoid. This is the classic Malkovich performance that is basically horrible and always measured at the level of madness and professionalism. <br /> <br /> It is also a stylish image of Peterson and the company, alongside the usual points, close to the fruitful realism of Don Siegel's pulp. But Peterson also has a couple of cinematic tricks on his sleeve that I occasionally smiled; at any time when someone makes such a blatant but exciting glimpse of the Vertigo jumps from the roof to the roof, the hero hanging hero, the "twist" - it gives some more tremors to my back. There are also telephone conversations between Eastwood and Malkovich, where we can see the depth of the cat and mouse game, probably the Hithcock ribs. After all, even with all the excitement and brutal dangers and tougher formalities, the image is customary, and everything is fairly understandable in order to give the audience a fine, at least in the mind of the spirit-film. The great leader of Eastwod, Russo, plays a sincere and mature female potential love, and Malkovich is the peak of the butt. There are also some remarkable support roles there and there is a fine studio result. One of the better films of 1993.
