Surprisingly, the British drama is about two very different people who find common ground and especially one of them "bloom". The "Spike" -type (McAvoy), who was born in Deuchennes MD, is housed in a home for disabled people and quickly makes friends with young (Robertson) who have cerebral palsy. Robertson has never known anything at home, but McAvoy is and he is connected and determined to restore to the real world. Together, they succeed in defeating this funny and heartfelt and often heartbeat internal strength to overcome physical deficiencies. Both leaders are terrible, especially Robertson, who must have spent time learning to draw people with disabilities into this difficult role. He appears in almost every scene and acts as an absolute storm. For anyone who doesn't know, they may think that he actually has a CB. Highly recommended.
