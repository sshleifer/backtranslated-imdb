Just a well-made, well-written and wonderfully acted film. Eastwood is a classic, like the grizzled Secret Service Agent Frank Horrigan and Rene Russo. <br /> <br /> Lilly Raines is a partner (and for the sake of love). But the size of the film rests on John Malkovich's shoulder as "Booth." He captures the rage and hatred of this character, but also his humanity strangely. Personally, I think it was his best result and it should have been that Oscar (but I loved Tommy Lee Jones in Fugitive the same year). In general, it's a great movie to see how you want to hire an assassin in the mind and be on the side of the seat. Enjoy !!
