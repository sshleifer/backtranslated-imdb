RENDITION is a film that does not skip Kelley Sane's solid writing and Gavin Hood's direction, which leads us to a story that travels through human journey in hell. Once again, Meryl Streep is a CIA with a convincing role today and with great performances at Reese Witherspoon, Jake Gyllenhall and Alan Arkin cast top performers with Middle Eastern actors who add a story to reality. In RENDITION, you see how "terrorism can increase terrorism" and when the film progresses by linking the story to what's playing in the Middle East, reality is on the screen. External shots increase the intensity of the story, and Peter Sarsgaard is doing an excellent job of playing an assistant in "politics" on how to conduct American politics. It is too bad that there is no larger audience for this film, because together with ELAH VALLEY and LIONSETE SHEETS, RENDITION plays an important role in showing the audience how to fight for democracy and to protect it seriously.
