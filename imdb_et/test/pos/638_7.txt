If you like intercourse, it's a movie. The fact that Marina Zudina represents the resin increases her accident and increases her intercourse. The appearance of Alec Guinness was nice but not included in the film. I'm not sure if Evan Richard's part as Andy Clarke was trying to add a little humor or just had to be a bumblebee idiot. I thought the cinema was great. It not only added quality of production, but also added value. The bath that was seen in slow motion with water droplets was great. The scene where the knife comes down and then switches to Andy Clarke is also very well done. I would call it generally good entertainment
