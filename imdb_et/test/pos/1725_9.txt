I am a next generation person ... I have never seen an original doctor who I've heard of this series that drove a big fan base in the past and was still in the 21st century; a new "doctor" who started in 2005, but for those who live here in countries like me, we see it pretty much as new episodes on a sci-fi channel or BBC America; from the first season, we introduce a new player, Rose Tyler (Billie Piper), and a rather cool new doctor, played by Christopher Eccelson (an erroneously written surname gave harm). these two go on many amazing and very dangerous missions to save the world ... every time and then they are with their peers rose from their former boyfriend to the current Jack Thomson (who can now see spin off) in Torchwood). for two seasons, the pace is almost right ... the stories can be extremely strange to the fastest packed pace, but both have their own rollercoster, which is a very memorable theme. br /> <br /> In the second season, it becomes different and changing and new doctor (David Tennant) continues to fight to save the world with rose and from that moment on there may be some that say that part of the season was not so good, but I have disagreement and it was sad to see the part of the rose and the doctor, but it leaves the opening " companion's role in Martha (played by very sexy Freema Agyeman), who helps to continue the struggle to save mankind ... The 3rd season is now more on action / adventure level and sometimes emot ionic but not as much as in the first two seasons; here's the relationship between the doctor and Martha, but the attractiveness can be rushed from time to time and it turns out that he doesn't rise to Tyler that you experienced him in your first two seasons and not in the third season. a little uncomfortable it was for me that you use the ascend and his options and now you see someone who sometimes does not ask the doctor on an emotional level, but it all makes the viewers very exciting, which keeps you on the edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> All this is one of the most exciting rides of the TV show I would give more, but there are also some bugs for this show that I can hardly mention this reason, but only one does what is the doctor and Martha's relationship are rushed and not leveled to feel you; I've seen some good shows on British television, but it's far from the coolest sci-fi adventures for the old and new generation, but you don't have to accept your world ... to step into the jail and join the adventure.
