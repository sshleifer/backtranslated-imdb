I had read the movie and thought it would be nice to be happy on Saturday night. I didn't expect anything big, I thought it would be bulky, but hopefully it's not a bad experience. I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was perfect, most of the actors were exceptionally good and flowed well. Ash Christian was perfect, his ability to change the uncomfortable moment of something that was touching was great to see. He could have changed that character, which we all saw before, but instead of stereotypes and focused on character intelligence. It was wonderful to see Jonathan Caouette again, I didn't know what he was doing after Tarnation. Ashley Fink is a pearl, a great young character actress who hopefully gets more work. <br /> <br /> The film has moments that could have used some work, but not a bad time at the cinema. My friend described it as a gay-Angus / Napoleon dynamite, but that's more. This is a characteristic study of what is in a small town for homosexual growth, pain exists, but the humor of this pain (only age can be made clearer) is greater. I look forward to seeing Ash Christian, Ashley Fink and Jonathan Caouette soon.
