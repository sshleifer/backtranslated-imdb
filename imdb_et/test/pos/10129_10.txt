Radio is the real story of a man who did what he felt in his heart, was the right thing. The viewer is forced to think about what he would have done. The reluctance that coach Jones and Radio both had to face was both tragic and predictable. People didn't understand; nor did they want to understand. Finally, the fact that circumstances forced people to understand and appreciate so much more than before. Radio is a young person with a mental challenge who understands very little, in addition to the three most important things that we forget too mature: intuition, compassion and love. Coach Jones is a high school teacher who cannot ignore a minor who is simply trying to play bad cards in the best possible way. It was sad how coach Jones and Radio met. The practical jokes that frightened life was enough for you to strictly punish, not just the guys involved, but every boy who knew what was going on and did nothing. On the positive side of the impact, however, the case brought about friendship that would affect so many lives in such a way that most of us believe it only happens in films. This film is a fairy tale in real life and it must not be missed. Ed Harris had his usual shine. Gooding was flawless. Radio is inspiration.
