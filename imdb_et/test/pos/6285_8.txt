When I first saw that the movie started playing on TV, I was just a new pauly on the shore, as a joke comedian, who really wore stocks this day. I still decided to watch it and I was impressed. fresh air breath on the shore. in this film, he plays crawling with a college advisor who probably also needs his own counselor. carla gugino, who is undervalued, plays becca who is a "farm girl" in the downtown with a simple family and film-clich√© boy-travis. when he goes to uclale, he meets with indexing and turns him into a bubbly blonde in California. he decides to bring the interruption of Thanksgiving home. if travis decides to offer, becca needs attention. he then investigates that everyone would believe he is already busy. this leads to crawling, which causes becca's parents' romance, kindly to their brother and even to the local bar of dancers to get a little loose. I'm not going to reveal it, but I liked it. anyway, don't rent it if you want a nice performance; rent it if you want to laugh at your ass and enjoy the humor of the 90s.
