Franklin forgiveness is the best film I've seen for years. The actor was fantastic, especially Mari Blackwell, who was truly remarkable as Peggy Lester. He brought Peggy with life with an incredible skill and made him as real as my neighbor. I also liked Robertson's role as Dean's father ... he is a real professional and he has managed to take even the most intimate scenes with rare love. All the cast performances were very good, great, but Peggy's role played by Blackwell made the film. The cinema was beautifully made and it was the most impressive. The only criticism I have to offer is the weakness of the scenes that have ended, which were too pulled out, repetitive, and slightly too wrong. I would have liked it to end with a remark of forgiveness .... but despite this mild defect, it is very worthwhile that all those involved in doing this look and applaud.
