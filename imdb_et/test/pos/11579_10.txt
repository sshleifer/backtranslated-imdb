My friend asked, "Isn't this movie to be e-euthanasia? Is this movie a mistake to conclude that most quadriplegics want to end their lives?" Interesting questions. <br /> <br /> As far as I can see (correct me when I am wrong), there is only one quadriplegic who wanted to end his life at sea. Think about Ramón Sampedro in this movie. It's the one who wants to die. He fights for his right to decide his own death. He speaks for himself, not for the other quadriplegics. Although his pioneering work may, depending on his point of view, prove useful or harmless to quadriplegics, his primary goal is personal. But one thing this film does (my opinion anyway) is that it forces us to ask the viewers questions that my friend put so briefly. <br /> <br /> After the first sea view, the home walked in contradictory blur. I tried to accept this amazing idea; why Ramón would die? Considering the love, care, and sacrifice that Ramon has unconditionally showered by the people around him, why did he deliberately grasp the decision? Then, at my second look, Ramon and a lawyer lady reached a common sense in my consciousness. It threw up a telling observation: "... complete dependence is at the expense of closeness." Most people want such proximity. Of course, how much we appreciate such "needs" depends largely on the individual. <br /> <br /> As a person with biased family sensitivity, I felt strongly with the film's custodians. Why can't Javier be the victim and the love of his family and friends? Is he all blind? I dont think. The miracle of the sea from the inside is its insightful imagination of a very humanitarian war. If we are faced with a reasonable but incapable of close guardianship with a peaceful, conscious and rational intention to die, then what is it right to do? Do you care and keep that love alive, with will, with a divine gesture? Does it show the value of our love? Or does it simply soothe our "selfish" fears for irreplaceable loss? Is there so much understanding that caregivers are given, whether their invalid accusations, if they were to make themselves dependent on others to survive, would be a neglected act of sacrifice? Rhetorical or not, how much is "dignity" worth to an individual? Does a dignity or right live (or die) with dignity? If we really care and love people, should we also respect their possible decisions in life (like death)? The questions that the film might have asked, the answers to what I can't offer. <br /> <br /> By wishing to intellectually limit the benefits of pro-life or pro-choices, we are launching the risk that the gray sea will not be taken into account, most often among people, carers, and caregivers. That is why Sea Inside tried to present a delicate but complex relationship between them. Intuitively, this film understands one thing; The nature of "sacrifice" is never one-sided. In this warfare, we should try not to win arguments, but to closely monitor and hopefully determine who the "stronger" party is to sacrifice it. <br /> <br /> Sea Inside is a soothing film. It opened my eyes to things I didn't want to see. And I'm grateful for that.
