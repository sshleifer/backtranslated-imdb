... I can't believe I was instantly connected to this show, having seen the first scene where I was deep in it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, first of all, the boys are hot, Cappy, Evan, Calvin, Fischer, Cappy, Heath, Cappy and so on. Second, girls are cute, sexy, smart and are not afraid to invite them to females. I like it. At the same time, they do not make meaning and greed, but realistic. <br /> <br /> Third, relationships are so great, especially Casey and Cappy. Recently, every show has been going a long way from the original, and people reach someone who wasn't even in the first season. The relationship between Cappy and Casey is a true love that lasts. They loved each other over the years and it didn't end when the guest star appeared. <br /> <br /> In today's world, it may be unbelievable that two people love each other for a long time, but that happens. And people define each other in college, so I knew exactly who I wanted to be in college. Just like Casey and Cappy. I hope there are many more examples of this story and I hope we will see the relationship between CASEY and CAPPY now that they can stay together, thanksgiving ... Love this show
