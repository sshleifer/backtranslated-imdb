In the growing comic book movie genre, Blade is the most important and most trusted (generally) source material .... whereas the character has a history of almost 30 years since his debut when a copy of Marvel's Grave in Dracula, the writer took almost all the characters and draws the history of comics. Although the changes were inevitably made, the finer points of the film move over to criticism. Don't let anyone in your friends have a different one: Blade is one fine movie. If it seems too "comic book" for you, Stanley Kubrick snobs there, that's because it should be. Handle it, but don't take it.
