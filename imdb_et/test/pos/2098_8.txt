This film was made by Daiei Studios, known for its Gamera films. It's about a samurai lord murdered by some of his own men. He claims his throne, forcing his former two children to flee in the forest, where they hide a huge stone shape near 10 years. At the time of the passing, the new Samurai lord proved to be very cruel and merciless towards the villagers and the valley. Therefore, it seems that the only hope of good people is the stone shape that is where the spiritual god sleeps; they want God to help them. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This samurai movie brings us traditional Japanese aspects, including sword fighting, geisha, and worshipers. This is a great and powerful story of survival and hope that the protagonists are trying to triumph over pure evil. It's full of excitement, especially those parts where kids fight to stay hidden when the evil warlord has them. In addition, it has a beautiful cinematic art, where the landscapes of the village and the landscape have immediately reminded Japan of ancient times. <br /> <br /> Like most samurai movies like "The Seven Samuari" and "The Last Samuarai", this movie is not pure, sometimes graphical. The film has several disturbing scenes. That's why it's not a casual sci-fi movie. Yet it is strong and powerful and gives the message that a good-natured person can overcome all opponents, as shown in this movie, even a young innocent girl can silence the wrath of the divine god. The demonic god, known as Daimajinina, the enemies and all that stand on his way, will immediately remind you of Godzilla or Gamera. In general, it is a powerful and serious but promising film. <br /> <br /> Be careful with your samurai sword. You wouldn't want to rub Daimajin cages. <br /> <br /> Class A
