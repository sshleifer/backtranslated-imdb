The "gymnast" opens in a short frame and a short scene, revealing it from letters and messages over time. Stock editing is accompanied by a beautiful and simple score. This intimate approach is great when you feel that you are discovering the journey as the characters are. <br /> <br /> Free approach is also its lack; there are some scenes that are confusing because they do not have enough context. Some decisions have been made by those who seemed to be a flip until I looked at the interviews on bonus materials. I'm glad I did, because the actors' descriptions of their motivation gave me a lot more understanding of the film in general. <br /> <br /> Apart from the story itself, it was wonderful to see women so comfortable and strong in their bodies. The shooting was very tasteful; very factual. There is a feeling that we see a story of love and a biography, not a voyeuristic splitting film. Physics of athletes - their reality - is a great contrast sometimes with the nature of an ethereal plot. <br /> <br /> Not a movie I will soon be watching, because the story is simple but its delivery is powerful enough to stay with me for a long time.
