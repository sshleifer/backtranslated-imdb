Uzumak has a very unique story and I never look at spirals the same way. Not really a backbone, this film has a dark fear, an acidic trip seems like it. Was it just for me in certain parts or did you see vortex visuals? The camera shots are interesting and the film will make your imagination wild. The bizarre supernatural feeling of this movie draws you just as the title suggests. Acting well and setting the city at first is wrong. <br /> <br /> It can take a few views to sink. Great trippy movie.
