A bunch of human body sleeps on a red pillow. It's a naked meat that is "Little Joe", a New York hustler who lives with his bisexual wife and child's baby. The film is followed by a day in her life after she has awakened in the awakening of her wife, demanding that she go out and do a traditional male - be a feeder. But he wants to use bread to pay for his new girlfriend's abortion. Certainly not here in a traditional family ... <br /> <br /> After playing with the child, Joe will hit the streets. Clients come close and fast: a normal gay man who wants to meet him again because they work well together, an old English classic scientist who pays $ 100 to see Joe like an old Greek athlete; the woman's topless dancer who blows Joe flaunt for rape; an aging gym bunny who does not think what he and Joe are doing together is a must. After a hard day's work, Joe returns home exhausted, but his wife and girlfriend. He's going to sleep when they harp and undermine him. <br /> <br /> Meat is exciting because it takes on the traditional classic mainstream structure - it has a temptation leader (money for abortion) and a confrontation and resolution structure (albeit very amazing), even a highly motivated protagonist, and then focuses on those people for the routine of the daily routine, which are quite common to themselves, but extraordinary to most "mainstream" people. Everything looks very authentic and natural - the actor is hard to see, the actors are so full of their roles - but the whole thing is a piece of clever artifice - a beautifully drawn portrait or a complexly carved shape. Directed by Morrissey, each plant is carefully planted, each meeting of the human body becomes a packaged product, but with such a shrewd hand that you almost do not notice it. Spouse's "Packages" On Joe's sexual organ, the old British discourage the long-established order of classical beauty that created the creature of human flesh and poetry, friends of stripper transvestites offer women, reading the Hollywood magazine, where "real" women are packaged as products; The gym bunny buys Joe's friendship and affection, thinks that artificial porn is real and can't say as we can't that Joe makes for his friendship and closeness to cash. The film itself is a cinematic realism, but what we might be discussing here is the fine art or concept of early art. <br /> <br /> Genius - a word that is not used lightly - Morrissey had to find a way to take Warhol's artistic complaints into film making, which was interesting, but boring like hell, and make them marketable products that are still the most interesting cinema artworks that have ever been made - commercial jars that are labeled "Flesh" and "Trash" and "Heat" with the product designation "Andy Warhol", which sells the idea of ​​the product as much as the product itself. However, as you have crossed Morrissey's cynicism, his ability to maintain the highest standards and depth of meaning remains. Permanent, which seems to be a camera flash, constantly draws attention to what is witnessing, but you get into the illusion the same way - Flesh is definitely one of the most extraordinary cinematic magic to listen to the audience.
