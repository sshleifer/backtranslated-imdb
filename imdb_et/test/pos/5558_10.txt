Farscape rules! In my opinion, it is very close to Babylon, although there are only 7 main characters in the series (including the spacecraft). Humor is great and writers can show interesting things, although much happens to the ship. <br /> <br /> Farscpaes really love and appreciate not using CGI for an alien. characters or if they do, it is unnoticeable. They use these lovable, dirty rubber animated dolls that are very similar to the original dolls used in Star Wars. <br /> <br /> Farscape is something you definitely want to explore if you haven't already.
