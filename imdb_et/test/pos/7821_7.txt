I watched this movie because of Costas Mandylor and Lauren Holly. I adored them with Picket Fences, so it was a treatment to see them again. It was never the best film, but it was lovely. Very predictable, but sometimes pointlessly fun movies are just what I need. </p> </p> <p> </p> I loved it when one of them broke down. I bet Costas and Lauren still had great chemistry that they had Picket back to Fences, and I was swimming when they kissed that movie. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't have watched it again, but it was a great night for one night.
