First I have to say that I love this movie. <br /> <br /> It was the first movie I saw from director Micheal Haneke and I was impressed that the good direction was good! <br /> <br /> Haneke certainly knows how to act as actors. I also found the Haneke scenario interesting. First of all, you saw a woman who is very straight and seems to be a good piano teacher and is very loved and respected by all her companions. Then you realize that she has a mother who has contrast and is too much in her life. Now you know he's been spoiled for having emotional problems, but you don't know exactly what. And then you get to his dark side, but his dark side is only when the student falls in love with him. He can no longer control. <br /> <br /> Roles are very complicated and difficult to play, but Isabelle Huppert is wonderful in her role and she deserves the recognition she had at Cannes. Benoit Maginel is also very confident, but Huppert is a little shady. <br /> <br /> One thing I did in the scenario is how Magimel's character is not very reliable. He's too talented! It is rare that a person is a piano virtuoso, but gives most of his time to play hockey and learning ... It thinks it's a weak spot, but only a small mistake. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie once so I can't make a very complete criticism because I didn't analyze the movie. I like what I saw! so I'll give the movie 8.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Oh yes ... as in the end, Haneke showed that he really wanted to shock his audience. Motivation that doesn't think it's necessary to make movies, but Haneke does it with style and precision, so his film is better than, for example, Baise-Moi. <br /> <br /> Vince
