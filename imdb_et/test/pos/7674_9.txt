Our spring choral concert was given the solo "Summertime" in the fifth grade. Since then, I got a big price for Gershwin's music. I love Gershwin's haunting melodies of this opera. Back when I was in fifth grade (around the age of 10), I was able to practice LP and also love music. I suggest you see this movie and when you get a soundtrack, you get it - you can sometimes find it on eBay - old, used LP. I've searched and searched to find a soundtrack from the CD. Its songs are great musical arrangements, and I really want it to be purchased on a CD and would like to have a movie restored and put on a DVD. This is really a great job I think the current and future generations will enjoy and benefit from. Some may think the film is slow and boring, but I think it is the opposite. Although Poitier and Dandridge called musical voices, I think the voices fit well on the face and personalities. A person's speech and singing voice can be quite different. Porgy and Bess, and the song in this opera, always have a special meaning for me.
