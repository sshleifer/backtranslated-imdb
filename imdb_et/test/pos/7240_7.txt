Agatha Christie's stories are often overlooked by her progressive and conservative attitude to a number of issues - from the role of women to the influence of tradition to people's belief in supernatural. You can mark many of these subtypes in "Nemesis" - but you can also find a good old-fashioned intriguing secret that keeps you in the dark for most of the length. Also raising the "Nemesis" to other series ("They do it with mirrors", "4:50 from Paddington, etc.") is the fact that in decisive moments before and after the killer's revelation you can actually feel the relationship. And finally, Jane Booker is welcome to watch my body at any time. (***)
