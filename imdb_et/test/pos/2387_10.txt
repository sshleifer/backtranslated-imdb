I loved Eddie Monroe. The film had all the components that interest me while watching it. I especially loved the plot twisted along the road and a surprising end. Craig Morris has both the look and the talent of Brad Pitt. Her blue eyes reminded me of Paul Newman. Fred Carpenter took this film to a new level. Music scores, cinematography, talent, locations, and script were fantastic. I loved seeing some of my favorite music by Eddie Monroes. Fred Carpenter is an incredibly talented and talented director. He gives his job 200%. The film has an excellent texture. I hope there is Eddie Monroe 2. I would like to see how Nicolette finds out after she has unexpected money. Fred Carpenter's Eddie Monroe is a Hollywood level.
