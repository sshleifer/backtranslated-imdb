So many literary adjustments are disappointing. There are many reasons for this, but it is usually necessary to reduce the complex novel of the scenario. The dead is unusual - it was supposed to be "padded" because the short story is a small, relatively short pearl. In fact, it may be the best English story. In a beautifully equipped language, he tells Gabriel Conroy that his life and the lives of so many people around him are led by dead memories. Even his many years old husband loved a man who is now dead more than his. <br /> <br /> It was always difficult to bring such a short story into the cinema. John Huston did a great job. He never tempted to play it or use fancy technique to expand the story. It is simple and true, with outstanding effect. The only small step is using music with a devastating final soliloquy. <br /> <br /> His rare truth is that the literary masterpiece film version is a masterpiece, but I think it's fair to use the concept of this movie. It's not bravura cinema, but it's simple and clean - I always think of Ozu movies when I think dead, its purity and simplicity and deep wisdom.
