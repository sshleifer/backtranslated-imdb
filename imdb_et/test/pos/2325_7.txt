This is a very little appreciated, very little appreciated film. As mentioned in previous posts, this movie has a somewhat loose and very unreliable script, but you find that you say "Who cares?" milk (or your chosen drink) during your nose. This was indeed due to the rare mix of participants in sync. Although Kelsey's grammar is clearly a talented actor (the reference to "Frasier", this film), supportive actors / actors play their role very well. In an interesting way, I found how they threw a part of Duane Martin that blew the "big game" into a navy basketball team; If anyone of you is a basketball fan, you remember Martin "White men can't jump" and "Rimo above" and you'll find that Martin had a short stint with the NDS with Knicks. Nice how they threw in incredible character attributes like this. The similar character of Rob Schneider was the perfect compromise on the calm behavior of grammar. Lauren Holly played the gutsy-sexpot-with-a-brain well enough that you wanted her to succeed. This is a movie that makes you laugh even when you have seen it many times ... ... the comics in this movie are definitely the last. I still laugh 12 years later. <br /> <br /> "Is this one of my chickens?" "Uhhh ... no. It's a Caribbean parrot." "Well, don't let her fly ... it's dinner." "Arrrrr ..... arr."
