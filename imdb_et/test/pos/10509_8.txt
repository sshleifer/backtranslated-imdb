I don't understand why everyone is bombarding it so much. I thought it was a very fun time, but unfortunately it wasn't popular enough. Believe me, I've seen a lot worse. If you want a bad movie, look at the blood pike or alien dead or something. So, what is the usual fare, but better than most. And it's traceable. This film also has one of the best soundtracks I've heard. Some music is very tense. And death scenes are also cool. We see a very bloody body in the bath with the words SOLD written in the blood, and we can also cool the beating with a toilet piston! with a razor! It was a fun 80's vintage that is definitely worth your time regardless of what others say about it.
