In an era when almost everyone does this on a DVD (I hope to see my mother being a car collector every day), this film has been neglected. In the 60s, there are numerous stupid comedies, as well as many other eras that have received at least the notorious DVD treatment. It was not even published in the VHS for talents involved in making my knowledge (Arthur Hiller, Eli Wallach, Anne Jackson, Murray Shisgal (later writing to Tootsie), even Dustin Hoffman in his debut). This is obviously a product of the sixties, but that's all it has been since then. All movies reflect their time when they were made. It appeared in the same year as the president's analyst, another absurd masterpiece. This film was finally published on DVD and developed a culture. This movie has many memorable strange, funny and terrible moments. Of course, it is painted with a wide stroke and it has stupid music, but it is part of its charm. It creates its absurd universe. If someone responsible for producing DVDs in Columbia Pictures (I believe Columbia released it) will take surveys for new releases that will be my voice.
