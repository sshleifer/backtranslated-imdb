Perry Mason: The Fatal Fashion Case in New York Perry and Della Street, receiving the American Bar Association Award. An unknown trial record should admit. Anyway, Della, a friend of fashion director Diana Muldauri, is being arrested for rival murder, Valerie Harper, and actually Raymond Burr and Barbara Hale are confronted with the confrontation between the two in the dining area. <br /> <br /> Two rivals have a thing that makes Hedda and Louella look like schoolgirls. Of course, Harper has many other people who liked him so much. <br /> <br /> The same offender also ran a fashion designer who might have been exposed to an individual. It throws Perry with his trusted lawyer, William Moses, with a mobile. It seems that the designer was a mob boss who also wants to find out some justice in his usual way. One thing I didn't get is when Moses and mobile Robert Robert Clohessy are pursuing a criminal. I cannot believe that the police did not act forcefully. Of course, Clohessy has access to sources that police officers simply do not have. <br /> <br /> But the best part of this particular masonic action is Scott Baio, who is rather young, full of himself. Raymond Burr tells how he investigated all his cases and was waiting for him to beat. Foolish Boy. <br /> <br /> In fact, my favorite scene is Burr and Baio. Baio wanted to reopen his case and to the witness, and was ready and ready for the precedents. Burr tries to get him out of the guard and says he has no objections to the new witness, and then he's going to demolish the witness during cross-checks. Absolutely priceless price. <br /> <br /> Scott Baio is the best thing in this Perry Mason movie and he should be seen alone if nothing else.
