Martin Ritti's skillfully staged film, drifting and anti-hero John Cassevetes lands in NY, to escape the tragic incident in his life, where he killed his brother in a car accident and drove to the army at AWOL. <Br /> <br /> Cassavetes, which is always an intense actor, shows the film in delight. I'm surprised that Montgomery Clift didn't get that part. <br /> <br /> Ruth White is her mother and makes a good deal in two scenes on her phone. <br /> <br /> communicates with Sidney Poitier as two dock-related jobs. Immediately, Jack Warden, a bully and villain in this movie, dislikes him and tragedy when Poitier tries to protect his friend. <br /> <br /> Ruby Dee, in this movie, plays Poitier's wife and is a great scene where she calls Cassavet to discover her husband's killer. <br /> <br /> This is definitely an interesting film of moral values ​​and lonely society. Against the background of the lease, the film shows the right mood.
