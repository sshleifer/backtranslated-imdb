I hit the whole movie while the channel was surfing, and it was blown away. It was broadcast in a lesser known short film program here in Australia. <br /> <br /> It's been a long time since I've had such a movie, especially so short. <br /> <br /> Story Power, Functional and Amazing Cinematography Quality ... wow. If available, it would be very valuable for my DVD collection. <br /> <br /> I am undoubtedly impressed and look forward to the next movie by Joshua Leonards. <br /> <br /> Exceptional experience is 10/10
