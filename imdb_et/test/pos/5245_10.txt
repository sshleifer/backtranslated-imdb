For the first time, I saw a great trail in the Vienna Film Museum. Immediately I was surprised by the high quality of the images as well as the unusual format and the beautiful details. Who has ever seen such a documentary style with western John Wayne? And there is so much time, you can actually look around the screen, see so much! One is always grateful that the scenes are often static, because each single picture is so well drafted and you want to take it. Even the actor is good and fits well. The long time is wonderful, you don't want to miss that moment!
