The giant demons "Gentlemen" capture the voice of the population from Sunnyda to steal human hearts without screaming. Giles finds that, according to legend, these creatures are destroyed when the lady screams, but Buffy and her friends, including Riley, have to fight for the monsters' unspeakable. <br /> <br /> "Hush" is definitely the best episode of Buffy's fourth season until now. I have a lot of humor and funny situations. Spike is fun, romance between Xander and Anya is cool, but I loved the "intense" dialogue between Buffy and Riley. The Gothic scenario of the final fight "Gentlemen" resembles the environment of "Dark City". My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "SilÃªncio" ("Silence")
