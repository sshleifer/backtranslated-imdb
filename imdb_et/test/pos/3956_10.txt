I had the opportunity to watch Blind Spot in Barcelona and I enjoyed it enormously. I thought it was one of the most fascinating movies I had seen for a long time. One of the best points of the film was unexpectedly and superbly filmed behind great places for their fresh faces and great actors. The three heroes on the screen share the chemistry that runs across the film, so it's so exciting. They are set by outstanding landscapes, which are marked by such an original eye (DOP's work is just great), which makes you feel that you discover them for the first time. The natural extension is the desert of the desert, and even the scenes shot on the streets of Los Angeles or San Francisco. The story speaks smoothly through all these beautiful settings to bring you to the bitter sweet end, being the perfect tip for this perfect journey. The film itself is a master. Qualified use of innovative resources (like Danny's memories to stitch the film) compares these rare and so enjoyable hand-made works. Blind Spot achieves the desert nature that takes you to a universal common ground where one of us can feel both the discoverer and the local.
