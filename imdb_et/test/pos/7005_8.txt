The scene of opening this movie is pretty unbelievable. I've seen a number of sci-fi movies with a great special effect, but my roommate and I looked at each other after the opening sequence and he clearly said "sensory overload". The plot of the movie is quite simple, but the nice thing about this sci-fi movie is that it allows the audience to find out most of the technology instead of wasting time to explain it "finely". The creatures of this film are also very interesting. You don't see them very well until about two-thirds of the way through. In general, it's a very fun movie.
