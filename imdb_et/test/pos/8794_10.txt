This movie is too good for words. It's so incredibly big and funny and alive. You just know that by looking at it, the one who wrote it, DEFIANTLY felt how Jip and his friends are doing it through the movie. It was at one point in my life and I would hope that I came home to see human traffic ever before I even think about going to sleep. I think you just love those characters and their lifestyle. Of course, this film would not be older than 16-22 years old. There's nothing wrong with this movie and it's stitching to you. It has no specific story. The general idea is to have a weekend in London for older teens and what they get. The places they go, the people they meet, the drugs they take, and the experience they have. You have to get this movie on a DVD that you never just looked at, you have to do it !!!
