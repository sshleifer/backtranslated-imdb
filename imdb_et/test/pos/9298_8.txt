Lets face it, Australian TV is mostly terrible, but it's a real diamond tough that enough people don't look. The Chassis team, who is making a satirical newspaper and CNNN, is trying something new by mixing live comedy, pre-recorded sketch and political satire into one example, filmed in front of a living audience, such as Rove, but funny. They love to create disagreements and this will cause some of the funniest moments, especially Chris tells his wife that he lives on breakfast TV and Julian, who gives Saddam Heusein a novelty check to the AWB leader. It must be one of the funniest Aussie shows from the Micallef program.
