I still can't believe that computer graphics can create 3D images. At the moment I heard it from my friends in the forum, I swear that I'm going to look at myself. <br /> <br /> I managed to watch this part in a colleague's mall where they had DVDs from many Adventists and showed it for sale on a laptop. Of course I was glad, but it was not enough. Then I went to YouTube to look for a movie. Everything I came up with was a music video dedication. Until this fateful day ... I found it. I looked at it carelessly because I knew I had to watch or otherwise call me a loser. <br /> <br /> More about me about the movie. Just when Final Fantasy VII wasn't enough, they made it a movie! My most favorite was the end of Sephiroth's life. Cloud OmniSlash couldn't be better. But I wouldn't break your show completely. You have to look at it yourself !!! Get DVD Now!
