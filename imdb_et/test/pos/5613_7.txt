I enjoyed this movie thoroughly ... and I watch it from time to time. I have used it in music classes at the school I teach. Children seem to enjoy it, even though they want it to be colorful. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is for me, who grew up after Heifetz was dead. Master the violinist works for your craft! I was surprised when the story was up to date. Although references to "reform school" are outdated. A boy whose father was dead and raised by his mother and stepfather .... most of our children are raised by today's masters, although the film seems to be cruel to most stepparents. I get very angry when her mother does not take her and protects her actions against her father. <br /> <br /> Music choices are also hard to believe. I find it unbelievable that a child who is about 8 years old can play "Minute Waltz" or that a 13-year-old girl could sing aria Rigoletto. <br /> <br /> Moreover, it is really fun, a good movie and I recommend it. I want it to appear on the DVD.
