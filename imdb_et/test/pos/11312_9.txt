This movie was a rebellion that fun "Madonna - Truth or Dare" in all the right places. I love Madonna and I love Julie Brown. How can I ask more. The looting of Julie's "Vogue" titled "Vague" was hysterical. "Kelly LeBrock thinks she's great, she's just cold burgers on paper." "Brooke Shields, Dawber, Pami Personality"! I could have died! And just wait until you see what he can do with watermelon !!
