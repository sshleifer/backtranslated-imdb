I really enjoyed this movie. I have a real sense of justice and "an eye on the eye," and this film also brings it to the labs. Glenn Ford is being offered a very low price for a ranch for his ranch; then one of his ranch is beaten and strikes "to help him sell it". When the pasture's hand dies and the sheriff refuses to do something, Ford first seems reluctant to do something by warning his men not to take things into their hands. But that's what he's going to do. I knew this film was in the fire when she entered the cabin, and was facing a boy (Richard Jaeckel, one of my very favorite badminton characters) who had killed his hand; after exchanging a gentle dialogue with him, Glenn Ford strikes his face and lets him die. Such a pure addition to justice, he kills that guy with a gun that was part of his murdered cow. In short order, Ford is being treated to burn his pasture so that his men are justified in keeping other crew members on board; then Ford and his men put down all the horses and cattle of the big bad beaches; then they show up and burn the outbuildings and a big fancy house on the ground. Talk even for a long time. There are many actions in this movie. The story is more than that, but I just suggest you watch the movie. Glenn Ford was someone who showed again and again what happens when someone misunderstands, and I really enjoyed watching him fairly old-fashioned.
