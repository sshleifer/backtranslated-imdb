For Greta Garbo's first talking picture, MGM wisely chose Eugene O'Neill's Pultizer Award winning 1921 ANNA Christie game. <br /> <br /> Producers also wisely supported Garbo with not one but two original Broadway Cast members (George Marion as Anna's father, Chris and James T. Mack as Johnny Priest - transmuted for "Johnny harp" films, not to offend). <br /> <br /> This little change is interesting. Like too many films accused of (those who want to be MOVIES to be MOVIES and ignore their origins) to be "a little more than filmed productions," the problem is not a game but a filmmaker who would not be more faithful to real estate. Dilution of the work of a big cinema stage that does not break anyone and would not open it because they could lose too many of the features that made the object the first time it was filmed. Luckily, the studio honored both O'Neill and Garbole ANNA Christie to live the traditionally destructive process perfectly adapted to Frances Marion's general-sensitive screen customization. The miracle of miracles, Marion even promises the POINT of the place where Garbo Anna shows her past "on the farm" to the man she wants to marry badly, and the father who sent her there in tact! What the Door League must think about it! <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with starting games has always been that Chrise's friend Marthy tends to get away from the first act and then disappears from the last two to allow Anna to step in - the two sides of a really good woman don't always know. <br /> <br /> Perfectly Cast Marie Dressler (who had also cut her teeth on Broadway before going to Hollywood) is the perfect balance for Garbo Anna in this area, and the fast moving film in just 90 minutes doesn't let us get too much time to stay - one of the few atmospheric benefits shown in the original, as well as beautifully described - AND the scriptwriter Marion is smart enough to mislead O'Neill to bring Dressler back to touch about two-thirds of the way through a movie that reminds many of Julie Laverne's second work SHOW BOAT . <br /> <br /> Anna and Marthy's early scene with a screen (16 minutes of film), taking each other's dimensions and setting all the rest of the story tension, is one of the most influential scenes in the whole work. Must not be skipped. <br /> <br /> ANNA Christie is a great tragic game and a good movie drama. It is hard to imagine that the last day's remake, which would almost certainly lose its sharpness and atmosphere in the 1930s remake (filmed for the first time without sound in 1923 - including George Marion's original Broadway Chris) - can improve this great filming. <br /> <br /> The inner scenes are the closest to you, but you should not skip the exterior when someone knows the atmosphere. While working with the wallpaper is not up to modern technical standards, the backgrounds look better than most of the movies in which the screen has been played (especially in New York Harbor). <br /> <br /> Almost all of Garbo's creative soundtrack performances have excelled (only too often, too often, CAMILLE's 7-year-old death-watch, snatchers occasionally sniffs due to heavy hands and parodies), but ANNA Christie , with his 1932 films MATA HARI and GRAND HOTEL and the supreme touch of Lubitsch in his 1939 comedy, NINOTCHKA ("Garbo laughter!") is definitely his best. <br /> <br /> O 'Those fans that it plays on their mantled' sea games' should watch the World War II film that appeared before the US entered the conflict, LONG VOYAGE HOME (1940). It is almost as skilfully drawn from the sea playing as it is from ANNA Christie and has a young young John Wayne in one of his rare non-Western countries supporting the actors of fine cast veterans.
