"Dead Man Walking" is a film that is not about the death penalty, but about people involved in the death penalty - a killer, families whose children were killed, a nun who becomes his spiritual adviser, and what happens. It tells a story of little fanfare, but a lot of compassion and sensitivity. I have it on a DVD and every time I watch it (not often, it's never easy to see). I have more impressions of what Tim Robbins and all the cast have done here. So revealing that it can be a documentary, so convincing that you can't take your eyes off, so subtle and so powerful ... "Dead Man Walking" is not a masterpiece. It does not matter whether you are against the death penalty or against it (or even do not have an opinion), this film certainly thinks of problems. To see this material, bold scriptwriters and directors face without even slipping once, and all the people involved in the film pull it out - there is no scene that rings. A masterful film, but does not expect to see the light ... for some, that the latest scenes may be more graphic than imaginable, though no blood or violence is shown. You will get to this movie and you will be a participant, and there will be characters for almost anyone you can identify with. 10/10.
