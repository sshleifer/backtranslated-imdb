I was very impressed that Eddie Monroe was able to influence my overall influence. I say this because I know that this independent film had limited budget / resources, but it nevertheless comes as a convincing and well-formulated work. <br /> <br /> The fun from beginning to end is a number of relatively unknown actors that I can't help but believe will make a big noise in the industry in the coming years, Eddie Monroe couldn't dance with my interest and my emotional gauge. This is a well-written story that has a surprising end, despite the fact that my aspirations are not taken away. <br /> <br /> Many of the cast names in this movie are names to look out for in the future. Someone told me that Paul Regina has just passed, and if this is true, it is a real tragedy because his stoic performance Eddie Monroes is remarkable. <br /> <br /> Knit to Fred Carpenter, who has really won it!
