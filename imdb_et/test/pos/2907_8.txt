It came before the "Ten Commandments" "Pharaoh's Land" "Ben Hur" and it is unnoticed today. How unfair! Based on Mika Waltar's mammoth novel, it's not cheaper! Waltar's novel was so great that the minisers had so great justice (I hope it will be done for a few days). Waltari, whose message is essentially a Christian, remains intact (the other of his "secret of the kingdom" (first part) takes place after Christ's death in the Holy Land). <br /> <br /> "Egyptian" is the rise of monotheism near Christianity long before Christ: Pharaoh (wild) is a Messiah who sacrifices his life because he knows that a real kingdom is not a material world: he asks She returns to good, and she is with the disciples who finally turn to martyrs (a scene where Simmons and other sun worshipers have been killed visually by stunning, looking like some pagan ballets). on the other hand, this new religion would mean a nation at the end of their influence, and that is why they are looking for a strong man (mature) who can lead the army against both the Hittites and their dangerous compatriots. Another religion or non-religion should say in Sinouh√© (Purdom), who for two years does not believe anything (the order of the sand blade is absolutely sensational and rises above the average peplum !!) There is one more exciting side: the film looks like a terrible melodrama. only for the scenario (especially the revelation of Pharaoh's sister (Tierney) before the "Ten Commandments" after two years), but also the splendor of cinematography: Viviani speaks of Baudelairia's air, blue and gold in Curtiz, especially in scenes involving prostitute ( Darvi), who is considering his reflection in his bath water, the ultimate narcissism. All characters appear around the hero, disappear, but when they re-appear, they follow their path and all the subplots come with perfect skills. has a long setback that has two short sequences that show Sino to an old man who remembers. <br /> <br /> It is a great sword and sandal that had a strong impact not only in America but also in Europe, especially in Poland, where Jerzy Kawalerowicz led the enchanting "Pharaoh" (1966), which owed much to Curtiz.
