First, ignore the commentary on how South Park should entertain Republicans. Everyone is doing it now, so why should South Park blindly monitor what the rest of the media is doing? And what the Republicans do is more serious and less funny than Al Gore and his global warming hysteria. The portrayal of Al Gore must be one of the best politicians I've ever seen, it was original and it was based on people's opinions on people. I don't want to give up, but I was running on the floor. <br /> <br /> There are also some of the best Cartman / Kyle moments. <br /> <br /> All I would say is one of the best episodes that the show has ever been, and I would recommend it to anyone.
