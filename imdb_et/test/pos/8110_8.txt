Tomania Dictator Hynkel is a spoiled child who gets angry when he doesn't get what he really wants ... And what he just wants is nothing more than a world ... <br /> <br /> One of Chaplin's art extraordinary scenes, Hynkel fills the "world" with a ballet that breaks when he thinks he has it in his understanding ... <br /> <br /> Chaplin also has some biting words about war and war films. At the beginning of the film, which takes place during World War I, the message of Tomania runs on the plane and thinks ... He's going to die ... In the state of delirium, he begins to say ridiculous words. ... Blank double talk continues in a brilliant start in all the heroic death scenes of war films ... <br /> <br /> In the second scene, when he becomes a refugee in a Jewish ghetto and takes the command of resistance, which is rebelling among old men, he is going to kill Dictator ... One group must kill Austerlich's ruthless conqueror ... Who's chosen to die naturally, but his heroic death is rewarded and his name shines like a star in Tomania's history ... <br /> <br /> other characters eat cakes containing coins to determine what sacrifices to kill their lives, the dictator is a bitter gentleman who is full of fear ... <br /> <br /> In all your frustrations, "The Great Dictator" is still important movie for ironic tones of the movie adding something that neither Chaplin nor others could have given: the irony of history ... The need for murdering Hynkel requires the killing of his generals against Hitler ... The force of the original satire exceeds only the history of imitation art ... <br /> <br /> An excellent sequence, such as a duck catcher, which causes the dictator to be humbled against the Jewish hairdresser and vice versa, The Great Dictator is Chaplin's first talking film. This time you want "Charles" and not "Charlie" through your movie and not through a comedy comedy, the last one where he uses his marked "tramp".
