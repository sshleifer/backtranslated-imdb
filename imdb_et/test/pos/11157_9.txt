Okay, I know it's a clich√©. It's a bad film on this surface - maybe in the league with Plan 9 From Space Space. The dialogue is suspicious (but Singlish is quite enjoyable ...), the graph is not quite plausible, Gavin's character goes too far. Watching the movie, something really wonders ... Nice and Kim, which makes the tank out, Gwen eats a banana in the tub, almost everything Gavin says and does ("psssssssssssssssycho !!"). The things that are taken separately are probably shortcomings. All in all, these are just scams. Watching this movie with open-mindedness (especially if you don't know Singapore culture) and a group of open-minded friends is a great laugh and a memorable time. You can't go to a movie that is waiting for a masterpiece, or even waiting for something serious. If you get this movie about what it is - an underdog movie about a movie that is filled to the brim with your own churches - then you should watch it! I've seen it three times already and I wouldn't want to see it three more times!
