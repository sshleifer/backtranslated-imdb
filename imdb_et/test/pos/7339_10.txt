Anyone who worked with this film did the work of AMAZING. It's honestly one of the best lesbian movies I've seen for a long time. Action, writing, cinematography, music, visuals, everything was the upper limit. As an enthusiastic fan of this genre (both lesbian movies and gymnastics), I was so incredibly satisfied with this movie. It gave me so much more than I thought. Listening to Q&A with the cast and the team was great, the lead actress has so much positive energy and it is so modest and gracious, it's a pleasure to see people who can be talented and not forget what's really important. And the writer did the work of hell, as well as directed and editing was fantastic. Thank you for making a great movie! Thank you also for the line, "Do you want to tag yourself, be bisexual". I'm so tired of movies where characters with both sexes became homosexual or straightforward, it is wonderful to see the bisexuals' recognition for the participation of the existing and tomorrow's community, and it was nice that the labels were not needed at all in this film. What's the end! Just when I thought it didn't give me more, it did. Beautiful work and my praise to everyone. I'm spreading the word, it's definitely a movie that can't be missed!
