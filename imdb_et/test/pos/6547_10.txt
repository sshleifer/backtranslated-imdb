I saw UZUMAK about a year ago and was mesmerized. The only Japanese horror movie I saw before was KWAIDAN (which I proudly embrace on DVD, by the way), great! The idea that spirals are absorbed by the city sounds exactly like Lovecraft. It certainly reminds one of SHADOW OVER INNSMOUTH, where the inhabitants slowly become monsters (in this case giant snails). And who can forget the washing machine sequence? I hope we will soon see it on the 1st DVD (I see Sundance has recently reviewed it on US television, hopefully they will do it very soon) so that we can all see it. VERY RECOMMENDED !!!!!
