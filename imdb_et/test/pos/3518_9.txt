For a movie, like this little hidden gem to come out in the 1980s, it's shocking how many people don't know about it. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely worth it. he has all the things you need for a horror movie. especially good old chills. <br /> <br /> I remember this movie for the first time about 15 years ago, but I couldn't remember its name so I came to IMDb a few years ago to ask for help finding a title when searching. Finally I got the title and bought the movie. I still love it as much as I did all these years ago. <br /> <br /> Buy this movie !!
