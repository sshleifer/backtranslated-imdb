"Nuovomondo" was a great experience. Many filmmakers talk a lot about their stories through dialogue. Emanuele Crialese controls his film visually. For all he wants to say, he finds powerful images that can stand up for himself. So he understands the film as a tool that mainly tells his stories about the images on the screen. In particular, European cinema is often very dialogue-based (and many young American American directors have strongly influenced it). The opposite of Criales was actually the point that made this film special to me. It also has a very interesting subject packed in a rather unusual story and spoken with humor. Vincenzo Amato is an outstanding family head Salvatore, but also an amazing Charlotte Gainsbourg who likes to watch his films. There are many great sequences in this movie. Just to choose one: when the ship leaves Italy and people just mute. This scene is great, especially if you think it is accompanied by pop culture references (Titanic!).
