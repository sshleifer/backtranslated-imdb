this title is very interesting. The whole movie was like a ninja rpg viewing that is really cool. Three magical swords, three canons, a terrible demon, a political force, are all. animation is decent, but a bit grainy, the story is top-notch and fighting scenes are cool. one thing that really looks good in this movie is monsters. they are pretty stupid. if you liked blood control and ninja scrolling, you can see yotoden.
