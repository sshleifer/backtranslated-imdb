The big names of the movie tried to make their part in the war and Charlie Chaplin was no exception. This patriotic and propagandistic picture is part of his contribution, although the war was almost over when it was released. Tramp goes to war, humorously heroism acts and hits Kaiser in the dust. This is a very funny movie, though I don't think it would be almost one of his best. It is "Dog life" for his better output to First National before he made his early masterpiece "Kid". They are his first of three reelers that contain persistent and more complex gags when he usually organizes his two-rolled short trousers. <br /> <br /> It may be difficult to balance between a militant message and a hit. Bombs and scenes on the front panel, but one does not think to look at "shoulder guns". It is also preferable in many respects to a more serious "dramatic" work, such as Griffith's "Hearts of the World". Chaplin had become a true virtuoso of screen comedy to date; it looks like it. He now knew very well that a film with less gags - more specifically on processing, refinement, and careful timing - may be better than any knockout, a Keystone-type farce with ten drills per minute. Such a sequence in which Chaplin is hidden as a tree is an example. Even in the wake of wars, Chaplin can raise millions of spirits.
