I am very grateful to a small college town near Abingdon, Va.- Bristol, TN. and the home of the famous Barter Theater, where Gregory Peck once worked, was able to collect the art festival and show it there. Abingdon is two hours an hour from where I live, but the trip was worth it in every sense. UZAK / DISTANT is an amazing, brilliant, bright, emotional, enchanting film. As a Turkish-American, this film was not only a testimony of Turkey's life; but to a greater extent he says to the world what it is like to be Turkey, whether one lives in Istanbul, Berlin, Montreal, New York or Omaha. It may be two hours long, not five minutes, but it is actually our Bob Marley song. There are so many wonderful scenes in this movie. It is very difficult to choose just random. But for me there is one particular scene in the cinema in Beyoglu (downtown Istanbul). The title character played by Mehmet Emin Toprak, who died in a car accident shortly after the end of this movie, follows a very attractive young woman under the staircase cinema's main auditorium. He's going to look at "Vanilla Sky". Since Tom Cruise's image is reflected in glass, we feel that Turkish men compete with Tom Cruise for their female feelings, although Tom Cruise is not in Beyoglu. The scenes on the shores of Bosphoros are also quite revealing because they symbolize beauty, but desperate bays that are painful in Turkey. In this film lovers and families are separated in the bay. A simple, empty package of Samsun (Turkish brand) cigarettes and a dying mouse jumped from the screen, as gulls from the 1982 Serif Goren-Yilmaz Guney movie "Yol." Many Guney films, including "Yol", "Suru-cattle" (1978 - finished Zeki Octen) and "Baby-Father" (1971), have been considered by many to have been the best Turkish films ever. Without Guney's sometimes overcrowded socio-political anger (especially in his latest film, the 1983 prison drama "Duvar-The Wall"), "Distance" in Turkish life is essentially very remarkable. This is a crowning achievement of the director, which, in my opinion, can already be declared to be equivalent to directors like Tarkovsky, Bresson and Ozu. I can't wait to see her other movies!
