STEAMBOAT WILLIE is an amazingly important film in our cinema history. This second appearance of Mickey Mouse (after this year's quiet PLANE CRAZY) is probably his most famous film - mainly because it was so ground-breaking. This is because it was the first sound art. Although you still don't hear Mickey talking, there are many sound effects and music for the whole movie - something that we take for granted today, but that was a huge crowd in 1928. <br /> <br /> Now that it was just some important historical movies, it's worth seeing - especially for the lovers of animation. But after seeing a short time in about 25 years, I was surprised how timeless the film really is. Though Mickey and Minnie are a bit strange (mostly thanks to the sensual mind and talent of the animator Ub Iwerks), the film is infectious. It's just a divine vision that Mickey plays "Turkey in Straw" in a very imaginative (as occasional cruel) way. A clever and real crowd - this film still belongs to Mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years.
