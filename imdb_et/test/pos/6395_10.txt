This is one of my favorite TV series. Wonderful cast, big scenario and protruding plot. <br /> <br /> Tracking Kyle's family routine has given a great sense of humor and great comedy. Let's see: - Damon Wayans: No comments. He's one of the best today. It is a perfect timing and always a fun point. <br /> <br /> - Tisha Campbell: His paranoid and sentimental Jay is just wonderful to see. George O. Gore II: Ideal for Paper. It is impossible to imagine someone else being divine (and stupid) younger. <br /> <br /> - Jennifer Nicole Freeman: The ego-centric Claire found the perfect actor. Beautiful and talented. <br /> <br /> - Parker McKeena Posey: It's impossible to fall in love with her. <br /> <br /> Noah Gray-Cabey: This guy is in the future, I'm sure it's very sad when it ends, but this exhibition is in my mind forever. Michael, Jay, Claire, Junior, Kadie ... we love you!
