I remember coming home from school to see and come it was a story of a black family moving from gheto to a high-class community where the family was called Wilson Frank Wilson, a man with his construction company, his wife Joyce was a bank manager they had 3 teenage children Kevin Valerie and Marcus . It was a very good show. it was a trained education and it was preachie. the exhibition was well written. This exhibition gave us an overview of successful African Americans before the Cosby show. At this show many actors from Ester Role to David Hubberd appeared up to 227 Stonnie Jackson to name just a few. If you find this exhibition on DVD, you should get it for your entire family
