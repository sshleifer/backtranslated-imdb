Since many other users have already explained and commented on the story, I don't. <br /> <br /> But I would like to say once again that Bardem's interpretation is terrible, as is the interpretation of other participants. actors in this movie. <br /> <br /> Reading Previous Comments I have noticed that some people criticize the fact that the film does not reflect the views of euthanasia and that these small presentations are ridiculed. I honestly think this is far from true. <br /> <br /> There are many characters moving between the gray zone, loving Ramón Sampedro, and wanting to stay and understand his desire to die. The most obvious of these is the family. For example, Ramón's sister never speaks against or against euthanasia. Another kind of character is Gené (Social Rights Activist), who at the last minute tells Ramon that it is all thinking again. The scene clearly shows that he does not want him to die. <br /> <br /> Then there are signs that are clearly against euthanasia. Ramon's brother is clearly against him, as does his father ("There is only one thing worse than his son's death and he has a son who wants to die.") Other users have commented that the discussion between Ramon and the priest is ridiculous and filmed for us think Ramón is good and the priest is BAD. Undoubtedly, the scene is comic, but that doesn't mean the priest is caricatured or ridiculed. From my point of view, in this scene, a comedy stems from the priest's attempts to persuade Ramon to live, using arguments that are completely strange to Ramón. The priest's speech goes to "God gives and God takes", "We are not the owners of our own life, they belong to God" ... and so on. Comedy comes from the fact that Ramón is an atheist and all the priest tells him that it is pointless. form their own opinion. And any other thing is the song of freedom.
