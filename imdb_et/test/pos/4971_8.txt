This is a great Italian shark film, which is probably not a full-length feature of the shark film, but it has a great story of a native who attacks a small beach community. the film has real scenes of real sharks and some do not, but how they did it is pretty good when cast is not so brilliant to act in this shark film, but it shows better action on some other shark film in Italy (eg cruel jaws, last sharks) show some pretty bad actions, but most Italian shark movies are good, which means that this vote is best than the best shark film in Italy, some of the scenes in this movie show violence / gore that makes this movie good, this movie is good to say it's the best movie for all shark-movie fans.
