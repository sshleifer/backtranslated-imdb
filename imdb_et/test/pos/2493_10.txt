You can't watch a movie like Peter Watkins "Privilege", a story about the exploitation of pop music by big companies, the state, and even organized religion, without thinking about creatively degenerate goods like Michael Jackson or Britney Spears, who gems the giants of the company like Pepsi or some other poison for money . Or any number of entertainers in music or movies that become tools for political parties or commercial religious interests such as Scientology and Kabbalah. The film, like Privilege, must be like a science fiction in 1967, so its premise was fantastic. Today, we tend to embrace the assurances of celebrities, giving little thought to its more worrying consequences. The Watkins vision has not only become a reality when we silently accept this reality as "normal". <br /> <br /> Now consider the Penalty Park. Because Privilege challenges the viewer to investigate what is being sold to us, and why, the punishment park requires us to consider what is being taken from us and why. <br /> <br /> Heaven will help America and the world in this matter if today's politicians get this movie. It is so close to reality that when I looked at it recently, I felt a real, nausea feeling. <br /> <br /> Watkins is proficiently using a documentary storyline. When Privileges had some harsh edges for this method, it is perfect and sharp in Punishment Park. The feeling of reality is enhanced by the whole cast of armed, modest, economical, and credible imagery. This is something Hollywood has done to its detriment, cosmetically perfect picture predictions. Cast is the first-class material to work in the Watkins scenario. <br /> <br /> Many cinematographic spectators have tried to shake the viewer because of their calm, false sense of security. No one has achieved this result with such harsh and cool precision as Peter Watkins does here. The nation, back to the national community, the administration has decided to accept and exploit the current division of the country and what it considers to be the majority, instead of a reconciliation policy, it has chosen a polarization policy. "One of the characters for paraphrasing we do not need to call them pigs because they know what they are. Better than us.
