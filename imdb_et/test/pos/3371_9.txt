The box is one of the strangest films I've ever seen. To explain your experience, allow me to use this word in the picture: Imagine that you have slipped the tiny sticks and color vapors in the last month, but did not look at anything other than the Twilight Zone. The resulting coma lets you go to the hospital where the sister seems to be getting her IV adrenaline shot. The dream you have in a coma is such a movie. <br /> <br /> SUMMARY: The man will appear on a pair of doors. He gives them a box with one button. Press the button, they get a million dollars in cash and the person they don't know dies. I try not to spoil anything but things from things that are so intertwined and complex and purely original that it puts you in doubt about your peace of mind. But hey, most of us have been sensible for some time and the change is good. <br /> <br /> PROS: Amazing story, overall good acting, not a slow moment when it goes. It asks people's moral questions, rarely, ever asked in popular culture. This movie is deep, it has meaning. This is not a special fluff blocking effect in the summer (not that there's something wrong with it); the budget for this movie was relatively small and it showed in some places. But I think this is perhaps the thing that makes me so much. <br /> <br /> CONS: The first twenty minutes before they go is really slow. At the end of the movie you are so confused that you just have to sit and think for a good half an hour. I can guarantee that this movie will not get dirty comments from your peers or most critics; it is too strange and there are no explosions every three seconds. In fact, there is no explosion in this movie (besides popping your brain, trying to understand exactly what the hell happened). Personally, I don't think it's a bad thing, but many do it. <br /> <br /> Rating: Just 9/10. I've never experienced watching such a movie. The only reason I can't give it to the 10/10 is that it's just too wrapped up. Finally, there are many other great things that are still unexplained, which still tell me when I write here. In general, this is the best experience I have had in cinema communication for quite some time. But be warned that you don't like this movie if you can't sit down, turn your incredible stop to about 150% and prepare your brain to do some impressive acrobatics. <br /> <br /> Visit www. thestuffblag.com more reviews
