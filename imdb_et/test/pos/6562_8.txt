I enjoyed this movie very much. It effectively combines humor, fantasy and a few moments of fear with Higuchinski's solid film layer. Brilliant vision and very original story about spirals. My only complaint is that it was your dullest moments and was not as bold as you could have. Nonetheless, I give this 10 strong to 8. The US should take note of this and other Japanese horror / fantasy movies that have recently arrived and are available on regional DVDs. In fact, Asian cinema generally has some of the best films the American public has noticed unnoticed because they are hard to find. I urge people to look for these treasures, find them hard, but once you've found them, you're happy that you did.
