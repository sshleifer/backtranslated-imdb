Young people inside us are the perfect pearl. I saw this stunning short anniversary at the 2005 Sundance Festival. The story led me to a thoroughly changing journey. Drinking Leonard, showing Kelli Garner and Lukas Haas, direction of art, cinematography, score - every element was true to the bone. One can only hope that this subtle and tortuous film is the foreword of the greater work of this talented leader. <br /> <br /> Just like a short film before Sundance, commercial theaters used a similar format. It would be nice if miniature masterpieces like The Youth In Us would reach this wider audience in this way.
