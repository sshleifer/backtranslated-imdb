The film is a joy to watch, not only for the plot that is thrilling, but also for the great performances of actors Deneuve and Belmondo. Although this is the first flop, it has become a critical success and it is clear why. The Deneuve style is perfect for film. he constantly gives the impression that he is holding or hiding something, and his character in this film. I do not break it by saying what, although it is published quite early. Belmondo is loved as a rather naive but a love tobacco. I recommend this movie to all fans of Truffo or Deneuve. This is a brilliant Hitchcockian style thriller with exciting twists and interesting relationships and characters that evolve through the film. The movie is about 2 hours so you feel you're not short-selling. Deneuve steals an exhibition of this movie and it is clear that Truffaut was beaten with him very much while making the film. You must see any kind of cinnamon or moviefan. 10/10
