Vision is a great thing. This "Cabaret" predecessor can now look a lot when it first appeared (inspiring the famous review "Me No Leica"). Certainly it is not classic, but it has its own magic ("Cabaret" film version follows the plot, while the stage version changed the plot somewhat). Of course, Laurence Harvey should fight Christopher Isherwood for the temptation to hide it (it keeps the original name of the original author; God knows what Isherwood thought about it), describes himself as "confirmed bachelor", and Harvey is a completely inadequate "hero" (he is almost unusual) ) and Shelly Winters disgracefully shameful like Fraulien Landauer (part of Marisa Berenson's "Cabaret" played), Julie Harris is absolutely wonderful Sally, (this is a cute comic that works), and Anton Diffring is first-rate than Fritz, a German Jew who loves Shelly character. Of course, if the "cabaret" has never come, you might want to ask yourself if it has ever seen the daylight. The fact that it has been revived may not be the cause of the party, but it is perfectly acceptable.
