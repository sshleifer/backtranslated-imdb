I can't believe I enjoyed it as much as I did. The stories of the anthology were better than the par, but the unifying story and its surprise ended in me. A lot of familiar faces are held by you asking, "Where have I seen them before?" Forget the driving time listed on the New Line tape, it's not my VCR timer and 103 minutes by IMDB. Space Maggot makes a campfire in its special way and rises it 8.
