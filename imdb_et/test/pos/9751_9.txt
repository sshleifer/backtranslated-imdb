I really enjoyed watching this movie! Only a few parts were slow, but it was just mood setting and action building. I thought this film was very educational, it taught me more about my Croatian heritage. I learned more about Louise Arbor, and I can tell you that she has a great influence on me. The magazine Timeise, named Louise Arbor, is one of the 100 most influential people in the world in April 2004. This film was very dramatic, but still talked about events in the former Yugoslavia. Louise Arbor is a brave hero and I am glad they made her a movie that respected her. When you see a movie, I hope you like it.
