I saw this movie in the early 1990s when it was out for some time in VHS. At that time, I found it interesting, and that was especially the case with the Ken Russell segment, where the victim's vision was in triage and surgery. <br /> <br /> Last night, in Phase 2 of the latest Indiana Jones movie, John Hurt's vision of an unexpected setback for "Ariale", which I did not think over the years, and Russell's piece of sudden memory was enough to tear the tears a little bit. <br /> <br /> If I can make this observation, I note with interest what the reaction of love-hate has been expressed by people to the Russell segment, and I have found this interesting difference in other films that deepen into deep trauma and its consequences. Some GET do it, others don't, interesting. <br /> <br /> With the comments and the assessment, I see the general work of people in different ways. It affected me and affects me.
