This is a funny, intelligent, and in some sense realistic comedy about 14-year-olds trying to live their first love during their holidays, as well as a divorced, sometimes fun, sometimes touching relationship between a divorced father and his growing daughter ... and how far women (not just Nicole, teenager) can go to their loved one! I laughed at this lively scenario that never pulls.
