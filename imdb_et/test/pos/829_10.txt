Well ... it's time! Van Damme has returned from his best film in recent years and hit him. The plot is not too inventive, but the whole issue of the Border Guard is interesting and the former sailors like drug smugglers are complicated. But what makes this movie fantastic is that Van Damme is back to martial arts. His latest films have been more oriented, but in The Shepard JCVD ​​has returned to bad guys and looks great. There are some impressive fighting scenes and Van Damme shows that he can still pull out the hit of the old famous 360-cage heel. Because it is a low budget movie, it has a good set and great stunts. Van Damme says some humorous features and shows that he is healing as an actor. I'm glad he's been back against some Van Damage ... I've been shot down because of the lack of recent movies. Scott Adkins is excellent in his role and Van Damme and has one final thesis at the end. All in all, this is one of Van Damme's better movies and it's entertaining for you. Must rent for JCVD ​​fans. I just hold my fingers over to another martial arts epic, such as "Bloodsport" or "Kickboxer". Nok Su Kow!
