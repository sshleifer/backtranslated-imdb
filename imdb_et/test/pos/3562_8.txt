This enjoyable Euro-West opens with a scene preceded by a similar scene that Sergio Leone wanted to capture "Once upon a Time in the West" but unable to convince Clint Eastwood to appear. . One is dressed like a man with no name. The other is dressed like Colonel Mortimer, from "Fewer Dollars" and the third is like Django unless he drives instead of a horse who pulls the machine behind the coffin. Our hero meets them in the Main Street behind the wagon with three coffins. "Any kind of weapon can play" is the west of the spaghetti with spaghetti on the west coasts, because the hero wipes three killers here. Apart from a little too much comedy, especially in acrobatic struggles, it is above average. <br /> <br /> The infamous Mexican announced Montero (Gilbert Roland, "Barbarosa") and his gang, who have unleashed the lucky pistols, rob an army train that carries over $ 300,000 gold coins. "Inglorious Bastards" directed by Enzo G. Castellari is directed by various camera angles that will draw you at the forefront. Bandites seize the locomotive with a gold-bearing trainer and separate it from the rest of the train where the US cavalry is located. Although Montero and his armed forces are holding the cavalry, Pajondo ("Sabbath" Pedro Sanchez) captures the locomotive, kills the engineer and his crew and pulls it away, leaving other pistols behind them to catch themselves. In essence, Pajondo doubles Montero and steals gold for himself. Later, Montero Pajondo arrives in Rio Grande. Before the bandit can find the place of looting at Montero, Sergeant Pajondo of the cavalry wins. Before he dies, Pajondo tells Monterole of a medallion, which is a hint of where he treasured. The dirty cavalry captain (Ivano Staccioli, "Commandos") impressed Montero, but he can't defeat the bandit after he uses his whip. The captain threatens, because of Montero's reluctance, that Mexico would shoot if he doesn't speak. Meanwhile, the prisoners let the priest speak to Montero, but he is not really a priest. With six weapons carrying the Stranger (George Hilton, "The Ruthless Four"), the fabric is a man and saves the Montero firing site. Unfortunately, before Montero is rescued, Clayton (Edd Byrnes TV "77 Sunset Strip") will take a medallion away from him and keep it for himself. Clayton is a bank representative who was sent to protect gold. He's scared that the captain wants to shoot Montero. Clayton's career in the bank depends on his ability to recover gold. The stranger enters the fire fortress to repel and Montero takes the captain hostage and tries to escape, but the stranger seduces him out of the horse. Before the authorities can check that Montero is dead, the stranger argues that the body is a beautiful reward that he receives, and he travels through the captain with gratitude. Previously, they left the city when Montero's men showed him to save him from Stranger. From that moment on, a stranger, Montero and Clayton create short-term alliances with each other when they search for gold. Castellari and screenwriter Tito Carpi, who have created a number of spaghetti Western countries, such as "A Dollar for A Dewe" and another Castellar Crap "Seven Grapes Massacre", rely on smart humor and surprise to keep the action fresh and fast. pace. In one cool scene, Clayton is sitting at a table where he eats his meal while listening to some suspicious sounds behind him. Clayton pours his drink on the table and sees the gunmen hidden behind six weapons. <br /> <br /> "Every weapon can play" lives by its title. In fact, many weapons are playing and at least twenty or more dead bodies are piling up before dropping out. This west is not so much a parody as it is Sergio Leone's "The Good, the Bad" and "Ugly." Remember, bad guys and good boys fall in bowling as often as ten-pin pins, but their death is not depicted in the West's brutal way. "Every weapon can play" does not take itself as seriously as the Leone masterpiece mentioned above. Three are leading back and forth for supremacy. Each has a piece of puzzle that takes them to treasure, but they refuse to share their information up to the shoot'em up finale. Lenser Giovanni Bergamin's colorful widescreen photography is remarkable, especially the train-opening shots along the railways, which are far from the mountain peaks that are dramatically growing in the background. Another big blow when Montero tests Stranger's effortless peace. This scene happens after a stranger has saved Montero and Mexican minions arrive to save their main activities. When confiscated by Stranger's six weapons, Montero strikes a hard-knitted shell and empties the revolver by placing his good-looking balls safely on and around the bike. Bergam, who photographed Castellar's World War II thriller "Inglorious Bastards", scenes the scene with Stranger and his pistol Montero in the foreground for a pleasant three-dimensional style. Meanwhile, Francesco De Mas's lively orchestral work is as memorable as his peculiar melodies, as Ennio Morricone's tracks were for the West of Leone. The opening song is reminiscent of the 1950s West of Hollywood, with its memorable lyrics and guitar charts. Although it is not a big spaghetti in the West, "Any weapon can play" is always entertaining and interesting on the twists and good performances of parcels, especially endless Gilbert Roland, who was 62 years old at that time.
