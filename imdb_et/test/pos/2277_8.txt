"Japan takes the best in the world and does it itself", although it may be true, it is true for everyone except one thing, that is ..... Major League baseball .... but don't worry "Mr. Baseball" is for that to change it all. But who's exchanging is part of the movie that really makes it rock! Tom Selleck is one of my favorite actors and truly shines in his comedy roles. Style can be alive, but the sub-block is dead. The Japanese people are a gentle, respectful person whose paths and traditions are very different from those of Western society. All these elements and obstacles combine a truly enjoyable and funny movie. Definitely worth a look!
