First of all, despite the low rating given to this site, I saw something quite worthwhile in this movie and gladly protect it. And no, I'm not connected to the team in any way ... <br /> <br /> I came randomly with The Wind's DVD and I had the strong feeling that it wasn't quite as described in the video package. So I took the opportunity and was pleasantly surprised by this strange, very different drama. I assume that DVD marketing and compilation were MTI Home Video to work for rental or sale (label line "Love is in many forms" changed to "Terror in many forms"). Of course, renting and selling smaller movies depends heavily on getting people's attention, especially if they've never heard of the movie before (a similar case happened with THE ITEM). This is probably what works against this release, because horrible fans read the description of the "ancient wind" that accompanies the "apocalypse". It is easy to think that this is the film that makes some college students a crazy savage who is going to kill. Therefore, the reason why IMDb is lower is most likely during this review. I understand that people become irritated and think they are deceiving, seeing an apocalyptic introduction, but then experiencing a dark drama. I can forgive the marketing opportunity, because I enjoyed Wind and thought it was a refreshing change from the major Hollywood offers, it is just that, when the target audience was paid attention, more talk about higher ranking. ">" The wind of this "movie" is basically just a metaphor of society, and it is a story of four friends who make some bad choices and how their lives are rapidly changing to desperate self-preservation. After too much lessons are taught for yourself, death will happen and every person will try to save their condition. Manipulation between them becomes the norm and finally we see how self-defense becomes their main motivation for good judgment. Civilized wild, basically. This is very obvious when you notice that using a knife, branches, clubs, fists and strokes is a means of violence instead of weapons. These characters are in some way the wrong things for the right reason to stay in the situation because they have already gone too far. Although there are many indirect violent images, it is interesting to see that there is no lack and nudity. <br /> <br /> What works for Wind is "unknown" actors. Larger stars were originally intended, but I think it works better if you have less well-known, capable participants. This way you can sometimes tell the story "oh, it's Tom Cruise", not the actual tortured person who is dealing with an emergency. Even unusual conversations (such as between Mic and Billy in the field and Mic facing Claire in their bedroom) are good and quite natural in the strange universe of Fairview, with cozy homes, woods and wide open fields. I was thinking that the reflective skin hides the peaceful landscapes that hide the darkest secrets that director Michael Mongillo mentions as an inspiration in his commentary. <br /> <br /> The wind will be able to get messages without getting to it. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you look carefully, you will see a lot of symbols and dialogue that other executives would just like to pound you over. I even realized the notorious "kiss scene" between Claire, John and Billy in the context of the story without being surprised that it happened. I'm still surprised at how some people (mostly boys) who complain about two men who can kiss in the scene are obviously no problem when the scene was kissing two. All things are well handled here, and additional views make things clearer without doing and saying, "Oh man, how I miss it, ..." Things are gradually sinking and I appreciate it. Or you can also listen to DVD reviews to see more things that came up! <br /> <br /> For those who have "movie" intentions, the wind is the breath of fresh air. at a time when most movies are made to make JUST make money and listen to other movies from their "box office" competition, if they are mentioned for entertainment today or at CNN. <br /> <br /> Years later, there are always very small discoveries like The Wind that, in my opinion, do not process star-guided blockers. <br /> <br /> MTI MTI home video marketing struggle and it can really find this interesting story. I strongly recommend this to friends who are looking for such unusual movies.
