It was one of the most emotional movies I've seen. Passion, joy, pain, despair, fear, healing, purification, and love. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was enchanting. Everything went so well; book customization, actors, kits, camera shots. <br /> <br /> This movie touched me deeply in so many ways. It reminded me of the despair that may be lost in your love and the time it took to heal this wound. You can love again, but you always risk the pain of subtraction. <br /> <br /> Isn't this one of the most important older questions? <br /> <br /> "Is it better to love and lose? <br /> <br /> If you never loved before?" <br /> <br />
