It's a movie about love, violence, illegal things, and novel tycoons. The Romanian Story with Accidental Adaptation, resulting in a modern international film that can be understood by both Western and Eastern European audiences who have forgotten to film the conservative communist regime. <br /> <br /> A movie full of violent fighting scenes that are very numerous and create increasingly tense situations as the film continues. <br /> <br /> A story that impresses your view of the neighborhood. Two young men are making illegal car trips. They work together as a team and bloom from their occupation, but when a local tycoon is asked to lose one race, things start to get dirty and the bomb's melting light comes up, creating a highly energized movie that keeps you close to the screen until you ask yourself a lot of questions long after that . <br /> <br /> Brilliantly both Dragos Bucur and Dorina Chiriac work with high-quality leadership and screen writing at a young age, but the talented director Radu Muntean also gives Furia a unique charm. All of this and many other elements that can be observed during viewing have created that all filmmakers must see the film from all over the world and its message is clear to anyone who is independent of the race, the language we speak, and the country. This is a real hope for Romanian cinema, as it tries to keep pace with the cinema of more advanced events. <br /> <br /> I hope you enjoy it because I'm sure all the people who liked it and understood it.
