I am ashamed to say, but I have to admit that for the first time I saw this movie only a year ago. After that, I quickly saw and bought the DVD collection and I've been watching it several times. <br /> <br /> The film is terrible on many levels. It works in the form of your straight monster or action film as a horror / sci-fi and also a very intriguing look at the human psyche. An amazing paranoia, mistrust, and fear borrowed not only by Carpenter's direction (which is stunning), but also by casting incredible action in general. Kurt Russell (apparently) is remarkably undervalued in MacReady's lead and, as a direct result, he feels more like a real person than a Hollywood "hero of America." Other cast members leave their roles in style, and the result is a highly believable atmosphere and a truly fantastic movie.
