This is an extraordinary picture so much to recommend. Action and writing are terrible and the plot has many great turns. As a French "Noir", this language is definitely more earthy in America, but it is just added to reality. In addition, I liked it when everyone was non-glamorous - especially husband and lieutenant. The only negative and the reason why the film gets 9 and not 10 is because there was a prominent plot hole. Like the other famous French film Dr√¥le de Drame, the confusion of the police and the accused can easily be solved at first, but the characters made quite foolish decisions. To do this, you just have to stop the unreliability and watch out for profitability. <br /> <br /> It's just one of the best French movies I've ever seen. Period.
