Jack Frost 2 is probably the most exciting film I've ever seen in my life. The full title of the movie is Jack Frost 2: Mutant Killer Snowman's Revenge. Horror movie fans who have a taste of campy story lines are pleased to watch it. This movie was directly on video and for good reasons. Here's why: acting was so cruel and so terrible that it could cause crying. The main character was not a personality, and the actor's bad behavior made it worse. The scenario was, it was cruel. Every character always says on a cheesy line and adds cheesy lines to bad choreography, then you have something bad. Secondly, the story is not really impressive, but because this movie was a direct video, it is forgiven. The director and writer could have made the killer's snowman's idea cool, but they didn't. They have a lot of story in the plot holes. At first, the fish is dropped into a coffee container and defrosted by Jack Frost. Scientists are trying to restore their lives, but they couldn't. When coffee coffee dropped into the tank, Jack Frost was completely restored. Now she is immune. Jack Frost in Part 1 mixed with the anti-freezing DNA of the main character used to kill Jack Frosti. Since the protagonist is allergic to bananas, Jack Frost is also. So here's my point. They say Sam's DNA was combined with Jack Frost. But one scientist had a saliva on the cup, so if the tank collapsed, the scientists would have joined DNA with Jack Frosts. Another thing, special effects were not very good either. Here are some good points: Jack Frost 2 has a lot of blood that looks pretty realistic. Although this film is hellish, it is still fun. Overall, Jack Frost 2 is an enjoyable horror movie. However, the first one was better. 7 out of 10
