What can I say about a series called NEW EXTERNAL BORDERS ... Hmm .... Only that it was one of the best TV channels ever put together !! You have actors of all ages, actors who are somewhat known and have forgotten since then. Everyone is playing their part for the sake of accurate perfection! These patterns always have a moral story for those who are mostly (if not all) very true! You may feel that a man whose voice is over credit and at the beginning and end believes what he says with all his heart! These patterns not only have a great story, they also throw you, can compete and pump blood. The original external borders in the 1960s were black and white in parallel, these exhibitions gave a triumphant return that I have never seen! The new twilight zone with Forest Whitaker was fun to watch, but the new OUTER LIMITS is where it is! If you haven't seen it: I ask you to check out these episodes and see exactly what I mean! LONG LIVE NEW EXTERNAL BORDERS !!!!!!!!!!!!
