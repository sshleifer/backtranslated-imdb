National Velvet (1944) A film that put Taylor on the map. Costarring is then the number one boxer, Mickey Rooney. Taylor plays a girl in love with her horse, and if Jockey Mickey Rooney is unable to ride in the Grand National race, Liz cuts her hair, pretending she is a boy and competing with a horse ... well I'm not breaking the end. This is a high-quality melodram that MGM has proclaimed. And this is another early color image to launch!
