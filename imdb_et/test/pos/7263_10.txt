Usually I hate period movies. Living in England is currently a nightmare if you have an allergy to periodic drama - what I do. But that's the best. It doesn't take seriously and Jonny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle are great, Liv Tyler is good too, although his English accent is annoyed! <br /> <br /> The movie has everything that just wants to go to the cinema. It has action, adventure, drama and comedy. I'm not sure how good jokes translate across the ocean, but hopefully they will do it. It would be disgraceful to the American audience that this film would not remain. This shows that English filmmakers can produce something that does not mean constant rubbing and sex. Both are in this but balanced format. Iain Robertson's camp imagination for well-made gentlemen is brilliant and two brothers, who are also part of the upper class kit, are fun! <br /> <br /> Like "Spy, who talks to me," say .... "If you see another movie," .... make it to Plunkett and Macleane this spring. It's fun, action, and of course Jonny Lee Miller, who has an English emphasis on change!
