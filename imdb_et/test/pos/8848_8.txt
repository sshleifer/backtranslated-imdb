At a time when the great horror films of the '60s and' 70s have been rebuilt in today's frightening strangers who are not too awful, it is instructive to look back at John Carpenter in 1982. remake - director of childhood favorite, Howard Hawks' 1951 sci-fi / horror classic THE Thing from OUTER SPACE. Although Carpenter's film was not a large box originally published in mid-1982, it has since accumulated a great deal. <br /> <br /> In fact, Carpenter's film is a lesser version of the Hawks movie than it is reprocessing because it goes back to the source material provided by John W. Campbell's "Who's Going?" In Antarctica, the shape-changing alien threatens to melt the ice after 100,000 years. Kurt Russell, who was the director of the director's 1979 TV film ELVIS and the 1981 film ESCAPE NEW NEW YORK, directs the actors of this tension, including Keith David, Donald Moff, Richard Dysart and Richard Masur. filled with paranoia research, because the shape-changing "thing" that begins in its camp as a Norwegian team tries to kill each of them. It won't be long before all the people in the camp start to trust their companion. At the end of the movie, where Russell and David are the only ones, there is an annoying and freezing ambiguity that resembles similar encodings for both BIRTHS and SYSTEMS. <br /> <br /> Almost universally, when THE THING has been purchased, the emphasis is on gory special effects make-up and alien designs created by Rob Bottin, who had worked with Carpenter in the 1980's THE FOG, and Joe Dante The 1981 werewolf movie THE HOWL. These effects are indeed quite remarkable and graphical, and even today they can be quite reversible. But all this would make the Carpenter film something other than the epic of top-notch stains if the direction, story and actor were not sniffed; and luckily everyone has them. If he does not focus on tremendously terrible transformation sequences, Carpenter will build the same Hitchcock in a way that has informed his earlier films HALLOWEEN and THE FOG, along with Dean Cundey's sticking camera work, especially through station corridors. help. The actor enhances Bill Lancaster's ongoing scenario adaptation; and we have also been given another score by Ennio Morricone whose work is directed by Sergio Leone's classic 1960s Italian spaghetti westerns, including, of course, Carpenter himself. THING also has Albert Whitlock (who worked on many Hitchcock films, including THE BIRDS) and Roy Arbogast, who worked on CLOSE ENCOUNTERS third and bilateral films. movie was not a success that could have been because Universal decided to release this graphic shock only two weeks after he released Steven Spielberg's much more family-friendly ET: THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL (not surprisingly, critics and audiences preferred Spielberg's superb movie Carpenter has the same great but extremely different movie). Also, most of the horror film offices in 1982 went to another film produced by Spielberg, POLTERGEIST. As a result, THE THING suffered a loss of $ 15 million due to its lack of attention. <br /> <br /> Over time, many have come to see Carpenter's film about what it is - a highly successful, yet highly intelligent combination of science fiction and horror, made with great enthusiasm and a true understanding of psychological paranoia at the heart of this story. Although it is still quite tough, you should keep in mind the many skills that the story will put together if it is alien to the alien's design and make-up effects; Because it is the skill and the relationship of narration, which makes it so memorable in the end.
