I remember that my family was home to stay at home "Nichols" at night (on Tuesdays Tuesdays? NBC?). It was a great vehicle for James Garner, a very well written, great band. His character is very similar to the films "Support Your Local ...": Pensioners with a mysterious past live in the city and offer adventures every week. In fact, it seemed quite obvious that it was the same. It was just a charm of the TV show. A dream, such as "My World and Greetings in It", which may be modern - I forget. I want these shows to be available on DVD. It was just a good TV. Maybe "Briscoe County Jr." come close, only a mile.
