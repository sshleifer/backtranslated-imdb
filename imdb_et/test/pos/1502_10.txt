this movie gets 10 because there is a lot of gore. who cares about the plot or the actors.It is a man of horror movies in Italy, so you know that you can't expect much from an actor or plot. took the movies from other movies and added it to one. Since I never saw any of the movies he took from this film, it's not important to me. The Italian godfather who made this movie is one of the goriest Italian movies you will ever see. shouldn't be this movie in your horror movie set.
