It was an interesting film. I could have done without a bathroom scene and online picture - EWWWW! Other than that, I loved the good movie that this film turned around. Chris / Izzy's parents are ATTENTION! They fully support the interests of their sons and believe him enough to support him - now that is AWESOME !! What really surprised me was the realization of Chris at the end. It wasn't a "hollywood" that ended up on his way to discovering himself. The overall rise to stardom and its decline was quite a roller-rider.
