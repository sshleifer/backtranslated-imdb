The piece is weak on the plot, full of holes and it also has a pretty bad action. but none of this is because the director's more daring singh has given us one of the most visually stunning films. The whole plot is just an excuse to smile and bring you to the serum killer, bringing some shocking, pleasant, breathtaking and desperate images to the audience. <br /> <br /> This beautiful movie will stick with you for a long time. this film is the perfect case of "stopping the unbelief". Forget the silly plot, let your senses be puzzled. and J.Lo sees enough stunning to add the rest to the work. Cinematography is harrowing, music is haunted and costumes are simply stunning. <br /> <br /> The film is less of a film and more of a work of art. Its just that the media is no longer a canvas, it's a big screen and celluloid. one of the most recent films of this decade. The cell has to look. Making a movie is a bold new step. <br /> <br /> Amazing 8!
