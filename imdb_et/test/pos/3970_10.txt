Adopted is one of the best teen comedies I've seen for a long time. This is an original script, talented cast and it gives one and a half clean endless fun. <br /> <br /> This tells of a high school graduate Bartleby's "B" profit (Justin Long), who is not in any collage he requested to avoid his parents' disappointment, he creates a fancy collage. In an attempt to fool her parents, she creates a fake website and turns the old psychiatric hospital into a school. Everything goes smoothly until many other "accepted" students turn to their fingertips. Now he and his friend must see that the collage is not only for themselves but also for others. <br /> <br /> Justin as a leading person is completely brilliant, his character is as natural as he can be. supporting actions are outstanding - Jonah Hill as Sherman Schrader, Columbus Short as Hands, Maria Thayer as Rory, Adam Herschman as Glen and Lewis Black Uncle Ben. <br /> <br /> Humor is fresh and simple, and most importantly funny, right from the start after credit. The plot's development is so easy that by the time you stop laughing at the last joke, you started to smile again. Together with all the amusements, the film brings to our attention, ie collage education, a very common topic. As a rule, the students of the film are together with the government of the school, in which case they are joined by a mutual desire to go to school and study. <br /> <br /> But film does not mean all other schools are wrong, it just shows there is another way. You do what they say, "If there is a will. And sometimes the kids know what they need as their parents better. <br /> <br /> This movie is an unforgettable little story about the great potential of life packed at best possible form.
