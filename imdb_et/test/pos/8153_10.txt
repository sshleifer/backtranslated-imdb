If you have a box bag, a cozy sofa, a big bowl of popcorn and no social commitment on Friday night, this is definitely your movie! Its romantic, hot and complicated. For most men, religion is just one of the things we did when we were kids and probably just a female boy and how cute he was! But in the last few days, you can see that the fight is gay when the whole world revolves around beliefs that are completely against homosexuality. The two main cast members were completely hot, but at the same time they managed to beat their heart and even "almost" cry (I never called in the movie!), Which I thought was impressive for the B-Class movie. I recommend this flick, you laugh, you cry (if you are not) and you definitely suspect! I love it so much that I even bought a DVD for my collection. Its a really beautiful movie ever
