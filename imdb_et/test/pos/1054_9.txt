I just got this movie for Christmas and added it to my favorites list. A lovely and simple story that makes a beautiful movie. Who could not love Uncle Felix or did not get the mouth water all this food. Certain points go to Sydney Greenstreet Alexander Yardley and Reginald Gardiner, who played John Sloan, an impossible boring nickname. Really pearl will be reviewed every Christmas.
