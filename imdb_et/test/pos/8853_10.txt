When the Thing came out in 1982 everywhere, it was a cold reception and very bad post office results, becoming almost unlikely to be John Carpenter as a horror leader; but time has proved that "The Thing" was definitely not a failed project and that the disappointing commercial practices were not the fault of the film. Nowadays, John Carpenter's "The Thing" has gained the recognition he deserves and what many horror fans consider to be a horror class and not without reason, as is John W. Campbell Jr.'s "Who's Going There?" Other World ") is an original story closer and holds a masterfully designed study of paranoia for pessimistic fear and high doses of hours. <br /> <br /> Thing begins in the winter of 1982 at a US research center located in remote areas of Antarctica, when team members point out that the Norwegian helicopter is on its way. The helicopter's two apparently mad pilots are trying to kill the Husky dog ​​who goes to the American base. When the Norwegians are killed at random, the Americans are trying to find out what they made crazy. Soon they will discover that the Norse Husky dog ​​was not an ordinary dog, but a creature that can mimic every living entity, not just that it has a huge hunger. <br /> <br /> Director John Carpenter made a place in history when he led the "Halloween" in 1978, where intercourse and atmosphere were overwhelming and shocking. "The Thing" can be seen as a development of this style, because even though Carpenter uses a lot of Rob Bottin's special effects (which were criticized by critics on his day), the film focuses even more on the atmosphere and skipping on non-violent (and very well-made) displays. The feeling of loneliness, as well as the "bad karma" of the team members increases the feeling of paranoia, because everyone could be Thing, even our main character, RJ MacReady (Kurt Russell), who ends up in a situation where nobody gets the element of the plot more faithful to the concept of the source community and the previous The version (not quite a bad thing, just a big difference) was ignored, changing the lessons of this version less than the remake and more than the new concept of the original novel. Bill Lancaster's manuscript deals with the brilliant domain of characters, giving us enough to differentiate them, but not too much to fully trust them, making them an important factor under the haunting feeling of the film that runs through the film. Mystery and intercourse are at a maximum level, because you can never say who is the thing and who is normal, increasing paranoia and unpredictability with excellent results. <br /> <br /> Cast is very effective, and their performances as a whole are so effective that they almost feel the feeling of being bad between their characters. The film is carried by Carpenter's usual co-author Kurt Russell as MacReady, and through his eyes we feel the madness and horror that the research station is changing when the situation changes. Certainly one of his best performances. Wilford Brimley is also terrible when Dr. Blair, a scientist who goes crazy after discovering Thing's goals. <br /> <br /> Thing is such a wonderfully designed movie that its drawbacks tend to go unnoticed, although they exist. The most famous is that Ennio Morricone is a very low and sometimes inappropriate score. It is not quite bad, but it seems inappropriate in some scenes and it is not one of the best works of the legendary composer. Also, with some special effects misshapes, some scenes were left out, which actually fill some small plot holes, though something of great importance or actually annoying. <br /> <br /> Talking about John Carpenter's films, most people called "Halloween" are his favorite films almost instantly, but personally I would like to go with "The Thing" because I consider this to be Carpenter's greatest achievement and one of the most interesting and actually terrifying fear films. I would like to go so far as to call it one of the best films ever made. 10/10
