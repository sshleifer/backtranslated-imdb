This film was a pleasant surprise to me. Frankly, the previews looked awful until Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman appeared. So I rented it with a reservation, but I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. It worked great, with some good plots and of course Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman. Definitely worth a look.
