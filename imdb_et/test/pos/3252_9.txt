Great movie! I am sorry to say that it reminds me a bit like Pulp F. but that is how it is in the pulp era. Many pictures automatically resemble a gangster. But it is well written, a funny coincidence, ordinary gangsters who are family members, something like Tarantino, which is a good match! <br /> <br /> In any case, the movie is from Australia, which is mixed with serious crimes and comes to debt and deep. To help her, her dead brother (someone who remembers Val Kilmer in True R.), to pay for her debt and escape from the gangsters on her trajectory. Gangsters have cold blood but take the time to play chess and focus on raising their children! They also get their grandmother's way to plan bank robbery and have problems with their children during robbery. So the humorous gangster flick with Heath Ledger in good shape (though I'm not a fan), and Bryan Brown is a great action as a gang leader.
