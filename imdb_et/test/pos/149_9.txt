Chan-wook Park, you have to give it to the guy. In my eyes, he is not only a brilliant director, but an excellent director who can turn his hand on any genre and often gives something refreshing but still satisfying. <br /> <br /> Thirst is essentially a vampire story, but one that plays fast and looses some "sub-mode" rule. Kang-ho Song plays Dad Sang-hyeon, a man who obviously handed over to the research program and then an unselfish illness they are trying to cure, dying and coming back. Everything because of blood was his blood transfusion. Being the only five hundred to survive, he becomes quite famous for those who know him and everything he wants is normal. However, normal now means that we can do great distances without injuries, wishing to drink blood and pull down the collar seriously when the sun rays on his skin. It is not long before he lives with a rather insecure family who knew him in childhood, and when he conceals his new, strange lifestyle, he finds himself in a complex triangle of love, becoming more and more acceptable to darker thoughts and sliding a slippery slope that can lead him to humanity beast to monster. <br /> <br /> Mixing multiple genres, Park's film felt much more fresh and original than Let The Right One (use the last example) and really impressed me with this approach to material that would have felt both worn and any other vampire movie we have seen over the years. It is a mixture of horror, melodrama and comedy, while contemplating ideas such as the strength of faith, the power of life and death, immortality, and so on. <br /> <br /> Some people have complained that this genre -blending approach weakens the film, but I personally found it to be a lively, entertaining and always enjoyable movie, helped by a great song like a tortured priest and a fantastic turn to a strong with no weak links. Many characters move through different emotions and all do it with skill and credibility, especially for a young woman (played by OK-vin Kim), who gets the priest's object of love, lust and affection. <br /> <br /> The fans of Asian cinema (and especially the park) and fans of the store "The Tell-Tale Heart" (see and learn) should do this, this is another stylish movie from a person who seems to be taking his step and always succeed in putting out only solid entertainment. <br /> <br /> See if you want: Cronos, Dark Dark, Dellamorte Dellamore AKA Cemetery Man.
