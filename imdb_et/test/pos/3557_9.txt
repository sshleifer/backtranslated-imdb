I'm really tired of sitcoms; you feel you always know what's coming to make it more funny. On the other hand, Hi De Hi, rarely know what's coming and laughing out loud funny. I just bought a second set (series 3 -4) and I'm surprised how much I enjoy it all - again. I have nothing but respect for writers or actors (or many invisible team members) because the entertainment they offer is worth the wait. The gems and the respect that the participants achieved through this series speak for themselves. Croft and Perry created pure gold, some of which appear through Hi De Hi.
