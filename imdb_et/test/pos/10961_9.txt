Watching the debut feature of John Cassavetes is a strange experience, even if you have seen improvisation films before. <br /> <br /> The first thing you notice is hardness. Immediately it is clear that some characters are screwing these lines. But then you step back from the situation when you sink deeper into the intimate exchanges of these people and you ask yourself, "Do I ever have to stumble over MY words?" Of course, the answer is sure we all do. It's unfortunate that most of the gaffs in this section are at the beginning of the picture, because for about twenty minutes you have been so deep that you don't know when the bomb went behind you. <br /> <br The next thing you notice ... or maybe you notice it after hours or days after the end of the movie is that you never saw any significant plot, but the topics and poem of the dialogue and characters will not leave you ever. In fact, the treatment of the racial role of these characters in everyday life is always there, but it is so short-lived that even if they are unaware of how they inform their opinion about themselves, their self-awareness, their perceived state, or the fate of their relationships. </p> <p> </p> <p> The title is relevant because you get a full spectrum of black, whites and grays ... and not just character skin pigmentation. Leila Goldoni (truly remarkable here) is an African-American / Caucasian, her two brothers are white and dark African-American. The irony is that they exist undoubtedly in the most prevalent atmosphere of time ... racing top east-west Manhatten ... and there are still conflicts. <br /> <br /> I don't think I've ever seen such a fine movie or technique. It is very similar to a truly large gallery art and then simply comforted blissfully when you think of the images that it triggered a day later. <br /> <br /> Great mastering and extras on the Criterion plate. Supposedly the first truly experimental independent film ever made.
