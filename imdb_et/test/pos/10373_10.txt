For those who are still in the dark, I don't violate Christie because it's definitely one of his best works, and I emphasize that you should see it whenever you have the next free time! If any adjustment is reviewed before (or instead of) reading a book, I would recommend following the funeral for the following reasons. <br /> <br /> I wanted to praise Monica Dolan's performance (Miss Gilchi), whose employer companion, Cora, is murdered brutally at the beginning of the movie. His portrayal of a shocked, nervous, irrelevant woman actually moves, especially if he has a personal relationship with Poirot for a moment, with another person traveling alone on the "journey of life". And when a murderer appears in a typical Poirot way, Dolan's reactions to revelation work best: you feel angry with the murderer if you sympathize with Miss Gilchrist ... something unusual about Christie Lore. <Br> Although <br /> there are a few different differences between the novel and movie customization in the normal way (movie business may be less meaningful), post-war England's incredibly proud holiday, thoroughly high caliber Christie's mystery and intrigue behavior and leadership and preservation (if not make these discrepancies irrelevant. <br /> <br /> Bravo Suchet, Dolan and the whole team for a mystery mystery for the theater masterpiece and the producers who gave him the green light! Encore!
