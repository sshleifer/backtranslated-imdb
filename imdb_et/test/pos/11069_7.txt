This movie is pretty good, actually it's like a good wine, it gets better, the more you look at it. With such a high octane issue, the pace is rather slow, but cinematography is beautiful and surreal. There's a cool blue tone that "drives" the whole movie. "Midget" by Gabriel Casseus also has a great performance. He's terrible. Why does this man no longer work. If the film got better support, it probably would.
