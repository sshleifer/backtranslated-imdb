But George and Gracie are not among them. The movie is fun and the pool table scene with WCs must be one of the most fun I've ever seen, but Gracie and George are irritating to their roles as comic, partly due to the scarcity of the script and partly their interpretation. I gave it to the 7 out of 10 for the rest, the toilet is a rank and energy comic in it.
