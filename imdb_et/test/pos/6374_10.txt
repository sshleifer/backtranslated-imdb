Every show is great. Finally, the exhibition is nothing but because it sucks to be married or good-looking people who talk about why they are like ordinary people. Shame that it was canceled. <br /> <br /> Mike Scully and Julie Thacker, formerly from Simpsons, wrote or commented on some of the funniest episodes of this series, and many similar humor comes here. Take Officer Steve Cox and think of Troy McClure. But it has its own unique sense of humor and let's face it, teenage girls love it only on their own. <br /> <br /> What is it with a television that cancels most of the good shows and we are fed with a spoon of abominations like who almost slept with my mother or what this exhibition is called? Please learn the lesson. Not all need to be about understanding or romantic history, or especially about reality, that shows how to demystify every aspect of life. Some people want to laugh and don't have to think later. Well, my grabbing takes place for the day. Now back to Simpson. When is it? Oh, yeah! All the time.
