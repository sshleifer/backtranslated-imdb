Regardless of the words, this is the heart breaking story of divorce, resulting in a tragic battle of the seven-year-old boy. <br /> <br /> One of the great strengths of "Kramer v. Kramer" is Robert Benton, his screenwriter, who has perfectly adapted Avery Corman's novel to the big screen. It keeps things beautifully simple and realistic, giving the whole drama straight from the heart. His talent for such emotional talks was to prove himself again in the "Places in the Heart" where he showed, like "Kramer v. Kramer", that he had natural work with children. Another strong point in the picture is a great actor, who deservedly received four of the nine awards from the film, two of them winning the winners. One of them was Dustin Hoffman (the best actor) who is great as an irritated businessman Ted Kramer, a man who has forgotten that his wife is a human. As said woman Joanne, Meryl Streep argued for an actress Oscar for a strong and sensitive image of a woman who had lost her marriage for eight years. He was also named Jane Alexander for his fantastic turn as Kramer's good friend Margaret. The last word for the actors' contributions is to go to the young Justin Henry, whose incredibly moving force will find tears back to you, and the earned Oscar title came to him. <br /> <br /> Brilliant is also Nestor Almendros' cinematography and Jerry Greenberg's timely editing, but musically Henry Purcell's classic piece has been used. <br /> <br /> It's really a story about how father and son depend on each other as their wife and mother leaves. They grow together, come to know each other and form a whole new and wonderful relationship. Ted finds himself with new responsibilities and new vitality and slowly realizes why Joanne had to go. a small child, especially not in the battle for the child itself. <br /> <br /> Saturday, June 10, 1995 - TV <br /> <br /> Avery Corman's novel strong drama about the heartbreak of arrest between strangers who both feel they have the best interests of the child. Apart from the great scenario and the amazingly controlled direction, from Robert Benton, this is the ultimate cast that makes this picture a winner. <br /> <br /> Hoffman is great when Ted Kramer, the man who has broken his career and the son he desperately wants to keep. Streep is also great because she lost eight years of marriage, which had to go out before she changed anything. These two are supported by a very strong Jane Alexander as a mutual friend of Margaret, a prominent Justin Henry who boy caught in the middle, and the top cast extras. <br /> <br /> More than worthy of this 1979 Academy Award for Best Movie, Best Actor (Hoffman) and Best Supporters (Streep). <br /> <br /> Wednesday, February 28, 1996 - TV
