It's ten times better than "who wants to be a supermodel" in Bravo. I think this is more right for business. At the same time, tyra is strong and responsive and can make maximum use of any desired model. In each model, the photos look for depth, personality and beauty, strength and bad attribute, and the ability to tolerate and work for what they want. I like to see that Tyra's personal experience has been put into photo sessions and on the track. I do not always agree with the judges' decision or with Tyra's comments and at least one of the winners, I think it is not worth winning. But this is just an exhibition and every girl is very happy to find this opportunity.
