My son Adam (5 years old) is a big fan of Scooby Doo. She likes this movie. He especially liked when the Loch Ness monster tried to attack Shaggy and Scooby. The result of the vote is his choice and reflects his love for the characters. <br /> <br /> Having seen the movie "Vampire Rock", it was surprisingly very similar when they repeated the well-worn main picture. different settings. <br /> <br /> Few adults are exposed to it without their memories of a series of television cards and even fewer children. You like it or love it. I loved Scooby Doot for half an hour as a child, I'm happy my son loves it, I can handle it right away.
