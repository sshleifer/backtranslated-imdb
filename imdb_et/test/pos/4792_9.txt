The black comic story of the fallen priest, Nazarin introduces the economy that Luis Bunuel was able to achieve to be able to say deeply about the humanistic fiction with minimal noise. The output of the Mexican filmmaking era was an invaluable talent with little money and an extremely tight schedule. However, Nazarin goes far beyond Bunuel's earlier Mexican films in the show (Francisco Rabal is great), narrative and theme. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, this is what Viridiana re-examined. three years later in Spain. This concerns the individual's struggle for humanity and the altruism of society, which rejects all the notion of virtue. Father Nazarini is more sympathetic than his sister Viridiana. Although the latter seems to choose charity because he wants to reconcile his (perceived) sins, Nazarini seems to have a whole existence and reason to help others, be they (or we are). The last scenes of the film, in which he doubts his behavior and the second second must choose the life he has led, or the normal life expected of the priest, are so emotional, because they concern his moral integrity and we are never quite sure if it remains intact or not. <br /> <br /> This is a remarkable movie and I would like to invite everyone to be interested in classical cinema. It is one of Bunuel's most moving films and includes many of his obsessions: disappointed desire, crazy love, religious hypocrisy, and so on. In my opinion, Nazarine is second only to "destructive angel" in his Mexican films. is definitely the top of Bunuel's entire movie output list.
