Changi is a joyfully fresh script that worked great for both young and old actors. John Doyle has done an excellent job of giving humor a tragic real story, sometimes keeping the sad story fun and tempting, especially for those who do not know the events in Southeast Asia during World War II. <br /> <br /> John Doyle's parallel story successfully overcomes the gap between the past and the present, allowing the audience to learn about long-term consequences for war prisoners and their family life, and to lay the foundations for an excellent narrative that rounds everything. individual and collective. Doyle deserves praise for this effort. We have previously enjoyed his rich and fast humor, as evidenced by his long-standing collaboration with Greg Pickhaver, such as Roy & HG. <br /> <br /> As the series is approaching halfway, we are looking for a story about how the story develops cautiously.
