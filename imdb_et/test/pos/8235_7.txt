During World War II, basilion films created by Hollywood took place and, after seeing many of them, they look the same. Yet, OVER 21 is unique in so many ways, as it shows the part of the war you can't see in other movies - it's worth seeing, even if you've seen other movies! <br /> <br /> Alexander Knox plays the men's lead, but Irene Dunne, the real director of the movie, looks at the amazing 47-year-old lady (yes I checked - she was really old when she made the movie). Over 21 pairs of men and women play. He is a military, a lot of his father (Charles Coburn) and the owner of the newspaper in which Knox is used, and most of the film takes place when he is in a candidate school for officials. The film shows little at Knox school, but focuses on Dunne when she lives in close-to-home spheres. During this time, he (as the British say) keeps the "rigid top lip" and does it best - although he is not a housewife, but a famous professional writer. Sometimes she gets very short visits from her husband, but most of the time is spent on housewives and taking care of Coburn. Finally, he decides to stop the malicious Coburn from constantly calling (he always says his paper does not live without his son), pretending that he is a Knox writer. <br /> Although there is no ground in this movie, it's a very interesting piece of life. In addition, the performance of the circle is very good. Interestingly, this film is a sophisticated reprocessing by Ruth Gordon (famous scriptwriter) and his wife Garson Kanin (as well as the famous scriptwriter and director). When Kanin joined the war during World War II, Gordon soon wrote and played the movie that got this movie. By the way, I noticed that some reviewers really liked the call at the end of the movie it was inspired by. Although it was very good, it was very sad, because all this hope for a better world after the war was short-lived.
