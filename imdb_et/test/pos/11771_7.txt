"Homegrown" first half hour was quite boring and not absorbing, but as the movie progressed, so did my interest in the characters and the plot. Several scenes are really scary and you are afraid of the main characters you actually grow. The story is about three hired hands hidden in the illegal marijuana farm in southern California. They know the murder of the farm owner Malcolm (John Lithgow) and take over the weeds. Three fairly simple farms will soon go into a terrifying world of mafia and local interests, while all the time trying to convince everyone that Malcolm is still alive. Although the film had several errors and a slow start, it turned out to be useful. 7/10 stars.
