Peter Lorre gives one of his own offenses. The plot has a new government agent to monitor Peter Lorre's character. When a G-man's contact with his Lorre agents was killed, a G-person is sent to jail for killing, although everyone knows the story is more. Lorre has turned the man into his care and led to his island where he is mining diamonds. Lorre wants to know what our hero knows, but he's not talking and the will to fight is moving. <br /> <br /> This is a good steadfast thriller that doesn't make much sense in the plot of wise, but even so the film holds your interest. I put the movie last night to use it as something to drive away, instead I found the story that was hanging enough when I was 70 more minutes. Lorre is the reason why it belongs. Her pretty behavior is nervous. He does very little, but explains his orders and how everyone reacts to him (see how they illuminate the cigarettes) that he is a bad guy. <br /> <br /> Look at what you should run over.
