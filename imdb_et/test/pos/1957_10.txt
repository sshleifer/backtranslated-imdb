After reading some of these reviews, it is obvious that some have missed this point. What this movie is great about (here is the point) that is incredible for this movie, the amazing thing about this movie is that there is no procession. There is no preaching. There is no preaching. There is no preaching. Life goes on. This is a masterpiece that lets the audience think about their collective self. These are just children who do what children do - without consciousness. We all went to school with such children. We are numbered by fiction / film / TV / news-based reality / invention. <br /> <br /> Fecki's (Dennis Hopper's great) girlfriend alone and her relationship with her is worth the cost of renting a movie. <br /> <br /> The film's intelligence has been measured before or after. AMEN. <br /> <br />
