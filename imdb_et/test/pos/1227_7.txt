Good, boring or bad? This is good. Worth Your Money? If you can reserve it for a ticket, be sure to. Better than a trailer it seems? Yeah, weird. <br /> <br /> There are not many scripts - guards working in a armored truck company are moving a lot of money. Defenders see the opportunity to retire as millionaires, one of them being too honest to go with it, and a well-planned plan on the floor. <br /> <br /> It could have been poorly performed reservoir dogs, but the cast skill and the director's ability to make almost all the tension pull it out of the world and put it on a solid foundation.
