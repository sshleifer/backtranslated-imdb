The aspirations of a new group of young talents supported by Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson, two very talented actors, are an entertaining and fun entertainment night. And I can add that Hal Holbrook looks like a senator. This movie deserves 5 stars. I'll give it ten on your scale. And the end is PERFECT. I'm surprised that British actors can manage their American accents. I was convinced that all actors were born in Louisiana. And what a finer local secret than New Orleans! Big Easy, also known as Crescent City, passes through each scene. The writer and director deserve great praise from Sebastian Gutierrez.
