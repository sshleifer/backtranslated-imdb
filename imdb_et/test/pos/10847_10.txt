Both the book and the film are excellent. They differ a little, but it increases and does not reduce what is a great script and action. The historic atmosphere, the young girl who is looking for love, the amazing background of the music hall and the London Lesbian World Travel at the beginning of the 20th century makes it an extraordinary film. Andrew Davies, as a screenwriter, stands out when he writes this lesbian love story with such sensitivity. Rachael Sterling and Keeley Hawes are both great actors and give them the best. The rest is very good. If there were more than 10 out of 10, I'd give it!
