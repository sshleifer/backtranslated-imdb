Lady and Tramp II: Scamp's adventure is a cool movie that many children today really associate. This is a well-told story about a child who wants freedom to do things, and how he or she is doing this freedom is only part of what makes this movie interesting. Just forget the little frustrations, like the fact that in this movie, only the pups had only adults, because it is only 0.5% or less of the film's amazing impact on the viewer. Great music, lively acting, talented animation and leadership, and a powerful story tell the difference between the freedom of New England streets and the cozy home between your family. And no matter how bad things seem, your family and friends are always "always" to help you get a tense place. <br /> <br /> I can't wait to get the soundtrack!
