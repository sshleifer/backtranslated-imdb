Classe tous risques, which was directed by Claude Sautet, was not, frankly, a film I had ever heard until the NYC Film Forum said they had a two-week review of the film with new subtitles. When I also read that it was in the vein of Jean Pierre Melville, a classical French criminal movie, I jumped into the opportunity to check it (at best it would be better with his great work, and at worst I could get a good popcorn in the big theater). It was a worthwhile entrance, because Classe tous risques is one of those French films waiting to be rediscovered (or first discovered). With an amazing, intense diligence, Sautet keeps the first forty minutes of the movie in a tight pitch, keeping a good (if not large) middle section and ending with what is always expected of these films, but with exciting motivation through the characters. With a movie with such a movie, you can learn how it ends, but it's a cool, attentive journey that is read. <br /> <br /> The film has a play that has the true truth and honesty of "the old school's" criminal code "by Lino Ventura of Aldo, who steals criminal with his partner at the beginning of the film (one of the best starting films in this genre and country) If suddenly at night on the beach there is a steep, ugly destiny, Aldo is again with two small children: he will receive the help of Eric Stark (Jean-Paul Belmondo, with Le Doulos only humanity and charisma), who is also a thief and directs him to Paris But there are problems with some of Aldo's old business partners, and one old score may be just the right ticket, a few times the piece seems to be calm, but it is not, like Melville, Sautet does not allow his story fat, and this is a very tightly structured film there are a lot of good humor doses here (I sometimes smiled at the courage of the criminals at the beginning of the queue and with a specific woman who had a fine thing with their cat and fish.) <br /> <br /> not to mention elerue scores, extraordinary cinematography, and rarely filled moods, Adays, Classe tous risques, reminds us that this bridge between a true old school movie and the last day took place. Gangsters in these new live films are the theatrical class and glory of this film at 1,000, and this is the second banana for Melville and Jules Dassini's works (compliment that I assure you). It is also good, realistic and moral.
