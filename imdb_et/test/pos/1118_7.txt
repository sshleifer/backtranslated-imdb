Walter Matthau can always improve a mediocre movie and this movie proves it. He becomes very realistic as a small-time horse trainer and a single father, not one of the roles in the sugar coating. <br /> <br /> He may be in turns with a soft heart and embarrassment, then with his iron hand on his boys, and we see the same approach to training his horses (we see that he does not want his young prospect to race over and hurt in small races) but it seems to be ready to risk the life of the horse when it came to a great time). <br /> <br /> This is just one of Matthau's great performances and one that I highly recommend.
