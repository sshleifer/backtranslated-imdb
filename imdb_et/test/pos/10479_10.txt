"Babette's Party" and "Horse's Mouth" are two of the most understandable, precise films about the true artist. The main features of the "Babette Party" are not, as some other commentators here have said, "the artist is never bad," just two lines that come before and after: "I was able to do them happy when i did my best ... ... the whole world sounds one long crying from the heart of the artist: give me the chance to do my best. "<br /> <br /> For nine years, I produced experimental multimedia music in San Francisco for money for products that included dozens of singers, actors, designers, etc. efforts to do their best. They were like Babette: they were desperate that every dollar needed their best job. Babette's art is good for French cooking and her art is worth Â£ 10,000 for her best performance. If, after years of political isolation from France, separated by two caring spinsters on the dark coast of Scandinavia, he unexpectedly gets $ 10,000, he does what every real artist does: he sees he has a chance to do it unexpectedly does it. He spends all the money so he can do his best work as an artist. The twist of the movie is that we do not know that he is such an artist until he actually serves meals and meals. Until now, he seems to be just a working class French lady with a bit of merchants and very serious (her husband and son were murdered in Paris in 1871). For such an artist, it is secondary to whether there is art that is competent to evaluate it. That's why the author made this dinner for people who didn't understand in any way what they were getting. Babette didn't prepare this meal as a gift from two spinsters or a religious community. His purpose was not to achieve a little reconciliation between members of the religious sect or the spirit of good feelings. Indeed, he never left talking about the kitchen. After a meal, she is sitting alone, drinking wine and not paying attention to how the guests reacted. He is pleased that he is finally able to do his best as an artist. That is why the story is satisfactory and so important that the general appears unexpectedly - because Babette knows right now that the general knows what she has placed before her and appreciates it. Because a great work of art is a tragedy shown to an audience who doesn't even have one person who is competent to evaluate it. He's glad he was very happy, he was the only guest he mentioned during the dinner, the only one he brought out for special care - no spinsters. But he does not plan to eat, knowing that such a person will arrive. <br /> <br /> Everyone who has had the opportunity to enjoy a real first-class Paris dinner as I have (my father was in the 1980s at the Attache of the Paris Navy and I had a honeymoon in France), this dinner, and Babette's satisfaction with doing it and the joy it brings to the dining place is absolutely convincing. If some art has the right to enjoy it, it is baked in France and served with a French meal. This film presents a claim to the recipients of the transformative effects of great art. Before dinner, there are few members of the religious sect who are cumbersome, aggravating the old annoyance. Old hymns cannot restore good friendship; people ignore them, talk about them. But the common experience of sensual great art - because people can enjoy the taste of foods and wines, even if they have no idea that they are experiencing great art - the nation, puts them in a forgiving mood, reconciles them, and encourages them to encourage each other to love and thus have a sacred influence on the bringing of peace. It is a claim to the movement of contemporary art - art can replace traditional religions, making humanity more peaceful. So, contrary to those commentators who say that this film speaks of the power of Christian faith, it is more accurate to say that the film claims that art can heal wounds that a Christian ritual cannot. After all the years in the art world, I have to say that this claim - that art brings peace that religion cannot - is overdone and invalid. But it's pretty nice and it's the second main theme of this beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> One last remark: At the arrival of Babette, spinsters come home with a certain French General Galliff. a person who was executed in 1871 by the wife and son of Babette and imposed the military rule he had to flee. At the end of the film, when the general speaks in Paris about a great meal for many years (before 1871), some military maneuvers ended when the same Galliffet was his host. When the Prime Minister says that story, General Galliffet of France praised this main meal as the biggest woman, the only woman she was risking for her life. Of course this was Babette. The irony, the same French general, who said that he respected Babette from all other women, was responsible for being driven away from France forever.
