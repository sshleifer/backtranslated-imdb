A strange relationship between a middle-aged woman and a transsexual who will soon be a woman. Charlotte and Venorica, both have died of their inanimate life and do not know how to get out of them. Charlotte is the owner of the beauty clinic, she has broken down with her aggressive ex-husband, moved into an apartment with all the furniture except her big bed. Veronica lives under her poor dog, she is sensitive and disturbs desperately and has a bad relationship with her father. His only hope is that the forthcoming transsexual operation makes him a real woman, and then everything is fine. All he can do now is waiting for a type approval certificate. <br /> <br /> Then these two people will meet randomly and gradually, they will all be involved in the lives of others, there will be some sparks between them, but no one will be brave enough to resist the truth because they will not accept the change as most people do. Finally, the end has ended quite satisfactorily and leaves some imagination to think about it. <br /> <br /> The great work of the director gives me a great impression, he is doing very well with the development of the characters, the emotional atmosphere is full and intense. I have so threatened blind lights throughout the apartment, Delphic, but full of desire. <br /> <br /> The two main characters are Trine Dyrholm and David Dencik, they are amazing in their roles, very impressive performance and chemical reaction between them is genuine and convincing. <br /> <br /> This Swedish indie movie is about meetings and changes, whether you're homosexual or heterosexual, male or female, life's strange, everywhere you fall, you get hesitant and confused but at least do not be afraid, follow your heart and choose the right path.
