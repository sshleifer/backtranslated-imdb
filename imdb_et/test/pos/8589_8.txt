A good film, acting in a terrible way, especially from Eriq Ebouaney (Lumumba) and very well managed. <br /> <br /> It also shows how Lumumba was at the corner of Belgium, the United States and the United Nations, and how they marked him as "Communist." scare people like all honest genuine African leaders like Nkrumah, Kenyatta, Nyerere and many others. This shows how Western states proclaim democracy when they have something else behind their thoughts. This is the story of injustice, fighting and brutality. <br /> <br /> This shows how Lumumba was unable to control his people, yes, they were his people, but before we blamed him, did he get enough of what any people he called his government, like Mobutu? Or did his colleague have other things to find out and watch the movie! Certainly Mobutu did, went to rob the country in the next 35 years before he was dropped and fled from the country. A billionaire died. <br /> <br /> Some shortcomings: Too little explanation of how a man (Lumumba) first got up. There should also have been more clarification about the state, Congo Kinshasa (after independence), now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo, formerly called Zaire, when it was under Mobutu. There should have been an explanation for why he (Lumumba) could not keep one piece of Africa's second largest country. And what's going on with Tshombe and Katanga. Just steer when you watch a movie that Tshombe controlled in Katanga, which (if I wasn't wrong) is the world's first copper producer. <br /> <br /> All this is a good movie to see. You will learn something new from Africa, its leaders and people, and probably your eyes will open up why it's going on wars on the continent.
