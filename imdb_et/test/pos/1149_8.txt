In Morocco, where Europeans and Americans completely conquered, at the beginning of the twentieth century, Moroccan leader Mulay Achmed Mohammed el-Raisul abducted (Sean Connery) American Eden Pedecaris (Candice Bergen), his son and his daughter. His goal is to get money and rifles for ransom to fight the corrupt Moroco sultan (Marc Zuber). During the election, American President Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith) agrees with the proposal. But Raisu is betrayed and Eden helps him release prisoners with American soldiers. I don't like movies with explicit colonialism and sovereignty of other countries, but "Lion and Wind" is really a great adventure. Active scenes are very realistic. Candice Bergen, the most beautiful American actress of the 1970s, is wonderful in presenting a robbed woman like a remarkable film "Soldier Blue". Sean Connery is perfect, as usual, as an honest and national religious leader. Brian Keith is great as American president. I don't know much about Moroccan history to analyze if there is truth in this story, but this movie is a worthwhile entertainment. It is only available in VHS in Brazil. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Vento e o Le√£o" ("Lion and Wind") <br /> <br />
