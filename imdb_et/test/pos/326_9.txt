I've seen this movie when it appeared, and it is undoubtedly touching the heart. I liked the boy who learned that what he was thinking of him wasn't really true. It's this little kid. And his search to find out who he is. And before and after he knows he has a relationship between him and his mother. This is a nice view. R Rahman adds his stress through good re-recording and songs. This film does not speak or give advice (as in Vuyire), but simply tells the characters as they are. And that's why the movie hits the audience exactly. The Chakkarvarthy and Nandhada Basin Bath Scene did not perfectly communicate what it meant. Mani Ratnam has been amazingly improved.
