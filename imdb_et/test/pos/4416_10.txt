One of the greatest American masterpieces, Morrissey opens the film for sexual Dallesandro, where her open mouth tends to get on the pillow. We don't know if he's going out of heroin? We'll see her face, flash, her body, lightning, her naked. I can't think of another movie that used this flash-blip format so well to create a hypnotic, narcotic mood, a editing method that works great in both tempo and style. After this introduction, when Dallesandro opens his mouth, his accent is looting - we expect him to be a soft androgynous; Instead, he has a street thug voice - Morrissey is not comfortable, letting our assumptions remain unchecked. Long-term opening is very sexy and playful - it is a combination of martial arts, Dallesandro's exciting lips rubbing and early morning sexual contests. it all moves together, if not smoothly, then emotionally realistic. <br /> <br /> What I got was the same thing I got from "The 400 Blows" when I first saw it - it's like a 20-fold continuation of this story. There is a mindset between sellers and buyers of meat; when Dallesandro walks on the street looking for men (to finance his wife's abortion), it feels like a secret handshake when the guys work with each other. I'm never bored, though nothing happens - nothing happens great, boys hanging as they do, waiting for tricks. The main trick that Dallesandro finds it interesting is to look at the Greek descriptions and only touch the back of the form to a man of worship of the aesthetic body. It's also terribly funny ("I'm not talking to an empty bed, am I?"). It's one of the film's most revealing scenes - in any movie; definitely every movie that deals with sex and sex. If Dallesandro's eyes look red and swollen, we can't say whether it's because he's drunk, ashamed, embarrassed or all. <br /> <br /> The conversations in the movie are cut - they're not important. (The film is quietly in some scenes, some nice and beautiful that you will ever experience.) But when Morrissey chooses one, how does it contain (we have it together), it's amazing, for example, one conversation between Dallesandro and newbie hustler - and neither of them mentioned the word "gay" or "hustler". Here is a scene where we listen to a pair of transvestites, as Dallesandro maintains - just after explaining to the beginner how to use this work. <br /> <br /> Dallesandro is a noteworthy topic for both his clients and Morrissey. He is less effective as an actor, acting as an example, but as far as he is something he is incredible - he is someone we want to know right now, but we pass through our experience, everything with his complexity, and we 're forced to try him . He's such an empty slate we pull, but we can't hold it. And, of course, he is incredibly striking - forgetting everything else, it's partly a female body beauty, a dallesandro's gorgeous torso and a permanent nip. <br /> <br /> The film has one devastating scene, but like anything else you can't really do - the girl says she's raped and her only self-defense is to say that if the rapist asked for sex she would made him better. It's crushing. The film has a feeling for everyone, but even better, it is not just sympathetic, but tries to help people understand - and without ever dictating what it is, we need to understand. It doesn't see people inside the movie. It seems inclusive when we see Joe's hand around the transvestite. If he reads a letter (he says that at one point he has not passed the eighth grade), he is completely charming because he stops the word ... then says "woteva" and continues. <br /> <br /> Based on the interaction between Dallesandro and one of his clients, you can learn something deeper than gay straight-line relationships than any case study. Here is a young boy who smiles (his upper lip disappears when he does it) when the Korean war veteran of a 30-degree gym hall travels through his fingers with his fingers; this is a scene that looks very deep, this adult man who shares something with a younger version - it's not two homosexual men, or a gay man who pays a straight man, it's something you can't put on your finger; Sexuality issues are next to the point. (Never before has the pimple been affectionate.) After they had emotionally shared something with each other (although with Dallesandro because he is there for money, it is never visible even though he is never less than sincere, can be his most limited "So ... can you help me?" The man says confident. "I don't think about my pants!" 10/10
