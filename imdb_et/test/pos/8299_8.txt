Rugged David Innes (solid Doug McClure) and violent Dr. Abner Perry (stunningly spotted Peter Cushing) drilled his core into the mole machine. The Duo discovers an ancient prehistoric world inhabited by dangerous giant wild animals and people used by both food and slaves by bad telepathic pterodactyls. Director Kevin Conner, who works in Milton Subotsky's gently stupid manuscript, maintains a steady pace and treats the extraordinarily foolish assumption with astonishing severity, thereby giving the picture some harshly serious quality that is fun and enjoyable equally. Lovingly (not so) special effects are quite (inadvertently) funny. Particularly odorless price queries are positively lateral: cruddy guys-in-obvious-shoddy-rubber-suits pterodactyl men, equally rinky-dink savage ape-man brutes, and a hilariously ridiculous fire frog thing who blows real good. One intestinal burst occurs when McClure interferes with this fat and clumsy giant reptile. Another priceless scene depicts a dinosaur that slides into a doll in its slave jaws. What's more, we have a lot of horrible and even fascinating slavery. This is a complete treatment when you see that Cushing grabs it in a rarely wide comic section and becomes an unlikely but enthusiastic arrow cut in the last third of the hero. The ever-admiring Caroline Munro looks like a cheerful princess, Dia, and Cy Grant, a warrior warrior Ra and Sean Lynch as a cowardly coward Hoojah, is a nice support. Mike Vicker's well-diversified score alternates between young orchestral works and dirty drone synthesizers. Alan Hume's sharp cinematography adds glossy shine to the infectious process. Complete campy rebellion.
