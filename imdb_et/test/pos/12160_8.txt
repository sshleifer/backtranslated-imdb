Under his control of continental Europe, Hitler is preparing the last obstacle to his journey ahead of North America, Britain. Aircraft Goering Luftwaffe's top position seems unstoppable on paper. In the air, however, RAF consistently attacked the paradigm by blowing the enemy's air at seven to one speed. The British battle has been going on for over a year, because the island's people are bloody, but unacceptable, providing their American allies with a decisive time to produce more weapons for the inevitable struggle. <br /> <br /> Using more than three previous documentary "Why our Fight" series, the British Battle has more propaganda lessons, such as dramatic (some with unmistakable Warner music scores), which is obviously an obvious newspaper. During the devastation caused by the German air strikes, the seventh symphony of Beethoven has been used in the ironic twist to emphasize visual suffering. The story itself is one of the remarkable courage of the diligent people who refused to do so under the destructive attacks until then, as an invincible war machine. It's the 20th century version of 300 Spartans. <br /> <br /> This battle has been followed by a more thoroughly explored and better-looking business effort after this movie, but the direct and motivated battle of Britain has always been to turn it into a more valuable document for England during its "Finest Hour".
