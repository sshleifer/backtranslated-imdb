This movie is complex and interesting in so many ways. This is an unsatisfactory amount of emotional and taboo issues. Sex and love. Men's Emotional Abuse, Men's Physical Abuse, Sexual Abuse of Children, Fresh Approach to Faith in Real Life, and Everything related to Very Raw and Powerful Blues Music. </p> Sit through the first 20 minutes if you find all the characters being paired and improved. And the end is more pleasant than expected. The music is outstanding, the writing is powerful and the act of everyone was brilliant. <br /> <br /> The DVD has some great features including Samuel Jackson's background to learn to play the guitar and blues. /> This film is not for children and I even warn teenage parents.
