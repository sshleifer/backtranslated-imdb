Food always makes a good thing in movies because "Chocolat" showed. "Babette Party" is the same type of thing. Babette Harsant (Stephane Audran) is a French chef who escapes from his homeland after the 1871 repression. He moves to a very religious village in Denmark. People in this village just don't use joy. This means that until Babette cooks them one of your fine meals. <br /> <br /> It's not just that this movie is about entertaining in a place that has never felt it. Like other Scandinavian films (and non-Hollywood films in general), this shows that the film can keep your interests without using explosions, car rides, etc. One more thing. Do you think the Danish word "party" sounds a bit like "tastebud"?
