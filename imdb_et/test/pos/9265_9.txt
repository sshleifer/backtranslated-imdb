I was a fan of the TV show at "Homicide: Life on the Street", but became a very fan. It was a police show unlike the others: visually different when using handheld cameras, with the viewer everywhere, with its multi and mutagular casting, and their varied and exciting individuals, and that covered the whole good and bad police department, including corruption and the personality exposed to this bubble surface. Destruction: Watching a movie is as good as a movie made on television. After Mrs Giardello (Yaphet Kotto), now a candidate for Mayor of Baltimore, a series of cast members is shot to help find the killer. In addition, cast members who are in power and dead persons are also able to take their place in the film. The strength and fire that marked the return of the series, and the script broke the same fire that marked the series. All in all, there is a terrible TV movie. <br /> <br /> Vote: 9
