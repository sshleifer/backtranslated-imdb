If it hadn't been to kill Mockingbird, this film would be much more famous. If Gregory Peck hadn't been to Addicus Fitch, acting here would be much more commendable. If it hadn't been for William Faulkner, maybe killing Mockingbird would never have been written in the shadows. <br /> <br /> I found this film unfortunately familiar, because it showed me that one of my favorite movies, Kill Mockingbird, may not be as original as I always thought it was. Perhaps this very similar film was inspired. Oh, "whodunn" is a different, but the underlying story, a single fair "white" lawyer against a white southern city who defended a black man is too familiar. And when a woman writes, Mockingbird focuses on rape, the woman's ultimate betrayal, while the film focuses on brother hate, rape that a man feels fraternal betrayal. <br /> <br /> Mockingbird here. Not the comfort that Addicus brings with his presence. So you just left with sadness that he was going to raise this movie or not, Harper Lee reflects Mockingbird. During the 10-year period, nothing has changed since he had read the Faulkner book and had seen his film in Alabama and unconsciously or most of his years later. Nothing changed in race relations and some may say that nothing has changed even now, years later. <br /> <br /> It's too sad to know, and one wants our day's addicus to be right. When Mockingbird leaves you with the hope that Addicus's hands are running around and waiting for better times, this film just leaves you sad that the pride of black people can be equal to the pride of the White people. But pride is not the answer at all. <br /> <br /> Rather, it is the Addicus response we need, the comfort that we are all faulty, and that in our weakness we should be merciful, not pride. another in our differences.
