Most of Chaplin's most famous films are his full-length features. And I assume that most people have seen only a few of his staples in their early days when he played tens and dozens of short comedy shorts. It's really a shame, because some great shorts are waiting to discover the world in the 21st century. <br /> <br /> When someone watches this movie, they have a great chance to see Chaplin's better shorts because Chaplin himself chose these three shorts and made them a little narrative to make a 1959 feature film. This is great for a number of reasons. Firstly, in Chaplin's earlier films from 1914 to 1915, his little tramp is still in his early incarnation or absent. In addition, even if he is there, he was often meaningful and self-centered - something very strange about the small tramp that we loved. Secondly, because the selected shorts were in very good condition, when you look at this movie, you don't have to worry about watching tough movies and empty music works that are not fit for action (a common problem). /> <br /> So that Chaplin's shorts look great, give this film a chance. This will definitely give you a great laugh.
