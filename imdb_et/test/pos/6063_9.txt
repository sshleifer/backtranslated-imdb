This production, based on true Danish criminal fetuses, is an experience of excellent leadership, acting at all levels and having a nerve that is often not observed in the crime series. Every episode is an excitement because the hole team seems to believe "it's my life right now - this murder or murders are my responsibility to solve" and the output is brilliant. <br /> <br /> As a spectator, you just have this wonderfully perfect entertainment because it seems that their focus is expedient or not, lie to them that they have a good time ...: o) Don't miss it, it's just right 'Brothers quality band and this is an experience that has' seen' - What a wonderful crime time!
