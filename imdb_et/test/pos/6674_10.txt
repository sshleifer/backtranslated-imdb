I thought this movie was very underestimated. The theme seems to be a bit strange, and I was put off at first, but when I saw the movie, it didn't seem strange at all. I was interested in all the different ways the story offered, and I couldn't wait to find out how it would end. When it's over, I thought for a long time. I was pleased with the ending of K-Pax, the exhibition and the story, and the scientific elements and psychological issues. This is not a particularly horrible or happy movie, although it makes you occasionally confuse, but I found it to be especially fun and thought-provoking. I own it now and I intend to watch it several times.
