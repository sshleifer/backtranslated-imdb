If this film is carefully examined, it's a little sad. It is detailed enough to address the very real problems that children grow up in a poor, insecure environment. Yet it retains its comic value, Diahann Carroll and James Earl Jones. Sadness lies in the struggle of mother (Carroll) and dysfunction, who cannot really help their children, not because she does not want or try, but because it is obvious that she does not know how. Remember, this is a comedy, but if you have never seen it or if you have it, look at this movie and see humanity characters. Good movie.
