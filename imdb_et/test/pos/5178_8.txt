My whole family enjoyed this movie, including 2 little kids. Great values ​​without sex, violence, drugs, nudity or embarrassment. Also, no special effects from zillion dollars were added to try to distract viewers from a poorly written storyline. Easy little family fun movie. We especially like the songs in the movie. But we could only hear some of the songs ... Mostly during the final credit ... I'd like to buy a soundtrack CD from this movie. This is my fourth Bill Hillman movie and they all have the same instructions as mentioned above. With all the movies you don't want your kids to look at, Hillman Fella doesn't have a risk rating. We love our movies.
