The First Reviewer Is Right - In this film we see ourselves fighting for the majority, being pleasant, trying to get away without effort, just trying to live our lives, and seeing how easily these very human traits are so important to the functioning of society, can bring with us the involvement of great evil. <br /> <br /> The story has taken place during World War II, radio, newspapers, and movies that remind us of Hitler's attacks on Jews to emphasize the irony that violent antisemitism is taking place in America. Sometimes it seemed to me a bit of a difficult hand. <br /> <br /> It looks more like a game than a movie, but it's so thoughtful that such knees mean little. Perhaps less trivial is the fact that the whole plot is related to one small fact that hit me rather unlikely. Larry has lived until the Middle Ages with an uneven life; But all he takes is putting his eyes on everyone - everyone - to take him at first glance for the Jews. I wanted to stop the belief inadvertently because the plot kept me alive, but the insecurity disturbed me all over the film. (And frankly, I did not understand why he took the wife for the Jews. Larry seemed so because his name was "Hart." And later, when he married him, I do not know why his neighbors assumed he was a Jew. ) For the first part of the movie, I was wondering if it was fantasy elements. Larry's discomfort seemed exaggerated, almost to the grotesque point. Why not invite the police to see rape, even if the attacker was a neighbor? And I thought the lighting seemed to be something unreal - the red of the houses seemed too red, the entrance of Gertrude seemed deliberately illuminated, generally the colors were almost pastel in intensity. <br /> <br /> In credits, I can see that it was filmed on Campbell Avenue and Wallace Avenue in Toronto, so I'm going to go there today (near Bloor and Dufferin) to see the colors. Really :) It was good to remind that the ministers often led the evil of racism at that time. (Remember how the Pope refused to talk to Hitler trying to get the church alone? By the way, it was the same Pope who, when Rome was liberated by American troops, asked the first soldiers to enter the city is not black. Check your history.) never remembers this movie before. It is a pity. Certainly, it is of interest to all thinkers who are interested in American history or racism; this is one of the clearest illustrations I've ever seen in Bertrand Russell's dictation, "Don't go with the crowd to do evil."
