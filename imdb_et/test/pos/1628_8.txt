This is the correct adaptation of Dan Brown's breath-taking book. I can't say it's new or very good, but they made a movie that you can enjoy. However, the great story would have been better. The film is pretty long, but finally I felt that some things were missing. Sound effects and sound tracks were very good. Operation was fine, but the character development phase was very weak. People who haven't read a book can see things too quickly. From my perspective, they would have tried to put so many things in the book that they would have tried to make the most important scenes better. What makes the book very good was all this, a story combined with Vatican's great portraits. You can't see it in the movie. The main problems of the film are too much haste and time not to use well. So, it's worth a look, but it could have been better.
