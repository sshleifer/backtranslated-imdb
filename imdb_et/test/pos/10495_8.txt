It was a film that first made me know what the great actor Martin Sheen was. He says modestly that Charlie is a better actor, Charlie can't keep him on the candle. <br /> <br /> I found this to be enchanting and enjoyed the intertwining of the story of love with the main plot (and I usually HATE love letters). At the end, there is a big twist on the plot that hit me completely, especially in the early 1980s, and probably now. <br /> <br /> The last scene was on the edge of my seat. This film obviously shows that those who we trust are often giving up on the betrayal, while the declared enemies have more in common than they suspect, and finally we find that human compassion is where we least expect it. <br /> <br /> Irenose
