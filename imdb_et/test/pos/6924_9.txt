If you watch this movie because Michael Caine or Michael Gambon is in it, don't worry, it's not their typical role, although I found Gambon's fantastic. Instead, look at this from Dylan Moran. I'm a fan of everything I've seen, and it's not an exception, I didn't even think he could act, but even the characters he had to find incredibly impressive, given the audience that they were fake. <br /> <br /> The plot is a genius, and although it is not continuous, there are many other charms all the time. A good movie for people with a sense of humor.
