Based on the manga of the well-known artist Masamune Shirow, this animated feature was a little disappointing for me. <br /> <br /> The story is good, but animation is just "OK" if it should have been remembered. The film is enough in the IMO, but it seems somehow flat and uninspired if you know what I mean. The destroyed opportunity, if you think that Shirow's second work, "Ghost In The Shell", is considered classic in many aspects. It set new standards for Japanese animation and created a brilliant series of "GiTS: Stand Alone Complex". <br /> <br /> I think it's worth renting if you're not a Shirow fan and I want it all. Check the original manga, which is highly recommended.
