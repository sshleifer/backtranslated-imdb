In New York, the group brings together fresh reporters who have been successfully tried. For four years, their dreams, scams, success, love and personal dramas are unveiled by the ambitious Ralph Garci of Doris Finsecker (Maureen Teefy), the homosexual Montgomery (Payl McCrane), the aggressive Leroy (Gene Anthony Ray), the promising Coco (Irene Cara) Barry Miller) and their friends until their closing day. <br /> <br /> Twenty-eight years ago, Fame was very successful. show business and I loved this movie and audio track on CD. I just looked at the "Fame" DVD and now I would say it's a good movie with only great potential, but with too many bad blocks. The story follows too many characters and leaves many situations unanswered. I don't know if Alan Parker had problems with shortening the working time of this movie, but what happened to ballerina going to the abortion clinic? What happened to Leroy and his teacher, did he fail due to his grammar problem? What happened to Coco after dressing her up in this croquet apartment? A musician who plays a synthesizer and his proud father is left behind in the subfield. Anyway, "Fame" is still a pleasant entertainment and cult movie. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Fama" ("Fame")
