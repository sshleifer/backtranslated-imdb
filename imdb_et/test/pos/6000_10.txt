Gulliver's Travels is a satirical novel by Jonathan Swift, a great misanthropist. It is therefore not advisable to decide on this film. We need to go deeper into the human conscience to get Swift to guide us. Gulliver has lived for the truthfulness of the journey, loneliness, understanding that can be his real life. We can't just sit back and watch this movie, saying it is so cute or so boring. The question is much farther and I would like everyone to wait. This is the greatest film ever when you know the truths of Ted Danson's character: the unforgettable Lemuel Gulliver.
