Mural K. Thallur's powerful debut film, which examines the events of a group of high school students, in one or another way in a crisis. The film begins with the discovery of one pupil's body, and then monitors the group's lives during the previous hours, leaving the audience until the last minute concerning the identity of the deceased person. Every major character faces major stress factors that we can see as potentially suicidal. The creators of the unknown give full power to power and emotion. Well done, especially considering the young writer / director who was 19 years old when writing the script.
