The murders of numbers are a pretty good movie. Even if the plot rolls at a snail's pace, which all Sandra Bullock's all-in-one mixes with his partner, and a movie that flashes back to the previous trauma, it can take part in the movie. In saying this, I think it is a good job to set up such a terrible type of "who did it". It will keep you where one of the boys was really behind the murder, if not both. I think Ryan Gosling and the other boy (lol) are doing a good job of selling this temptation and dork relationship. Not sure Gosling is playing a bad ass, but a boy who later celebrates a movie like a Notebook, did a pretty good job. When the film is rolling, I really found myself involved in the story, asking myself, "Oh God, what would I do if I was in such a situation?" As I said, it is a good CSI-type film, perhaps not for the junkie of the drama of the EXTREME crime drama, but good circumcision. <br /> <br /> 8 outta 10
