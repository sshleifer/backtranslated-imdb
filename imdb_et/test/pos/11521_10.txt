I must say that this film had a great cast, location, music and camera. Cameron Diaz was great, he was a very exciting roll, very scary, while Jordana Brewster had a serious roll but one more. to me, Jordana is very nostalgic, she remembers her wife's classmate! what really got in my movie was a very skilfully planned camera work and location selection. the story is very passionate. it must be one. the one who is in the mystery films should look at it, I guarantee you everything that will keep you in place until the end.
