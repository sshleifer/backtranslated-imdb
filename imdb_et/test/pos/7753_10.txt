On the surface of the TMHS, there seems to be another general high school drama; but surprisingly hidden underneath is the enormous amount of depth, originality and eccentricity that not only makes it unforgettable for the viewer, but also undoubtedly transforms one of the best anime media has produced in recent years. <br /> <br /> We see the world through Kyoni's eyes, who at Haruhi Suzumiya, a girl who boldly asserts to the rest of the class, that she has no interest in "normal people", and invites all aliens randomly, time for passengers, sliders or espers to meet him. Kyon looks incredible, wondering if he's joking or a couple of screws open. But he's gonna talk to his gut instincts. In doing so, it turns out that he is not an ordinary university. Not long after, he creates his own "SOS Brigade" school club and pulls Kyon among other very unfortunate people. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this anime complies with the usual standard conventions, Kyon the protagonist is too cynical to pessimist and gives the exhibition a funny story. A normal 2D male-dominated character that tends to fill the environment. The episodes themselves are not chronological and cause the viewer to think about the occurrence of events and how they relate to previous cases. It's a genius mark; the effect is like a jig-saw puzzle, because the new piece is placed, we get a bigger picture of the lesson. Previous scenes now have a whole new meaning and their realization is profoundly satisfactory. However, this means that he feels open (which is something else), a very carefully written script has missed this problem and ensured that it flows smoothly from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The story itself is amazingly original, but I don't risk going beyond the simple bare skeleton I gave earlier, because it will undoubtedly spoil you. However, what I mention is a lot of genres that range from comedy to sci-fi. How they managed to achieve this in the space of fourteen episodes, and that is undoubtedly a great achievement in itself. pretty much anyone with an anime interest. Look at it, rather unusually it is something that lives in a huge leap that it has received and even surpasses.
