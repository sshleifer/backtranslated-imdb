Deepa Mehta's "Fire" is groundbreaking, bold and artistic. A masterful social commentary on the situation of women in conservative middle-class middle-class Indian households is a film that no one should leave. Shabana Azmi and Nandita Das give the stars performances that play their character as much as possible. A.R. Rahman's music is a genius and plays a role of almost another character in the film. Mehta uses Rahman's score and together, these amazing sound assemblies that effectively represent the views of Radha and Sita worlds when they support each other. This film does not mean lesbianism because many have celebrated it. Lesbian is just part of the movie. It is unfortunate that most people tend to write the film, calling it taboo, rather than giving it the chance and the real meaning of it.
