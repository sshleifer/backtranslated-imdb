Now it's classic. One of my friends told me about this flick, saying it was incredibly flat, stupid, slowed, and moral. He also said that I love it. <br /> <br /> To my surprise, I found it available on netflix and hired it immediately. I'm just shocked that I've never heard it before. If I could give it to each other, I would. <br /> <br />
