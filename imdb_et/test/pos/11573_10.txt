This is probably the best film that has been filmed for at least the last five years. I've always believed that crying people is much more difficult than laughing at them. If you want to see 400 adults crying out in the same room, watch this movie. It's breathtaking. Javier Bardem plays the role of his life. You cry, laugh, smile ... The most valuable thing is that everyone in Spain knows Ramon Sampedro. Personally, I knew the whole story and even the end. So, the film's top level is how the story is spoken. And in this area is the master of Amenabar THE. <br /> <br /> This movie is BLACK.
