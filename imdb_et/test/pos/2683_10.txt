In short, the TV comedy series, which has the best cast ever, is also the most enjoyable. Each one is the first hand comedy actor. I know only one of the best TV series (ie "Moonlighting"). ) that one was Willis as a leader? but it was just Willis, while the king of the queen is in the pocket of actresses that is as good as you can enjoy - Kevin James, Leah Remin, Jerry Stiller, Patton Oswalt, Nicole Sullivan, Victor Williams, Gary Valentine, and even all of them? I enjoyed it spontaneously and constantly and immediately. The additional age did not violate anyway. <br /> <br /> In some words, the series is intelligent and original, spellboundly saved from the current TV foolishness and rubbish. It is politically incorrect and does not put minorities in the usual disgusting way. <br /> <br /> The comic is very tasty and delicious. <br /> <br /> I mainly read IMDb. writers, and sometimes they write about their favorite exhibitions, even though these writers are many, I could not find any of them the slightest reputation for my favorite TV shows (- but it is true that those who like it do not like those with whom it fully accepts but those who at least offer a common ground of condemnation, mainly WILD WILD WEST, MOONLIGHTING, QUEENS, FANTOMAS, 80s TWILIGHT ZONE, Bradbury TV Show and SANDOKAN.Most of them have been seen when I was 13; enforceable.
