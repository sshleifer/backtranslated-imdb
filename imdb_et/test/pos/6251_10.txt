The 1979 tourist trap is a smart, unique B-thriller that stands out as one of the best. Certainly, passengers are alone in wax museum stays where the owner's dummies are comfortable Although the movie has tips on Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Tourist Trap is a crappy psychological thriller that deserves the Twilight Zone. Director David Schmoeller gives this film an atmosphere of darkness and mystery that reaches horrible proportions. Schmoelloer also adds a random comic to an unusual event. <br /> <br /> Venteran actor Chuck Connors is the best liar of the movie. Pino Donaggio's music score is great, having both lyrical and festive themes that are ideal for the film. Several movie sequences are quite memorable. <br /> <br /> At the same time, for horror and thrillers, the tourist is an unforgettable movie that is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 Off ****
