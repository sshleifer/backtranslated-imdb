I've only seen this movie once and I wait for it again and again. Dear David (from Beligium), why did you watch a comment on this movie? I just think we can think of you (after reading your comments) is that you are really a non-sexual person (as in the Erika movie) and you are not ready for a new cinema that is coming. I think you're a bit old and sexual expression is not part of your "visage". The Cannes Film Festival is by far the best film festival, and I am pleased to say that this film received the award: Best Actor, Best Actress and Grand Prix. Isabelle Huppert is great, as always, who does this movie as she does? One of his best performances. The music is fantastic and Michael Haneke puts it on the big screen again. It's like a Dogma95-type movie that's on the subject. Try to see it. <br /> <br />
