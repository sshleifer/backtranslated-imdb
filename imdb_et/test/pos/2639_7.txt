It's not the Fast Times. But look at this movie, it's the heart. Pour yourself a drink and enjoy. It is loaded with just the starting letters. Sherilyn Fenn has her first screen credited home. Chris Penn, Lea Thompson, Eric Stotz, Jenny Wright, Rick Moran, etc. - they all look so young. Oh, and if you look closely, the police spouse, Nancy Wilson, is the rock band Heart.
