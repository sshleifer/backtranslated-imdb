Last Dinosaur is a movie designed to be fun and exciting. This will both succeed. <br /> <br /> Maston is the biggest hunter who heats a big game (go to the drawing). Owning a company is going to make an expedition with a group of people, including a photographer called frankie, a Japanese scientist, a man working for his company called Chuck, and an African boy who has helped him in many Safari names Bun Ta. The aim is to explore what is considered a Tyrannosaurus Rex, a dinosaur that killed the last expedition in the region. They reach this prehistoric area by taking a drilling machine that moves underwater called Polar Borer. After arriving in the area, they will soon find Tyrannosaurus, which Maston is trying to shoot, but his weapon remains closed. Chuck immediately realizes that Maston always wanted to hunt for a dinosaur to add to his collection of "stuffed animals". When they were gone, Tyrannosaurus invaded his camp and took Polar Borer away from his camp. On return, the group understands that they may be in the area longer than they expected, and Maston says he is killing Tyrannosaurus. <br /> <br /> The story is great for a fantastic movie. Drilling in a prehistoric area is something that seems really possible. The landscape is beautiful and looks like a place where dinosaurs would still live. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie too. Maston is a typical big hunter who wants to get something that could be a trophy to kill. Bun He was also a great player who was previously played by NBA Luther Rackley, who really looks and acts like an African observer. Jackie is a typical woman who causes problems for a group and it doesn't seem to belong to the wilderness. Chuck is a former Maston worker who has a position with his superior when he is in the wild. <br /> <br /> In this movie, Tyrannosaurus is one of the best in the movie. It's a little too right-handed as Godzilla does and it drags the tail so it's a boy boy. But the suit looks good, especially the head and tail, and Tyrannosaurus looks good and very scary. I've seen many other movies where dinosaurs are worse off. The film Tyrannosaurus is sometimes emitted by Godzilla and other times, such as King Kong "King Kong Escapes" and "King Kong vs Godzilla". It's a great Tyrannosaurus. <br /> <br /> There are many actions in the last dinosaur. Particularly important is the great struggle with Tyrannosaurus and Triceratops. There is also an excellent scene where Bun tries to defeat Tyrannosaurus. There are other big parts that I don't give away. You have to see yourself. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone. Look at it and you don't have to be disappointed.
