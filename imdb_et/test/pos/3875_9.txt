I saw Borderline several years ago at AMC. I've already searched for it. It was haunting: visual, textural, sensual. This film took me as a dream and I don't care where. I will never forget the curtain that is blowing. I still remember how it tilted in my head. I remember my facial expressions when I saw it. I didn't know what happened when the movie was over, but I think life is like that. It didn't bother me. Unfortunately, the injustice of the ultimate rejection of innocent characters really hits me. I loved the face of how the camera lived on them. The camera looked at the set with the incredible eyes of dreams. Borderline was real to me with no movies. The lack of explanation, color, sharpness made it enter into consciousness like a thief of power. I love this movie. One day own it.
