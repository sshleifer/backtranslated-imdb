Again, I have read all the comments here and agree with many intelligent ones, but I fully agree with those who think it is / is hockey. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think nuclear energy is the only energy we have left, unless our governments (allies and states) increase subsidies to think that homeowners use photographic equipment on their roofs. Many attractive and expensive homes in Southern Calfifornia are designed and built to take advantage of the cleanest energy in the sun. I live in an attic that has been exposed to all sunlight throughout the day. I hardly use AC - I'm sure it would consume too much electricity to change the intense heat in the attic about five degrees cooler. We are blessed with "dry" heat in this part of the country. I am on the Gulf Coast so I know about moisture ....... <br /> <br /> I said I found a "Chinese syndrome" convincingly about what could go wrong if industry is not busy with nuclear power plants regulation and control. I think there are enough comments here to illuminate those who are still afraid they are plague: they are safe. TMI is still online .... <br /> <br /> Director James Bridges carefully guides this plot (by Mike Gray-T by Cook) to skip and think thoughtfully on a movie of interest. All roles were well played: Jane Fonda ("Kimberly Wells"), Jack Lemmon (Jack Godell) and producer Michael Douglas ("Richard Adams") are all excellent in their roles and all the rest. I liked that there was no score. It was so interesting that I got a glimpse of the real background of the TV industry - it shouldn't be surprising, now Dan is complaining about CBS, and I hope he wins. Do you believe Donald Trump says, "He's a loser" ? Trump - Who cares? "Tiberius1234" posted a very good comment here - I agree. The leak is much better than living in a world that is wasted and becomes "Blade Runner" and / or "Solyent Green". Get away from your video games for a few hours and watch this "dated" movie and get a little education about nuclear power.
