I discovered it late in the night with Turner's classic. I said to myself, "I'll turn it off as soon as it's funny," but it goes without saying that I was looking through the way. <br /> <br /> I am a movie junkie, but I never even had a good movie (or when I did in 1971 I forgot). Just look at Goldie Hawn's performance as a tongue-ingenie. His act is a revelation in this film. Yes, the script is sharp and great (when the last time Hollywood made a comedy with a smart script?), But its action is extraordinary. I've never understood how funny Goldie could be, and that makes her later performances like Laugh-In and Private Benjamin a little sad. In his later career, he is too exaggerated compared to his minimalist, evil funny look. <br /> <br /> It is a pleasure to watch the young Matthau, the great Bergman and star-friendly, but that's Goldie Hawn who makes this movie again worthwhile.
