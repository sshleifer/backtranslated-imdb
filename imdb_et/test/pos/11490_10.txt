It's frustrating that many people don't understand this movie. Lack of peripheral elements is the absence of the true meaning of this film. This film talks about the minority of people who really believe in love and truth. He points out that in today's society, people often say what sounds good now without having to support things when things get caught up. as someone else said it was obvious in the number of divorces. Some people believe that marriage is forever. Forget about stereotypes or anything else, but rather focus on what's important after your heart, and fight for whoever you believe. I liked this end because it would have been easy to go, but instead came to the reality that the culprit is great, and you should fight everything you have, but sometimes it is not enough. Too often, people just give up love and forget. late.
