After I saw it for the first time, I thought, "Wow, this is the most outstanding film, visually speaking, I've ever seen." Since then, I've seen some of it, but it's still one of the best in this department. I'm just annoyed when the long-awaited DVD was so badly made that its transmission quality was barely better than VHS tape. <br /> <br /> Jungle scenes are filmed in Cameroon and "lush" is the best adjective to describe what you see. Except for jungle sounds, "seeing" is almost all at first, because there is almost no "hearing", no dialogue until Tarzan (Christopher Lambert) interacts with Ian Holm and vice versa. you haven't watched this movie. <br /> <br /> All I say is that it is not Tarzan, many of whom knew in Johnny Weismuller's films ..... but this is not a complaint. For those intimidation measures that don't care about cinematography, you just have to go out of this silent introduction period <br /> <br /> In this Tarzan version, our hero goes back to Scotland (his roots), adapts to this environment (mostly .... and a bit too fast) trustworthy) and then returns to the jungle without Jane. This is said to be more true of Tarzan's books written by Edgar Rice Burroughs. <br /> <br /> Rick Baker, one of the best companies, got special effects here. Sharp DVD or not, this is still a stunning movie that can be viewed and very interesting in all its 2 hours and 15 minutes.
