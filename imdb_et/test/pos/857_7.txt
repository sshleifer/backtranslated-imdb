I hit this movie locally with t.v. around 4:30 am I had no expectations about it, but after the opening credit I knew I had something good. <br /> <br /> There are situations that remain in your interpretation to find out what really happened, so your attention is a key factor. <br /> <br /> The whole psychological thriller situation deals with a lot of character development and how things are done by the main character. <br /> <br /> - Consciousness also plays an important role, because through events and dialogues you can correctly interpret and create an opinion. <br /> <br /> The technical aspects are very good. Actually good. Kelly Overtone is extremely sexy and she is candy-eyed, although she is mostly in her white outfit. <br /> <br /> Factor is almost non-existent, but there are many secrets and tensions. <Br>> <br /> I recommend it to those who enjoy supernatural and psychological thrillers.
