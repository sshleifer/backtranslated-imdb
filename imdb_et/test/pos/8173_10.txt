I have something good to say about this delicious and warm-hearted film. I think the film director's / writer's efforts are bold and inspiring. I loved this movie not only a fantastic story (which I had to say), but also about how the actors gave the story. This is not yet a low "gay movie" that depicts stereotypical signs of humorous situations. It was a memorable and flawless attempt to show people that love really does not know borders, and love is as beautiful and wonderful as it always was. Another thing that touched my heart was how well I could relate to the emotion depicted in this film that surrounds one of the main characters. We all have to go through similar situations in our society, where we live, and we feel this departure from everything that is "right" and "normal." I give my heartfelt thanks for this fabulous and bold story.
