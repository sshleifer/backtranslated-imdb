It's a romantic, though cheesy movie, one of my all-time favorites. This is one of many classes of 80's genres such as "Pretty in Pink" or "Some Wonderful". <br /> <br /> Nic plays a traditional valley in love with punk guy, preppy girl Julie. It is a heart-warming love story that makes you root to finally win a girl. <br /> <br /> True, most of the actors are sucking, but ... <br /> <br /> I've been in love with Nic because it was seen in theaters and seen almost every movie she's already been on. He has really grown as an actor, but in this early film it is obvious that he has a lot of potential. <br /> <br /> If you love 80's, you will love this classics. <br /> <br /> Go for rent !!!!!
