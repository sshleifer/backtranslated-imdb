planktonrules comments must be written on Topsy-Turvy Day, because everything that this simple form of life has said is the opposite of the truth of truth. <br /> <br /> "Blue Eight Wife" is fun in every scene - chemistry between Colbert and Cooper would not have been finer ... support is great. <br /> <br /> Writing and direction are great !!! <br /> <br /> Like many other comments on this table again, I lie: "Why can't movies be like that?" <br /> <br /> This is the classic Paramount 1930s screw-ball comedy for your best people!
