I have to agree with all the previous comments - it's just the best of all the frightening comedies, because Bardot is as sexy as Marilyn Monroe, and certainly with a more beautiful face (maybe there is less mystery, but see how Marilyn paid for it,). that I've ever seen such a juicy female female screen so perfect that even as I like this guy - and not just for purely aesthetic reasons (when the idiot is evangelical really want) to make her "convert-a-queer" number , they really need to upgrade their standards because there is no need for any church mice ...) His breasts, the rest of his figure, his divine voice, the fun way he shakes when he walks through the room ... just to reach a person front, breasts literally turned out to be a subtle confrontation ... <br /> <br /> I think Boyer is one of the biggest men in the history of the film. Nobody played much bigger female stars than Garbo, Dietrich, K. Hepburn, Colbert and Bardot here. And he was also "Fanny" with Leslie Caron and had small portions of "How to steal a million" with A. Hepburn, as well as Deneuve's movie "April Fools" (though not against him.) the fact that even loud, unpleasant music over the open credit is appropriate - I mean, Bardot is not meant to be everything but fine, and his important loudness (I don't understand his voice) is part of his irresistibility and may even say it is exemplary charm . <br /> <br /> Vidal is very beautiful, even if Tiny Brigitte says at the beginning: â€œI don't know why I love you, you're not even beautiful. Dear, dear Bardot! Really one of the wonders of the 20th century, not to mention the joy that he is still with us, when so many truly characteristic are disappearing so quickly in their eccentric glory.
