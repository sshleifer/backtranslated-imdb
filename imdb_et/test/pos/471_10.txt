It was a fantastic movie about two people, one young teenage girl, and another middle-aged man, everyone looking for someone to help them fill the void left by their former loved ones. <br /> <br /> Both actors give great performances that different audiences can associate with. The script written by Gorman Bechard seems to have been written from a woman's perspective. At the same time, men may consider male characters as they are well-written and described in the film. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie is an unusual but powerful and unexpected twist that leaves you speechless. I recommend this movie to anyone who has ever felt lonely or abandoned. In this movie it is clear that you are not alone.
