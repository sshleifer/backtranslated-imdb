I watched this movie this morning and found it to be a great example of the wealth of faith. Babette gave them a second chance to look at life; not a substitute, but a supplement. He shared everything he had with those who gave him little. I see God's story here. He sent his only son to man. Man could not give anything that was equal to it. So, with our little sacrifice, we are given the ultimate treasure and it is being changed. In this film, the townspeople have been so tantamount to using such small interpretations of God. Babette showed them that life and God can indeed be beautiful. The love the Son of God has shown to people is the love we should show to each other and our lives are richer for it. Even a movie is a metaphor. At first it seems slow, but the time and detail of investing is finally paid. It was really a feast.
