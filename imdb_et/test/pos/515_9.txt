Now it's a movie that does something that hasn't been done for a long time. It takes ten or more different elements that we've already become familiar with (vampires, martial arts, techno beat, top-o-the-line special effects, etc.) and make it new. What could have just been a combination of "Mortal Kombat" and "Buffy: Vampire Brawler", Wesley Snipes (which is not my favorite, because mostly "Passenger 57") gives a really good turn for a human / half blood transfusion. He acknowledges the inner conflict, but does not speak more than necessary. He makes Blade as deep as Michael Keaton made for Batman. <br /> <br /> I say that the only part of the movie that was a little diffused for me was the clich√©s of the horror movies of one person that the hero knows who knows exactly how to stop an evil guy. On the other hand, you must have it in such a movie, so it's just excusable. <br /> <br /> Well, Snipes is good. And Steven Dorff, who was a hypothesis in the previews, makes Snipes' hero more than a bad bad guy. He has a class, presence and sufficient control over his little pink to teach Al Pacino how to highlight it a little. Who would have ever thought that a comic book movie would be an actor's launching disc? I sincerely hope it is. And who! where did the devil give Kris Kristofferson's talent? Don't do me wrong, but the fruitful actor hasn't done anything "memorable" since the "millennium" and how many of us looked at the reason for the cool video box? Well, here he is, people, very Obi-Spanish, like the Blade mentor and father's figure. And good work is also. <br /> <br /> The quality of the actors is consistent with the quality of choreography and special effects. Together with the pulsating techno-contest, the battle scenes are brought back and the memories of Mortal Kombat are released quickly. Hey! He also had a script! I was wondering what had happened to all the good writers out there. I was not sorry to pay the full price, I got Schumacher "Batman", "Avengers", "MK: Annihilation", "Godzilla" or "Armageddon". (Wow, how many of them came out this year? Ugh) I also look forward to the inevitable sequel, like the end of the movie. We just hope they do it as well as the first one. <br /> <br />
