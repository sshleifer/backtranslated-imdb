The story of how a (communist) leader who liberated Congo from Belgian imperialism was eliminated by Western authorities through Mobutu. A story about fighting and injustice, hope and seeking freedom. The story can be one of African countries. Very moving film with pictures full of symbolism and beauty. If you only have one foreign film this year, watch it.
