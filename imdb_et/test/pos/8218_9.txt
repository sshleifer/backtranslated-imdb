If you actually read this review, I'll give you a lot of credit. You care enough about the movie that most people have forgotten and then taken care of after the first review! So for the joy of your reading ... <br /> <br /> I expect you to know the plot line so I don't waste time writing it. I mention that Sandra Bullock did an amazing job with this film. He really brought a lot of sympathy to the role of a computer programmer, which is often difficult to do. I can say that because I'm a computer programmer. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I thought the basic piece was very good. You can easily build sub-plots on your mainframe and make it a very pleasant movie. The premise is also unfair as it can really happen if the right precautions are not taken. <br /> <br /> Short review for short ... oops! Too late! If you like Sandra Bullock, who plays a role in her life and wants to see a very well done movie, look at this little legacy. You don't have to be disappointed. :-)
