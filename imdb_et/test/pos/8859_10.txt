John Carpenter shows how much he loves the 1951 original, giving him the utmost respect for what he might be able to do, the only difference being that Carpenter decides to stay at the core of John W Campbell Jr.'s short-term paranoia. The secret of the success of this version is the intolerable tension that accumulates when a group of men suspects each other, literally waiting to be taken over. Carpenter can provide both the shock and the mystery needed to move the movie in the right direction. Whether it's a terrible scene or "what's in the shade," the perfect alliance for the horror and sci-fi of the film. The dialogue is on the ground when a group of men trying to save it and the Carpenter score are a great shockwatch that will even hang the seam and paranoia through the film. Excellent, solid collection of actors led by Carpenter, who use Kurt Russell, while the effects used have the necessary effect. But the most important thing is the end that is a crowning glory, an end that is not inconsistent with the norm and that has incredibly matched with what has gone before, looks and sees what really happens, is 10/10.
