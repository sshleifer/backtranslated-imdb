The last time I logged in, I think there was more than one comment. I am very pleased that more people have now seized the flick and even more so that everyone is dying. I tried it at Christmas 2004 night and found that I was unable to change the channel on my TV, even though it was an Asian flick and I'm - unfortunately, but really-very used not to give any chance to the challenge. Hollywood Products. I did that evening and I thank God deeply for that. I have not been able to shake this film from my system, because not that I have tried or wanted - and it still amazes me very much that such a great and beautiful experience was so, totally unexpected, like the Christmas miracle. have the chance to go to this movie, buy or rent it bootleg or whatever, but watch it. I guarantee it will affect you. I'm out of date, but I'm far from completing my demonstration so get back as soon as possible.
