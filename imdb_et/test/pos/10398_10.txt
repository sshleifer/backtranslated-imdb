Here's another Antonion that opens again and again as soon as it appears on a tape or DVD. I saw it a few months ago when it ran for the first time in a couple of weeks (even in the capital city LA!) And then disappeared (the art house audience seems to have chosen their own special area where older favorites like Antonion and Resnais are welcome only as occasionally interesting) . <br /> <br /> First of all, I was disappointed, I thought the pace was unbearably boring and that the man had lost the opportunity (for years Antonion was hard to find funding) to add another masterpiece to his canon; But knowing Antonion about what he was and how I first reacted to Blow-Up and the Passenger, I refused to judge until I saw the movie again. I went back the next day and I shouldn't have been surprised that the movie pulled me again, making me aware of the things I had thought and lost all my life, driving home in a modern environment. for the first time about forty years ago in L'Aventur, forming a subtle mood in the environment both intrinsically and externally alienated in tones (and quite comedy) that I didn't get enough. My favorite was Malkovich, who sat proudly in a painted swing on a beach where the weather was beautifully silver, and on the Eno / U2 runway that flowed in the background that flowed with that rhythm; it was still, but now the whole movie is just as big! What a strange phenomenon, a complicated simplicity, or an invisible complex that alone seems to be capable of receiving and communicating with Antonion. Strange thing is, although it looks at some kind of soft porn at first glance and has a lot of sex and crazy fantastic Sophie Marceau and many other international stars that disturb you, this movie is unmistakably the core of Antonion, but you don't know what deeply until you have it few times seen and used to their rhythm. For example, this is a rather funny movie with a deep sense of humor, something that I didn't notice at first, but turned to another critic and noticed that further views (4 before they pulled it would be very happy). you have gone back more). If this film had been promoted correctly and people were to some extent guided by how to approach it, I have no doubt that it would have been successful in art houses, like most of Antonion's 60s films. But the 60s are no longer, and the film has to find its audience on small screens, where half of its beauty is even lost in a DVD version of the mailbox (if and when it is released). I invite all the nuts of the film more generally or esoterically to look beyond the clouds and add to the tragic magic.
