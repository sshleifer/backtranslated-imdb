(Some spoilers have been added :) <br /> <br /> Although many commentators have called this film surreal, this term suffers badly. Encyclopedia Britannica quotes a surreal meaning: <br /> <br /> "Fantastic or inconsistent imagination": There is no need to explain the unimaginable ways in which a ten-year-old boy is looking for his fortune in a red Mustang driver's seat could be fantastic: those curious can read James Kincaid; but if you asked the boy how he had a mismatch behind the wheel of a sports car, he would definitely protest, "NO!" What fantasies and contradictions the film offers are usually displayed within the first 15 minutes. Then we get more and more iterations, with ever sharper and rather sparse progress that is far from inconsistent and soon predictable. Not that it would be literally plausible on the other hand - but it was unfair to tax Motorama in particular with this mistake, any incredible stoppage that dropped sharply to a typical filmmaker and viewer "Raiders" "Lost Ark" became blocking. <br /> <br /> "Hallucinatory": How do we know what hallucination is when some of what one does not know we have one? In some cases, some people know that they have "hallucinogenic drugs" - but if Motorama brings this result, I'm sorry why someone takes them more than once. Of course, it is a bad trip from time to time. The film must be one of them, pun and everything. <br /> <br /> "Comparing Amazing Words": How many times can a ten-year-old be amazed by saying, "Oh, my God!" if he likes something, or "fuck!" if he is not? These two interventions are about par for this script course. Unfortunately, any surreal idea that goes through the dialogue can directly impart naivety to the growing American generation of speech patterns. <br /> <br /> "A world that is fully defined and accurately depicted, but which is not a rational idea:" The Motorama world really has no meaning, but it is almost as accurate as in a primary school newspaper. Many of the stars cast on the stars are even less intelligent than our little hero who shouts "Damn!" eyelashes, but needs several seconds to lie flat. And even * his * characters, in spite of almost every scene, do not have a significant development. Here's a little reward for every viewer who understands, as I have, enough to want him to know better and understand where he comes from. One vaguely seems a much better story and the protagonist who fights off. <br /> <br /> "Fully recognizable, realistically painted images are removed from their usual context and redirected into an unclear, paradoxical or shocking framework." No, we are seeing increasingly stereotypical and increasingly degraded billboards, gas stations, gourmet dining places, cheap hotels and their low lifestyle locations on the country's highways, exactly where they are stereotyped. <br /> <br /> "Highly responsible for maintaining ... the emphasis on traditional content." Motoramas has little content, from moment to moment. In summary: A picture of British millionaires dressed as a dress or pirate is standing up in a costume party, sitting calm and quiet as a careful driver. customs their Rolls-Royce like the weak skiffs through the desolation of desperate mankind, China, who passes these windows and fires the glass with blood. Or imagine a stadium filled with abandoned antiques, limousines like those that are now rusty, and white piano that are haunting. An exhausted boy and a sick woman are climbing into this detritus, to whom he clings as a mother-figure, becoming a girlfriend sleeping side by side. She wakes up - a transformation party, "white and dazzling" day 1945 - with an outstanding flash that is not a rising sun. Finding that his consortium has become a body, he first believes that he has seen his soul in heaven. Later he explains just a little less innocently, "I learned a new word today: atom bomb. It's like God taking pictures. Now, * there are only two examples of cinematic surrealism, surrealism, whose iron hangs far enough to penetrate the title of its film: The Solar Empire. If you are looking for a surreal, * please * don't miss it. Unfortunately, but he is accelerating the accelerator to compete with his chariot out of the desert and beyond, the scenes are not so subtle, rich, fine or proud to wait for Motorama's poor little Gus in his quest. <br /> <br /> None of the above is necessarily the thumbs of this movie. Although somewhat disappointed, I cannot reject it in the light of the respect of the other genre he illustrates - one that has undoubtedly been influenced by surrealism, but also by expressionism, existentialism and pessimism by Franz Kafka in all-inclusive power structures. Let's try the size: Absurd Theater. <br /> <br /> When I look at EB's article on this style, I am surprised at how Absurd Theater is a valid artistic style, the above objection to Motorama disappearing like smoke. I am tempted to quote the entire text to support identification. <br /> <br /> The Absurd Theater is trying to show that "the human situation is essentially absurd, without a goal ... humanity is hopelessly puzzled and anxious." Gus finds that he has instantly reached his deadly home among his parents until he goes past the glorious display of Motorama and decides to win the lottery he promises. As others have already shown, this ambition proves illusory: although the game "never ends", the sponsor company has no intention of ever winning, and has the ability to trick, confuse and leave any candidate to the prize. He, like others, is finally disappointed in his dream. <br /> <br /> "Absurdist playwrights therefore took away most of the logical structure of the traditional theater. The characters are filled, their capturing highlights the fact that nothing happens to change their existence ... timeless, round quality." the absurd game is full of ... repetitions ... repeating it until it seems meaningless. " Sometimes under the "dazzling comic surface" we find "the message underlying metaphysical stress". Guse's obsession is a silly game, his language, a plot device where he shares a dark future and / or returns to an earlier moment and takes a different, but still gloomy move - so much is right now. While a surreal admirer would be better off for some filmmakers, Spielberg, Motorama admirers, because it should actually find co-passengers - not instead, but add - to Beckett, Ionesco and Genet. br /> <br /> But you can't stop here. After the game was disappointed, Gus "Phil" (ie Love), the first judge he had met, and one person who had treated him well, even though he had been shouting - was "Be Full!" Under the guidance of the film, he learns to wait for cars in life. We could note here that the absurd playwright Beckett was justified by his more famous "Waiting for Godot" and that we should read "God" to Godot. God is also one of Phili's concerns. In addition, Phil is badly injured due to the indirect result of his previous meeting and goes straight horizontally with his cast hand. In the last scene, Gus, now Phil's counsel, says he wants to hear music. We don't hear any, but we see Phil moving his fingers at the end of his extended hand, noting Gus closer and Gus responding. Finally, to the author I currently read, the Anglican theologian William Stringfellow. If this rebel lawyer is not recognized as an archaeologist or a minor of a freedologist, rather than a Roman Catholic movement, perhaps he should be. The brutality and corporate greed of the police is a clich√© in the cinema and literature, including Motorama, but Stringfellow supports and enlightens feelings that have impressive scriptures, traditions, and reason. <br /> <br /> His most important work is to uncover the earthly activities of the fallen angels that the Bible refers to as exceptions and powers. The principles, written by Stringfellow, are among our three most popular: images, institutions and ideologies. All of them praise our worship by giving the wrong promise. The deeper the image, institution, or ideology of each person, the more his personality becomes "exhausted" and becomes their slave. Promising power, control and immortality inevitably give helpless, chaos and death. As they have fallen down, gain power, they can't do it any more. Yet they blessed people with the "domination over the land" that God had promised in the Genesis book, although in fact no one of us controls our image, institution, or ideology, which is inevitably bent on their own hegemony and self-preservation. They take their own lives. "Dominion" is an error translation: Hebrew more precise presentation would be "leadership". But this is a more profound problem: it is most of us who ignore God's delegation of this power to Adam * before *. We have no reason to assume that we, our descendants, are still using it: on the contrary, it should be obvious that demonic forces have stolen it from us. <br /> <br /> Two observations by CS Lewis can be added: First, "conquering human nature" is simply an illusion, and a rose that covers the fact that we are indeed talking about conquering a man by other men as a means of nature; and secondly, contrary to popular belief, Satan has no good time for Charlie. He may first entertain, but he is very jealous of them, and he firmly pulls them out of every human being, perhaps leaving his prey to come, feeling bad, and despising the resentment. > <br /> Now, knowing these examples from Motorama, they seem to be significantly reflected in Gus experience. He's at least a pretty little boy before he falls victim to the Motorama game. The first signs that advertise it seem glamorous. The longer it continues, and the deeper it travels toward the sponsoring company headquarters, the more rattles they will change. He's lonely, meeting someone else who's playing. Maps issuing stations are either ruins or zombies. The people he meets along the way are increasingly ugly, deceptive and hostile. (The fact that governments' responses to a common dictator do not mean they can follow each other). Guse's mankind has fled him because he is not only completely self-centered, but also in terms of other, but partly blinded, needs ... hidden ... premature, while infantile is literally challenged linguistically. Eventually, even his dear Mustang is taken from him during a crash and he must continue in the dead man's wreck. Finally, having done everything he thought, he was proud of himself in his proud tower to receive his prize. Using biblical power to confuse those who have built such monuments into their vanity, his agents avoid him, frustration, insult, and eventually throw him away from the upper floor. He runs long and hard, finally landing in the water. In other words, in the classic symbol he DIES. He has inevitably completed a bad end for anyone who has trusted his faith in such a fraudster. <br /> <br /> But this destiny is just a deterrent to the changing future. He repents and returns to Philis and sees that he sees him for the first time in a generous, selfless act we saw him for almost an hour and a half, noting that Phil is now disabled and hardly able to insert the hose into the gas tank, he asks, "Can I get you to help with it? " Then, when he sees the "help-wanted" sign, he decides to apply for a job, explaining to the driver with whom he traveled on the hike, that he thinks he's gonna get out of here because it doesn't seem to be too bad, this interpretation is naturally supposed and can surprise or even surprise the film's "classic" enthusiasts who see quite different points in it. <br /> <br /> If Motorama is not my cup, I am at least convinced that this is hardly the worst film.
