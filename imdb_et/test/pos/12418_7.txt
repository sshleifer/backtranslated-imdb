I got Monster Man's three movies in a set where I wanted two of them, but I still had a very nice time. It combines horror and comedy with a sensible effect, significantly helping Eric Jungman as a geeky leader in decent performances, Justin Urich's Honor and Aimee Brooks for the sake of love. The film is quite predictable and mines ideas from many other films, but remains fun, somewhat shameful gore is thrown. Director Michael Davis even manages one or two scary scenes, such as in the bathroom or bar. The movie is viewed all the time when it's a little messily drawn and written, and for me it lost a bit until the title Monster Man begins to resemble a Slipknot member and the film tries to go more horrible, but it's not twisted or convincing enough. The last moments are also weak. Nonetheless, despite the lack of tension and general stupidity, it is a good example of a modest, often gnarly, cracked comedy that should endure the same fans.
