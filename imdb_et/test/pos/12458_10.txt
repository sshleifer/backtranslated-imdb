Before reviewing this movie, I have to admit that it's a bold statement as a film reviewer. Anyone who has already read my previous comments may know that I've always been in a controversial sense, giving high marks to floppies like "Captain America" ​​and "Creature 1985", and movie classics like Alistar Sim "Christmas Song" and "Love Shakespeare". With this in mind, this confession may not be a surprise: <br /> <br /> It's easy that Christopher Lambert is probably one of my favorite actors. Woah, now, don't make me crazy. Let me explain: I don't think he's the biggest actor in the world. I clearly admit that he is not. He is certainly not Morgan Freeman or Anthony Hopkins, but I would say his ability is probably somewhere where at least Bruce Willis is. What I wonder about him is the human qualities he brings to the heroes of his actions. He is just an average man who laughs and cries and beats who is a hero because he has to be, not necessarily because he wants to be. I think these qualities are characteristic (especially in the movies he has worked on), and Lambert's heroes are far from Schwartzennegger or Stallone. Frankly, Lambert's characters are more easily related to me. So he's not the world's biggest actor. He's just a personal favorite. <br /> <br /> I can't say that for my movies. But much of what I know about my course of action would be foolish not to admit that the choice of his films leaves something to be desired. Most of them are, frankly, terrible, and all the ridiculous things he has been getting over the years are not due to his behavior, but rather to his poor choice in scripts. <br /> <br /> With that in mind, I can say that her debut film "Tarzan" is one of her best films and probably her biggest results. As I mentioned, it is effective when a person brings him to his role and how seriously the director, writers and actors are in charge of the material. It's a great leap from B-movie adventures with Johnny Weismeller since the 1940s. Actually, I would hesitate to call it an action movie. Instead, it is a serious drama that takes all E.R. Burrough's materials seriously, showing Tarzan's attempt to discover his true family in Scotland after he realized he was not a "white monkey". She's torn between her old family and her new one, which includes a wonderful Sir Ralph Richardson in her final role. In order to adapt to humans, his goats are trying to catch up and he cannot decide what he loves more: His true family or what he always knows. All in all, this is a wonderful comment on society and a wonderful nature study. <br /> <br /> If anything else, he launched Lambert's international start-up, which continued in the 1980s with films such as "Highlander" and "he Sicily." Unfortunately, it didn't last. But wait a while .... His latest career tools like "Gideon" and "Resurrection" have proved that although he still has a long way to go, he is a competent competent actor, maybe ... ahem .. .. back if he just chooses his roles better. <br /> <br /> There's still a decision on her first movie right now: <br /> <br />
