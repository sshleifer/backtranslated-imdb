This movie is a mystery. It's not scary, it's horrible. Probably jump on some points and some of it you scratch your head to figure it out. It opens up as a crazy shelter through its mystery protagonist Eve and her psychotic college project, Don. She needs her to look for some clues to prove her mother's murder, and when Eve agrees to help her, she opens the pandora box completely and releases some very strange things, including Malachi. I'm not going to Malacia, but I thought the game was a complete genius. I know movie fans don't like this film with the same prestige as other classics, because it doesn't have a very famous one (brother Angelina Jolie was great, but maybe she should have asked her sister to show her face just so the film could get some recognition) , but I think Malachi's final work is something to talk about. I've recommended it to my friends, it's definitely worth buying or renting.
