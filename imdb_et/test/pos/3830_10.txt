I didn't know how much of this episode was taken down from the enemy until I finally saw the movie (it has since been my hope for a war). There were also a few elements that rose from Run Silent Run Deep. Nothing wrong with stealing ideas when you cool with them. And the boy did something like Roddenberry and the company. "The story begins when the Romans break a 100-year contract and cross the neutral zone and destroy a series of federal exteriors along the zone seemingly to test their excessive arms and invisibility screen (and the subsequent change in power balance between the junkies and the federation, in their opinion), if a prelude to any kind of invasion. Kirk has to decide whether it is worth the threat of war to try to stop the Romulan ship, or the greater the risk of shooting intruders after they have killed 4 soldiers. Kirk chooses the latter wisely. <br /> <br /> This is our first look at the Federation's enemy, the rogues, the military, but in its own way, the venerable race of the Vulcan family. But unlike their peaceful cousins, the Romans did not give up their emotions and violent and imperialist ways, even when they were technologically advanced. <br /> <br /> None of them are important to Mr. Stiles, the ship's navigator and the driver of this episode. antagonist in the company (Romulan's commander has his problems with a gung-ho junior officer). For him, it is important that he hates Romulans and Spock looks like no matter how long when Spock rescues his life (of course). It is in stark contrast to Captain Kirki and Romulan, neither of whom is personally bad at all. Both men just do their job. In fact, there is mutual respect. This is the first Trek episode that deals directly with prejudice, and it does it skillfully (unlike the 3rd season's "Let's Be Your Last Battlefield"). <br /> <br /> As below We have a classic chess game between two boatmasters who are really very similar. You can see right now that both captains are good .. ALL good. If you were in battle, you would like one of these men to be your leader. Both are honorable and decent men who are bound. Yet, although the commander of Romulan is bound to bind his homeland, he still finds that he wants to be destroyed before he can take it home rather than to start another interstellar war. Yet he does everything he can to get home, just as Kirk does everything to stop him. <br /> <br /> I think this is one of Trek 5's best. That's all: lots of action, intercourse, great dialogue, subtle action (I'm still retaining Romulan's head was Mark Lenard's best trek role) and he managed to make his social comment without being too preaching. The unfortunate Roddenberry forgot the last part when he did TNG. <br /> <br /> Look at this episode, see the enemy below.
