It has been said that Batman starts with the first Batman movie "to the right", but I think it is terrible superfluous because I think the new Batman film, though bigger than Batman Forever and Batman and Robin, is better than Tim Burton's classic. it is the top five. Darkness is beautiful, as are the music and landscapes that create secretly hidden Gotham City, as opposed to Batman Begin, where Gotham City is a regular-looking city. Roisto is terrible in this movie. You can't literally take away the eyes of a penguin and a cat. I commend Tim Burton for being original because he used a penguin rather than a freak, rather than an ordinary criminal or old Batman television clone. At the beginning of Batman we have a scarecrow whose screen is not nearly as demanding as a penguin or cat woman. The film does not have to focus solely on Batman, because we already know his story, and it is the villains we are researching and trying to think about are those who create a plot where the penguin works for the mayor and seeks revenge for the parenting of his parents, killing Gotham's first-born sons. Danny Devito gives the best results in any superhero cable, even crossing Nicholson. The end scene, where penguins pull the penguin's body into the water, is moving and powerful. It is a tragedy that Tim Burton was not allowed to complete the trilogy, because Warner Bros, who was interested in marketing, wanted to "lighten" Batman's films. And they got their wish ... unfortunately. Tim Burton was going to run the third movie using Riddler as a cable without two faces and Robin to confuse it. So this is the last big Batman movie. Batman Begins is dark but boring, annoying, plain, full of green villains, and playboy Bruce Wayne. The right Batman movie, but the best Batman movie? Never. Batman returns this crown.
