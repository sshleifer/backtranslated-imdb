Craig Brewer grew up in Tennessee, this is his obvious film. Forget the black boy with a white girl. This happens, but it's not Samuel L. Jackson's Christina Ricc. More importantly, this film is about the values ​​and culture of the people of Tennessee. How they deal with divorce, abandonment, sexual abuse and psychological disorders. While millions in the cities of the North, Central and West Coast are diminishing, the city minister, who also grabs his own problems, becomes an advisor and mediator. This is an interesting concept and one that may not be very happy with everyone. <br /> <br /> Brewer shows us the area where he grew up. Yes, it is still a racial problem, although many big cities have worse problems. This is in the subtext and not in the main graph of the story. People live easier, but life is still complicated and embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Jackson and Ricci are doing a fantastic job in this movie. Jackson is an aging former blues guitarist who lives out of his small farm. Her 12-year-old wife leaves her with her brother so she runs into depression. Meanwhile, Ricci and Justin Timberlake have the last naturally sexually charged night before he ships ships to the army. Ricci suffers from sexual abuse in childhood, although it does not appear until later, her torture can only be eradicated with sexual entertainment by various boys (black and white) in town. <br /> <br /> When Ricci is beaten and left dead near Jackson Farm, he finds him and cares for him. He believes this is a divine intervention that this half-life white girl will be left under her care. He binds his Bible and prays for guidance. She refuses her sexual progress and treats her with dignity, respect and care. Something few men in their lives have ever done. <br /> <br /> He sees the time Jackson is a man of honor and morality, but he also carries his pain. She plays her guitar and sings for her. Yes, it is also blues and damn good when the minister advises him, he understands slowly how to cope with his childhood sexual abuse. Jackson, through Ricci's transformation, realizes that he must let his pain heal. <br /> <br /> Justin Timberlake comes back, releasing "anxiety problems". When he searches for Ricci, who lived with Jackson during recovery, he discovers that he has been buggy and unfaithful to him. <br /> <br /> He finds him and Jackson at the bar where Jackson has decided (as part of his healing process) to retire and play Blues again. Timberlake follows them at home and stands against Jackson and Ricci. <br /> <br /> You must see the movie for the rest of the story. If you decide to see this movie, keep in mind that you look at it from a foreign or independent film perspective. It's part of America, some of which can be seen. It's interesting and revealing. It also shows us that despite our skin color we all have similar problems that can be solved with similar solutions.
