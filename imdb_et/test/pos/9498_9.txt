This is probably the first film that contains Gloria Swanson - a movie that made her break. Although he was good in the film, I don't see how this performance was particularly remarkable at that time - but it was still a very good film. <br /> <br /> Gloria plays a rich slob that takes her for granted. He cares a little about care, eats onions and forgets their anniversary! At the same time, Lothario gets into his life and begins to pay much attention to Gloria, and his dippy husband does not notice or give him any reason to be deceived by him. Ultimately, he divides his door and marries Romeo, fluently speaking. Though the film could have just been a superfluous melodrama (they were quite common at that time), it takes interesting turns and an imaginative and fun movie. Although this is not the biggest silent movie I've ever seen, it is extraordinary and deserves to be remembered. <br /> <br /> By the way, DVD distribution from Image Entertainment is surprisingly good - with proper printing and music. This has not always been the case with other images (especially how slowly they dealt with Chaplin's publications).
