I remember going home from school almost every day to catch the 5 monster movie of the KTLA channel, but I never ran home faster than the movie was planned. Somehow I had the impression that the boy and the giant robot as a friend, in a very special way. Of course I pretended I was Spiderman, Batman and other superheroes, but I wanted to be Johnny Sakko any of them. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen this movie in 30 years and I remember it vividly. Who can forget about how Giant Robot put rockets off his fingers! Or how did Ghuillotene throw his fingers to make explosions? Geez, I can still hesitate at the end of the theme music, which is so tragic that I remember going to sleep several times! <br /> <br /> Only one other film has the magic that this movie has in my mind and that is the wizard of Oz. But I've seen this movie several times after the baby. Of course, Ozi's wizard is a real classic, while Voyage Into Space is a small budget mess. These two films should not even be mentioned in the same sentence, but for the young boy there are no high product values ​​or continuity that grab your heart, its flying monkeys and giant robots! <br /> <br /> P.S. My cousin uses a very accurate impression of Giant Robot (he said it was "Giant Robutt.") When you remember, Giant Robot had a special way of taking his rockets and my cousin was cold. I did it routinely for my personal entertainment.
