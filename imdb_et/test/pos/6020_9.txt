This is one of the best television productions in music. I've heard Merman's cast album, Angela Lansbury's album I've seen in Tyne Daly's life, and I've seen Rosalind Russell's film countless times. I think Bette is not the best, it is tied to the best. He not only hits the Brama, but also the Mama Rose pathosis. I was never a fan of Natalie Wood, so I really enjoyed Cynthia Gibb, which is undoubtedly her best role. Everything from costumes to submissions is wonderful. These three removers, always led by dependable Christine Ebersole, are difficult to maintain. A few years ago, Mame was supposed to be a television producer with Cher, but I think Bette would be the best for Aunt's aunt Mame.
