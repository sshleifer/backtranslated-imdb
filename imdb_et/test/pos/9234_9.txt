This is a very funny movie. A very attractive film has a selfish and iconic tone. The characters are interesting. The film flows very well and keeps your interest for 1 hour, 50 minutes. The quality of the film is not the highest in Hollywood standards; but the original film was supposed to be in a silver punk-rock style. The documentary film about the attempt to film and the subsequent betrayal of filmmakers is very detailed and easy to follow. The original filmmakers themselves become the main characters in the documentary version of the film. Interviews with filmmakers and actors have been put together in a very fun story that illustrates the struggles associated with making the original film, the potential failure of the original project, and the asphalt-like ascent of the phoenix film. . In my opinion, the Texas Tale of Treason is a much more interesting and fun film than the original film (Waldos Hawiian Vacation). Two thumbs up for work.
