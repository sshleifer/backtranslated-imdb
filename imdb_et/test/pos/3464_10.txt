If you want a movie with a full range of emotions, see NO; dramatic and funny, and the keys to emotions; I can safely ensure that very little will be able to watch this hot and very human film without tearing it now and later. It is hard to believe that two leaders are acting; you swear that two young men really suffer from rory and brain palsy (Michael); just, two FINEST shows I've ever seen; these are also two very plausible characters, and you never feel that things have been "dramatic" or compassionate. In the DVD version, "extras" include those "deleted scenes" (including the alternate end) and "extended scenes"; why these clips are not included in the final movie, they are hard to understand because they tie the rest of the movie perfectly and are in no way superfluous. But without a reservation, I can heartily recommend this movie to anyone; one of the best I've ever seen.
