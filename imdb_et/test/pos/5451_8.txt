Good movie, great story, great characters, I enjoyed it enormously, enough DVD when it came out. <br /> <br /> The real life story he wants to say is more exciting and appealing than anything fiction players could ever come up with. My friend, who is in the media company, said they should not show such inside information, it gives the company a bad name. Like always. <br /> <br /> There are, however, some problems with the DVD: first, the volume is terribly low to watch this TV. I note that the fact that HBO manages this in the original copy of the product. Secondly, in the first five minutes, the left side of the video is cut off, that is, the picture breaks about one inch from the left. After five minutes, it will fill the screen properly, from left to right. Such sloppy technical production is very amateurish and I do not know why the director and producer promised such a slogan. I'm thinking.
