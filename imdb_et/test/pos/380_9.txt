Well, it's about as good as they come. There are arguments about whether Hitchcock was only a "master of the trade seal" or perhaps a "compulsive technician" - or was he "deep". No one knows exactly what these terms mean, but it is legitimate to ask if he could not have all three things at his best. <br /> <br /> It seems to have reached its peak in this. Hardly anything about it is accidental. It has doubts, ambiguity and intelligence. And the story is tempting, Patricia Highsmith probably has complexes like Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the plot has been thoroughly outlined elsewhere so I'm not worried about it. I just refer to the screen in five cases that Hitchcock is undoubtedly responsible for that. to murder. She has noticed her attention and has been blamed for her. <br /> <br /> 1. Laura and her two friends rent an electric boat to pass the love tunnel and then to the island in the middle of the lake. Walker is behind them, smiling at his boat - Pluto. "Pluto." This is not a reference to Walt Disney's cartoon. This is a reference to Pluto, also called Hades, the god of the underworld in Greek and Roman mythology. This little touch cannot be an accident. And the "underworld" represented by Walker is not just literal, but the underworld of human mind. I don't want to say he's Jung's shadow, but that's what he's. (Did Carl Jung see this movie? He was alive during his release, but probably not.) 2. It's a deadly serious sequence now, right? Walker is a madman who is going to murder a woman whom he doesn't even know. Imagine how most managers would have guided it. Night lurking through an overcrowded carnival, stealing from theft, peeling off the killer walls and so on. What does Hitchcock show us? When Walker first passes through the gates, focusing on his victim, the little boy runs the cowboy, holding the balloon, running up and shouting: "Bang! Bang! You're dead!" Walker pulls his head back in surprise and despises the boy outrageously. And when the child goes away, Walker walks out of his cigarette balloon and jumps on it, then continues his surveillance without another glance. This is one way Hitchcock treats the impending execution. <br /> <br /> 3. Famous reflection of outstanding eye glasses read at numerous times. <br /> <br /> 4. Miriam and her friends stop at one of the devices you nail with a big laugh, sending some hockey to measure your blow strength. One of his boys rides it and the ripple doesn't reach the top of the clock. With Miriam's joyful and admiring glance, Walker smiles and rubs his hands, then rises to the gripper, pulls it down and rails against the clock. He's excited. He puts the hammer down, looks at him, smiles and WAGGES HIS BIRTH to him as a ten-year-old showoff! 5. After the discovery of Miriam's body, when the whistles hit and people scream, Walker leaves the carnival and meets the blind who waits for the curb. Walker takes the old man by the hand and takes him over the junction, holding his hand hard to stop the traffic. Funny joke. <br /> <br /> These incidents and others occur within ten or fifteen minutes of the carnival visit. (Robert Walker's performance is exceptional all the time.) This is basically such an invitation to be noirish. (Cf. "Ride the Horse Horse") But the threat of the scene is Hitchcock's demand for irony and distance. No familiar Noir technique is available. There's nothing really "horrible" there. And the murder itself is hardly wild. I don't think any other director than Hitchcock would have done that. It would have been all the threats and shadows, hiding places, interrupting attempts, noodles instead of mistakes. <br /> <br /> Not that it is a totally flawless movie. The flawless movie is not yet with us. Some of the middle section is a bit slow and Farley Granger, though a nice man, is tough, boring and pretty stupid. His new girlfriend is just bored. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock had to deal with the firing wrongly "wrong man". I am not sure that Hitchcock would ever have thought of the difference between legal guilt and moral guilt. The latter was assigned to him at an early age by his Catholic education. "Original sin" - you're with him BORN - and all this. In the filmed interviews, he always explained his fear to the police and the authorities, generally speaking about the story of his father who was taken to the police station to scare him after peccadillo. We are justified in asking if this was just what psychoanalysis calls "screen memory". I hope you get a punishment. I know, I know. It's tense and unfair, but I spent a lot of valuable time thinking about it.
