I watched this movie on HBO and I had a good time. <br /> <br /> The director has done an excellent job. I found myself completely up to the absorption of this movie. Norman's performance is cool. I'm looking forward to more cool movies from him. <br /> <br /> I was so absorbed that sometimes I wanted to grab a gun from Norman and shoot this snake girl. Hehe. I like movies when innocent looking girls really play tricks with men. The end was what I wanted :)) <br /> <br /> This movie is full of moments. You expect this, but something else happens. <br /> <br /> At first, these massive images were painful for the eyes. <br /> <br /> Although it was not shown when Norman Reed changed currency tokens? Or am I standing in the refrigerator. :)
