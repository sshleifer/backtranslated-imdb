"In order", Peter Falk plays an elderly New Yorker who calls his children home so that they can make a plan with him before suicide. As the film progresses, we see everyone's mistakes and other problems. While some people may interpret it as a "warm-hearted" movie, I enjoyed it mostly in the character of Peter Falki, which does not let anything down, and even take part in a bit of badness now and then. <br /> <br /> The best movie may never be, but still worth it. I've been thinking for a long time that Peter Falk has the perfect look to play the role that his glass eye has and everything. Also starring Laura San Giacomo, David Paymer, Judge Reinhold and Shera Danes (Falki's real husband).
