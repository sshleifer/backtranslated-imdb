I watched the NFL game and started surfing in a break and found it on one HBO-type channel. I missed the beginning, but when I started to look at Deadly Voyage, I put the clicker down and didn't even think until the credit rolled. You will find yourself rooting against the villans and the edge of your La-Z-Boy throughout this period. If you get the chance, look at it. At any time, I think that the cable TV company would take off the channels of my movie, but if you stumble on such big ones, as you know, why pay for them. Happy Cod to all of Cape Cod!
