The British-born Australian Bead Alex Frayne calls for his strange attention that requires careful reading, visually stunning Modern Love (2006). The fascinating study of human psychology follows a person who is unable to control the drastic change in personality caused by the death of a close relative. Distributed by Accent Film - Australia. <br /> <br /> John (Mark Constable), his wife Emily (Victoria Hill) and their son Edward (William Traeger) reach a small southern city to take care of their dead uncle. (Don Barker) property. While Emily and Edward are controlling the local hotel, John starts questioning local people about the death of Uncle Tom - some say he committed suicide, some do not want to talk. Reasonable John comes up with his theory - Uncle Tom is alive and well, hiding in nearby shrubs. <br /> <br /> If not for casual dialogues used to relieve heavy atmospheric tones, modern love can be easily confused with Sokurov's film. The 16mm camera-painted washing scheme is strangely visible from the reflective humanity of the Russian director. Perhaps it is not a coincidence that it was at the Moscow International Film Festival, where Modern Love was its premiere. While watching this unique intoxicating visual collage, there is a slightly different picture - Sokurov's films tend to remain painfully intimate points, where they deliberately remove the main mainstream players from the surrounding environment, blurring everything from a large-scale director's preferred yellow. The progressive psychological change of John stems from it and the more the story progresses, the more it becomes apparent that nature was an integral part of Frayne's vision. <br /> <br /> In Sokurov's second round, the young man returns to his Russian countryside to bury his dead father. In the morning where the old man lived, everything is covered with dust. He collects some old clothes that are scattered and put his father's body in a coffin. Then he says goodbye and bursts it. The rest of the film is a long-term contemplation of the collapse of the Soviet system, loneliness and dissatisfaction, many of which remained unfulfilled. <br /> <br /> In modern love, somewhat ironic, love is nowhere to be seen. On the contrary, it is pain, loneliness and dissatisfaction with "modernity" that suddenly invades John's life. However, unlike the second round, the main protagonist here is the opportunity to re-embrace his modern life. His wife and son are waiting for him, but he walks away. Slowly but surely, the current disintegration is somewhat confusing at the weight of the past. <br /> <br /> I doubt Frayne is so stunningly similar to modern love that Sokurov did in the Second Round. Nonetheless, this pace, and especially the mysterious framing, is what makes this film a close meditative experience - a difficult and immensely brittle approach to deconstructing human psychology, which the two directors have perfectly mastered. <br /> <br /> Mark Constable delivers top-notch performance as John adds even more depth to his very complex character. His facial expressions are outstanding. Both Victoria Hill and William Traeger are perfectly suited for their performance pic with a striking visual style.
