This movie is probably not the most fun I've ever seen. In fact, it is actually nothing more than a set of vignettes put together in a loose plot. Such a "make-it-up-I-go-along" attitude is actually about the advantage of the film. "Tommy Boy" succeeds as a comedy for the same reasons that SNL skits Farley and Spade played successfully: their well-timed extreme foolishness and chaos make them humorous despite their immatureness.
