Ok, everyone agreed what was the best season. First. And Boone's killing was a bad advantage. The killing of others was also bad. Blame the directors and writers for that. Bad guys. BUT. I think it's ever the best sci-fi series! Sorry guys I can't help! I see that the quality of the series fell after the first season. It is still easy to accept Liam as a new main character when you are over Boone. He's really ... mysterious. The thing that most shocked me was when it was written about Lill's story and how. It was something he didn't deserve! And what can we do? Some blonde chick named Renee, absolutely no character! But these Taelons remain mysterious and you do not know what the real plans are until the end. Real suspension. The conversations between Zo'or and Dani are sometimes excellent. <br /> <br /> I understand that jumping to the 3rd, 4th or 5th season episode may not mean you understand this example. But if you look from the beginning, you just can't get rid of it! <br /> <br /> Actress is great, special FX is wonderful, music is beautiful and plot interesting. I have to see it, guys!
