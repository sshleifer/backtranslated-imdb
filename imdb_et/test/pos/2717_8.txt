Our family and friends enjoyed this movie very much. The topic was well discussed by Director Shabana Azmi, Konkana Sen's major performances and well-supported performances of the second performance. The peak was well built, but to the end that was far from what was called "Good". We're still trying to understand what the director was doing? Were they little or no ideas out of the ordinary film students? A better end would have created a lasting impression on the audience and increased the viewer's ship. However, this should not take away the credit that is due to Konkana and Shabana Azm for doing so well!
