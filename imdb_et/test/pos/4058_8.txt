It's really fun. I really enjoyed it, though it wasn't at all, Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy were great! All the characters are cool and the story is pretty good, plus Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy are just amazing! Rene Russo is great in his role and there is a lot of laugh to be all the time (especially when Deniro spoofs are Clint Eastwood and Danny Glover) and the finale is just great. Yes, this is just one of the Buddy Buddy police, but it works thanks to fantastic chemistry De Niro and Murphy! Sometimes. It is not really very good, but I found it to be a very fun and ideal way to pass time! This is by no means the best "Buddy" Buddy cop, but it's still a lot of fun, and I thought it was pretty well done and written! I really enjoyed it, though it wasn't originally at all, Robrt De Niro and Eddie Murphy were great together, I recommend it! The direction is very good! Great for camera work, cool corners and fast movie pace. Actress is fun! ordinary fantastic stuff, some really funny faces pulled, seemed to enjoy himself, had some funny lines and he really had a cool character! Fun as De Niro did the usual funny things, apparently loved to be in front of the camera and when he can do it ff with his sleep he was still having fun watching! (Murphy Rules !!!!). Rene Russo is fantastic here, he had a cool character and although he couldn't do much, he added a lot of screen presence and always made his character interesting, he was just great! (Russo rules !!!!). William Shatner is surprisingly funny here and hasn't overstretched it and made the film laugh. The main villain is OK, but this is weak and quite boring, but he did what he was supposed to do. The rest is good. In general, I highly recommend it! *** 1/2 out of five
