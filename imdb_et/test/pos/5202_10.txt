Such a film does not come too often. I'm surprised that it took me nine years to finish. Politicians and civilian shotguns should do this before deciding how to destroy the lives of peoples, look at it a day after looking at the "revolt" television version of the Warsaw Ghetto. Even with this fresh mind, I felt sympathy with the German soldier. I felt sympathy for all parties that this tragedy could happen. Defrosting takes time. I'm surprised that they haven't bought "The Forgotten Soldier" by Buy Sajer. This movie is cold with the book. Both are haunting me for the rest of my life.
