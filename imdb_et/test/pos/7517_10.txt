Absolutely Corrosive! Director Arthur Hiller and writer Paddy Chayefsky demolish the American hospital system with this evil comedy / drama / whodunit. The hospital depicted here is full of problems ... from the protesting neighbors in order to rid patients of a possible serum killer. George C. Scott is a top physician who, alongside his nervous breakdown, is participating in Diana Rigg's free-spirited and his madness father, Barnard Hughes. HOSPITAL has an alternatingly depressing and amazing dialogue with some of the most acidic dialogues (note how Scott describes Rigg's love-loving session). It also has many great vignettes: Scott Berating, head of Nancy Marchand, after one of the people here, accidentally killing a doctor; daffy administrator Frances Sternhagen desperately tries to collect insurance information from a waiting room full of sick people; Scott was calmly consulting the hospital's psychiatrist after telling him he was a living life. All operations are first-rate. Scott and Rigg are dynamite and Hughes is a real surprise. The film is a masterpiece with a Chayefsky script that serves a well-earned Oscar (over such strong competition as KLUTE and Sunday, BLOODY Sunday). Opening narration is invaluable.
