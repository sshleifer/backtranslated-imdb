This movie is still alive and hits Alan Ladd's presence. It's a good thing, because the movie has some interesting things to say but badly in the other, because anyone who expects him to wait for a tough guy, Ladd, to run his usual runners, is mighty disappointed. Without fanfare or introduction, Laddit will be introduced to the third roll. True, his role is key, but it is small and likely to disappear in confusion. In the former ambivalent scenario of journalist Martin Mooney, there are many key roles that hit all political alliances and quite ruthlessly deplores the candidates for the Reform. It is a lovely and very talented Joan Woodbury who ties a wide-ranging story in different directions. Unlike traditional Hollywood production, the plot is actually in the series of jumps, similar to the French "New Wave" later released films, although here they are easier to follow, especially if you know that the original title of the movie was a piece of paper. Nonetheless, some of the film's narratives and characteristic switches are somewhat confusing, especially for the role of Jack LaRue, who has wisely chosen to play this part in a strange way. One of Jack's best-performing jobs, but no one is likely to notice it.
