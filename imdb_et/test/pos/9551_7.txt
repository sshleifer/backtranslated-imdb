I really enjoyed it when only Fred Willard's comment on the dog show. There are some dead spots and some gags that don't work, but generally the movie works very well. When I was younger, my older dogs grew up and the people I met at these shows were not much less strange that I could confirm the friezes of this show. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie for my art and its comments on how we tend to take frivolous things too seriously ... I enjoyed doing this for the accuracy (most of the accents were flawless) and its nuance (I loved it how each person went to their dogs) ... <br /> <br /> Rent this movie if you have any appreciation for the oddity of human existence.
