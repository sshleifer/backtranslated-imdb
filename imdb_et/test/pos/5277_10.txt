I absolutely loved the movie positively. I just saw it and can't wait until it comes out on the DVD. It's a beautiful, well-drawn masterpiece. I am always surprised by the complex work done by Ghibli's studio. <br /> <br /> Others have commented on Sosuke, who called Risat for his first name. He does not call his Father by his forename if he does not speak to anyone else. I didn't get the impression that Risa was her mother. No one has ever said it or said it indirectly. It is obvious that he is his stepmother. That's why he makes his promise to come home and why he gets so empty when he finds his empty car. Her mother must be dead when she was a child because she is talking to Risa. This, along with his father, is a lot at sea, why he has given up on the problems. Everyone also talks about how mature he is. This usually happens when a child loses a parent.
