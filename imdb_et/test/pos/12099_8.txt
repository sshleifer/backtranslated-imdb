German-born Turkish director Faith Akin captures his film in the city of Istanbul, a city between east and west, a unique city on both sides of the Bosphorus, endless variety of music and songs. Europe and Asia. Kurdish languages ​​represented by Aynur, who performs his Kurdish gospel music brand, passionate and melodious. We introduce the novel instrumentalists, Orhan Gencebay, who has been invited to the Arabic Elvis - music voices are heard everywhere in the city because Faith Akin takes us to underground clubs, street performers and recording sessions. German bassist Alexander Hacke, who arrives in Istanbul to play Turkish music, quotes Confucius, "To understand this place, you must listen to the music he plays". This is what Akin's good documentary is doing - giving us 90 minutes of music that helps overcome bridges. For me, watching the movie was especially interesting because I recently visited part of my vacation in Istanbul and spent four days there. The city enchants me with its pictures, colors, crowd, vitality and visual beauty. Now I can add music sounds to the ever-changing portrait of Istanbul.
