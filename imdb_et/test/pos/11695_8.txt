Crackerjack is in Cityside's suburban lawn club in Australia. Mick Molloy plays a scammer who has free parking in Cityside. If the club is put under pressure to install poker players on its premises, they have to raise it to $ 8000. The club needs new members and this is where Mick's molloys come in and rescue the bowl. With many up and coming Australian participants, Crackerjack is hidden in a pearl. Warn, though, most of the jokes are for those who know the lawn bowls, but there are many amusing visual disturbances that provide comic relief. Sam Johnson and Judith Lucy are members. In general, the film should be recommended to people who play lawn bowls or have played, but there is enough other material for fun gaming if you have an easy understanding. If you enjoy Australian humor, I suggest that you get the bowling white and go to the theater because it is the premiere comedy (also the only one) of lawn bowls of the year.
