The end of time is probably as close to the perfect movie as you have probably seen from Hong Kong. All the elements are clicked: an amazing script (French writers Julien Carbon and Laurent Courtiaud), which can even undermine the odd clich√©, the reliably imagined direction of Johnnie To, and the excellent central performances of Andy Lau and Lau Ching Wan. great comic timing for a wonderful effect without going beyond the parody (especially his surprised reaction to his boss's chest). The supportive cast is also good, because Yo Yo Mung plays a strong role in the small role and even often the hysterical Waise Lee (looking remarkably and very aptly, like the bald Andy Lau) to influence it well. This is best if you don't know how much plot goes beyond basic setup? just a few weeks to live, Lau is dealing with a criminal game with a Wani policeman who doesn't have an easily visible motif? just sit back and enjoy the ride: it will definitely reward you. It also has one of the most perfect love stories of the latest movies and is played on only three scenes (the second bus ride is one of the most magical moments of film I've seen in age). Raymond Wong is also fine. The most fun playing cat and mouse in the movies for years.
