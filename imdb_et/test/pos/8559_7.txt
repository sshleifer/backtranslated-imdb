H.O.T.S. Not for those who want hardcore porn. Instead, this film is the forerunner of many of the 80's cultural classical college / frat films, such as the Reason to Reason and PORKY'S and the world-famous ANIMAL HOUSE cursor. It's a good time when you dig a lot of 70s / 80s Playboy chicks and cheezy slap-dick comedy - but nothing too remarkable if you want to use it as a silver material ... <br /> <br /> H.O.T.S. is an "unauthorized" corporation of sexual emigrants who fights against popular and trendy Pi girls. It has horrors, aunt Jemima-ish housekeeper and even a overheated robot that makes it quite fun when boys are your "thing" ... <br /> <br /> Well ... I like so much tits (or probably more ...) than the next boy - but all seen sliding sh! t, i couldn't somehow want some hardcore scene to make it really valuable. I knew it wouldn't happen, but I still want H.O.T.S. was a little more sex and a little less a little. Not quite as remarkable as NERDS, PORKY or ANIMALS, but it's worth looking for fans of these movie types ... 7/10 <br /> <br /> PS .. and I forgot - this is the perfect shower and Danny Bonaduce is probably his career best role outside his "real life" ...
