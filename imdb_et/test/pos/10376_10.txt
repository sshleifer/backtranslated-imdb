I was surprised that I liked this movie. But it reminded me of the first version of the 13th of August 2004. There were a number of cheese elements, but at the same time there were many cool ones. The story was good - predictable if you have seen more than one or two horror films, but full of one liner to value it. There are some memorable scenes to watch. Some of the questions I had about the plot were related to the consistency of the characters. For example, in the opening plan, peacocks (which were contributions to people whose blood had dried up for the grain) were very real, but later in the film they saw rather fake snares carrying blue colored masks. The plot had more than several gaps and the actor was mediocre, but at least it sounded like real people talking, unlike Hollywood movies, where dialogue is really fake when you think about it. The culmination of the last scene, when the protagonist says, "I'm not Baker, I'm Connell!" and the head of the peacocks will disappear, because his creatures have mostly killed this point.
