First, I appreciated this film 10/10. For me it's just one of the best I saw because I've been born (I'm 23, but I saw several movies). The story is cruel, but is there no reality? It went deep into me and mixed my gut. I saw it about 5 or 6 years ago and it still shakes me - and I still remember it! <br /> <br /> Second, there is no "national preference" (this is a direct translation of French) into this film. I mean, this is not because it is a French film that I put so high: it really captured me when I saw it. Additionally, I don't know Marcel Carne's filmography well, so I don't know if it's her best film, but I know it's not her most famous: Hotel du Nord, Quai des Brumes, and Les Enfants du Paradis are Third The film is black and white, but it deals with the temporal problems of young people (not acne), such as love, friends and studies today. It can even be a spoken word with real young actors, Dolby (tm) sound and special effects (car accident), it would still be a great movie! <br /> <br /> Problem: Maybe it's a movie that young adults (16-25 years old) see - and of course - that its message would be well understood ... Did I say it was a great movie?
