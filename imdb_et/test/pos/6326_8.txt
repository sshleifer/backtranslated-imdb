This is a very episode. It starts with Jim, who returns with a new girlfriend at the weekend, recently divorced Karen Mills (Pat Delaney - John Huston's daughter who knew some Noir-movie stuff) and her daughter. When they arrive, Karen goes to the house while Jim takes her daughter to the back seat and carries her to her room. He then finds that Karen is gone. Of course he calls Dennis and, when the police arrives, they don't see any signs of Karen but find their neighbor who was killed in the bushes. So, of course, Jimi makes the suspect directly. <br /> <br /> This is a very small secret and Rocky asked for the first half of the story, asking Jim to go over the story again. Rocky suggests that Jim told him a story he might remember a little detail that he didn't think it was important at that time, but now it might happen. It is a really well written scene and ends the transition of Rocky's character from the grifter to the parent. It also goes a long way to showing that Rocky is not just one helpless old man. As he says, "You come to me because I am your father. And I'm smarter than you!" It's one of those times when we see where Jim got his smart. <br /> <br /> This episode also includes the look of Lara Parker who played "Dark Shadows" in the Angelique series and played Laura Banner, Bruce's wife in the "Incredible Hulk" series a few years later. She looks terrible. <br /> <br /> This episode also marks the first reputation of the Minette crime family, a name that had to catch up on Rockford files almost whenever they needed a family family. This time, this is Vincent Minette, who Rockford helps to hold on. <br /> <br /> Lt Diehl (Tom Atkins) makes his first appearance series and Dennis has quietly surrendered to the police lieutenant that he was one of the episodes of the Sargent police last season. I think they thought it would be better for Dennis to be less powerful, plus a conflict between Jimi and the police. Frankly, they were right, although I prefer Mr Chapman later to Mr Diehl. <br /> <br /> Not much typical "Rockford" humor in this episode, but good conscience.
