I have to drill in my head in Barney's head; well .. i think there must be a reason. First of all, I am convinced that our children are not stupids, they are just children, but they know (my 1 and a half year old son chooses what to see) which is nice or nasty. Did you see the news? Do you think your children need to know reality? Maybe ... or not; we (adults) have a responsibility for what we want our children to do and teach them. Drug Dealers Movie? news about massacres in the Middle East? Of course, children need to know that there is real life, but ... they are children; we give them grace. What do you want them to do? If you want children to be trained with weapons or the best way to kill a neighbor, go to those deadly weapons, Kill Bill, any manga anime, tell them that Santa is spoiled, who enters directly through the stack to spoil them. I want the illusions of my son (don't get me wrong, I'm not saying Barney and Friends are the best; actually there are many mistakes in the show, I read the other comments and agree the most); maybe dreams or illusions of happiness. At least I want to teach him to grow without fear, but it learns to think and believe that everyone is not a succession of killers or hijackers they have a reason to grow. At least he may be somewhat satisfied with his dreams. So, parents, don't underestimate their children; they know what they want.
