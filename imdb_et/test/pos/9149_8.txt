This film is a good start for beginners who have never looked at a silent movie and for those who believe that high-quality cinema began with the aspirations of generations. They do the services themselves if they do not expand their horizons. "Silent film" is a pantomime that differs from the sound and the production, which may be its own attributes. <br /> <br /> BELOVED ROGUE (1927) The common artist is the fictional history of the French poet Francois Villoni and King Louis XI. "The King of Villons Prodding" Louis Louis "captures the" Burgen Duke "to a minimum in the Feudal system and establishes the king as the Head of State and the beginning of modern France. <br /> <br /> The extraordinary headed by JOHN BARRYMORE (yes, Drew's father) is cast. who remember him only for the disintegrating actor "Larry Renault" at eight dinners (1933) or hissing WOMEN (1940), this is a revelation. The American movie is CONRAD TITLE, who interpreted "XI-Louis." It is a twin of functioning titans, each of which does not give customs to another. Trivia's note is Character Actor and Dwarf ANGELO ROSSITTO on their first film, the last, MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME (1985). There are also other character actors who would continue the sound that has picked up easily. <br /> <br /> American artists will not save money on this beautiful production, which was followed by WILLIAM CAMERON MENZIES. the kits are well made and not exaggerated as in the DOUGLAS FAIRBANKS products. Here is the real reality. A DVD from "Delta Entertainment" came from a good master. Although it was not "restored", the musical soundtrack was clear and it only suffers from unpleasant black spots (dirt) and dropping. The only major damage at the end of the last throat from the water. â€œKino also has a edition that can be of a better quality because they make bigger impressions in their print. The best control with them. In our opinion, this is "must be", especially if you do not have "silent" in your collection. This is a good place to start.
