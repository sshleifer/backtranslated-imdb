I saw this movie tonight. When I got into that, I thought it would be good because I like Natalie Portman and Susan Sarandon is also a big actor, but it was better than I thought. You come out of the movie, you feel great. Action was great, which has been difficult lately. Natalie Portman is for big things and I'm a student at NYU, I think it's nice she's going to school, not just an actor. Anyway, again, the subject keeps the whole path you are interested in and I think everyone should watch it. I'd give more details, but I don't want to give away the movie.
