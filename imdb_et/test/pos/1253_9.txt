Although my children enjoyed the movie (and later announced that they want to buy it later), I think I got more out of it. The scene in the airport shop is a real life in the beginning (I didn't use the cut-off comment loudly, but I thought it was). It's a good living environment, a little sweet, and some scenes work less than others (why does Bruce Willis stay after he knows his mother is dying?), But all together and in time. It also gave our family something to say - did my kids think my life was boring? What are they waiting for? How do you not like the film that gives you good conversation with your children?
