Chaplin stars as a double role as a Jewish hairdresser who has been misled by the dictator Adenoid Hynk (ie Hitler) in 1940, where war was on his dark days and never won by allies. In Germany, Hitler was forbidden to ban and was dangerous for Chaplin, because if the war was lost, he would definitely be sent to "retraining". <br /> <br /> Funny satire with classic scene of Hitler's tossing around the world with a giant balloon .. good fun, but with a message .. little preaching at the end. It was the last movie of the Chaplin brand with a little mustache. on a scale from 1 to 10..9
