History, mythology and fantasy fan "Mystic Knights" exhibition pulled me away. It has semi-scripts, fantastic costumes (there are exceptions), pretty good action, and all heroes and villains play well. <br /> <br /> SCRIPTS - half of the script is pretty big, the other half is flat, but it all mixes, which means that many episodes turn out to be so good. Some key people are repeatedly given dead lines (such as King Conchobar and Angus) who have to be given something ... more. I'm not sure what writers should be able to do. ACTIVITIES - In addition to some villagers' actions (terrible features make them too much effort), casting their drivers was very good. Everyone, good and bad, works well! KITS / HIGH - everyday clothes everyone carries are remarkable! The Mystic Knight's armor, which is below, is Deirdre and Garrett. The chain ribbon bikini would probably have better protection for him ... and it wouldn't look like plastic; its appearance is of brown plastic if it should be bronze. Ivari Trident looks like it has been purchased at a discount store and while Garrett's arms look cool, they also see plastic. <br /> <br /> Recently, "Mystic Knights" has taken too many "Power Rangers" features when you look at an exhibition, you'll find out what I mean. As the series progresses, it should find its niche and refine its style. All in all, it is a great show that all ages should enjoy (most of my friends and I look at it and we are all 20+). Thickening and twisting of the plot, although it gets a little younger at times, and everything just becomes more interesting. It can be an interesting movie about "Willow" or T.V. series "Sinbad Adventures" for fans. A lot of adventure, a mystery storm, a dash of romance, a spray of natural forces ... Look at it! (My score: 7/10)
