I first saw this VHS masterpiece 10 years ago, and a powerful interpretation of the angry boy-painfully-counter-created society has remained in my heart since then. Director Hector Babenco is such a good mankind who finds a gentle corner to tell the story of how the city kills childhood from the poverty class. Even challenged children have their innocent beautiful dreams. But the corrupt reality never gives me the chance ... <br /> <br /> Thanks to the publishers of the latest DVD publishers, I can now keep this great movie in my favorite collection.
