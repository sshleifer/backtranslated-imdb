I looked at this example from the beginning and I'm a 45 year old man. For me it is so much more than an exhibition that women like. It's a family story, maybe unusual, but the family still. It focuses on mother and daughter Lorele and Rory Gilmore, two bright, attractive and successful women in their own way. Lorelei makes her home in fictional Stars Hollow, CT, small New England towns that have a historical feeling, and a population that may be unusual but that works as an insecure family. The exhibition also casts off the relationship between Lorelei and his parents, Richard and Emily Gilmore, old money DAR WASP people who do not approve of Lorelei's choices in life, although Lorelei doesn't care. The relationship event and the passing line is what makes this exhibition the best in my WB network (soon to be CW). See this example!
