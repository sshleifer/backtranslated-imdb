As with all Haneke films, make your decision - don't let it read, and if you're interested in someone who uses your movie for your unique purposes, look at it yourself. Isabelle Huppert is stunned in this movie - with Haneke - these two do not pull their strokes. Haneke rolled us by attracting the golden boy Benoit Magimel, but it is both romantic and a funny game of anti-thriller. You have to look a lot and catharsis is much more in the range of persistent anxiety than any emotional release, but it is incredibly nervous and thoughtful; Haneke still keeps a mirror on how Western civilization has been or has changed. People can turn their nose on it, but that's just what Solondz happily did a couple of steps forward. Being justified in reality, what Erika (Huppert) does is considered an emotional metaphor. I do not recommend it, but I wouldn't keep you so ... it definitely shares people, but given that it is largely repressive - it's not surprising.
