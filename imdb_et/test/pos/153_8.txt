Now that I saw it, it is NOT what I expected, at least not before the end. I read some other comments before I got a copy of it from Amazon and I was glad I did it. Being first acquainted with Park's work through Oldboy, I was curious about how he heals the genre and was quite pleased with the way he did it wisely. I think Park has matured in the presentation, because although Oldboy and some of his other works are very nice and deliberate on camera work, he has some good updates in Bakjw, which I didn't see in other vamp films. For example, a scene where father Hyeon realizes a beast growing inside of him when he always gives his shoes barefoot to Ta-ju and he sees blood pumping through Tae-skin and his eyes expanding in bloody blood for that. It had a nice effect. I was also happy that Park was not captured by CG and in fact it is a very small CG. I came up completely from Bakjw to think that one thing would happen and drive in a real park. In addition, I liked Park's little symbolism and reversal, while we usually don't get this Asian cinema. At the beginning of the film, we see that the plot slowly develops and becomes familiar with the characters and feel like an invisible observer of what is happening. The Park treats you a little as a ghost of Christmas competition to show you, albeit a bit boring, what life is outside your world. Ah, but then we start to feel a little kinship with the growing lust of the Father and Tae-ju and the conflict with the priest. We are about to start with them even until the Park has hit us so nicely, and we really see that Bakjwi is finally a moral dilemma and a right and wrong film. It does not spoil you when I tell you that you look at Bakjwit's way of priestly thinking, and I think you're coming out of what Park wants you to do. Don't wait for Oldboy and stylization because that's not what you get here. This genre is very interesting. Those who missed many literary elements and religious hints looked at some other film, not Bakjwit. After Bakjwit, check out Let The Right One IN, this is not what you expect.
