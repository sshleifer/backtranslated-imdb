Just before World War II, it is a touching and undervalued romantic story based on a loosely real event. <br /> <br /> It concerns the German missile researcher Gerhart Zucher (Ulrich Thomsen), who works in the UK with the advent of World War II. Fear that Hitler could call him back to Germany to help him prepare for the war, Zucher and his slippery assistant Heinz (Eddie Marsan) are evacuating the British authorities to a remote Scottish island. They are given the task of building a rocket box that allows islanders to communicate with the mainland. <br /> <br /> Saared and tempted by the Saarites, they set up a home with a local girl Catherine Mackay (a stunning Shauna MacDonald) with whom Thomsen starts things but complications arise when Germany calls ... <br /> <br /> The central romance between Zucher and Catherine is subtle and sincerely played and supportive is a colorful bunch with an array of reputable Scottish character actors including Gary Lewis and Clive Russell. <br /> <br /> A subtle cinematography and brilliant central theme song in a local dialect is rounded around this movie. <br /> <br /> Smart, but undesirable, it's good for a quiet evening.
