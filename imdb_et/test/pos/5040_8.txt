Perhaps the best role of John Travolta ever. Saturday night fever was a great film and a role, but a long time. I can't think of many of his films or roles that I even loved, and it's easy to think of rotten. He can make meanings like Pulp Fiction, but he does a perfect funky angel and it is hard to imagine someone doing better (equally slobby) work. Plot summaries are available everywhere, but the plot is not a point. Just go for a ride and have fun with the little ones. Nothing like this movie if you don't look deep. I want more of these movies. We need to break deep or fantastic or harsh or complex or hysterical.
