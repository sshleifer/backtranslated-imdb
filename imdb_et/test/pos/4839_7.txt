Look ... I've been waiting for William Macy's level of action ... the man just puts terrible performances ... but MEAT LOAF? Just when His Loafness decided to drop Jim Steinman and throw his decisively smaller weight into Stanislavski's wonderful world? Well ... what am I saying? I have the impression. Paraphrasing the old proverb: "It's not meat, it's an emotion" ... and Loaf quietly blows his late-acting pieces. <br /> <br /> Laura Dern takes the 40's look perfectly here ... good work by costumes and hair departments ... David Paymer is typed but right on the money. The solid camera works throughout the flick. The plot line resembles the "Gentleman Agreement" (post-World War II anti-Semitism). It's worth your time ... especially for the growing legions of Bill Macy acolytes. <br /> <br />
