It is absolutely the best comic of the 80s, perhaps the best comic of all time. It had all the activities, adventure, excitement and much more ... <br /> <br /> I can't imagine how hard it was for Ruby-Spears to make this big cartoon, there is a lot of money spent on this masterpiece and it was worth it, for example, just luminous scenes were difficult because I didn't call the 1980s a great technology year, as computers like the world we live in today, so that the scenes that were radiating were Excellent! <br /> <br /> Cartoons are never the same as they used to be, so I hope they'll all be released on DVD specifically for The Centurions because it's my favorite. I have a whole set of DVDs from 65 episodes, but it's not the same because when they appear on the DVD, people in the world can buy and watch DVDs in almost every store, which means many fans. My good friend Ted made this statement on a DVD, either on a TV or at a better show, that is, we get many requests to bring them back to the DVD. <br /> <br /> So please help us signing the application at http://www.petitiononline.com/6600F/petition.html
