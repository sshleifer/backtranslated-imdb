In general, I give this film a good 7.6. To get started, I say I love how this character was depicted and customized on the screen. If you read the comics from time to time or just watch the DVDs, you can see the Blade character significantly different from the movie. Among the changes, Blade is now the most important vampire, thereby acquiring "all of its strengths, but none of their weaknesses." David Goyer, the fan of the darker genre of the comics, obviously pays for this. Thanks to him, Blade has become a much more interesting character and I find it one of my favorite heroes. Wesley Snipes was born to play this role, although some would probably have been executed by Dezenel Washington or Will Smith (lol). His action here does not have to be exactly winning the Oscar, given this character, but I am glad he decides to play DayWalker in two sequences. Also starring Stephen Dorff as our main villain and Kris Kristofferson, when Blade Alfred speaks. Actually, it is good and the activity keeps the plot firm. The club's opening scene is one of my favorite things I have to say. Like this movie, there are some things that annoy me, which take the "Spider-Man" or "X-Men" as the top of this movie. Stephen Norrington had a badge like I didn't like so honestly. Their lines were so full of funny comedy that he didn't know the comic book. Plus "La Magra" is a bit of a disappointment as the last villain, but an intense sword fight creates it. Not to mention the extra sense of non-realism: a black man in a leather cover with a sword beaing # $% ^ out of the police in wide daylight. ..dumb. Being away from some of his mistakes, Mark Isham's music was great and made the movie nicely. Fortunately, all these problems are fixed and improved in the stunning order "Blade 2".
