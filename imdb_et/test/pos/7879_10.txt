Peter Boyle was always a great actor, and he proved it as a performance as a weapon-ho Big, making me hate every time he used the N-word, I watched him and his big mouth and wanted to kick out his lights. (Think that Peter Boyle was once a monk) (now "Everybody Loves Raymond" supporting actor) Susan Sarandon, who made her first debut, immediately bathed and enjoyed sharing it with someone else in her dirty water. I noticed the great Raggerty Ann Doll (creator, John Gruelle) was the only thing Susan actually trusted and loved and the doll appeared in quite a few scenes. If you really want to know how 70s are drugs, free love, and pipe dreams, then enjoy the great direction of John G. Avildsen ("Rocky and" Karate Kid ".") I always thought Peter Boyle should have been. a cult class that is worth watching and sharing with others.
