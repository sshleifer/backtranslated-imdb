Watching a film staged by Russian legend Sergei M. Eisenstein on some sequences (a mistake, the whole ice on the third film of 1/3) from Estonian Alexander Nevs (his only remarkable credit co-led by Dmitry Vasilyev) made me realize how much to really manage, at least to the extent . If I was a member of the prize group during the release of this film, I would probably give the Eisenstein Director a prize. It is such a crazy course of cinematography to pull some of the things out of the movie, even though one of those directors after the best work - Battleship Potemkin and October - could have been something he was scared of at first. However, between the film, which is sometimes a bit frustrating, when black and white themes are scarce, it is still almost 70 years later to admire the pulp. The fans of the rings meet with the grandfather of the films to say that something is a piece of propaganda that puts a lot of attention on it and often bad. This is something that has the full message and perspective. It is still a hot debate (see Moore's film-proofing arguments) as to whether great art can bring out something that is point-empty, designed to attract audiences in a special way. In this particular case, the Russians against the Germans. At a time when WW2 was approaching and there was again "German invaders" in Russia, it is interesting to note that Eisenstein was actually tasked with making this film because the rally's call to Russians would never forget an important part of their history. The end result comes out as something that is actually a bit plain of seeing the Battleship and October; if nothing else comes through these movies, Eisenstein is most concerned about how the image and content can come together for the viewer to stop the viewer completely. Under these conditions, Alexander Nevsky is fearless. <br /> <br /> But even if the whole idea of ​​"Great Russia, the Germans are Bad", some small moments, where things are a little less strict, a little less stringent for their ideals. For example, when we first see Privka Germans, they are not facial punches who are completely barbaric and have the will to conquer blind (not that they don't take what they get). They also have their own national pride that they have nothing less to go on, what their Christian-led masters say. At least, the picture has an evil face, which is still kept at a lower level to hit it more. There is also a short scene, before the battle of the ice force, where the Russian troupe has a joke that is spoken and laughed, and it adds a little more depth, otherwise there may be little. Because more often than Alexander Nevsky, where the battle songs are proud of the battle, the character is not complicated, especially Nevsky himself (played in an ultra-heroic way, but Nikolai Cherkasov at the beginning of the poll) what to consider. After all, searching for naturalness in Eisenstein's film is the same as trying to find non-Kosher pigs at the deli. <br /> <br /> But the real reason why you don't see the picture works anyway, but for the film's look, how it moves and takes the expansive environment that Eisenstein puts out. On an epic scale, it is as ambitious as its 20th films, several additions not only in the main scenes of battle, but also in the scenes of cities, the roll of hundreds of people. In fact, I would say that all the Hollywood or other leaders who think they would do some great epic, especially war, would do the movie very well, even if the sound is turned off. It's even better to think of a silent film, where the visual shots are sometimes extraordinarily emphasized. It could take a whole month to analyze the battle of ice, how it starts far from German soldiers and then, like the mistakes, and how Eisenstein's integration takes place between the close-ups of the participants and then between large-scale pictures and editing. And of course, the power of music cannot be subtracted, Sergei Prokofiev gives one of the most exciting results of an epic work. All the time the director's editing keeps our eyes moving at this frenzied speed. If it were just a short film, it would certainly be in high places like the order of the stairs in Odessa. <br /> <br /> If I found it a little less than absolutely perfect, it would be due to errors coming from the director, who is much more suitable for the silent medium than the sound. Although I have not yet seen Ivan Terrible, one of my negative criticisms of his actors who are really as wide as the melodrama is as high as it is surprising. Competing soldiers for Olga is the best example I think). But even with that in mind, Alexander Nevsky is all too extraordinary to ignore it, and draws a level of participation in action and film making that even sets an example for movies to try and live today.
