During bad, if not terrible, comedies, the King of the Queens is more than just a breath of fresh air, it's a full oxygen tank! In my opinion, this is one of the five best comedy shows of all time. Nothing has been because of married children. Kevin James and Jerry Stiller are comic geniuses! And believe me, it takes a lot to tag me as a comic genius. These guys really understand what's funny. I can look at ten Seinfeld episodes and couldn't laugh at seeing KOQ once. Other funny people in this show are Carrie, Janet Heffernan, Spence and Doug Pruzan (Carrie boss). I'm so happy that they managed to get so many seasons from this legacy. The exhibition has been a fun winner for the most part during the comic losers. Check it out if you are not !!
