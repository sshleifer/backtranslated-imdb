This movie gives you more ideas about how the Austrians are doing. Although the castle is an excellent Australian film, it's a bit out there. This movie is by far the best Aussie flick I've seen (haven't seen Dirty Deeds yet) and probably my favorite movie. The thing is, if you haven't seen it, look at it. If your thing is crime / action / comedy.
