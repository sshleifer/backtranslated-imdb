David Lynch shot his first film "Erasurehead" for several years, adding new scenes every time he managed to make a little more money. Kevin Smith worked as an "official" at work, and Robert Rodriguez is proud that "From Dusk Till Dawn" costs exactly $ 30,000. But $ 30,000 is still a lot of money to raise when you work in a cleaner cemetery. And what if the aspiring filmmaker would have not only done such work, but also the ambitions of the luminaires and the whole Smith's dorkish match, but no talent. This is Mark Borchardt, who is this fun documentary that crowns his efforts to make a few films over many years. Borchardt combines his mad dreams with depression flights and death that he can't call every day; one feeling that he prefers almost endless work to look for the impossible perfection of a place where he is simply ("based on evidence in the" American film ") very good. And like today's Ed Wood, he surrounds himself with the losers of an epic crowd whose true affection is his greatest salvation function. The collection includes his warrior parents, the best friends (one criminal, another reformed drug addict), his own unhappy children, and the best of Uncle Bill at his age. Bill can live in a trailer park and has almost abandoned life, but he is the owner of a small fortune ($ 280,000 exactly) and the relationship between two men, but potentially exploited, is at the heart of the film. . Borchardt is able to participate in some actors (of course, with himself), but basically he depends on the full work of his friends and family (even Bill has a camera role). In British television, the BBC has designed the American movie "back-to-back" screening "Lost in La Mancha", a story about Terry Gilliam's bad attempt to "Don Quixote". In this film, I was impressed by the high level of professionalism displayed (inadequate, as was the case for this task), and just how difficult it is to spend a film even on millions of experts; whereas Borschadt is not only a rude one, but also a clown that cannot even declare the name of its work ('Coven') correctly. Ultimately, Borschadt is enough person to want you to succeed, but terrible that the viewer can still laugh in the neighborhood. If this film was a fiction, you would leave it incredible; but this is one of the most fun documentaries you will probably see.
