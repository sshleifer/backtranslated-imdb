I am always fascinated by ninjistsu who would know that it goes further than farther. "Ninja III" is fun and encouraging. The police pulls the ninja and uses his spirit to retaliate. A victim, a lovely young woman named Christie (Lucinda Dickey). He falls to the police who was shooting. The scene of love, where she pours V8 on her body, knocked me out! Ninja's death will become another Japanese name, Yamada (Sho Kosugi), who comes to America not only to save Christie, but to ninja grave. Just because he put Yamada's left eye out with a shuriken (throwing). The fighting scenes were great. I liked the part that plywood falls on Yamadale, and he shares that leg. And when he was caught, he says that Officer Christie was involved in everything. Thumbnail: Ninja has never been rated. He took the others to the police without killing them. And he did his thing without worrying. Of course, Chirstie did her best to put her ninja in place to use her for revenge. It was a good movie, great for martial arts buffets. 3 out of 5 stars!
