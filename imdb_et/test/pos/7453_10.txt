Graphics: probably brilliant. The most stunning things are NOT definitely given to trailers. Struggle sequences are moving very fast, but after a couple of them, it should be used and it doesn't seem so confusing. Cloud has a lot of swords and I want things to move LITTLE slower so we can see them because they were very detailed. And we can finally see exactly how one materia supplies ... <br /> <br /> Music: Great. I was a bit nervous about it because (what I've seen) Nobuo is not the best for writing music to go with action (remember Steal the Tiny Bronco?), But it's great and it fits perfectly. I'm glad OST ordered. They changed the lyrics to one Winged Angel so you can't sing when you know Carmina Burana Lyrics. <br /> <br /> Plot: In the first half of the movie, things are created and introduced to everyone in a rather complicated tapestry, but the other half is almost entirely in combat when all players are in place. I wouldn't call it a weak plot, but it's not nearly as difficult as the plot was. I think this is an attempt to prevent the game from being overshadowed, and I think it is a good thing ... the film is by nature and should not try the double lines of the original. I testify that I was the one who hoped this film would bring FF7 to a wider range of people, but that is not the main film. I only gave her nine letters, just because it doesn't really explain to newcomers ... Marlene (at least I think it was Marlene ... she liked it) start, but that's more than a recurring course. But then I realized that this movie is for me, so why should I just take away the points because other people probably don't like it either ... if you've played or at least been familiar, you should see this movie. But you don't have to tell me that. If you don't know it, go out and buy it, sit there for twenty hours and beat it, and then watch the movie ... even without the background, it's still amazingly beautiful. You just don't get any internal references ... that make up 50% of the movie (ie, all that isn't a fight order).
