It was such a funny movie that was soon forgotten, probably because there are so many teenagers and young adult comedies like this. The film is not as predictable as one might think. Indexing is an unpleasant but fun and caring and most important very dedicated friend. Rebecca is still unlikely to be at home and probably a friendly boy. If she helps her to feel at school more easily, showing her in the neighborhood and encouraging her to communicate more, they become friends, but it's completely platonic. If she realizes that her boyfriend can offer, she does not feel ready, she seems to be like her boyfriend, but it seems she enjoys her free party life in college is not yet ready for marriage and responsibility for life. You learn what a good friend of Crawl is when he tells him to help him get married. If his boyfriend proposes him to the whole family, he will hit Crawl and put him on the spot. He tells the whole family that he is putting him in, and gives him his ring of diamonds he sets up all the time (he was supposed to come out of money or something. Well, they don't really show around). The message of the film seemed not to look for people by their appearance, not to judge people before you knew him. Rebecca's boyfriend, who loves his parents, changed when we learned that he had been stunning his new girlfriend after Rebecca (Amber Thesan) and Crawl, so that Rebecca would have broken with Crawl, I thought they were a couple. Though they weren't, Rebecca was angry with her, thinking about it, was so unfair because they were not couples, but I think they started to love each other. And I think he thought there was more. The film didn't really show them a couple, they left the viewers to decide. They couldn't even kiss at some point, although there was one part where they almost did. It was one thing most viewers seemed wrong with. Many people saw it and said that it would be a nightmare for the fathers to see their daughters bring home or shock, but they were all friends all the time, even at the end. And he didn't introduce him as his boyfriend; they never said to their parents that they did not participate. Rebecca almost did. Even if he never became his boyfriend, they would have been friends. For some reason in the 90s, feminism and the great stereo type that the woman liked feminine men (not because it was wrong with it), I think it stems from the fact that women love such a sensitive type that crawls proved that their friendship Rebeccaga. but when I saw the movie, I have to admit that when I look, I thought I would have gone to the first boy. However, it was a creative film that tried to teach friendship and others to decide.
