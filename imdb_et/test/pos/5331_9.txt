Leland Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling) is sent to jail for the murder of an autistic child. If you click on "Why?" he has no answer. When she is in jail, she meets a teacher with Pearl (Don Cheadle) who decides to pick up things and help Leland understand why she did. Throughout this film, we learn all about Leland's difficult life, including his former girlfriend Becky (Jena Malone), his famous father Albert (Kevin Spacey) and all his sad life. <br /> <br /> This movie is the second film by Matthew Ryan Hoge, which is remarkable everywhere. This is one movie that will leave you thinking finally and wondering how it all works. The film is quite dark, but if you can do it, you will understand how good this film is. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a bad guy. There is no one to blame for anything that happens. There are no stereotypes and the audience does not try to prove Leland is guilty. Instead, we sit back, relax and watch this boy's life during the film. All the problems of the story are very real. Drug addiction, parents' expectations, overwhelming sadness; they all exist in our world. <br /> <br /> Ryan Gosling gives his movie one of the greatest performances, like the depressed teenager Leland. His father lives in Europe and doesn't care much about his son. The only person he loves is Becky, but he has problems. He knows exactly what he did, but as he says in the movie: "You want to, but maybe not. Maybe that's what happened. 'There is a reason, but we do not know it until the end. When watching the film, the audience discovers that such a young person can find out so much about the world. Leland notes things that people tend to ignore. <br /> <br /> One special thought-provoking scene that really influenced me was one at Leland's conversation with Pearl. Pearl just cheated on his wife and when Leland asks why, Pearl replies that she is the only person. Then Leland says something that never happens to anyone: "Why do people say that if they've done something wrong," Chris Klein gave another fantastic show. In the film, he plays with the boyfriend of Allen Harris, Becky's sister Julie (Michelle Williams). Although she is not one of the main characters, I was surprised at how deep her character was. You get a lot against Allen. You know how much he cares about Pollard's family. It would be like his own meat and blood. At the end of the movie you will understand how far he would help them. In general, this film is a masterpiece that has been neglected by quite a few people. However, if you take the time to view it, you'll probably see everything I mentioned above is true. And once you've finished watching it, you'll never see the world the same way. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10
