All you need is a big house, a babysitter and a phone. Simon West drives this excitement and cooling from the original 1979. This version is more like a thriller than a horror tape. Emotionally tense with growing fear. Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) must develop an excessive mobile phone bill; he assumes the responsibility of taking care of the child by Dr. and Mrs Mandrakis' two children (Derek de Lint and Kate Jennings Grant). The house is a beautiful wooden and glass masterpiece of the 1970s. Separated and calm. The children are already in bed, the wind is being built and the rain is added to it. The phone starts ringing, ringing, ringing. The babysitter will soon be a frantic survival mode that fears the horrible stranger on the other end of the phone. <br /> <br /> Belle is great as an innocent, intelligent and strong teen babysitter. The foreign voice on the phone is Lance Henriksen, while the physical stranger is played by Tommy Flanagan. They are also: Katie Cassidy and Brian Geraghty. Knit James Dooley for the original music of the atmosphere.
