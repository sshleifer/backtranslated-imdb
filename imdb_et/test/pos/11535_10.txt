I can't figure out for my life why this movie's rating here is so low. It was one of the most beautiful films I saw this year. It really hit the chord. I had been watching this movie for several months and I was thinking about myself, somehow it can't meet the expectations I had for it ... seeing how I built my head as much as I did. Well, it goes without saying that it not only meets my expectations, but has surpassed them. Jordana Brewster and Cameron Diaz were great. Their actions are great. They were completely natural for both their role and their roles. The places were absolutely proud. Each film filmed was completely busy and fits nicely into the mood and atmosphere. I found this movie very touching and took it close to my heart. I would even think it might be one of my favorites of all time. At least, definitely I saw it again and again. <br /> <br /> I swear that there was no mistake in this movie. It's hard to say that every movie. I highly recommend it. It is touching, it makes sense, and it says a lot about the human animal and the family. <br /> <br /> Of the 10 in 10.
