Involvement of European pilots of Czech fighters flying to RAF during World War II. It is always interesting for America to see a new perspective on historical events. There is nothing terribly original or revolutionary about the style in which it is filmed or the romantic triangle of love that anchors anchor. However, it is convincing. There is a good balance between drama, romance, humor, action and symbolism, which the director and director are underestimated. It's a breath of fresh air after sitting out in a crowded and boring Hollywood epic like "Pearl Harbor". Strong production around. It's definitely worth your while when you're a foreign cinema fan.
