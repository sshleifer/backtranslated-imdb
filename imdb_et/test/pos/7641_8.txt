I hit this movie from the horror channel and the gothic atmosphere and tone of the movie were pretty impressed. Like a big fan of vampire affairs, I am always happy to see a new version of vampire salespeople, in this case a ghoul-like creature living in another dimension of Lovecraft. The director has done a brilliant job of communicating the dark mood of the theme, using decadent art as the scene's backdrop to what is essentially the story of love of time and space - pure love of friendship that is opposed to the desire and life of blood by vampires. The characters in the story are transported to another dimension with a mind-changing substance, where it appears that the shape-changing vampire creature gives them the desires of their hearts, while emptying their nature of life. There are some analogues about losing drug dependence and control, and how it affects a group of friends in the art community. I liked the story of the 2 main male characters, Chris Ivan Cevic and Alex Petrovich, who were very attractive pieces, always a plus point for the female vampire story! The special effects and the effects of the creatures were well done and the vampire dimension was very effective. All in all, it is nice to make vampire sales and is recommended for anyone who loves their vampires with some intelligence and not just action. The only thing missing to make it even better would have been a little more eroticism and nudity because it would fit the plot and the themes.
