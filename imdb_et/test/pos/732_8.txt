The sweet young sister Charlotte Beale (a charming force that is the enchanting redhead fall of Rosie Holotik) goes to work far away from the rural shelter led by Dr. Geraldine S. Masters (excellent Annabelle Weenick). Colorful crazy patients are insatiable, aggressive nymphomaniac Allyson King (lush Betty Chandler), loopy judge Oliver W. Cameron (brilliant hammy Gene Ross), paranoid Vietnamese veteran sergeant Jaffee (nicely played by Hugh Feagin), gentle giant Sam (friendly William Bill McGhee ) and walnut old hell Mrs. Callingham (extremely irritating to Rhea MacAdams). These patients are encouraged by dr. Behave by the Master to act on his fantasy, which will naturally lead to a rash of brutal killings. Director S.F. Well-known and appropriately overwritten by Tim Pope's manuscript, Brownrigg is working to create and maintain a suffocatingly stabbing and clotting atmosphere of tortured madness and oppressive claustrophobia. Robert Farrar's terrible score, grimy set design, some wild murder murders, Bruce B. Alcott's grungy no-frills cinema, lots of delicious, scenic histrionics from a playground game (especially Ross's full eye) 70s low-budget regional cinema for the exploitation of infectious fun.
