A bit of a "movie movie" or if the topic here is a virtual game, which is reality or even more frightening, what reality is "real". Like every Cronenberg, there are organic things like a pod and it's a great idea: an organic weapon, a tooth-shaped bone and a tissue weapon. If there are some slower moments, the sets, designs, and ideas exist with some ideas of revolution. You can't like it, because the way the movie is done is quite unusual and sometimes disturbing, but it's definitely worth it.
