OKAY. Finally, a horror film that is well done. As soon as I heard the music, I knew that some effort had been made to create what I think it was almost a good game of chance. Zombies, whores, deer, grave and more. Great cast, well-functioning, well-managed, well-written --- hardly a mistake. Even American actors with Irish / English accents pulled it out. I thought actor Larry Fessenden seemed familiar to me. It was this lost tooth. Finally, I realized that this man was the leading part of the "Habit" movie from vampires in NYC. I thought he was great in this role. Now I don't know if he's American or not. His accent was so convincing "I sell" that I thought he had to grow up on the emerald island, not in the US. Obviously he was born and raised in New Yorker. Great actor - really made his role in this movie. Nothing will let a horror strike at the beginning of the 19th century (like the old Hammer flicks). I encourage everyone who wants a good time to watch this well-designed movie.
