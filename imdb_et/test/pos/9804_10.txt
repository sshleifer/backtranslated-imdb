I'm surprised that so many viewers didn't find all the characters in the movie ..... that's what made the movie an incredible piece of art! The story deals with some of the saddest content the film can hold, but it's one of the best movies I've ever seen because you need your imagination and brilliance events. <br /> <br /> If you pay close attention, this message is there. The male kills the younger brother. An older brother made a story about driving a wagon to deal with the pain of his brother's death. There are those who argue why he would lie to his children. For me, the answer is because he does not want to share such disgust with his children or that he has blocked it and replaced his memory with the thought of a terrible event that his brother was driving to safety. I have read some comments that believe he was the only child and that he created a younger brother to escape in order to cope with the abuse he was suffering. Although this is an interesting idea - I love the imagination that was developed earlier. I don't think she would have lied to her little brother about her children. But I find it plausible that he would have lied about his brother's death. But I like the idea that at the end it is much better than the idea that the film had no symbolism at all. <br /> <br /> There are many different shots in the movie, but if you take the movie's nominal value ..... two brothers who will create a wagon that will flee from an abusive father-father - you will be brilliant. The fact that I managed to see the fine messages in the script was what made the movie so incredible. It requires your own thinking process and your imagination to make it work ...... dig deep when you look at it. You have a genius in a surprised movie. The only other movie I've ever seen in a symbolic and subtle message is Pleasantville ..... but it's a comment on another movie!
