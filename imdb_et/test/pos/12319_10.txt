Just one of my three or four favorite films. Definitely one on the island in the desert. There is nothing "genial" about this movie. Rather, it glows warm and welcoming. Audiences are invited to the party and like any good party, there is joy in communicating with the guests and what you learn when you move on. Exclaiming Joyce, the movie's title reflects a number of ideas that keep the audience away. The film is not terrible. It's not frustrating. It is a beautiful exploration of the time in the past, during which people grow and others are ending. Some are frustrated and others are calm. And all night long, the people are the people and the parts of the people who are on vacation. The words spoken by these fine actors are perfection and, according to Irish broog music, they are heard by the celebration, especially by Americans of a certain tone. For the above-mentioned lack of brilliance, I will take it back. There is no other word between Anjelica Huston and Donal McCann. It talks about tacit ropes? well, everything. Some beautiful snowy nights, rent this movie and let it happen to you. Permanent fighting, cars, dinosaurs? just a movie most sublime.
