The theme of religion in the Buñuel films is a point that hardly needs to be analyzed as a feeder or person in the art of films. "La Voie Lactée", "Un Chien Andalou" or "L'Age d'Or" can be seen on satirical Buñuel. Critic is very difficult and effective, but if you have seen it and then you see a movie like "Nazarine" then after you see this work, you start questioning the author. And many have asked what seems to be contradictory to Buñuel, but what is not better in this way, I think there is no contradiction in his work, but that the viewpoint of the Buñuel religion is very diverse as unique in films. <br /> <br /> This beautiful film is based on Benito Perez's Galdo novel, telling us the story of Nazar, a father who lived for a humble, simple life dedicated to God and to all. He lived in a simple and poor area. Beatriz, who was a abused and abandoned woman, also lived there. She doesn't find any sense in her life without her violent, maso-man. He has some will for him. On the other side is Andara, one of the city's prostitutes. Father Nazario is stolen again, he accuses Andara's cousin. Andara hears it and tries to fight a priest who doesn't believe in violence. That night, Andara found that her cousin was actually a thief, she had stolen her bellboys. Andara is fighting with the terrible consequences of her cousin. With this, Andara seeks mercy from the priest. Nazario decides to help her, knowing well that it may be against her church, obviously with some consequences. Since then, Nazario has become a pilgrim. Without anything, even without shoes, but with spirit and faith. But Andara and Beatriz want to be with her and be like her to serve God. <br /> <br /> If this is the most enjoyable Buñuel movie I've seen so far, it's too spiritual. It is clear that the thing that is confusing is that here we do not see Buñuel against the power of the church, we see Buñuel, whose film is of a church, but not a typical - and large - satirical way. Although this is the case, I do not believe that the right word is controversial, in fact, I find it pleasant and well done and despite such religious problems (because his "Voie Lactée") found it as a spiritual film, but do not try to touch the Catholic religion in diversity because maybe he touches and laughs in other movies. "Nazarine" is Father Nazario and the foremost God of that perspective and the same religion, but it is ultimately the spiritual life of that person. <br /> <br /> The other two women are not the opposite, but very two more perspectives of faith. First of all, we have Beatriz, an abused woman who loses all faith in life, first with her husband and then with a little daughter in her family. This little girl was very sick. On his side was Andara, a prostitute who led justice. There is great pain in the child's family, but in religious women, but faith will become the father of Nazarite if he does not reach this city. He blesses the child, later says he is good. The priest wants to go on foot, but Beatriz and Andara have restored faith in life and want to dedicate their lives to God with their father Nazar. After some complaints, Father Nazario decides to be with them, discovering with himself how he knows the faith, God, faith, and the right person, the people who need to stay in charity. The last question should then be noted as one possible explanation of pineapple duration. It ends up listening to the drums (similar to "L'Age d'Or") and Father Nazario, walking over the questions when he refuses the fruit for the first time and ultimately decides to get it as a symbol of necessity or perhaps the answer to his spiritual path. which is going to be a priest. In the meantime, two women have to take away their father, Andara, for their crime (A beautiful scene where he thanks a man who helps his father in Nazar prison and then went to jail for a man hit by a priest and Beatriz because he prefers to be with his macho man despite this that he treats him badly, just because he doesn't accept that he falls to a father loved by the priest, here is perhaps a unique place in the film for the critique collection - to walk against the controversy of the church, his religion. is that there is (a lot of soft but not for me) a critic in some religion (father Nazario, which helps women who are guilty of a crime, sin), but above all this is an analysis of Buñuel's religion and life and he really got it beautiful, gentle, a sweet and unforgettable movie that is undoubtedly one of his best. <br /> <br /> * We apologize for the mistakes ... well, if there is.
