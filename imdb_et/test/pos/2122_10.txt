Grand Champion is a little old fashion at first glance. Andrew Morton at Fort Worth Star Telegram said it was best if Walt Disney had greeted Texas, he would have made a great master. <br /> <br /> The film has no video or special effects, but it has a heart and soul. The kids are big and the number of stars is incredible. I bet Bruce Willis and Julia Roberts are proud to be in the movie their kids actually see :) (G rated) <br /> <br /> This is a masterfully designed "simple" little movie Texas has made Texas Barry Tubb. Get your kids, take your kids friends, take your grandmother ... they all enjoy it and you too.
