This movie is a picture of perfect action / drama / and thriller, every scene you have to suck. I watched this movie and was amazed at how many talented actors were in the movie. Especially great was Chapa Chapa, she played her role completely. A story was created for these actors. The characters make the movie so realistic. This movie just becomes a plus for me. Finally, look at this movie, it is comparable to a scar, but has a deeper story. Watch this movie !!!!!!
