This is a perfectly observable adventure movie to watch, with great pain and a good story based on real events. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that the story of the movie is based on real events. This is mostly an adventurous story, with all the usual ingredients you would expect from adventurous films in the Arab world. So, a lot of sword struggles, good old-fashioned glory, religion and rich gorgeous country. But the film is full of humor to make the movie easy and pleasant to watch. <br /> <br /> Continuous cutting back and forth between the Moroccan plot, with Sean Connery and Candice Berger and the American plot Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith) was not the best possible approach in my opinion. These two things are completely different, completely different characters, it's just a completely different world! Of course, both tracks are connected and focus on the same thing, but the contrast between the two worlds is just too big for it to work. It doesn't always make the movie connected and a little open. The American plot line is mostly more political, while the Morrocan plot line is purely adventurous and filled with action. Ultimately, maybe you might even wonder what the whole film or Roosevelt was in this movie. John Milius seems to be his great admirer. Often, the American plot line would take most of the quicker and more interesting and quicker filling of the morrocan plot line. After all, John Milius has always been a senior executive. <br /> <br /> It is not only half the size of a movie that gets completely steam. The biggest and greatest scalable action of the movie is launched. Particularly large final battles do not disappoint. I want the whole movie to be like that. So this film would certainly have been better known than it would have been. <br /> <br /> The film has a great musical score by Jerry Goldsmith, perhaps better known as the actual film itself. The film is also good looking, with a great production design and nice looking activities and battles. The film costs only $ 4,000,000, but it's hard to believe in terms of movie settings and size. I mean, John Milius is his best-known film, "Conan Barbarian", costing about $ 20,000,000, but was much more campaigning and less impressive on his scale. </p> A great fat Scottish accent, but hey, this is Sean Connery, so you just tend to accept it. He fits his role well. That's what Candice Bergen does. It is always difficult for a female character to believe and work in a movie like this, but she leads. John Huston plays a major role in this film. <br /> <br /> Perfectly subtle observable movie! <br /> <br /> 7/10
