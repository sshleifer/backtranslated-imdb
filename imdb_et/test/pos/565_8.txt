I watched it in HBO because it won the Oscar Week earlier. This is comparable to the fictional court drama. <br /> <br /> The story is a 15-year-old black boy who was sued in Jacksonville FL, the murder of an older white woman based almost exclusively on the victim's spouse and confession that the defense forces were forced. <br /> <br /> About half of the material is on trial; it is also complemented by material from members of the Defense Forces (two public lawyers) explaining their case, interviewing witnesses and visiting key locations. It is edited with minimal unnecessary repetition and placed in a logical sequence. The camera's work is pretty strong. And there is a slightly surprising epilogue.
