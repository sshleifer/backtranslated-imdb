The sad thing about Frontline is that if you look at these three or four episodes, you really start to realize that it is not far from what is happening in real life. What's really sad about it is extremely funny. <br /> <br /> The Frontline team in the first series consists of Brian Thompson (Bruno Lawrence) - a man who really lives and dies only according to the assessments his exhibitions will receive. Sometimes his stunts see him with his Line Producer Emma Thompson (Alison Whyte) to achieve these ratings; a woman who has not lost all her journalistic integrity and is ready to defend moral disorder. The same cannot be said of Reporter Brooke Vandenberg (Jane Kennedy) - a reporter who has absorbed the whole substance - so much that Ben Elton's questioning needs to be instructed to laugh. His reports usually consist of a celebrity interview (with whom he has previously passed the road) or scandalous unethical reports that usually come back. Martin De Stasio (Tiriel Mora) is a reporter with whom his team relies on gravity and dignity as he has a 21-year-old journalism behind him. His principles are not as great as what makes a good press story, even though he directs a random line. This chaos (called) parading is a selfish, naive reporter who does not see that he is just a beautiful face for stupid journalism. He often finds that his morality is endangered simply because Brian is turning to his vanity and allowing his stupidity to rest. <br /> <br /> Frontline is one that shows that there must be more, because it shows that today, happiness, safety and deep political understanding are interesting; evaluating scandals, fears, and tabloids is much easier.
