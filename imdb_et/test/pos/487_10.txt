I grew up in Winnipeg and saw the treatment of natives almost every day. ALL RASES are good and bad, why make them all bad? This applies to all races today. John Harper was an educated man, he graduated from high school, he even had a university in a year before returning to the reserve. How do I know that? John Harper lived with his family for three years when he was in high school, and he contacted us after graduation. He was a kind and gentle soul, he can be fun loving and he can be serious when the times were right. I was not very old when I left my house, but I still remember all the time he had helped with my homework when my brother was not disturbed. He even taught grade 3 before reaching Winnipeg. None of this is mentioned in the film, and the constant cross suicide is the recognition of guilt in my opinion. What happened to John is unforgiving not only in his homeland but also in the white community. Not all people in Winnipeg think like the police, I knew that person and what he was like a PERSON, not India!
