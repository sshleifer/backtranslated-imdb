Since the 1950s, there has been a clean thriller that speaks of smuggling diamonds from another country, as well as smallpox from infectious disease. Evelyn Keyes pulls all the stops as an important victim of this movie-runner. In the United States he is not aware that he can spread the disease to everyone and everything he touches. Finally, he will continue and must be stopped before the epidemic begins. Other than Keyes' outstanding performance is the support of her husband Charles Korvin, William Bishop, Dorothy Malone, Lola Albright and Whit Bissell. The final is a humminger with Miss Keyes, where you can see the lighthouse and hundreds of spectators. Good B flick!
