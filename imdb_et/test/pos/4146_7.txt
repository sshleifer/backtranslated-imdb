Where do I start. Can I tell you how cinematic is. Can I praise certain scenes that show leadership creativity. Do I say how realistic the scenes of Ellis Iceland are? Should I mention that we do not have a cliché scene to view the degree of freedom for change. (By now, immigrants looking at the ship's railings in the form of a cliché) <br /> <br /> Now, what's not so great is two big things, one of which is the result of a modern song and not even good to start it. The second and almost deadly film is boring, it moves so slowly that the drying of the colors would improve. <br /> <br /> The 118-minute working time is long and the movie still seems unfinished. We do not see the scenes of this family in the United States. Our hero mentions that he wants to find his twin brother, I would have enjoyed scenarios related to his meaningless search, not the other scenes. <br /> <br /> The movie is almost gone. <br /> <br /> Ratings (from 4) 81 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)
