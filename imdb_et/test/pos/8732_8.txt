CACTUS FLOWER was a delightful 1969 comedy based on Neil Simon's dentist (Walter Matthau), who had a relationship with a young free-spirited woman (Goldie Hawn), completely unaware that her dedicated sister / assistant (Ingrid Bergman) was in love with her. Matthau can play such a role in his sleep and he is not disappointed as a philanthropist, Dr. Julian Winston, who gets to know one woman, but who has no idea that he loves another. Goldie Hawn won the Oscar for his glowing performance, such as Toni Simmons, an aging flower child who slowly realizes that he is trapped in a trap and is not as dim as he appears on the surface. But the real pleasure for me in this movie was legendary Ingrid Bergman, like Stephanie Dickinson, dr. Winston's fully dedicated assistant, a performer who is ready to bury and sacrifice his happiness as long as Dr. Winston is happy with Tony. Bergman is luminous in this film, looking absolutely beautiful (although the camera has always been loved by her) and has shown an unprecedented skill for easy comedy. Yes, dialogue and settings are a bit out of date, but the story is timeless and star performances make it directly traceable.
