Teenage movie of anger, friendship, loyalty and growth? but it is not a happy outing due to circumstances and life-changing dilemmas caused by your situation. What's happening is quite numb, haunting and cold. But I was expecting something more powerful and effective, and although it was difficult and unforgettable, it wasn't much of an emotional thing. The performances are quite a mixed bag, but they all have brutal honesty. Dennis Hopper and especially Daniel Roebuck are amazing? Crispin Glover eccentrically over does it and Keanu Reeves' dead when the wood turn seems to pay off its custom slacker role. Joshua John Millar is pretty good and so is Ione Skye. Jim Metzler sounds like a short but very interesting result. The story is dramatically faced, characterized and harassed in the event of a possible failure, where it causes a sharp and painful punch. JÃ¼rgen Knieper's rotating music score is anxiety, tension and wonder, as morals and responsibilities have been tested and learned.
