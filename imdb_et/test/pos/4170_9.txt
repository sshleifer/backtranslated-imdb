My friends and I went through the time we rent movies that no one of us had ever heard of. The only good thing that came out of this film was "Take it to Limit". Just when the movie started, we can say that we are for a real classic. Music is probably done in rural areas of Colorado, but it sounds like in the early 1990s. The star of the show, actor Leo Fitzpatrick, plays so bad a guy so well, especially when it comes to doing a big movie sport. This film is based on climbing, and I'm not a climber, but even I think it's fun when the climber tries to climb and there is a guy in the background who is basically walking on a "cliff". You do not want to leave this movie, you can see the same clips again and again. You'll get surprises at every turn. You will find yourself quoting unforgettable features. I highly recommend this movie to anyone. Take this snow. Disclaimer: This movie is badly made, but it makes it great
