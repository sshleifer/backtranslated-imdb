Catherine Brreillat is a French director who loves to provoke her audience. He takes us along to acknowledge how the film takes place on the spot. The production in the film seems to be the basis for itself, because the person at the center of the story is a woman, directed by Jeanne, similar to Ms Breillat. Jeanne acts as an alter ego of a true director. <br /> <br /> Jeanne gets stuck at the beginning of filming. Not only has he chosen the wrong time to shoot this movie during a cold spell, because it includes places on the beach that are probably too cold for actors and accessories. Jeanne has problems with two main players, especially men who have problems accepting how the director has decided to show him in the film; the leading actor is not an angel. <br /> <br /> Making a movie, Mrs Breillat tells us there is nothing else in the creative artwork. First of all, there is a writing period during which Jeanne has written the screen that when it comes to production, there are problems that the writer / director did not think of. The problem is how he wants to take a picture of a love scene where the story of a young woman is the first sex contact. What appeared on the written page does not necessarily mean a simple time in front of the camera. The actor is made to wear the wrong penis and has many problems accepting the fact that the makeup must touch her in a way she never thought the other man would ever touch her. <br /> <br /> Luminous Anne Parillaud is wonderful when directed by Jeanne. He makes observations about production, actors, and the team that fit into a well-told story. Gregoire Colin and Roxane Mesquide play the leading players with the insecurity that some participants bring to the film set. Jeanne has to massage her egos to get what she wants. Ashley Waninnger plays Leo, Jeanne's assistant. <br /> <br /> "Sex is Comedy" allows Ms Breillet to give her films in general. This is a great look at how movies are made in a typical Breillat style.
