I've always liked this movie and I'm glad it's finally available on DVD so more viewers can see what I've been talking to them all years. The story is related to a high school virgin named Gary (Lawrence Monoson), who works in a lace dress as a delivery boy and hangs with her friends with David (Joe Rubbo) and Rick (Steve Antin). Gary points out Karen (Diane Franklin), who is a new girl in school, and one morning she gives her a ride and by then she's in love. That night when he saw Rick with Karen and now he's jealous of his best friend, he doesn't talk to anyone about his true feelings. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> Rick asks Gary if she can rent her grandmother's free home, but Gary apologizes for Rick not Karenit alone. But one night Rick Gary tells him he laughed at the football field and Gary was angry. A few days later, the school library Gary see Rick and Karen claiming and she asks Karen what's wrong. She tells her she's pregnant and that Rick has complained about her. Gary helps her by bringing her to her grandmother's home and paying for her abortion. Finally, Gary tells Karen how she really feels about her and she seems receptive to her feelings, but later she arrives again in Karen and Rick on her birthday. Gary is driving without a girl! This movie ends with a much more realistic version of how life really is. No matter how nice you are, the girl may not always get it. <br /> <br /> This movie was directed by Boaz Davidson, who continues to be a film director and he did two things. Movie. First, he made sure that there was a lot of free nudity free of charge to be marketed to young men who usually go to these movies. Secondly, he had finished the film with Gary without the Karen, and I think the audience may be related to being twisted, no matter how hard you win the girls' hearts. Yes, this film is silly and exploitative, but it's funny and sexy. Actor Louisa Moritz steals the movie almost as a sexual Carmel. Moritz was always a popular "B" level actress and you could remember her "Squat over the nest". Like the "Fast Times at Ridgemont High", it has a very good soundtrack and the songs being played reflect what's going on in the story. But at the heart of this film are two very good performances by Monoson and Franklin. Franklin demands nudity, but he still passes on a young girl's fucking guy who gets down in a decisive time. She has always been a good actor and her natural charm is very evident in this film. But it's still Monoson's story and you can't feel that guy. When the movie ends, its performance is with you. This is a definite act that makes it more than just a teen sex comedy. Even when the stupid scenarios of young people are trying to have sex, this film can achieve what it wants. Underfunded comedy hits Santa Claus.
