Betty is the hustle and bustle of Verdi's Macbeth production leadership. When the car mysteriously hits the lead, Betty pulls the spotlight. Opening the evening has been a success and Betty decides to keep her offspring private with her boyfriend. But when the boy leaves the room, Betty grabs an obscured figure with a black glove behind him. The unknown attacker binds the Betty to the column, grabs it and puts the needles under the eyes that cause incredible damage and pain when Betty closes them. The boy returns to the room and is stunned to see Betty in such a situation. He is even more shocked when the killer grabs him and cuts the knife through his lower jaw with such force, the knife is clearly visible in his mouth. And Betty is forced to watch it all. That's how Betty starts a terrifying testimony with a killer who is not only going to hurt her, but also forcing her to look when she distorts her friends. in many ways from the model. Less emphasis is put on the mystical elements than anything Argento Tenebre or The Bird with the crystal plum. Black gloves, a masked killer can be everywhere, but there are no clues and red herring, usually associated with good Giallo. Instead, Opera deals with an unknown killer tension and makes the audience uncomfortable. The focus is on the deadly scene, Betty's fear and the killer's obsession with Betty. When the killer grabs Betty after leaving her boyfriend's room, you're sure Betty has done it. But the sadistic killer only wants to force Betty to look when she brutally pulls her lover's neck? a knife that appears in your mouth. It is well captured and designed for the scene. And these needles in the eyes? brilliant. Or take the seamer's death. At first, his death appears to be a normal murder break. But when a dressmaker accidentally swallows a killer medallion, what started as a second death scene makes it a notch, because the killer uses scissors to cut the girl's throat. Finally, there's the most famous death scene in Opera that I'm surprised every time I see it? Mira is put into the eyes when peering through the opening. This scene has a lot of things I like about Argento. It's a flare style. This is unlikely because it can be creative, memorable and exploding. <br /> <br /> Argento was definitely not the first Italian director to focus on eye distortion, but in Opera's eye he has brought a new level of trauma. These eyes are open to the eye, the eyes and cucumbers that pull out of the eye are part of Argento's vision (red intended). And these scenes are such that I believe Argento went. The first time I saw the killer put those needles in Betty's eyes, I couldn't stop the blink. It really affected me physically. What is it about eyes that make them the target of abuse in Italian films? <br /> <br /> To be fair (and it doesn't sound like a fanboy), I've got problems with Opera that keep me from Argento. One of my problems is that the air duct system works through the Betty apartment building. Although I have no doubt that older apartment buildings that connect apartments are air duct systems, the Opera canals are huge. I am not an expert, but I sincerely doubt that there would have been such air channels in a building like the one in this movie. It doesn't seem practical. And don't you think anyone would have done something for them long ago to keep criminals and terrible neighbors out of other apartments? It's comfortable on the plot, but it's not very realistic. <br /> <br /> But I think my big problem with the film is the finals. What ends with it? It seems totally inappropriate, caught up and as a bad posture. I'm not sure what else to say if it's terrible.
