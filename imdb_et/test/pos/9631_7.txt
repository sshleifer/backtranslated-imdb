It seems that all people did not like Steven Seagal: just look at his list of candidates, but for him there are only prize winners, but I think he will not do anything about it. I saw good movies with Steven Seagal, I saw bad movies with Steven Seagal. And PATRIOT (1998) is one of his best films, which is almost as good as UNES SIEGE (1992) or HARD TO KILL (1990). PATRIOT shows its action to protect nature. Surely this film is not great and I have to say that there is more violence than I like and why Seagal's best friend, L. Q. Jones, is dead? Dr McClaren's role is one of Seagull's best performances. He has, as always, a very good charisma. In conclusion, PATRIOT is a good entertainment and the average rating is only 4 points all the time the least undervalued film. <br /> <br /> Welcome, Hans-Dieter
