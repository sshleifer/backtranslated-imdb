The questions and answers of the human spirit are all here in a masterfully documented historical documentary. The beauty and horror of one man's shift go through life, manifested as a whole. Dieter and Herzog are united and connected through a spiritual labyrinth, which has become one of the straight corridors whose walls are plastered with images created by one person who characterizes his voices with the vibration of his vocal order. This film has discovered a new dimension of storytelling in about 80 minutes. What I probably call it a new idea. Only God knows that there is nothing MIRACLE does for God to do, but decides to stay ANONYMIC? <br /> <br /> This is a requirement. If you want to experience a dreadful war fear, this documentary clears the bone marrow of your soul.
