Uzumak has an amazing reputation in the Lovecraftia districts and now I know why. <br /> <br /> Uzumaki is based on the Manga title (which is incredibly better than the movie) and follows the odd events that preceded the typhoon-isolated Japanese city. I'm not going to tell you what's going to happen in this movie because it's an absolute black film. I watched it for the first time last night and I was blown away. It has been shot in the most popular films of all time and jump-frogged pans are the best fantastic films of the labyrinth (literally and photographically) that have been released in the last decade. <br /> <br /> This movie is very lovecraftian in nature without directly connecting Cthulhu to Mythos. It's done in the same way as Lovecraft's stories; it expresses power as "nothing quite here" intensifies through momentum and fear through fine progressive change in soundtrack and cinematography. It is indeed "Weird Tale" par excellence. <br /> <br /> Just stunning.
