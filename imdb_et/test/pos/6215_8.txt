In the spirit of a great space force, but a few years ago. <br /> <br /> Hot Fudge was one of the psychedelic children's shows I grew up with. Seymour was a big, fuzzy, green doll with a crescent smile on the huge teeth that almost hit the head, and reminded him that he was wearing different Elton John-style shades. <br /> <br /> He "played" the piano, and was Jesus, who was looking for a guy in a white tux, sitting next to him. They would have a moral debate, and then we'll sing about it. <br /> <br /> Do not remember much more than opening the theme, Seymour and Hippie. <br /> <br /> Someone else knows to remember it at all. I grew up in Jersey, so when it was introduced in Detroit as a previous post, it wasn't just local. Seymour reminded me a lot about Sherlock's Squirrel Magic Garden (another psychedelic child shows if it has ever been there.) People are always talking about the effects of LSD's 70s music and movies, but it seems that children also received the dose.
