This 1934 Paramount comedy trick is the six comedy theaters connected to three men and women teams that all appear together. W. Fields and his frequent screen partner Alsion Skipworth appear in the second half of the film and appear to be a small town sheriff and inn. The areas seem to have given the latitude to bring in a lot of their own mantle pros, a surreal comedy brand, and it works great, especially if it is allowed to do its famous pool routine, it's completely welcome because it's fun. <br /> <br /> First of all, I thought it might have been inconvenient to portray a film that was worn by Charlie Ruggles and Mary Boland's fine comedy. broad, funny Vaudeville, from George Burns and Gracie Allen's great husband-comedy team, but here it works great because George and Gracie are the parts of the script. They are freelancers who take a trip to California's Ruggles and Boland Honeymoon, and are constantly finding ways to distract them every step of the way, including the great ones, while they keep the cliff alive for an expensive life. /> <br /> The comic annoyances of Burns and Allen for two sympathetic characters prove to be the ideal way to match their far-reaching, larger than life comedy characters in the real world - a comedy for people who respond to them in a credible way as gold mining as Gracie's naive delivery itself. Charlie Ruggles deserves a special reputation for his performance as a clever banker "Pinky" Whinney. She is wonderfully subtle and undervalued and draws a laugh at the lines that may not even be heard by another actor. <br /> <br /> The script is wonderfully funny everywhere, and most of it is a completely expanded comedy disappointment, where our sympathies are with poor enemies who don't just have a moment, and the extra bonus is that what drops them is just higher comedy from Burns and Allen. <br /> <br /> For some of the funniest scenes, some of the funniest scenes are quite encouraging, because Whinney is trying to go over to George just WHY he and his wife want to be alone for a while. <br /> <br /> Here are a few signs of fast-paced production - from time to time jumps, one of the most obvious parachutes you'll ever see in the movie (right there on the WC Field itself) with a short "Golf Specialist") and Field's link node changes constantly. But they don't bother me, and they shouldn't bother anyone who enjoys the movie. <br /> <br /> "Six Kinds" is a real little-known pearl and one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. If you think about it, the answer should be yes.
