The Romanian King Vladislav (Angus Scrimm) is a vampire, but a vampire of light who wants nothing more than to live in peace and harmony with humanity. But his son Radu (Anders Hove) is a cruel creature on his heart (which is quite obvious when you see him). Three female students have studied local folklore, but they find themselves pulling the vampire legends at the wrong time: Vladislav has been killed. <br /> <br /> Who can say anything about a movie with Angus's scream at Scrimm? I can not. I thought I had some low expectations after seeing other full moon pictures (especially "Puppet Master" and "Demonic Toys"). But despite the very bad animated effect of the demons, this movie was really very well done and very fun to watch. A lot of blood, good plot and backstory (Bloodstone's story was surprisingly refreshing) and even some new corners for vampire sellers that you think would be dead now. (Maybe I am wrong, but this is probably the first film with beads of roses shot in the gun.) In addition to vampires and blood, you get some nudity (free, but welcome) and I had noticed a great score by the composers (not sure who worthy of credit, but Stuart Brotman, Richard Kosinski, William Levine, Michael Portis and John Zeretzka are involved. It's Horror 101 all the time. Heck, you get even two sequences that are a sign of a real horror film. (Of course, some bad movies also get the aftermath - did I mention "Puppet Teacher"?) The Romanian theme was well done and the film seems to have been made by the Romanians, if I think their name comes from the right way. And the score - the music - set me a real pace of change, a great mood. I like Richard Band, but I'm glad the other composer was hit because he hit the head in the atmosphere. If you like vampire movies and want a small variation (one of the Eastern European varieties), it's worth it.
