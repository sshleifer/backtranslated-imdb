Great movie, very worth 7/10. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks was his usual best heavy heavy drinking congress that saved Afghanistan from its communist oppressors! Based on the real story, we tell us how money and weapons in the West are throwing into the problem and expecting it to go away. Well, it went, though temporarily. See who we (among others the British) are now fighting against the same people who were given arms, training and money by the US in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> This film always created political thoughts. people who look at it but have a very nice story. But once the main goal is achieved, ie the release of communists from Afghanistan, one can see how quickly people are forgotten. <br /> <br /> This movie was good, it was well earned 7/10. He spoke in detail of the Communist invasion of Afghanistan and later the US hidden operation, and was well dramatized. While I'm a good movie, I recommend it to people, but some people don't really enjoy it, it's a serious movie of good (USA) or bad (Russia) isn't your thing!
