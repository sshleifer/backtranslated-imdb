There I was on vacation when my host suggested taking the Breda B-film festival. I was the opposite because I was not sitting in the cinema, but I have to admit that I do not regret it (especially with the contribution of Stephen Malkmus). Probably it helped me understand what to expect. <br /> <br /> SEA OF DUST starts as a typical costume track. We have a young medical student who helps a doctor whose city is destroyed by a mad plague (which somehow includes an explosive head). On his way, he stops on his groom's visit and his father gives it away. As she travels on, she finds her daughter, who is on the road, another victim, and leads her to the doctor. Yawn, I thought. It all seemed quite predictable. <br /> <br /> Then everything went crazy and suddenly became a completely different film. Tom Savini looks like Dracula, the characters start to travel to the other side of reality, and the dialogue becomes more humorous. again, becoming truly dark and strange. I'm not breaking it for the first time, but there is an amazing sequence of hollow people, a lot of conversation about the abuse of religion in society, and some extraordinary effects. And did I mention Stephen Malmuss? It's not a perfect movie (if you didn't have it at the B-Film Festival), it's time for adventurous viewers. Large images, cool sound, lots of interesting ideas. Action is sometimes somewhat hungry, but I think it's a point. You think one out ...
