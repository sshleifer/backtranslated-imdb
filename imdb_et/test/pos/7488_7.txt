Thursday is a wonderfully cynical, sarcastic and intense film that mocks and imitates the style of Pulp Fiction and stylized gangster films. An amazingly eclectic combination of seemingly and oddly entertaining situations, this revenge who is trying to go straight, proves that it is a worthy addition to the series of films trying to emulate the dark humorous masterpiece Pulp Fiction of the Tarantino gene. <br /> <br /> Nick (Aaron Eckhardt) stops by old house by Casey (Thomas Jane). Casey was a former dealer who has since been reformed, become an architect, married to a successful business woman (Paula Marshall) and is now considering accepting a child. Nick, who still has links with the gangsters' underworld, leaves Casey at the house full of drugs when he borrows his car to make a move? a.k.a unfinished business. Colds and angry drug introduction into their home, Casey rinses them all under the kitchenware. This is when one at a time, Nick's double-crossed runners, rastafaric drug addicts and crooked policemen, all come to the unsuspecting Casey, who will soon be an incredible Thursday. <br /> <br /> The movie opens with a fun sequence at a petrol station where Nick is looking for the best deal for coffee. After pondering the size of the cup, the fiasco will break with the cashier when he needs a free snack cake and costs $ 50. As a result, the comic bright bloodshed is worse than the situation when the policeman intervenes and is caught in the most unusual situations. This opening segment creates an excellent mood for the rest of the film that never takes itself too seriously and contains outrageous signs that seem conscious of its existence in this meaningless gangster flick. <br /> <br /> Film is divided into segments based on different events and times in one day. This effect is similar to Pulp Fiction, which is similar to the chapters, although there is no chronological order on Thursday, except for a random setback. Like Tarantino, music is a great introduction to every scene and every character. Strange humorous creatures, such as a guy in Jamaica for delivering a pizza to a man who shakes the phone and shares his hashish, and Paulina Porizkova's narcissistic Dallas, trying to rape Casey, adds humor to every event, no matter how terrible and convincing coincidences. When introducing the cooling of Mickey Rourke's peaceful backbone, a careful stopover and sophisticated setup are fully assembled and Casey's sticky situation becomes even more bold and praiseworthy. <br /> <br /> Certainly this is a wannabe Pulp Fiction with a lot of violence, clever dialogue and extremely horrible antagonists, some things are right on Thursday, but other attempts to honor can only go far enough to suggest robbery. A modest order showing that Casey is taking baddies and a sports haircut that exactly matches John Travolta's Pulp Fiction is just one step too far. <br /> <br /> - Mike Massie, www.MoviePulse.net
