Shame on you if you give this movie a low rating. How do you not like the film with Doug McClure, Peter Cushing, foolish rubber monsters, fighting (and for the boys, the woman who was a female female fraudster who loved me and one of the eighties of Sinbad, not wearing much of what my mother said : "He didn't choose his eye color"), the stage, the silly wigs and the Victorian drill machine from the brush are similar to the old Thunderbird series? Who watched and crawled this movie looked at it for the wrong reasons. It may be a mess, but it is definitely good. They don't, as they used to be, sigh ......
