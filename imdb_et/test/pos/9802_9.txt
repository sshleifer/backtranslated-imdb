My end ends. Bobby died in his father's hand. Mike had tried to get Bobby out. Only a child could think it would be possible to build a machine that could fly. Bobby died .... Mike when the child survived, creating an alternative that ended his mind ... how Bobby left .... Mike made an airplane flying out of Bobby. Sexually and violently abused children create a whole world to survive. <br /> <br /> It was also good to see my old residential area. We called it San Jose Boulevard and I lived around where these houses were filmed. It was so strange to see that they were filming inside the houses ... not the studios ... It was my kitchen, bedroom and living room. And those hills ... we use them like these children ...., let's look at our little valley ... we see a cool look. There was a real nostalgia trip for me.
