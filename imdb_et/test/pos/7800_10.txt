This is my favorite Indian film. It's a comic genius. Salman Khan is fun. But Amir Khan steals the exhibition with spiritual dialogue. Karisma Kapoor's equipment tells a story - makes you wonder whether the stylist has deliberately wore clothing to make the movie more fun (at one point he looks like wearing a diaper). Andaz Apna Apna is the only comedy genre movie that makes me laugh from start to finish. There is no dull moment, every scene is fun, even songs and dances move to laugh at the seams. I especially loved the scene where Amar (Amir Khan) "remembers". I've seen this movie so many times that I've lost hope. And I'm so glad to say that this time Bollywood can embrace this fantastic movie as much as I know A.A.A this is not a copy of the Hollywood movie (TÃ„NU JUMUM). In general, I recommend this movie to anyone who understands Hindi / Urdu and love good comedy. <br /> <br /> Look at what you love it !!!!!
