"Terry & June", the most unfriendly program of all time, was also one of the most popular campaigns of the 70s and 80s. <br /> <br /> It started with a "happy life", but when Eric Merriman decided he didn't want to write anymore, it changed into it, so "Aunt Lucy" and Fletcher became Medford. Yes, it was cozy, homey, middle-class stuff; The plots went to the dinner of the bunch of clich√©s coming from the boss, a prison that organized a little sales, and unwanted relatives who came to a stop over the weekend. It was certainly not a "terrible lazy comedy". As for the fact that it is not "wise," it should not have been. It was funny and well done and it was enough! <br /> <br /> I also liked the "alternative" boom ("Spitting Image", "Black Adder", "The Young Ones", etc.) of the 80s, but I also enjoyed the usual things like this. If anything else, he gave an alternative comedy that would be an alternative. I found it sad when Ben Elton liked it and Benny Hill. Well, family-oriented comedy has all disappeared from our screens, but where has it left us? See the latest T.V. timetables. All soaps and reality tend to. Few left-handed comedies are aimed at teenagers, which means they are stunned, fun with physical function, and explicit sexual references. And they're not funny at all. <br /> <br /> The "Alternative Comedy" boom was good in many ways, but it had a dark side. It made ordinary sitcoms old, drove out talented writers and performers like Spike Milligan, and eventually led to being "little British" and "Tittybangbang" (heaven helps us). If it's not broken, don't fix it!
