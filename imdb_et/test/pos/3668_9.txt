CONDITIONAL LOVE is surprisingly fun. Although the plot goes in too many directions, making the film for a long time, it never fails to fascinate and admire itself. Several graphic lines that warmly resemble SHIRLEY VALENTINE offer plenty of smiles, laughs, wisdom and tenderness. It shouldn't work, and sometimes it collides, but forgives its contradictions, sit back and have a good time. It's charming!
