I saw this movie in the early 70s and I liked Judy Geeson. For me, it hit Rod Steiger's secret character, which he could not play with Geeson, young and extremely sexy. <br /> <br /> You could not get a little excuse for your husband, which Claire played great. Bloom. I was really disappointed to see that the original cut could have disappeared and the DVD has little chance of publishing it. <br /> <br /> I do not believe anyone who saw the film, and it is a strong message not to be equally three main character events, and I would have liked to see it again if nothing else for purely nostalgic reasons. <br /> <br /> Go back in time, about 35 years. A real classic.
