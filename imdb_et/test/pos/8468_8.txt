It's a pretty interesting attempt to look. This is the first, still existing attempt to combine vision and sound. It has two guys dancing with a violin player (perhaps William KL Dickson himself) standing next to Edison's recording cylinder, which captures sound. <br /> <br /> Sound and pictures were not linked to one another. And until recently, sound and picture were added technically together. This is probably why people without hesitation call this movie first. <br /> <br /> The film is made by William K.L. Dickson, Thomas Edison's assistant, who told him to come up with a way to combine pictures and sound. The answer he gave was Kinetophone, Kinetoscope (a large, large box with a spike so that people could see moving images) with a cylinder phonograph inside it. This is the first thing we know about live movie experiments that have this technique. All the later films that used this same technique were shot later and separately when recording quiet movies and sound effects. Thus, Kinephone had not attempted to sync sound and images, but rather an attempt to capture images with sound. In some cases, people could even choose from three sound cylinders with 3 different orchestral pieces. Only 45 kinetophones were ever made, so you couldn't get a cinephone to succeed. Even after this experiment, other cinema techniques were mainly focused on film projectors. made with sound and commercially released. They could not yet technically synchronize and put together the sound and pictures, but even if they could and would have been available it would have been a very costly job. It is not really the most influential or historically important cinematic film, but it is very interesting to see how people tried to constantly improve the quality and techniques of making early cinema and film. <br /> <br /> 8/10
