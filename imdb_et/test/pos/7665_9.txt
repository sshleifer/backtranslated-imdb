I've never read a good overview of "Vanity Fair" and I don't understand why. For something that was "rushed through ten days", it all comes off surprisingly well. Although "Becky Sharp" is a better film and Miriam Hopkins is better at Becky, there is nothing to stop one of the faces 9/10. Sometimes Myrna Loy may seem too cute and nice to play the perfect mother, but at other times she just has to shut her eyes and the air temperature drops a dozen degrees. Meow! The transition to a more modern situation did not work against "Vanity Fair" and the only thing that really causes conflict is casting. Barbara Kent (Amelia) was less than 5 feet in length and the few leading men were very high - it all came together to make Loy look like an absolute Amazon woman! <br /> <br /> "Vanity Fair" is similar to "Craig's husband", that no matter how bad the main character is, you have to love him. And you know he deserves his coming and then some, but you still feel he's getting it. Although this version was based on the same story as "Becky Sharp", this version had a different ending, which is interesting to see, as most of the other films were almost identical. For the value of entertainment, the end of "Becky Sharp" is ultimately more enjoyable, though aesthetically pleasing, and there is no doubt in the story of the story that the "Vanity Fair" is better, whether you like it or not.
