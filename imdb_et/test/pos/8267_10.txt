When precious Bane flew in America, this beautiful story was surprised. All the actors were great; Clive Owen really realized what she was playing. I immediately went to the bookstore and ordered a novel of the original that is even more beautiful and which after printing the book went out to print - although I've seen it a few times online. I also had hoped that Janet McTeer won the Oscar and BBC big Clive Owen's popularity of course on DVD ... I can't believe that all those years later we don't have a DVD. It must be the only sale that the BBC has ever created and which is NOT sold. Come to the BBC - you have the money to make the fans here. Get it from DVD!
