The problem with today's TV is that people are spoiled by watching "lite" TV. This type of TV show is equivalent to elevator music or "light listening" jazz. A typical viewer's idea of ​​"continuity" is to keep in mind who voted last week on the islands and who thinks who is next. Show them a program like Surface, Firefly, Dr. Who or something with an arc of more than three episodes of plot, and ... well, they just want to return to Survivor. <br /> <br /> 95% of sheep watching television do not want to rack their brains. They don't want to think of excuses. They want to make sure that the "boob tube" lives under its name ... and they don't want to show you to try and go to any other route. Because of this, the ax has got a surface and many other high quality exhibitions that should have lasted longer. <br /> <br /> Television viewers do not want stories or morals or philosophy or anything more than a third of the vocabulary level in the classroom. They want people who eat a series of earthworms or excessive dramatic "real life" (there is no such thing! You can't follow anything without changing what you follow) or hormonal exhibitions that involve groups of people who have a sacred and then donated it to your own Today's television is nothing but greed, and some diamonds that you can take out of dust are just thrown out because no one even knows what the diamond is. The surface was one of those diamonds.
