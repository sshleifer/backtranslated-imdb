I've never thought I'd say about it in the bio-region, but there's almost a general characterization (especially with Kenji Miyazawa's emotions) and too few real events in my life - in the end I'm not sure if he will die (he should) or when his sister finally ends up dies (she should be) or the director spent a little too much time on the galactic railway (this is an internal joke if you forgot it - Miyazawa wrote a children's book on the galactic railway per night). But this glimpse of the writer's mind, which "imagines the imagination of poetry and fairy tales", is very intelligent, creative, entertaining and emotionally powerful. <br /> <br /> All this despite the fact that everything is animated like animals (as in many northwest of Miyazawa). <br /> <br /> Some visual images are really amazing, especially since it's made for a TV movie. Seriously, some of them (like the order of birds in the blue light) compete in parts of Fantasia. However, I still can't stand the computer animation when it is mixed with Cel animation. CGI trains are terribly obvious - even more so than Anastasia train. <br /> <br /> 8/10
