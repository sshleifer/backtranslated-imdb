The film here and now discusses the horror of "rendition" with the overall general account of all participants. No one can easily get out because we see the blindness of the players because they are punishing their "enemies" and themselves for their hatred of the global game of anger and misery. <br /> <br /> The sympathetic senator aid (scintillating style played by Peter Sarsgaard) and actual Washington power gamers is electrifying. At the same time, a new CIA person (Jake Gyllenhaal) undergoes sea change in his attitude to the new cosmic torture found in the US. Suddenly, although his rejection of what he initially condemned, he must ask why someone on earth would call him a civilized stand and look at someone in such a humiliated and abusive manner? The film has a few heroes - perhaps Gyllenhala's erroneous and liberating CIA person is an exception and a necessary spirit for the film to offer hope. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie is not a fiction at all, but a wake-up call to those who have misery in them. The terrible truth is that we in the United Kingdom and the US have lost a moral plot and this film shows how low we are ready to go. All this for freedom! The script is an excellent line that says that torture is a sure way to expand the number of our enemies. This is already happening in real life, and we should listen to the message that this film offers and will use its ability and money much more intelligently! The message seems to be that every one of us who claims that we need to surrender, torture and abuse basic human rights is as wrong and foolish as jihadists and suicide attacks. All praise for the sensitivity of talented South African directors in view of power inequalities and key players from the US and beyond. Oh, and by the way, the film has a tail and a way of thinking at the end of its tail that provokes surprise (which I don't give away). <br /> <br /> I saw a preview of the movie in London so it is not yet widely written, but I'm happy to say that less than glowing reviews seem to be turning. The BBC review has been very strongly supported and they (and I) suspect that a large part of the negative comments come from those who see the world through simple Hollywood attributes - where good guys and bad guys are cardboard clippings. So the reason why many really great movies are more and / or non-US pixels.
