I live in the croc territory and remember the events that inspired this movie. Our courage falls every time we hear a croc attack. BLACK WATER is just the best croc film I've ever seen. Although I loved ROGUE last year for all its effects and splashy scenes, local scenes were hit by our audience. We laughed at ROGUE more than anything. But BLACK WATER really resonated the idol and the fear that you might experience when you are alone in mangroves (you call them sex or bayous, but they are mangroved). Every tourist should watch this movie before reaching the northern area. The end result was a bit behind the end of the movie, but I'll add it to my DVD collection if it's available.
