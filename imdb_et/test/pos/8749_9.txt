Compared to the renowned Hollywood remake, this film is less sharp, but much stronger to give a general overview of the drug problem. Transformation loses the most interesting thing from the three plots of thread, the farmer whose poor coping depends on drugs as a paying money culture, and whose increased involvement in drug trafficking to better destroy himself, destroys himself and his family. In addition, the story of the daughter's addiction goes not only to the problems of recall but also to the likelihood of relapse. This initial minisation system takes advantage of the extra time to deal with things more thoroughly and this controversial topic is stronger meat.
