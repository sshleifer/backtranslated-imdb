I thought it was great! It was nice to see how the performer follows each of them. Dwight Schultz still looked the same, he hardly changed his appearance, nor did he have Dirk Benedict, he still saw the same terrible! I thought Mr. T seemed thinner, but it was still great to see how he looked after all this time. I thought it was a trace to some other members like Decker and Amy playing with the lady. It was just a shame that Mr T could not make a real reunion. Also, it was a great shame that George Peppard was dead, leaving the gaps so to speak. Now I just want to have kept it. We hope they will repeat it.
