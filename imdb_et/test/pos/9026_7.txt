This film does not win prizes. But if you have one and a half hours of free and imaginative little white entertainment, then you could do a lot worse than watching it ... <br /> <br /> Mostly young and beautiful, the script has some really funny moments and the sound is pretty cool . Rupert Penry-Jones, like Jake, seems to be the most fun, while Laura Fraser like Justine is sweet, pleasant and funny. <br /> <br /> I rented it because I like the "Spooks" series currently played by RPJ And here she is young and buff and perfect eye candy for girls' evening. <br /> <br /> Take wine and some ice cream and eat.
