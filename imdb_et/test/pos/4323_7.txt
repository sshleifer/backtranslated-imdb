Woaww Is it just now if you notice any links between all the characters? Of course this is Libby! And for the boy hatched with Desmond, was all deja vu ??? Yes! He was the "same" man who gave Sayid money after he died or tormented in the 14th episode of the second season: one of them. In fact, it's not exactly the same man, he's named Joe's 14th episode and Kelvin's last 2 episodes. Gemini? :) Who knows ?? JJ Abrams ... mmmm I'm not even sure about it :) There are such links between all the characters as <br /> <br /> But it was just a response to Libby's comment. <Br /> <br /> I found these 2 episodes more interesting than the whole season 2. Throughout this season I felt there were a lot of things I've lost and very few things I've learned. First of all, the first episode of season II is great, and then the second is the first one that is the first one ... I found that disappointment is even when I'm pretty sure everyone lost the tendency to have meaning. It was just an example of how I was disappointed when watching these episodes. <br /> <br /> Go back to the last 2 episodes. I think we have learned more new things in these 2 episodes than the whole season. But all we learn is small pieces for the next puzzle, such as engaging with Desmond's "relatives" (sorry if I spoiled too much, believe me or not, like trying not). So many things that have emerged in the last two seasons are still unclear or have ever been developed. And yet, there's a new material like all the holes in the picture wouldn't be enough. Of course, we all want to see this big picture, but I think we have to be very patient. Hope only 3 seasons. I'm not sure I'll watch more than 3 seasons. There were many activities in the last episode. And the end of a good entertainer. <br /> <br /> So basically, I loved this last episode ... and yes, I want to see the third season.
