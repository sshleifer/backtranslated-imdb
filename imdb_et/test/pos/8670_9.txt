I saw this movie yesterday and can't think of it. I moved to Norway four months ago and since then I've tried the origin of strange emptiness. When I saw this movie, I was in a bright picture of that society. Yes, it's all true !!! I also found a great job with a big salary, and I live with my Norwegian boy in a nice apartment. But so far, all I met with me has left me with this tasteless and empty feeling I never had before - that's the movie. A dinner party that has nothing to say to each other, but emotional comments, long resins, stress, horrible calm and frozen smile. This Scandinavian nightmare is perfect for Den Brysomme manne. Watch this movie !!!
