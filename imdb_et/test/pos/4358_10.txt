This movie is one of the most amazing examples of the delightful and artistic film I've seen. Herzog seems to strike Dieter's story almost as a transcendental tragedy and beauty, as well as his loving personal character. At the end of the movie, I wanted to have the opportunity to meet Dieter before he passed. The narrative is woven, with an conscious theme and its ability to revive and restore traumatic events. Few document managers have such a strong ability to invest so much in the audience. This movie is black it !!!
