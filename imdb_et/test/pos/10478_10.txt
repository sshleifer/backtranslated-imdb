If ever the best movie ever made, "Babette's Party" is definitely the most loving. It is a wonderful study of the meaning of artistry, generosity, loyalty and grace. Humor is mixed with delicate longing; Characters are treated with honesty, but also with deep respect. Here are meditation memories, fate, old age and faithfulness. Henning Kristiansen's marvelous camera work: rarely, the wrinkled faces are so bright in candle light. The meal is accompanied by a delicious period, music, Brahms, Mozart and simple folk songs. Enjoy this celebration for the eyes and spirit, because, as General says, "Armus and truth have come together and justice and bliss can kiss each other."
