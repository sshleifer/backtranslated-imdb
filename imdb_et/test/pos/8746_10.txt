It is a wonderfully sparse drama describing the various aspects of international heroin trafficking - the mountains of North Pakistan, where the cultivation of opium poppy seed is by default widely practiced; In Germany and England, who organize the import of processed heroin into several kilos of smuggling; addicted end-users and the crime they need to support their growing habit; and finally, all levels of corruption and hypocrisy at the international level that surround the police's efforts to control the "drug problem" --- this drama is outlined by many in-depth and rounded characters, a fully developed plot, and excellent action and location photography. <br /> <br /> It's putting Hollywood epics like "French Connection" in place! <br /> <br /> Traffi is a deeply thought-provoking and stopping story of modern drug-related espionage and many people's international efforts to eliminate it. Unlike many drug-turning "criminal dramas", Traffik strongly focuses on the social causes that people become addicted to drugs. As one character puts it "... until we as a society build a world that people want to participate in, instead of wanting to escape, we can't stop people from taking drugs ..." "<br /> <br /> It's exciting and totally fascinating drama.
