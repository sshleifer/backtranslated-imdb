eXistenZ is a study of reality and virtual reality, where characters run from the world, from landscape to landscape, trying to capture a game they don't know, or exactly where it steers. Within this virtual reality game, there are more virtual reality games that question what reality they are coming from "real". a sensible answer to real reality, rather than thinking about whether it is a real or video game, even until the end. I'm not even sure that Cronenberg pretends not to be twisted, it's so incredibly obvious that it's confusing. <br /> <br /> The problem with this movie is its basic animal, in some ways. Cronenberg doubts in reality and criticizes the game. But the same things he uses to criticize the game play brings him joy: violence, uninterrupted, lack of focus, and in some ways, pixelation, even when there is no such pixel in the film. I've never heard anyone claim that Cronenberg's violence is actually a critique of hypervolence in the media, but it hides the fact that it gets such an incredible joy to tap new openings in humans, animals, and amorphous piles of biological sediment. /> <br /> What is perfectly written and done about this movie is the use of video games (it is impossible to say exactly what you want to say during the scene, the lack of surroundings or surroundings, which is not worth just a few people who feel that there should be many and vice versa, all of these things) with the motive of penetration. It definitely deconstructs the reality of video games in a way that it is nausea and absurd, but it makes it even better by replacing the biological material of video game electronics literally, which is harsh and shifts and, frankly, reluctant to the most terrible degree. What it is worth, this film creates a sinus reaction. <br /> <br /> But what? It criticizes virtual reality, but it is a film: it is your virtual reality. It seems to criticize the banality of designing the lines and character of video games, but argues that this banalism is. I'm sure I'm worried if killing the nature of video games is more okay than killing a real person, and how to confuse video games with reality and make people not think about the consequences of their actions in real life, and yet again, it is a joy for ripping people, objects, wild animals, things and organisms bloody cutting. <br /> <br /> So while this is the main focus of attention, it doesn't really do anything, not real. Only what he does is so original that it cannot really be denied from the moment of his glory. <br /> <br /> In some ways, it would be much easier to hate this movie because you were expensive and violent, because there is no good reason why I love it and I can't keep it mediocre or bad. It would be easier to just not take it, but since I can, I can't do anything about it. I believe this is a bit excessive, it doesn't really have to go so far, but Cronenberg's intentions are so confused and confusing that I don't know if it was Cronenberg's mistake or Cronenberg's point and I don't think it's really possible think of it, except maybe ask him directly. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
