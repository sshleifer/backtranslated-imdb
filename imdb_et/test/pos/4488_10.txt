There seem to be two kinds of people in the world: those who think "five characters" is one of the best episodes and those who are so cool that they know they are sucking because they were so smart and already predicted "flat" at the end of the twist (which is probably the only reason in their small thoughts why Twilight Zone exists: turn). <br /> <br /> There are a lot of flat episodes in the series and I don't rate all ten episodes of TZ. But this is certainly one of those that deserve such a rating. It's claustrophobic and colorful. The relationship is built up and we can't wait to reveal the mystery at the end. But what that secret is, what these people are, is not really important. Most of the episode's beauty is accomplishing it. It would be just as strong if we never know what these strange places are.
