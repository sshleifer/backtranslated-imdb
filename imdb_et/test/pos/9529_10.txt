I looked at this film countless times and never blessed it with home simplicity, sincerity, and goodness. All of the cast and beautiful little steam trains that play such an important supporting role are of a character character. I testify that I fell in love with Robert in 1970 and he still touches me today. Show on New Zealand on Christmas Day, the most beautiful gift I would have had.
