It is the French representative for O.S.S. 117 (French response to James Bond). The series was launched in the early 1950s and gave birth to at least eight films (none of which were ever published in the US). "O.S.S.117: Cairo, Spy's Nest" is a windless little comedy that shouldn't ... repeat NO, take it too seriously. Our protagonist finds himself in the middle of a spy attack in Egypt (with Morroco in Egypt) to find out about a long lost friend. The following is the standard James Bond / Inspector Cloussou. Although our man is something open to xenophobia, sexist, homophobic, it is treated as a pure farce (as I said, do not take it too seriously). Although there are some tough languages ​​and comic book violence, it is basically okay for older children (12 years and older). As previously mentioned in the subject line, just sit back, go to the popcorn and just have fun.
