Cam Archer's Lyric Bobbycrush boldly captures the insecure kaleidoscope, which is the desire of adolescents with lush rendering (beautifully captured by Aaron Platt), which is more than a narrative. Bobbycrush recalls somewhere between a documentary and a dream that reminds Todd Haynes and Gus van Santi of living hyperrealism early on. What is sharp, glamor and heartbreak, is like the Sonic Youth film form that plays the bubble strength.
