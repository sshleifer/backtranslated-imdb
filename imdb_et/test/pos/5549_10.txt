This movie looked very good in life. I liked the end, which seemed naturally unresolved without great moments, but many small moments came together. You could say that this is an honest love story. No matter what the "sexual orientation" of the main characters is, it is still a story of love and understanding. <br /> <br /> There were many scenes in the family. The device is at a time when some people have a very stressful time. Namely "holidays". Christmas is accurate. <br /> <br /> Like most good movies, it also addresses the issues of overcoming love, fit, expectation, and impossibility. Finally, Alexandra and Casey make a choice, knowing that love is difficult and giving. Well done.
