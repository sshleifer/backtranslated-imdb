Thanks to the help of an IMDb colleague, I managed to watch this movie for almost twenty years and I can honestly say that it hasn't lost any of its strokes. I can't believe Channel 4 is letting it disappear without trace, because it is a very powerful, moving and moral key to the consequences of incorrectly placed loyalty. <br /> <br /> For ten years, it focuses on the clicks of friends and their relationship with two out of school "bystanders"; exactly how they use one and ruthlessly torture you. Both past and present events will gradually detect tensions that are thicker, not similar to Shane Meadows' excellent revenge-cooler Dead Man's Shoes. Actors, Writing and Direction are very brave in 1983 and still offer the middle of the day, despite the average stars. Yes, it can be set in a public school, but it is a world except for something that Merchant Ivory put out; I got public education and still have countless meanings from this list. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you remember for a long time when you see it - unless you probably don't, because Channel 4 (or FilmFour) has chosen to bury it. On their official website, they describe it as "an inexplicably ignored gem from the first 4 days of Channel 4" - who ignores it? It was one of the first Channel 4 movies (which later became FilmFour thanks to a successful film like Trainspotting), so somewhere somebody still has to print. These days, when you get DVDs with extended collections, which have more or less anything, it is a little pointless that they can't advertise the good of the movie that it deserves. <br /> <br /> So when one of the Channel 4 production flunkies reads it, stop playing programs that show people a humiliating hope to secure a tabloid deal, chase this movie and solve a nice special anniversary edition disc or something, please!
