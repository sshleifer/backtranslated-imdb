Why do I give 7 points to this 1974 porn movie? Because I watched it. And I found it fun! Aliens, their strange spacecraft, their strange helmets ... my God, it was vision. And all that these desperate strangers need is sperm on earth. <br /> <br /> And where are they looking for? In the upper part of Bavaria, Germany. And there's a lot of fun here: in Europe (and even more so in German speaking countries), Bavaria is considered a traditional and modest region. And then the actors are so helpless about foreign women. Well, there have been films about people not being able to deal with women like the "American Pie" series. <br /> <br /> But what this movie has achieved is real, funny. You are constantly wondering how they came with their crackpot ideas. But it was in 1974, and 35 years ago, one nostalgia fills up. You have never seen such a movie. <br /> <br /> And if you don't think you see casual hairs and breasts in your pubs, look at it once. It's a comedy, not a porn movie.
