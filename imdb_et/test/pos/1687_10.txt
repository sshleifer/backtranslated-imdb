Incredible performance! This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I know that a lot is said, but I bet you will not regret this movie. <br /> <br /> It's great from start to finish. Judith Light's (especially mother's) play is so convincing that there are not many other movies I saw that could compare to it, and there seems to be no feeling for people in this drama. br /> <br /> Every year there are many and many movies, but if you only have to choose one to see in your life, do one of them.
