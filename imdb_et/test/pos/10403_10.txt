I, one, loved this movie absolutely. <br /> <br /> This is not a "typical Asian horror" where you can see a terrifying spirit (usually a woman) going around scary people. Most movies don't barely bother, but the way this film interests the plot and the characters is the genius. It's not a movie for you if you're a gore (like Saw, Hostel) or a "surprising intimidation" where things appear to you (Hollywood horror, movies), but this movie has a "horrible" factor all the time. the whole movie I loved. Noroi is a progressive and somewhat experimental approach to the fear of ridiculous transformations and the unique mess released by Hollywood in today's society. <br /> <br /> Please do not let the documentary film take you out (why?). It's much better than Blair's witchcraft project, because in one case Noroi's actor is great and it really makes you feel like you look at something you shouldn't see. <br /> <br /> Noroi is definitely one of the best horror films I've ever seen. Only a few movies have done this with my fifth horror; and this movie has a # 1 place on my list.
