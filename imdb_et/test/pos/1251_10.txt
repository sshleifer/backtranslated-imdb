It is so nice to see that Bruce Willis is dropping out of his activity and seeing that he is really a talented actor. In this film, she looks like an almost 40-year-old picture consultant who has lost her inner child completely - until she meets her face to face. It's one of those rare movies that doesn't talk to your audience and really does something for the WHOLE family. It is about caring for one another, keeping a part of the child inside you and understanding that you are not growing exactly as you thought. It seems that Willis is building an impressive experience for working with children (just witnessing "The Sixth Sense" with Haley Joel Osment) and he has great chemistry with Spencer Breslin here. It's great photography and music, and the end is wonderful and exhilarating. A great movie we see with every family member.
