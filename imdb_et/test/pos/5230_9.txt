The best cinematography I've ever seen? In the year when the film was made, I was completely amazed and impressed with the attention and authenticity of the scenes. Although I am not particularly a western film buff, every scene is given the ultimate detail and it is haunting. There is a sincere connection with nature. Sometimes I am surprised by the scenes, but I'm never bored. I feel like I was really peering into the time machine and looking back into the old west. I recommend this movie to anyone who learns about design, location planning and photography in general. It can be a modest film to experience the visuals, given the era of digital touch we are experiencing.
