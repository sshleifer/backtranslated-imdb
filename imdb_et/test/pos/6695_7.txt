I got it as a complete set of 9 episodes on 5 DVDs. I didn't know anything about the history of the series. Season 2 lists 5 episodes, the last of which is Beyond Good and Evil with the original Air Date on December 7, 1998. Other 4 episodes in Season 2 were sent since 1997 From December 2008 to Febrausry 1998. So Beyond Good and Evil are like season 3 episode 1 unless there are no episodes in season 3. <br /> <br /> Spoilers here. Two of the first 8 episodes, dr. Iain McCallum (John Hannah) and Dr Angela Moloney (Zara Turner) lack two main characters, replacing Dr. Dan Gallagher (Nathaniel Parker) and Dr. Charley Fielding (Eva Pope). I recognized Nathaniel Parker from The Inspector Lynley Mysteries, which began in 2001. So they planned for the 3rd season, but only one episode was sent. <br /> <br /> It seems strange to try to continue the series called the headline McCallum, when the main character has disappeared from the series. So they could plan to return to Dr. Iain McCallum, but if it failed, the series was canceled. I do not have inside information on this, but I see that both John Hannah and Nathaniel Parker participated in other projects in 1999. Does anyone have any information on this?
