I agree with Vince, this film paved the way for Goodfellas. The scene where Pesci threw peanut to the piano player reminded me of "How am I funny?" routine Goodfellas. This is a very underrated movie and deserves attention. As with many other mobile movies, the subject of death is spoken by: always Don.
