It's really a fun movie and that's what I've seen many times. Drew Barrymore is great as Josie Geller, as is David Arquette as his brother. You have the embarrassing idea that she will return to high school because the film is a reminder of what the high school really liked! His equipment is weird and weird, and it brings back memories of those who are a little different in their clothes! Gorgeous Michael Vartan was a divine teacher as a teacher (I wish I was such a teacher in high school!) And Josie's boss is fantastic. This is a movie that you can watch over and over again, with a great soundtrack! One for all students of the 90's!
