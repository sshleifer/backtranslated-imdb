Nobody said it under the "Great Trail" and I thought it would be natural. Nevertheless, it was one of the best western seers and I am a big fan of horses and weapons films. The size and feel of this picture is just amazing and, as someone mentioned in his commentary, he has "Napoleon" (1927) triple triple camera. Nowadays, the cost of production and especially the thousands of samples would be superfluous, but Raoul Walsh could do it. <br /> <br /> Cast was great, though John Wayne was better than had no traits and just went around. Specifically, Tyrone Power, Sr. was a perfect villain - I had never seen him before and it was his only talkable picture. Ian Keith was a snake, but El Brend has a comic relief. He may be funny or annoying, but usually the latter - and he will appear in the most inappropriate times. <br /> <br /> It is a bit too long and the appearance of the Indians took time, but it is as close to the documentary Manifest Destiny and life as it proves and considers film fans regardless of genre preferences. By the time the settlers arrived in California, I was exhausted.
