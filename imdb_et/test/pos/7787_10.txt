Andaz Apna Apna is my favorite music movie. Both Aamir and Salman khan have been doing great while the Amir actor was much better than Salman.Aamir Khan is known as MR. PERFECTIONIST 'is in Bollywood and he proves it in all his films. <br /> <br /> The story moves around two young men, Amari (Aamir Khan) and Premi (Salman Khan), from both poor families and is a great dreamer. They want to get rich without wearing pain.so when they hear Raveena Bajaj (Raveena Tandoni) daughter Mrs. Bajaj (Paresh Rawal), who comes to India to find her groom, they both fool their parents to marry Raveena Bajaj and the journey begins. The film also has a twist that makes the movie even more fun. Paresh Rawal has a double role (Teja and Mr. Bajaj) and has worked perfectly as she always does. The Shakti hood (crime leader Gogo) also adds great comedy. <br /> <br /> This movie is a comedy from the first minute to the last rib and is one of Bollywood's classic comedy films.
