This animated short has been redesigned to one of Tex Avery's earlier short pants by Fred Quimby in M-G-M (Dog Gone Tired). The runaway convict (here just known as Joe) who just broke out of "Alka Fizz Prison" is trying to take a step ahead of Droopy (here is known as Sgt.McPoodle of the Mounties), but always manages to lead in one direction or another. It is easily one of the most contiguous, short, short shorts that have rolled out of the M-G-M animation studio. It succeeds to get most of it laughing at the shocked reactions Joel has when he comes into contact with McPoodle (including some equally failed sound effects, ie Horns, Screaming, Elephants, etc.). As with any Avery M-G-M for a short, frantic, kinetic pace, it is expected (with some nice, surrealistic view, ie Joe is trying to get away from McPoodle and indeed drive away from the side of the movie). Pop it one on a DVD player and laugh at it stupidly.
