Includes Spoiler <br /> <br /> This is Peter Watkin's film. If someone has seen their BBC masterpieces "Cullodden" and "The War Game", it will recognize the style (and his voice) within a few seconds after the start. Made in 1971 is set to be very close in the near future, when the Vietnam War has deepened and now China seems to be involved. Nixon is still the president and the disobedience and protest of the citizen is being violently dealt with by the drummers' tribunals (outside civilians who are judges). As the "prison building is unable to withstand", an alternative is introduced: the Penalty Park. Criminals can choose between heavy prison sentences and a man in a hostile environment, in this case, a 85-kilometer ride in the desert of California at 100 Â° F. When they arrive at the end of the American flag without being caught by a state guard or by a rebel police, they are released or otherwise punished (or dead, as we see). The film is made in a completely documentary style, with three European teams covering the litigation and the progress of two already punished groups. Scenes jump between arbitration tent, hunters and wolves. The few Watkin comments give us raw background information (time, temperature, etc.). Tribunal scenes, on the one hand, show the Kangaroo Court, and on the other hand, many personalities extending from actual terrorists to unwanted, clearly innocent (eg, all pacifists who cannot even console the flies). The lawyer of a lawyer (who takes his job seriously) must abuse both sides. What makes these scenes especially frightening is their similarity to the rhetoric of today's administration. In the meantime, some unfortunate events in the desert reveal that the rules of the game are not really applicable. The question remains open, whether it is from the outset or because of the arbitrariness of the military, because of the events leading to the results (I suspect it is both). Finally, we are back on the square where the next group goes to the "penalty park". This description may refer to a heavily biased (or even demagogic) propaganda film, but it would be misleading. Behavior (all participants were traditional non-professionals with Watkins) looks and sounds real (tribunal scenes may even contain text material from real modern experiments). I would say it could be sold as a real thing without problems. Watkins "Forgotten Faces" was a reaction "We can't send it or no one believes our real newsletter (because it is indistinguishable from reality)". It should be the same in the "Penalty Park". In the US, it is effectively forbidden, as far as I know, to see that it has not lost its power or its relevance (especially today).
