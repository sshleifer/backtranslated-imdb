Due to the fact that there was no CGI in 1976, I felt the film was quite observable. The studio productions were very good and very detailed. Background effects were very plausible and always appeared as if they were part of the whole set. Participants did this, bearing in mind that the film's premise is the atmosphere of Jules Vern, where imagination and exploration of the future were the most unlikely. If I had watched this movie in 1976, I would probably have been a frightened person's ability to build a machine that could drive to the ground core. I'm still wondering that until now, we're not all driving on our cars, but I'm going. McClure and Cushing have their funny moments, mostly from their facial expressions against each other, which naturally makes the film somewhat campy, which I loved. "Monsters" missed something, but the story was a good premise, although I feel that some other "thing" could have been more credible in these circumstances. All in all, it's time and fun to follow.
