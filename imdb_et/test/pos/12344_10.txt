I thought one dark night was great! It deserves 10! As for a single user statement, the dead WEB had zombies of this movie. A dead person who lives back to life is a zombie, no matter what method or reason he / she brings back in life. The "zombies" of this movie are used to scare the girls, not to feed them like traditional zombies. This movie is a definite star among the 80's terror. The result and the atmosphere are quite scary and the audience is kept in the mausoleum scenes alternately. The actor is actually convincing, with the expression of true fear in Undead's eyes. While I enjoy all the zombie cinemas, this film is a refreshing change from a typical "meat-eating zombie" movie.
