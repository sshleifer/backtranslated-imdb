This movie is the best kung fu movie of all time. Although there are no wires and special effects such as those used in tigers, this film uses ingenuity and creative camera work to create memorable struggle moments, and combat scenes are well choreographic and tense. There are many activities in this movie that have many fighting scenes, but this story is also very good, with many turns. The characters are well rounded and have a real depth because their motivations for action and personality appear much more in detail than most kung fu films. In the movie, there are some really great camera works, my favorite image starts from our hero's face, showing his reaction, then he quickly pulls back to reveal the scene he is facing. Originally, I bought some great scenes in the hope of watching the movie, but I found out how amazing the drama and the story were when I was watching. In general, it's a great movie.
