Once upon a Barbie movie that's good. I am 18 years old and I said it, but I am attached to these films. I hated Barbie when I was younger, but the movies I love. Shiver is so cute and I'm in love with him. She is as cute as the polar bear and in love with Aiden. Oh man who I am in love with Shiver. I love Annika's determination not to give up hope and it works on the scene. I love this movie and hopefully the others are good. Barbie & Swan Lake is another great movie. I recommend this film to children of all ages (even boys) because the film is so good and I'm hard to do it. The magic of Barbie and Pegasus is an enchanting and exciting film.
