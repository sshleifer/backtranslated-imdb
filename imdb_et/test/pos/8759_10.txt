I can only agree with many observers that Traffik is one of the most memorable dramas for television. I saw Traffi when it was on television, and I looked at it again. In particular, I am spurred by Tim Souster's haunting original music, especially Dmitry Shostakovich's chamber music symphony in the C minor (music over credits and parts of the film). Music deepens the despair of these stars as they deal with their sad fate. Music is strongly emotional. This agreement combines two movements of the symphony, but I recommend listening to your symphony.
