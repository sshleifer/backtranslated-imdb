I can't praise this movie. It had a lot of this hand-held, first-person trembling camera that I love (and some hate because it makes them sick), like REC, Cloverfield, and Blair Witch Project. <br /> <br /> This is a long movie, but I didn't even notice it because the movie was so interesting. Simply by showing a video of a paranormal reporter's work, the film keeps pace, making it a real-time experience for the viewer. <br /> <br /> Although I would never call this movie a "more horrifying horror ever made" I have to say that this is definitely one of the best I've ever seen. The Factor is depicted here on the basis of image details, camera interference, interrelated events that give the film a very mysterious and haunting tone. Fear is more than what has not been shown, but is left to our imagination. The end is perfect and you are warned that you may have nightmares later. However, a second view is highly recommended. <br /> <br /> Look at it alone in the dark, don't wait for anything and have fun.
