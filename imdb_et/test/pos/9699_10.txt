This movie is fun. I'd say much more painful and disgusting than the previous movie. The previous movie and series collection is cast. <br /> <br /> These movies are great in MovieTheater, so the whole audience shouts with laughter, especially in a terrorist attack that was damn nasty. I want them to make more of these movies. <br /> <br /> Strong belly needed! This time they got some mad tricks. Warning: contains a lot of snakes! I would like to write about it, but I can't ruin that fun. Look at this!
