It is famous for the Hitchcock tradition. You will be kept in the dark when suspects come and go. Dennis Quaid is like Dexter, who died of death, and Meg Ryan is great as his child. It is not much to dislike in this small ratio and all the pieces fit together as they should. You won't be sorry if you watched it, if you like a break.
