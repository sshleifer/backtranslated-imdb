This film was made with a relatively small budget ($ 10-20 million?), Which was hardly promoted by distributors. I only knew this because I was a fan of Jean-Claude Van Damme for a long time and I always look at his latest films in the hope that they are at least observable and some real turkeys (Derailed, Second In Command), they are. This movie has a simple enough plot to follow, and Van Damme gives good, humorous performance, but the film owes all of its battles to Van Damme, Scott Adkins and the latter together. Editing most movies and working with the camera is terribly terrible, but Isaac Florentine can definitely shoot a good fight. I am also happy that Van Damme has been doing better lately (in hell, awakening to death, until death), but with good action there was less martial arts. In Shepherd, Van Damme proves he still has.
