I found it to be more chaotic than the average Stooges short (as strange as it may seem). There were a lot of funny bits, especially running gags ("Calling Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard!", Breaking glass doors, Stooges entrance into the room, and coming back ... well, you know), but quite a few too things that I just had no idea. I have to assume that these were usually scenes from the movie "Men's White", but since I don't know much about this movie, I can't definitely say. Maybe if someone could explain them, I'd appreciate it briefly.
