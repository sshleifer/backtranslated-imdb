This movie promises a lot but gives a little. The main problem is related to adding Charlotte Gainsborough to this movie. Immigrants from Sicily in no way need angloid redheads - a movie may be needed for him, but there were no new citizens. In my opinion, the decision to include her film destroys the continuity of the film. This is particularly worrying because it seems to reduce not only the film's characters, but also the history of immigration. The immigrants themselves were heroic figures that are fully capable of going together without having to satisfy what I believe is a hidden image of the "white man's load". I don't know if someone is making a movie about Irish immigrants, including a Sicilian woman who's a great character. The left elbow index deals with seven aspects of film performance, product pools, dialogue, art, film continuity, plot and character development - on a large scale 10 excellent, 5 on average, and 1 needs help. Both the continuity of the film and the speed of the schedule are low 1. The above consistency is exacerbated by the surreal end. Does a film of such great historical significance deserve more than a conclusion that resembles Marc Chagall? The plot is easy enough until it seems too long in the old country, too little time on the ship and too much pressure to end. Action and character formation are average, as all characters are fixed throughout the film, and engaging English-German speaking English makes it almost satirical. Where's Groucho when you need him? The production kits, the dialogue and the artistry are very good, every rating is 10. Sicilian, ship and Ellis kits are as good as possible. Dialogue is wonderful and ethical singing is great. I agree with Scorsese that listening to the Sicilian dialect is a joy. Note that immigrants talk about "America", not "the United States" - the ideal political reality. There are many good artistic scenes, American dreams, gold coins, and giant vegetables among the best. The average left elbow index is 5.25, raised to 7.0 if it is equal to the IMDb scale. Another idea seems to be going through Ellis Iceland's experience: the misfortunes of passport migrants were exhausting, later in 2006, only the coyote or boatman had to pay and crawl at night in the darkness, no questions were asked! The film is worth, but it seems that what we see is problematic.
