A man with a golden shoulder was one of the first films whose main theme was (and in some sense a message) a heroin addiction tragedy. It is nowhere near a big movie, but its importance lies in Otto Preminger's commitment to making it real, alongside melodrama and naturalism. I liked it not so many junkies (if you want to read it the best revelation of a naked lunch, if you still get through it), but the nature of the city Frankie Machine lives. She is waiting for her to go straight and narrow after she leaves jail to become a drummer in the band and make it a legendary musician. But she has her own "spoiled" woman Zosch, who can't work and needs money and often digs, and then there is an old neighborhood - she can't get to see Louie (Darren McGavin) who is still playing back-card games and yes, pushing the rope . Like Mean Streets, it is difficult to distinguish small things when you leave. <br /> <br /> But Frankie Machine is hard to work on in the city quarter. It's just that he can't escape the junk temptation (when he's booked his fake for a fake he sees junk, and he puts back the fear of going back to his clean self). And Frankie's personalization is Sinatra and I don't see anyone else who could have played her, even the original Brando. He is in the neighborhood and seems to be a man who should be a step ahead of the game. But it is also a vulnerability to Sinatra that it pulls out perfectly and when we see her in a "cold turkey" in a Molly apartment, it is plausible even if it is not what my "my" generation would think of heroin (ie Trainspotting and definitely a dream) Requiem). If you don't want anything else to watch a movie to see what it is like to be with Sinatra, the disadvantages will still appear in some other stage, although it's a bit complicated. It seems that Eleanor Parker is a good part of the movie because she deceives Frankie that she is really exhausted when in fact she can walk and deceive her for one reason or another. But then it becomes clearer when it goes - it should be nuts and nuts with jealousy and at this level it will become better. Meanwhile, Kim Novak is a good, though not Vertigo-worthy, if possible girl side, but rather a story voice. Then there is the detective Bendar who can be one of the most noticeable characters / performances. And Sparrow, Frankie's nerdy friend, and Louie and Schiefka's characters, and they've all been playing as expected (in fact, McGavin is better than OK). As for the other talents around Sinatra, Preminger doesn't do that much. And frankly, some scenes are gradually falling. <br /> <br /> But a person with gold scarf has a lot of excitement and not just some dated sociological interest. It acts as a massive drama and as a message that is transmitted without preaching or campy. This is a real article that is not just exceptional.
