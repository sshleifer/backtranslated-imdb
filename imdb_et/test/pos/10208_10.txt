Fritz Lang led two major western states: Western Union and Frank James' Return. Frank James's movie is "Jesse James". Western Union is one of Randolph Scott's largest Western countries. I've never seen Robert Young in the West before; he is a terrible telegraph worker. This is the only film I think the telegraph company is opening in the West. It is a high-level story with a western telegraph, a triangle of love story, and loyalty. <br /> <br /> A strong mold is excellent. Dean Jagger, who made a few westerns, plays a telegraph manager. Virginia Gilmore, who plays with Mr Jagger's sister, is in the interest of film love. Mrs Gilmore was in a short career in films. He gave up the films in 1952 and became a drama coach. She is mainly known as the first Mrs. Yul Brynner. It's nice to see Slim Summerville's movie with Mr. Scott. They were still in two great films: "Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm" and "Jesse James".
