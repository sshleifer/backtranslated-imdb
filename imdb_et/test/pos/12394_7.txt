I'm talking Carn√© over hot and cold. He can really be a puzzle for me. I think his inspiration left him a little earlier when he made his generation for other leaders. Certainly, in the thirties, the man seems to have reached the people in France at a good level in the fifties, because it is a crippling commercialism and a hard American influence. He is almost thirty years older than his young stars and it shows. Party scenes go a lot longer than they should, as if trying to buy time for an anemic scenario. The character of Roland Lesaffre - he plays Pascale's older brother of Petit - seems to exist only to assure the director that his old-style ideas are still sound. <br /> <br /> After two hours, this image will be too long. However, let me praise Pascale Petit for his game; he was a natural person who should have challenged Brigitte Bardot against sexual potential, but he somehow lost. Andrea Parisy is also great when she gets pregnant and wants Charrier to marry and make her child legal (yes, they thought about it in fifty places). Laurent Terzieff is the only French actor who can play a convincing anarchist: he's great here when he rescues a cat from death, he says he can't wear a cat. Jacques Charrier reminds me only how mediocre he was of the actor, his constant little smile and their empty eyes.
