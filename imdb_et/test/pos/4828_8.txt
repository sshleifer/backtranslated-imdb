This work is in a pretty atmosphere, with a few surprises, some of which are really horrible elements. I found this work more profitable than I expected for the first time, since IMDb has rotten reviews here. The dialogue comes through both naturally and honestly (considering the circumstances), although the overall course of the film goes down the predictable cliché and heroes when they should run, and by examining strange sounds when they should lock the doors. Typical horror movies prices. Local characters are some of the worst clichés depicting the natives of Appalachian as a breeding challenge. Children's characters and leaders are great! This development is good and Scout Taylor-Compton seems to be developing talented talent quite well. <br /> <br /> Now, I'm not saying it's completely original or the best because sliced ​​bread (which isn't otherwise big), but it's interesting and I won't lose my 107 minutes ago. I wouldn't say it's in some way a fantastic movie, but here are some very good horror elements. But there are also some very slow places where the graphic / character formation seems to be superfluous for the director (or film editor). <br /> <br /> All in all, it's good for a rainy night, but not as good for a Friday / Saturday night. <br /> <br /> This price is 7.6 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
