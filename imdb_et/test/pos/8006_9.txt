Ah, Batman Returns, is it possible that the sequel is almost as good as the original? With Batman returning, it came close! We have terrible actors and a large plot with a dark knight and two new villains, Catwoman and Penguin. We have Michael Keaton as Batman and he is still fantastic as ever. Michelle Pfieffer is the perfect choice for Catwoman and was perfectly cast. As much as I love and is such an incredible actress, Annette Benning, she couldn't be Catwoman, she's not really seen. Danny DeVito, who could have imagined him to be Penguin? He was just big and terrible! <br /> <br /> Batman will return to a more loving Gotham City community, celebrating Christmas time with Max Shrek, played by horrible Christopher Walken. The perfect villain who threatens his cute secretary, Selina, who hears too much in his office, putting him under pressure from the window, hoping that he will die and never disclose the penguin's knowledge and aspiration to love him with Goth. When she lives and has awakened her cats, she wants revenge and is ready to go with her cats! But there is another active villain, Penguin, who is looking for his parents who abandoned him and now wants to be a new mayor of Gotham City! Can Batman stop both superb mothers from creating their twilight actions and stop the mayor from destroying the city? <br /> <br /> You have to see! Batman's return is as good as the original Batman, despite being the first true classic, it will still run. And come, I mean, we have Michelle leather! His classic moment just at the meeting with Batman and Penguin "Meow" is classic! There are memorable signs, lines and sets! You have a blast! Trust me! <br /> <br /> 9/10
