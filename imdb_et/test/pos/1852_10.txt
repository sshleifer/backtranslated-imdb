My two daughters (aged 11 and 13) and I was lucky enough to see a movie review last night. We were all pleasantly surprised to see how fun and funny this film was. David Duchovny was very tempting because the male leader and Minnie Driver generally gave him a competent appearance. Some scenes are laughing loudly funny - especially one scene Minnie Driver has a companion "transplant". I liked it was a movie I could watch with my kids and I didn't like a scene. All the cinema in the theater laughed and enjoyed themselves. Bonnie Hunt is on fire!
