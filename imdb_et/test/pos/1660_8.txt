American expatriate Jules Dassin makes an award-winning French gangster film. The plot is owned by Tony the Stephano, a hoodlum that has just been out of prison and takes his early band with a $ 240 million jewel strike. Unfortunately, his former wife's relationship with the notorious gangster, called Grutter, the Italian safe cracker named Cesar, who had a weakness for women, and her own friend Jo's deceptions, caused a successful success to become a bloody race with the time Grutter keeps his son's hostage to cash in a typical "crime will never pay" "The tragedy. <br /> <br /> The title "rifife" is explained in the song to mean basically violence and sex slang, and the whole title, "Du rififi chez les hommes" means about "Some naughty men's house", which is pretty much where it happens the deadly mistake of the characters. Leave this gangster movie to put most of the emphasis on women's failure, but this time Jo's laugh can be laughed at (if you call it laugh) when she predicts "Everyone kills everyone else." The characters are not the most sympathetic and women are mostly weak, but Dassin it still builds an extremely well-designed midget film when they pull down extremely quiet, hidden goods and try to survive, which in principle becomes a cross-country cat and mouse. There are some very amazing photos and fine attention to detail in the blend that brings you a temple and visual experience that goes beyond the general plot. It is not just easy to understand why this is considered classic, it is also easy to understand why it's IMDb's top 250: it's tight, visually great, full of sexual and violence, and argues that the stylish gangsters attitude we're filming like that much.
