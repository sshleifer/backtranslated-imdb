Great movie! oh yeah! Perfect energy, fun, full of our generation, our alienation: the anthem of positive thinking, despite the world we live in, the story of a great party, the story of friends who desperately need to do something at the end of the week and the only thing the club has to do. But fun and extasy keep boredom away! Very funny, nicely grotesque at some point, nicely shot ... and a great soundtrack!
