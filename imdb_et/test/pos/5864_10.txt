I remember this movie as the other who commented on it. I saved it, but I wish I had it just because it had to be one of the worst movies. Funny, really bad. I remember the "ultimate front lobotomy" on the label of the box. I got it from my mother who got it from work to a friend who said it was the worst / most exciting film she'd ever seen so my mom said, "My son loves it." and she just gave it to her to get out of her possession. Later I recorded what I regret. I also remember the "body screw" thing that was one of those things for the ball-catchers .... yellow cone-shaped things with a red button at the end, and when the red thing hit, he sends the ball. Well, they used it with one end of crank and funnel corkscrew. When the killer killed, they showed him that they would come with a "weapon," and then cut closer to what seemed to be the raw chicken and the victims of counterfeit blood. I don't know what else to say with this "pearl" except that if you like bad movies, it won't get worse.
