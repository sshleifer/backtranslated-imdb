I can't believe it has been 25 years since I first saw this story on TV. I remember having touched it a lot and I had a happy VHS tape several years ago. I didn't look at it again until recently. Since then, I've been following it again. I have to watch it 10 times in the last 2 weeks. <br /> <br /> The actor is great, the story is convincing and I'm embarrassed to say that I didn't appreciate the actress Bryan Brown's talents until now. The first half shows playful facial expressions - when she gave Jean stolen drugs at Malaya, this contrast is with her very reserved and nervous body language, shown in the second half: her first drink with Cain and the peasant. We have to wait until the wedding reception, especially the last dance scene, to see her open show for Jean. The same dance eyes that first showed her admiration for Malaya. Who wouldn't want to be her Mrs. Boong? Although Joe turned into a middle-aged Joe in the backyard of almost a living life in the Malay jungle, Jean took the opposite path; his war time experience seems to have given him new confidence. He wasted time and went after what he wanted. He took steps to take what he got - exactly as Joe had once told him. <br /> <br /> For me, all of these changes help show that it is more than just a love story - it's a story of growth, courage, and uncertainty in life. Lawyer - It's a sweet and sad figure. He also gave Jean a lot - he gave his last hope of love. Finally, he did what real love needed - he put his happiness in front of him. <br /> <br /> I happened like a fight between Joe & Jean, which wasn't in the book. I thought it was an appropriate and necessary complement, because it contributed to the internal struggles they both had to deal with in order to make their lives together possible. <br /> <br /> Now I'm older, maybe I understand life, love and loss a little better. This story touches me even deeper. <br /> <br /> However, I am surprised to find that Brown Brown has an advertising photo of blue eyes on this site. He certainly did not want "in the area of ​​the city like Alice". Well, 25 years is a long time!
