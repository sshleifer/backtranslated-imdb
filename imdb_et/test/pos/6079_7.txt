The book is better than the film, mainly because of the prose of the writer Ondatje. Before I saw this movie, someone who saw it told me that the love depicted in this film is not real. After seeing this movie, I can see how stopping his unbelief in this regard could have disturbed other filmmakers. To be honest, some of the intense displays of love were ridiculous and appear to be on the edge of the parody. But in the end, everyone should realize that this is a great message. It is not specifically about love at all, it uses "love" to dialectically expose people's divisions or arbitrary boundaries of states that help to justify wars and hatred. It concerns misunderstandings and the blinding of things that are supposed to separate us. The critical scene of the real theme of this film is when a hero or antihero aids to help his stranded lover in the desert are ignored and ignored for the reasons shown in this scene. This film also talks about hope and forgiveness, the hope that is reflected in Binoche's renewable nature and the Indian miner's interracial relationship (reflected in Sikh's friend-friend relationship with his white colleague who is meaninglessly killed) and the first hunting and abandonment of Caravaggio's conquering forgiveness for what he thinks , the hero's confessions for his "crimes" (state betrayal) of his war. I think the film could have been even better. I do not know if a more realistic representation of the circumstances of love would have made the actual themes and points of this film even more obvious or not, but I agree that this film is not a realistic romantic love if the people behind it in a work of art or a film refer at an early stage to potential lovers meet for the first time. The hero talks about how a new car, a broken car, a fast car, etc. (I'm paraphrasing) is still a car, no matter what adjective you put it. He answers, but parental love, platonic love, romantic love, etc. are very different types of love. It is ironic because this film is really one of the love that all people want, the love of peace (or not) (not the materialistic things that are usually the real causes of wars that most of us like "cars"). Otherwise, we may be left in a cave of death in the cave, which is an ancient ancient wall with art / swimmers' drawings among large deserts, suggesting that the seas and the life-supporting waters that once existed have disappeared. "The English patient" won the Oscar because of the great messages he did not have to portray his romantic love. The prizes tend to go in this way. The relationship between the hero and the heroine was necessary to lead the audience, unfortunately, this love outlook may be obsolete and so many singles who does not seem to come together on so many levels, so mysterious love is hard to access, even in dreams that have always loved, especially in old Hollywood. The film may not be what people expect, but out of the 10 out of 10 movies to see.
