Peter Watkins, a rarely seen punishment park, is a brutally spicy, uncompromising political weapon over the endless desertscape. Unapologetically left inclined to be an authoritarian abuser fest, the capitals initially seem to be so upright militarist and sick that it could come out like some distant fantastic dystopian alternate history, one of Harry Turtledove even enjoying. But if we go deeper and really pay attention to the terrifying drop that pulls out the tents at the forefront of the tents, as well as the shotgun guards who watch the blood things, our eyes are really open. Suddenly, we understand how Watkins' historical filmmaking is as much as the neo-congruent point about youth culture and the legitimacy of the disagreements that politicians today have. Most of this was also when it was, but it shows us how little has changed, and tells us how we are somehow closer to a world where punitive parks are real and scary acts. Almost every scene, the main players are experienced non-actors, mostly selected for their rash political views and the desire to get them on the camera. This gives the whole experience unprecedented heap authenticity, because we never doubt, even within a few seconds, the reality of all the chaos. The style of the 16 mm documentary film looks like the sharp documentation of some of the despicable government pilot projects that were classified up to years later. At least it seems at this time that history is now, perhaps not as much as it was (barely) released. However, it adds value to all procedures and helps to convict dissidents convicted of incredible, not so intermittent torture.
