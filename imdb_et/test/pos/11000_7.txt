General Trelayne is a super-creature who wants to play a small game with a company team. Many very unlikely and pointless things seem to be happening, and Trelayne seems to be obsessed with the practices of warfare and murder. It seems he needs to experience what he is excited about and has created a human environment (albeit a few hundred years old) to play his fantasies. The environment is delicately unreliable and the team will immediately identify the contradictions. Quite soon, it turns out that Trelayne is not just an immature god, but a very flawless one. Regardless of how you feel it, hold down the Twilight Zone-type end. It's worth it. <br /> <br /> As many have pointed out, Trelayne's character was inspired by the advanced and more fun character of Q - and you see John DeLancie building this personality more than just Campbelli Trelayne. It's fun to compare how the four captains we've seen to deal with Q are doing so radically differently.
