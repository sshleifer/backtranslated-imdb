Obviously it is cheap to take advantage of the notorious "Mandingo", this slightly dirty Italian sexploitation junk pile of really varieties with no lucrative taste and restraint: the evil arrogant white family who owns and manages the rich slavery spends most of the time on the screen, dealing with each other as well with different slaves. Directed by Mario Penzauti and screenwriter Tecla Romanelli, the hellish slogan with terrifying slippery is breaking: we have nasty rape, interracial copulation (one white lady makes a natural love of the black black stud when she's bound), big woman nudity, brutal whips, weak degradation, a much more gentle soft core sex, and a severely twisted tragic surprise that interferes with elements of incidents, murders, and malformations in the questionable attempt to make a statement about the terrible inhumanity of slavery. Particularly beautiful actors are to see foxy brunette actress Paola D'Egidio, whose strange and unobtrusive image of exhausted and naughty evil bitch Rhonda burns positively on the screen. Besides, Marcello Giombini's funky, creepy tribal score hits an amazing place. The trick is also Maurizo Centin's quite polished cinematography. Calmly swinging creeping butterfly.
