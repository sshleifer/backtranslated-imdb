I love this movie so much: music, cinematography, acting, story and all the clichés of Mormon. Just because they are clichés doesn't mean they're not true! It's not perfect, it's film. Although expositions are held in well-lit rooms with beautiful large tables and chairs, it was perfectly appropriate to portray it as a dark, cold scene they did in this film. I also liked the scene where an angel waits for smoking at the bus stop. I thought it was so cool. I think I believe the angels are watching us. What to wait for? Smoking is a way for some people to move on in anticipation. I loved irony because the Mormons did so much about smoking. I saw this movie 7 times in Salt Lake theaters and called every time! It blows me off. And I watched it 3 times in the video now and it still makes me cry. I would jump to see the big screen again. I hope that the Salt Lake Tower Theater will regularly bring it back as a cult film during the general conference (the red is scheduled but not intended).
