My partner and I sat down to watch this movie on a wine bottle last Saturday, and although we had our reservations initially when the story went, it was actually catchy. A scene in which one of the brutally murdered characters was particularly shocking and repeated the work of Korea's new auteur Park Chan Wook. The selected weapon was a special craftsmanship and allowed us to see grandmother's psyche, making the connotations of a strongly loving, warm grandmother into a murderous action. The dialogue was incredibly touching and lyrical in expressing the main major paranoia. Pavlosky's choices from the arena to the arena will further enhance the nervous and manic atmosphere of night-time events, combining Oscar-worthy performances to create a cool and thoughtful masterpiece. The end I am not breaking here for you reminded my partner and me of M Night Shyamalan's institutional masterpiece The sixth mind for changing this way of thinking that has left me thinking after a week of viewing. Definitely one repeatedly!
