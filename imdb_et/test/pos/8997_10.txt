This film has given me a fan of rugby and coach Larry Gelwix. The characters in the story slipped and fell before they began to grow when they fought incredibly strong conflict. They were understandable and completely believable. As with life, there was no easy answer to all these problems. A great actor and a great script brought this true story to life. I want more of these movies. These days, I look almost exclusively for valuable true stories because they are usually much more interesting than fiction. In addition, it is inspiring and teaches us not to give up too soon.
