I bought this movie to see Bam because I really loved her, but after I saw it she didn't like much. I mean, his acting was good and all I think, but when it showed completely unnecessary skate scenes, I just said to myself, "Okay, we know you're a professional skateboard, now we get back to Ryan Dunn?" Dunn, Rake and Brandon really made a movie from my perspective. <br /> <br /> I noticed that Jenn Rivell (apparently) and Missy Rothstein were both in Haggard, but who was Bam in history? Anyway, I really enjoyed Haggard and I think it's really like no other movie I've ever seen. It's kind of in your category.
