Batman's return is gothic and somber as his predecessor, and I like it a lot. The landscape is also darker and the whole environment is sad with both the talented Danny Elfman's breath-making music. <br /> <br /> But I didn't like the idea of ​​making a Penguin a monster, unlike the comics he is a human. Even if he looks like a monster, he shows well that he has human dignity, and I was very sorry for him when he saw the tombstones of his late parents. But still he was a dangerous villain, and he had to be stopped. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton made his return to the "tour de force" as a dark knight and this time he is as powerful as the original Batman. It is not difficult to understand why he has sometimes been named by Batman's public ... <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer is also so sexy and well-equipped that she gave the perfect result as a woman dressed as a villain / criminal. Indeed, the actors did all the masterful work with Batman Returns, which made it a successful film. <br /> <br /> If you liked Batman, check out this awesome sequel because it is very worthy of all Dark Knight's core lovers. <br /> <br /> Steve Baillargeon
