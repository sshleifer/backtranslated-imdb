It is one of the seafaring yarns of this era that are distinguished in the middle of the female buccaneer (though not unique in itself). At first, both leaders - Jean Peters and Louis Jourdan - may seem uneven, but they will eventually grow into their roles, no doubt the talented players (Herbert Marshall, Thomas Gomez and James Robertson Justice) who support them. The velvety voice of Marshall is peculiar when the ship's obligatory philosophical doctor is cute and Gomez is more suitable than life like the Blackbeard Pirate. <br /> <br /> Debra Paget is cast as Jourdan's wife, carrying the jealous character of a terrifying title to whom the Jourdan Institute's first love fears (which, however, does not prevent her from being beaten by beating or sword wound); by the way, this film was another exotic joining of Jourdan and Paget one year after Delmer Daves's relaxation. The direct consequence of unexpected softening of this character is his fall to the Blackbeard team and his unlikely climate-specific victim to save the stranded Jourdan, Paget and Marshall lives. <br /> <br /> During the movie, the energetic direction of Jacques Tourneur and Franz Waxman's magnificent score is not a particularly prominent example of this type of effort, which is more than average, moving at a fast pace; by the way, Tourneur had already made a service in the genre with the superior Burt Lancaster vehicle THE FLAME and ARROW (1950). As with traditional Technicolor productions, cinematography gives the film viability. By the way, this movie has different working hours (81 or 87 minutes), and the record was shorter for the record.
