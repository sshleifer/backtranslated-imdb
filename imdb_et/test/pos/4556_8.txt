I think it's a bad and sad coincidence that both John Candy and Chris Farley left us when they were still doing a lot of things. , I think the plots of 2 movies are really similar, Road Trips with two different characters and many unfortunate consequences because of Chubbies, This movie can't be Planes trains and Automobiles, but its really fun movie especially with Chris Farley's great performance, this movie missing part is if we compare it to Candy & Martin Classic, but I think it's better
