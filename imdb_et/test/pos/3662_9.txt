"Hari om" is a greeting from India, and the compelling title of the movie with the same name (played by the wedding planner Monsoon Wedding) characterizes you and takes you through the heart of South India. There is no "Bend it like Beckham" backdrops and stereotypes, and only a few welcome Bollywood's music and dancing (but the sound is worth getting), but the feeling of seeing real India goes through the use of tens of local people in every scene to enhance the film activities of five professional participants. Fortunately, Hari Om's companion is a young and beautiful French woman looking for a trip. With the discovery of "Y Tu Mama Tambien" self-discovery (without sex and deadly disease), this beautiful film calms the philosophical mind. Everyone's identities will be identified by the opposing features of the original counter-rivalry, and the cultural divide will disappear when humanity enters. The central theme of the film is "Everyone has a love story, don't let you pass". lots of love on many levels. Don't let this movie hand over you!
