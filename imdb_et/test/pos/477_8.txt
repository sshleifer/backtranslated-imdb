The participants in this dark film are truly credible and well cast. The quality of the camera's work makes you feel like you are there. The scenario is intense and does not migrate. The plot is one that wants to look at it a second time, when it is a new perspective from the end result. We showed this movie to a small group of patrons at Gadsden Cultural Center. After the film, he once wanted to discuss the film and one person invited me to say the next day that they were still "bothered". If we put an 18-year limit on the film, I would look at the film with a young group, because it is a very realistic picture of a stupid situation and sets a great conversation on the stage.
