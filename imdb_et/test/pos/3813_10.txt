Obviously, the previous reviewers are not fans of this genre, but I think it's done quite well. <br /> <br /> It's a difficult cute wise and dark. This story brought back memories of the girls I loved as a child. <br /> <br /> I also like to see some of Nadia's other movies, many youtube comments about how hot she is in this video. <br /> <br /> Certainly there are some Burton effects here, but I wouldn't say that Brad is trying to cut him off. <br /> <br /> He just jumps and adds his talents to the genre that I appreciate. I like what he does and he does it well, nuff said!
