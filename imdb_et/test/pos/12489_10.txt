The director loves the actor and it shows. The actor lives the character we love at first sight and sound. The character loves her jealous of an uncommon wife and she loves her. Her childhood friend loves her wife secretly and the fact that her friend is a beautiful woman makes love tragic and ironic. Her husband is jealous of his childhood friend and thinks that his attitude is not secret love for his wife. <br /> <br /> Then the murder and the Lieutenant of the Investigative Police, who loves only his two racial sons and the surprises that the above-mentioned characters took from his company, and who have been in contact with dead persons and are all in one degree or another, lose the most accurate and authentic procedural detail of the mystery that has ever been recorded on film. <br And then there is a post-war Parisian atmosphere where coal is scarce, music is full of erotic longing and poor memory, and innocence has long been wiped out. /> <br /> All of this is in the milieu of magic, whose tricks do not always work, the dogs that walk on their hind legs and express music with criticism, hungry news reporters and exhausted police. <br /> <br /> And then there are many of the best actors of their generation who are through some very bad ars, led by a full circle, a man who is in love with his leading actor and who was a fully-fledged Picasso-honored friend. <br /> <br /> I've often seen this movie and I love them all and that.
