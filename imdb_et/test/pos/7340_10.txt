Gymnast (2006) wrote and directed Ned Farr. Dreya Weber depicts Jane Hawkins, a world-class gymnast who was seriously injured and now earns a living as a certified massage therapist. <br /> <br /> Advertising material will lead you to believe that the plot is located around Jane's casual meeting with a former teammate. Although this meeting is taking place, the plot of this plot is the main plot that includes her husband Jane and a professional dancer Serena (Addie Yungmee). Two women are working on an act by Cirque de Soleil. Two complement each other - Jane has a superior experience and enormous body strength. Serena is more elegant and artistic, although it is probably capable of incredible physical competitions. <br /> <br /> Film works because we understand how Jane turns to Addie, who is caring and compassionate, while Jane's husband is Both women are incredibly fit and athletic, and Dreya has a lean body and well-defined muscles that are typical for gymnasts. Obviously, they do their job and the results are so great that we can believe they are really successful in Las Vegas or somewhere else they traveled. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the situation becomes even more complicated when it comes to being able to kiss during a stop. A woman who has a careless wife and an attractive female partner creates an explosive situation that is not solved in clean and orderly manner. Film and video festival, we thought it was the best. It works on a DVD and is definitely worth looking for a large or small screen. NOTE. Stay on credit!
