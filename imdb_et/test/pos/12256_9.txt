... was "Broadcast News" and what it was good for. It just stays and sounds like a barbaric gripper that resonates two decades later. <br /> <br /> There are moments - especially with the cutesy score - when this movie becomes a little eighty or a bit too "Sleepy in Seattle." Fortunately, they're a little and far away. <br /> <br /> One-third of social satire, one-third of romantic comedy, one-third of drama, three faulty but loving people at the center, it's smart and moving and almost impossible to be funny. Especially Holly Hunter has never been more fun watching the comedian role. (And yes, I am also in this appraisal "Raising Arizona", his second letter of this timing.) <br /> <br /> A legitimate classic.
