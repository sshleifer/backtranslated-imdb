I turned toward this movie midnight and I almost missed it. Just because it had nothing else, I decided to look at it. Finally, I thought it was great. <br /> <br /> An interesting story, good characters, smart script and brilliant management make it a fine movie to sit and watch. In fact, it was the first thing I heard about this movie, but I would have paid the money to see it in the cinema. <br /> <br /> My IMDB rating: 8 out of 10 <br /> <br />
