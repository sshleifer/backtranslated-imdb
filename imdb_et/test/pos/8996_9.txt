In this film, we have a very positive message for our young people. Through Rugby sports, high school rugby coach means players in their behavior and lifestyle, ON and OFF. <br /> <br /> Operation and control are good. Rugby shots are just OK if you know some rugby or really cool if you don't know much about it. <br /> <br /> I recommend watching this movie, especially when this sport is getting more and more admissions every day. <br /> <br /> The plot is based on a real story in Utah. The coach depicted in this film has been under the guidance of Highlander for over 30 years (and loses only every 3 years). <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
