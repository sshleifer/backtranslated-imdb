The surface, from the day he first showed up in the summer of 2005, was a tossup. On the one hand, the concept and the motivation of the plot seemed so high that for the passer-by it seemed to work better than a film (or several). In addition, it seemed that this was a "lost killer" attempt at NBC. On the other hand, it can be understood that the story was too broad to say in a movie or two, and Lost fans seemed intriguing. <br /> <br /> So after one (and possibly only) season in NBC, the show is indefinite at a time that can put it on the vault, Sci-fi or fill the gap in NBC in the summer or fall of 2007 or beyond . Its ratings were better on the network (which doesn't speak much), but the show has been removed from the air without a real official announcement of its future. <br /> <br /> So is it worth it? Yes, yes. <br /> <br /> Surface follows an ongoing story format, driven by plot-side filler episodes. Almost everything in the show is important to the plot, such as film. There is no filler episode that, when you miss an episode, puts you in pain. However, it helped show the double edge; Big things seem to happen for every episode, but because you know the movie, you stop feeling every episode as little happened and you've missed more! This exhibition shows how big it is. Solid is cast; The three main leaders, including the beautiful Lake Bell, Laura Daughtery, made every episode a strong result, each of which prompted its reasons for finding / learning beings. Supportive shots, including a brief presentation by Ian Anthony Dale and Rade Serbedzija, fill a cast well. The story starts slowly (my one regret; it doesn't really rise to 3-4 episodes to a short 15-episode season), but the last half of the season is doing it. Visual effects are stunning (one jaw drops when you see a view of one ship's attack on a ship). <br /> <br /> Many of the exhibition's problems can be eliminated by purchasing the first season and do not have to wait a week (or three) to watch the next episode. <br /> <br /> In short, if you are out of the first season and are curious, go back and watch it. It is not a double peace, but the essence of this high concept brings both lost and other similar exhibitions. Enjoy it.
