I saw the Chomps Theater Theater in about 2 days. It is pleasantly cute and funny in the spirit of "Benji", though much better and more focused on actors than dogs. Easy to portray the hardships of life with humor, followed by bullying and villains who simply get deserts are as sympathetic as heart-warming. Provocation is also believed. Due to the inadequacy of this film, this film affects awareness of cruelty, personal conduct and bullying. Movies are for different families and for different purposes. This movie, which is pleasing to all ages, offers an interesting humorous look at our own experience. Everyone recognizes the personality and behavior of himself and others. Everyone sees humor. Humor makes the movement enjoyable and brings a new level of understanding of life situations. <br /> <br /> Chomps is a great choice for a twilight laugh and a "good feel" movie. Memorable.
