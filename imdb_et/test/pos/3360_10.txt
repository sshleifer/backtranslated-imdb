Often, when TV shows are transferred to a large screen, they lose their complaint. Not in that case! The historical precision of costumes, equipment, and general art, as in the TV series, is outstanding. A good example of comedy and farce with excellent scripts and comedy parts in the right part. Based on the classic TV series, which is a British TV comedy story alone.
