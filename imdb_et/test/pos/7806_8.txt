With its fake, intelligent comedy, it has some pathetic actions and choreography (and remember it is deliberate), good hummable songs, good productions, Amir, Salman and Paresh with great and all scripts. which is so rare in the Indian cinema that also comedy (see David Dhawan, Harmesh Malhotra, etc.). The story is a waste of two, the only purpose of which is to enrich and hear in any way. They come together so they find that the rich NRI is married to India. The rest of the story talks about a unified approach and how they waste each other. The whole cast is entirely by Deven Verma to Viju Khote. The songs are correctly placed and funny. The surprise package is Salman, who works with perfect timing and this particular act gave him his comedy style. <br /> <br /> All the fum movie you shouldn't ignore if you want and watch Indian cinema.
