"Head" is a film that has grown well since its original publication in 1968. The film is a complete contradiction of the Monkees image. It introduces the monkey so that their fans never perceive them; men with real thoughts. Monkeys controlled by these manufacturers were given the opportunity to tell their story. The film is fun for your image, the entertainment industry and the business world. The soundtrack contains some of your best music. It's watching the movie over and over again.
