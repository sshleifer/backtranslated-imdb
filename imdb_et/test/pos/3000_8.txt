Lewis Locker Quick Approach Underworld King creates a deeper plot while maintaining efficient working hours. One of the clearest examples of this is the transition to a paired medical couple between poverty and wealth. The public is immediately transported from the medical cabinet to a luxurious suite in the city's most prestigious inn. This development is critical to understanding the position of the doctor. The story shows from the introduction that these two people are generally satisfied with the provision of medical practice to those who are less fortunate. The moratorial occupation of this scenario, which has been drastically cut back (mob's personal doctor), invites the viewer to experience this unexpected course of events. Nelsons (Kay Francis and John Eldredge) have been forced by Gurney (Bogart) without any objection. This stylized concept of organized crime, which is too influential and able to cross, has become a standard component of every gangster's image. One aspect of this film that raises some questions to me is ironically about the pace of the story and the speed at which it was said. I think character development and social identity may suffer if certain aspects of the story are not fully investigated. This paradox happens as a result of personal taste, because I think the film experience can be improved by developing a strict character. However, for this movie, I have to admit that fast action helps the film more dynamically. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 (****)
