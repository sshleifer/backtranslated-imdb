The exhibition is great. No words to describe it. Wonderful music. Incredible dance. Editors couldn't ruin it, not because they weren't * bad *, but because the show was really * good *. <br /> <br /> Editors are compulsive cutters, you won't see the scene without being cut for more than 15 seconds. It's OK to show different perspectives, but these guys worked for the first time with several cameras in their lives and they remind you how many cameras they have every five seconds ... They can shoot at first with one camera, then cut it into the middle and show it at the rest of the corner. <br /> <br /> No matter how much they tried, they couldn't ruin this wonderful show. This is essential for dance and music lovers.
