Do you like explosions? How to fight? Well, this movie is both. You know you can't get a movie without: kick ass motorcycle, a type that bounces on someone's head and strikes them at the same time. You take the stabilizer one. There's even a classic bald scene. <br /> <br /> All in all, I'm absolutely proud to have even seen this movie ... and even proud that my review is the first ... YES!
