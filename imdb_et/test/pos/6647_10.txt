I don't remember a movie that so intelligently demonstrates the emotional destruction of war, as reflected in one marriage relationship. The focus of the film is Ullman and Von Sydow - both in each scene. During the film they experience a role - one is the strength of survival and the other, through dreams, the reduced emotional escapism. Both lose the human dimension, but to a greater extent than the other. The characters and the viewer fluctuate during the proximity - the camera pulls out and away, the sound disappears, the words disappear, only the camera returns to the picturesque neighborhoods of its facial stars. Confusion and fluctuations can make this movie difficult for some viewers, but it is all appropriate for Bergman. I think the use of the "fake" war makes the film timeless, which is as important today as ever, and focuses on human relationships during the war, making the film relevant to everyone. A couple can be someone. The film is not on the spot or in time, but rather on emotion. Unique and effective warfare, unlike others. Bergman's films are virtuoso when he performs interpersonal relationships - to bring it to a movie that is masterful.
