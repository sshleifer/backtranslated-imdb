Note the extensive release date on August 8, 1945 - about a week before the Japanese resurrection in World War II, so we probably have the message "Over 21". Irene Dunne (this happened one night, the 1939 Love Affair version) is Paula Wharton, who lives on an army, while her newspaper editor's wife is in school. Alexander Knox (longest day) is his hub Max. Look for Charles Coburn (Monkey Business, gentlemen prefer Blondes), like exhausted, commanding, newspaper boss. Also look for Cora Witherspoon as Mrs Gates, Women, Bank Dick, Libeled Lady. A military story written from a woman's point of view that was not too common these days. a fun comment on the stricken situation of "married housing"; Irene's wardrobe in this movie was not at all dirty .. since they never had to leave their little house, it seems that the whole movie's budget was spent on her fine dress and hat.
