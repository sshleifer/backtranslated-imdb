Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who is rarely my favorite, said everyone should see this movie because it is something that can help the world heal .... <br /> <br /> This is one of the most amazing films I have seen and have provided Tutu comments .... I've read many comments and although they range from a good average to commenting on the range of participants ... The fact is that this is one of the most common events in our world. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission ... for the first time, the state has decided to incite its terrible history, find its way and create a way to heal people ... <br /> <br /> The film begins when the White Police is offered the chance to get rid of brutal crimes and Black the boy tries to make sure he doesn't get away from it, it worsens the humanity of the people and the immense need to heal that we all need ... <br /> <br /> Be sure to thumb up ..... Again, I'm proud to be South Africa ..... <br /> <br /> An interesting comment can be found here: http://www.biz-community.com/Article/196/97/5223.html
