I like movies about peculiar people. "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" is perhaps my all-time favorite, so I can imagine I had this shot. Certainly it is not if you want to watch if you want to smile. This film is unpredictable and intense. Some scenes are terribly intimidating, even after several views (because such a thing can really happen). This will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat for the entire journey. And after you see the end, if you are not deeply disturbed, you should really check the pulse. <br /> <br /> Operation was phenomenal. Marcy, with his rather extreme tournament case, shifts from a peculiarly cute to a completely frightening, sometimes uncontrollable, look like an undead. Seth was also great. The film's focus will certainly not fall on him as much as Marcy, although he happens to be the fastest flourishing character. <br /> <br /> This is a classic love story with some unusual twists, and it is also my favorite love story next to "True Romance". There are two bad reviews here, but one of the people who gave such an overview did not get their facts straight and admitted that they didn't see the whole movie, while the other was looking for Hollywood excitement without deep stars (and maybe the obvious lowness of the plagued plot that the ultimate goal revolves around stealing a black bobbin head from a toy item). The thing is that this movie is not for those who want to see something "normal" or "light". It's confused and indie as possible, and won't let you go up to the tough top.
