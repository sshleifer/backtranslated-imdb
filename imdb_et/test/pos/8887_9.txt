We live in sad times today, where it seems that every comedy and TV show is painfully uneven and caused by cheap, raw or bad humor. Most people do not know what to really laugh in comedy, and these people desperately need a "Throw Mom's Train." I say with little hesitation that this is one of the funniest movies I've seen, from start to finish. Comedy is so unpredictable and just twisted to laugh at us many times. Don't try to kill yourself. The plot is not serious enough to take care of us or worry about what happens. The story includes a young man (Danny DeVito) who wants to get rid of his annoying mother (Anne Ramsey, a candidate for the role of Oscar, which I think was absolutely flawless) and does this by Billy Cryston's wife killing whom Crystal wanted to steal her novel. I don't wanna ruin this movie and the gags, but I can tell you you have to laugh at this movie. Fast paced and true treatment for comedy students and the type of movie you can't see today. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 Off ****
