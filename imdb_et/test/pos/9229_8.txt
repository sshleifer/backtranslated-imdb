I wasn't even born when this series appeared in the US. It took about one decade before the British television networks held it. <br /> <br /> In fact, I was happy to see the first episode where Lone Ranger was one of the pigs who got killed and killed. TLR was the only survivor. Although he was badly wounded, he saved a tranquil India called Tonto. I believe he was wearing a mask to hide his true identity from fear. Instead, he made himself more recognizable. Dunno, when he wore it in his sleep. <br /> <br /> It was a staple of Saturday's journey. William Subscribe to open-minded fan banners showed a dash on the TV that is still in hand. Although it quickly became a recurring, predictable hockey. Nobody ever forgot her. No one has ever shot a shot, no one has ever shot him. She was a bit too good and just too small in her dress for most children. But Poor Tonto got his aunt Sally. He had always slipped and tied and robbed and stuff. <br /> <br /> And what did he think of The Lone Ranger? "King Savvy" was a general consensus where I lived. It seems that "great knowledge" speaks the Indian language. But it sounds like something other than Mr Silverheels's lack of speech. "Kemosabe"; what the hell is that? <br /> <br /> Later, the less well traded duo named The Range Rider and Dick West finally won their voice. It showed Jock Mahoney, naked-faced, who was thoroughly grasping every episode and was less in camp, less in supers and more plausible. <br /> <br /> Still; even today, I can't hear William Tell's frankness without waiting for the claws and joyful Hi-Oh silver. <br /> <br /> Devine daftness.
