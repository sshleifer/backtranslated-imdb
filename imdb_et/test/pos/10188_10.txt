I'm not a fan of Disney at all, but I have a Orlando friend for a wedding. So my travel partner and I went to Disney for a few days. I haven't seen a good three-letter effect, well. So I usually try to keep these presentations away. The 3-D effect was so good. I'm a 38-year-old grown man and even I wanted to try and touch. It's good! Advice word. Finally, look at the back of the theater on the wall. Put it this way ... the first time I saw it, the effect doesn't work. So I told my friend ... "It would have been nice if ...." My friend said, "That's exactly what happens. It doesn't work for some reason." This is an awesome show. You don't have to be disappointed!
