Much of the US The movie can be summarized in its title. It draws parallels between the attitudes of the country before the war and the sort of Hollywood-like loyalty that respects things that should not be glorified. I'm not sure if I agree with the filmmaker's recent events (though I really can't always tell where he stands), but I admire this unusual and artistic way to get that point. The soundtracks of speech, radio interviews, poetry and the like play such a big role here as the visual. In most cases the story with visual examples is accompanied by their sound elements. I am such a radio collector so it was satisfactory to hear how the radio was integrated into movie speed. In fact, most of the dialogue takes place over the story, not the characters talking to each other. This does not mean that there are no "characters" (real people), but excluding the main character of "Jim" (some "dropping out of the 60s with an insecure mental state") others come and go quite quickly, some of them making a very powerful impression, especially the guru-like taxi driver. who seems to be the voice of wisdom himself. When he leaves the spontaneous prayer song while traveling to Jim subway, this is a very powerful moment. The DVD's "Quote is Clear" quoted from President Bush's speech paved the way for our invasion of Iraq. Afterwards, hearing that talking about the film at the climatic moment brought home how we live at a historically charged moment that we always remember.
