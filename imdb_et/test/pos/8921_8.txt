OK, so some plot points can be a bit obvious, but any interesting idea that works close to the end. The actor is sure, especially Lachy Hulme, who plays one of the central signs of this band. He definitely has a screen and it is interesting to watch. This is a low budget feeling that works like a thriller / horror genre. The film does not try to take itself seriously, which adds to the general charm. The character of Phili (Dave Serrafin) must be most visible on the screen of Rupert Puppkin / Comedy King. It is worth adding to the DVD on the weekend.
