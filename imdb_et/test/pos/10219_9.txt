This movie is mastered by Clive barker, he knows how to create interaction between the audience and characters. I think there is a lack of order for this, Barker should have devoted himself to this movie, instead of making Lord of Dull Illusions, this is one that I think was a real garbage. But I also think that thanks to this and thanks to this, NBreed has become a dark cult class of horror films.
