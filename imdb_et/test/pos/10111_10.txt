The recent history of the Hollywood remodels of the Oriental spirit / horror films has been terrible. This film inevitably carries the same fate, so get a copy of e-bay or similar. <br /> <br /> It's well photographed and the sound is great. It is recommended to look at a good screen with a good 5.1 or DTS-enabled audio system. Obviously this is with subtitles, so if it puts you down, I won't worry about it. Copying rarely works and just doesn't do it here. <br /> <br /> It is also really frightening, with great performances from a stage that doesn't know western audiences. Especially I would like to point out the character of a stranger who was completely brilliant. Finally, you want to see it again when you can cope. The plot is relentless and does not offer pleasant moments of liberation. <br /> <br /> If I have a little criticism, some scenes may have a detectable effect on the Japanese version of the Ring. However, for years we have accepted straight copies of other people's ideas of Western film, and so my idea is limited, which did not stop me from giving it 10/10. I believe that most of the fans of this genre will become a huge "joy" of this movie, which I will fall into for one hope.
