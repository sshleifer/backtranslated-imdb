LACKAWANNA BLUES is a fine show by Ruben Santiago-Hudson and an even finer film, as the author adapted her life story to the screen. This brilliant film lights up on the screen with its rich colors, fine music, brilliant editing, a superb direction with George C. Wolfe and cast so stunning that they make self-view compulsory! Yes, it's just that good. <br /> <br /> The story is based on the life of the author as a "Junior" (Marcus Carl Franklin), who was raised spiritually by the empathic Rachel "Nanny" Crosby (S Epatha Merkerson), who devoted her life to supporting her filiation by transporting them in the south , in mental hospitals and streets in Lackawanna, New York. The boy recalls all the lessons he has learned from the inhabitants of the house - the odd-hearted pain - and the disintegration of his racially mixed family, saved by Nanny. Numerous characters at home are too big to sketch them, but they are represented by some of the best entrepreneurs: Terrence Howard, Rosie Perez, Mos Def, beautiful Carmen Ejogo, Louis Gossett Jr, Jeffrey Wright, Ernie Hudson, Charlayne Woodward, Jimmy Smits, Patricia Wettig, Macy Gray, Liev Schreiber, Kathleen Chalfant, Lou Myers, Hill Harper - the list goes on and on. <br /> <br /> During the film, we introduce the cruelty of racism, the history of desegregation, the dynamics of drug abuse and violence, the infectious joy of the cultural contribution of African-American music, and the courage of a fine woman who struggled with all the difficulties that the world can keep away from. the dignity of the people he contacted. Epatha Merkerson has been fully embedded in this group, a role she looks like in a chaos house world. He offers the most amazing productions of recent years, and when this movie was released in theaters instead of HBO, he would undoubtedly be an Oscar to place his Golden Globe award. <br /> <br /> The whole cast is extraordinary, and Wolfe is acting as an actor and a master like a captain like a jazz-hit, with each character and Junior sticking up small moments of conversation with the flashes of the scene with the matrix. local club dance events that go beyond the incredible blues, jazz, dance and joy. The production team has placed this small miracle in the picture with extreme caution and never missed the story. Very recommended, almost mandatory viewing! Grady Harp
