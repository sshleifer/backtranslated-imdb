I also saw the last stop at the Moving Pictures Film Festival Prince George. I have to admit that the only reason I saw it is that I am a big fan of Callum Keith Rennie. And he didn't let me down. He gave a fairly unreasonable result and gave the whole comic relief. <br /> <br /> The film itself is a common "many bad people who are trapped in the snowstorms", but it had a couple of twists that thought of me. The testimonials were strong and the whole casting took place quite well. The only problem I had with the pain was Rose McGowan. He was so cold throughout the film that we didn't get any idea of ​​his character or motivation. Apart from him and some minor continuity problems, it was a well-written and well-functioning thriller.
