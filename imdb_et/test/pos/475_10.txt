It's hard to say how wonderful it was. From time to time, you see a movie that just looks like you. "You're alone" is this movie (for me). The film is constantly in my head and heart. I repeat the scenes mentally every day and analyze them and re-emerge as I see it for the first time. <br /> <br /> Nothing like a movie. Amazing soundtrack !!! The end was perfect. Very emotionally mixing !!! It was convincing and riveting. <br /> <br /> I adored Jessica Bohl and her performance was the greatest I've ever seen. I admired the strength of Brittany (a strong woman). <br /> <br /> The label line is "When your darker moments live". We never know what we can do. Everyone says I would never do it if we really have no idea what we would do in the situation. We are very capable of doing something and this film goes straight to this topic. Movie honesty can be my absolute favorite. <br /> <br /> Thank you to Gorman Becherd for the perfect art !!!!
