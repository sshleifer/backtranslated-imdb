Just reading the comments from this wonderful BBC mini-series reminded me of how much I enjoyed it when it was first released several years ago. At this time I remember waiting for the next installment and I fell in love with John Bowe and Janet McTeer, two talented actors we don't see on TV or cinema these days. <br /> <br /> I've been trying to successfully get a number of BBC fantastic past insights, including Jane Eyre's 1973 version and Anne Green Green's 1972 version, all the wonderful timeless classic stories that unfortunately BBC- l does not seem to have the intention to distribute a video or DVD. If someone else learns, I'd like to hear from them. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, we need to remind ourselves of the likes they had.
