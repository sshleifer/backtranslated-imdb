For the first time I saw it in my friends' house. It reached the fluke by their parents; some video shop / bicycle repair shop !! went bankrupt and treats as it was to grab. We saw it twice in a row and almost wet pants are just how hard we laughed. <br /> <br /> I've seen historical documents like the Ninja mission and the 9th Space Plan, and they are still in good places. Almost 15 years after the first contact, it is considered to be the best cult film ever (in my circles); I have shown it to all my friends ... Now we have a tradition to search for movies in the same category: non-rateable. <br /> <br /> It cannot be explained or reviewed in any way in the usual way, because each scene, every shot, every step, contains at least one mistake in editing, dialoug, driving, etc. For every cult movie, this is the ultimate award, the precious metal of all the gems. <br /> <br /> Mode: It can't be rated for a ship because it would be an insult to even birthdays and wedding homemade videos. <br /> <br /> As for pure amusement, it's a more fun movie I've ever seen; more fun than any comedy ever or ever. Anything less than 10/10 should be considered offensive to a good sense of hum.
