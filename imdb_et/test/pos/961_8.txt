Who said it should be credible? Make your preference and turn off your dose before watching a movie. Enjoy much more experience. You'll find yourself forgiving some of the film's more extreme plot settings and just accepting what it is - a great family movie. I appreciated not having to worry about "questionable elements" in the children's film once. It's worth the ticket price for me. And you can maintain your health without being obvious - older chidlren enjoy this movie. Good humor to keep adults interested. Very good movie.
