At the same time, John Russell played the ranchman Nathan Burdette, trying to release his good brother Claude Akins, who was from Sheriff John Wayne of Rio Bravo, who worked in the second half of the TV Act. These years were probably the highest point of Russell's career, his most remarkable role in the screen and his most famous television role, Marshal Dan Troop of Laramie Lawman. <br /> <br /> Russell kept Laramie's laws and order in the same way as James Arness did in Dodge City's Gunsmoke. Unlike Gunsmoke, Laramie has never developed all the smaller characters that gave you Dodge City lessons at that time. Instead, he focused on Russell, who took care of the business and learned his business for his enthusiastic young deputy Peter Brown. <br /> <br /> Brown played Johnny McKay, who was the most respectful young man, constantly keeping his boss, Mr. Troop. He was quite comfortable with the striker, but was prone to being impulsive. The good thing about Marshal Troop was about. <br /> <br /> The second line was Kitty Russell of Laramie, Lily, played by Peggie Castle. This is where Lawman most remembered Gunsmoke. Russell and City had an unspoken understanding that even the smallest children would not have missed. And I wasn't the smallest child when Lawman ran for the first time. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Peggie's castle evolved after the abuse of Lawman after the abuse. I remember that in the first half of the seventies he was a small expert. She was one beautiful woman. <br /> <br /> The lawyer was not Western in the Western Golden Age of adult television. It was one of the best.
