Another great incidence of Tom Wilkinson is "Private Lies", a 2005 film starring Emily Watson, Linda Bassett and Rupert Everett. Director Julian Fellowes, this is a story about a married couple, James and Ann Manning, where his wife (Wilkinson) believes he and his wife (Watson) are happy together. The evening that is next to their house, when they are, brings the police around. It has hit and ran, who killed the husband of his servant Maggie Bassett. James becomes suspicious of his neighbor Bill Bule (Everett) when he sees no damage to his car. He's standing in front of Bule, who admits he did it and lets go to the police the next day. When James arrives home, Ann is angry that he is making such a big deal and says he's driving a car. Of course, James is not so eager to rush to the police. She suggests they call Bule and tell her about her decision. "Oh, f___ Bule," says James. "Well, that's just that," says Ann. "I'm f___ing Bule." James's destruction is precisely the beginning of this well-designed drama. Without giving up a plot, this is a good example of how gender change changes the story. An example of what I mean: Susan Smith drives her car to the lake and her children are drowning. She gets a life in prison. What if the father had done it? At work. You would be surprised how often the result would be different. The same is true here - if James had a thing and did the following, the audience might feel the story differently. If Ann was in James, it would be broken. As it is, Tom Wilkinson is heartbreaking when a man intercepted by a woman he adores, and Emily Watson doing a beautiful job like Ann, who, when she releases her lies - her involvement in an accident and a happy marriage - knows what she needs to do. Rupert Everett as Bule is very effective - desolate, greatness and finally needs. Everyone here is communicating with each other with civilization and nobody is good or bad. <br /> <br /> There are separate lies - James, that his marriage is happy, Ann is listed above - and there is one unifying lie - an accident for which all parties are silent. Anna's enough for Maggie to know. Finally, everyone has to deal with separate lies that are covered individually. <br /> <br /> Great movie.
