Chan is in New York and is trying to sabotage the new aircraft design. <br /> <br /> War was more than a year after America arrived, but the Second World War was already raging around the world and so it was all because most people thought war was coming. There is no mention of war here, but the fact that the film deals with at least the production of aircraft suggests this. The mystery itself is pretty good, that is, the concept of airborne cabotage fits well into a couple of quite tense moments. To be sure, we're talking about Charlie Chan so we can be sure he's alive to fight the other day, but there was no guarantee he would be in the situation, not whether someone would survive around him. <br /> <br /> I like this movie very much. It's not one of the nests and far from the worst. It's one of the really rare things, really enjoyable. Definitely worth a look or a month.
