Okay, I'm not sure if this is considered a spoiler, so I just ticked the box to save the trouble. <br /> <br /> I've noticed that opinions about this movie seem fair. Personally, I loved it, although I have to say that I think some of the comets were there to come. (Peter Kay?) Personally, I am just grateful for not showing Edward, Tubbs and Papa Lazarou and that they chose the 3 best characters in the series to see the film, especially Sir Goeff Tipp, who is probably the most fun. in fact, it's less concise about a rather funny blog-like thing, but what the hell, the movie was fantastic, and I think it's all hopeful.
