Starring Kelsey Grammar, Rob Schneider, Lauren Holly, Rip Torn This movie is a classic family favorite. At least for most of my family members. One of us rolls our eyes to the reputation of this film and thinks, "What a stupid movie." I'm not that person. I find this movie very fun. I looked at it again last night with someone who has never seen it, and I laughed as hard as I first saw it. It's still very funny for me. <br /> <br /> Navy Captain Tom Dodge (Grammar) is a navy black sheep. He is a boy who plays golf on a sub-subtitle by hitting the ball on the golf course as they drive. He is the guy who drunk, goes out and wakes up with his dong on a dagger and tattoo. He's not a guy everyone wants to sub-command. <br /> <br /> But Dodge is at the end of the line. He puts the applications under his command several times, and if he does not receive a sublime this time, he has gone to work at the table, which means that it is a naval life. Admiralty decides to give her a boat, but they don't give her a new nuclear facility. They give him diesel fuel, the old world war. His mission is to clean him up and take him out of the Atlantic War game. <br /> <br /> Dodge is obviously a little disappointed that he would have been given such a dirty boat as he was so hard to get until he was, so he goes and talks about it to Admiral Winslow (Torn). Winslow explains the purpose of the war game. Diesel is still sold there in the real world, in countries like Iran, Iraq and Libya. Winslow wants to know what would happen if any of the diesel sub-candidates came to countries and tried to take over the nuclear warheads. Do they do it? Dodge and most Admiralty do not think so, but Winslow definitely wants to know, so why has he developed this war game. The mission of Dodge is to take the Stingray into the sea, then try to avoid the US Naval Force and incite American naval bases. Naturally simulated battle. <br /> <br /> So it's about as deep as the plot. This is not a plot-based film. It's a stupid movie that's just a big gag. It makes you fun and you don't have to take it seriously. If you are looking for a laugh on Friday evening, please check it out. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: 3 out of four (worth watching)
