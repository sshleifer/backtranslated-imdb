This movie is my English class lesson, but the depth and meaning have amazed me. Because we look closely at all the facts and signs of this film, its and its interesting story of love, hatred, war and prejudice. Well recommended! <br /> <br /> Story: A girl named Jewis Patty Bergen meets a escaped war prisoner, then hides her playhouse in her huge gardens and when they get to know each other, they see the qualities of others and they love each other's love. Patty's father despises him and treats him like dirt. Anton (prisoner of war) strikes his cover almost to defend, but patty can do it before anyone sees it.
