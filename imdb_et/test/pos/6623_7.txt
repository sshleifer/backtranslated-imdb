Anyone wishing to learn more about roller skating development should find sufficient research material at Dogtown and Z-Boys. It must not be confused with the Lords of Dogtown, this unfortunate attempt by Hollywood to get into the success of the original Dogtown revival. The document is headed by Stacey Peralta, former Z-Boys himself, as well as a professional skater and handyman behind the 80's Broom Brigade, and wrote with skateboarding photographer Craig Stecyk how surfing children from the middle streets of South California (known as Dogtown) who formed Z-Boys Skateboarding crew (actually there was one girl - Peggy Oki), changed the skateboard. The film includes interviews with almost all of the Z-Boys (Chris Cahill's location is unknown), the most noticeable is the bad ass Tony Alva and the youngest, Jay Adams, who have overcome the rest with the talented (with Perlata). . There are interviews with the founders of the team (and Dogtown), surfboard designer Jeff Ho, Skip Engbloom and Craig Stecyk. There are also interviews with people such as Tony Hawk (probably), Ian McKaye (Fugazi) and Henry Rollins, who were young children in the 1970s when Dogtown influenced roller skating (skateboarding was a whole other context documentary last year). <br /> <br /> It really does not only show who the Dogtown team was and how they formed, but why their style did not just change skateboarding (skating in the pool became popular and hence possible for skating) but also facilitated sports (though not in the extreme business because it is today) because more than just a dirty fad had been before those kids surfing the waves early in the morning needed time to spend their time and finally rollerblading. The days of Russ Howell and Alan Gelfand were a long time when Dogtown, at least through its skate team, paved the way for a new skater. As Dogtown got all the attention, they managed to skate to the next step. <br /> <br /> This is a great documentary as it has been put together, even though Stacey Peralta always knew how to do it even when she produced Bones Brigade mini films / skate demos like "Ban This" and "Animal Chin search ". The film, spoken by Sean Penni, comes with a fantastic soundtrack that contains a lot of terrifying archive materials and many interviews to give you the real feeling of being a Z-Boys and how they made their roller-skating mark.
