I didn't know much about this movie that my roommate pulled me into. I was so pleasantly surprised! The plot really drew my attention and kept it and the characters are well drawn and realistic. The scenario is very clever and funny, and the cast is doing great things. And the best part is that it managed to be entertaining without any explicit sex or violence! If this movie comes from somewhere in your area, this little movie should look, it's worth it!
