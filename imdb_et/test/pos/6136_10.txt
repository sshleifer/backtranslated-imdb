I've been looking for this mini-series for a very long time. I saw this movie when I lived in Russia many years ago. I'm curious if someone with a copy of this movie sends a copy of it. I'm ready to cover all costs and pay for additional cards or DVDs. This is one of the best TV series I've ever watched. I recommend it to anyone who is somewhat interested in Israel's history and world history after World War II. I also try to find a book (I've heard it is even better than a movie), but the new cost is about $ 50 for Amazon and I've never bought a used copy. my email address is yurets777@hotmail.com Thank you very much for your help.
