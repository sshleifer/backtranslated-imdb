We enjoy a movie like "Celebrity" because we imagine we are ourselves - music, dance and drama students who enjoy our self-expression. This film had a sense of humor, entertainment, and it must be an inspiration for young people to play in the performing arts. Bravo "celebrity". Be sure to pay 8 out of 10! <br /> <br /> Chris
