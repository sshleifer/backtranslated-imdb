Young John Garfield excelled in 1939 "They made me a criminal case". Celebrating the ring victory in a clogged dressing room, boxer Johnnie Bradfield feels the love of his mother, the fear and the rejection of a clean lifestyle for fans, including policemen, who eat it. Later in the evening he plowed his bimbo gal, but his manager shared the evening. And whiskey. <br /> <br /> The problem arises when the other couple arrives. The man is a newspaper reporter and he says he is publishing Bradfield's fake on the front page. The driver kills the reporter and he and the floating leave. Later a murder was discovered, police officers are now looking at a unique boxer whose car is driven by a new girlfriend, Johnny, now. The police chase ends with a hot car accident. The manager and the girl are dead and recognizable. Johnny discovers he should be a killer. But he's also supposed to be dead. Asking a lawyer, he trusts a counselor with a key bank deposit box with his only savings of $ 10,000. Later, Johnny gives $ 250 and tells him that his reward for his professional counseling is to get out of the city, fast and far away. (I'd never take more than $ 5,000 from a client for such a pithy, short, and wise direction.) <br /> <br /> Johnny, now a freight train that jumps into a hobby, runs out comfortably on the Arizona beaches, where he has looked back on health Goldie West, Ann Sheridan, a beautiful actor whose career was on the rise. Taking Jack Dorney as his moniker, he loses his harsh edges when he loves Goldie. She becomes a mentor and prayer - Dead End Kids. Known screen characters for pre-war members. <br /> <br /> The opportunity to earn money arises when the show boxer looks like he can run several rounds with him. This is a natural temptation for Bradfield / Dorney, but there is a flight in the ointment. Who should show, but the department's laughing stock at New York Detective Monty Phelan? She has been morally committed to age, because at the beginning of her career there was a mistake that sent an innocent husband to Old Spark (we all make mistakes, isn't it?) Phelan admitted Bradfield's news of the photo and she is there to watch and fight. Claude Rains is a policeman who has for years been in the weaknesses and barbies of his co-officers. <br /> <br /> The following is predictable, but it works well. I hope this was the main feature when it appeared - it's too good to read "B" for a second on the tent. <br /> <br /> Busby Berkeley, known as a prominent choreographer, directed "They Made Me Criminal" and Max Steiner, one of Hollywood's most prolific composers of all time, wrote a nice but not extraordinary music for the film. <br /> <br /> Now the DVD is available from Alpha Video, filmed me back for $ 4.99 and gave me a real joy. I look at it again. <br /> <br /> 8/10
