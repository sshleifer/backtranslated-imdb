As a fan of Robocop, I always loved this movie. I saw it coming out for the first time, and finally I bought it from a Brazilian DVD, never published on a DVD. I like the film, but like everyone else in the world, everyone has their own opinion, love or hate. Whatever the film does, someone always says, "Why didn't they do it differently?" in other words, you can't like anyone. If you love Robocop, you love this movie. For me, it's so unique that it's not cheesy, or silly like much smaller budget movies. this movie always kept me interested. I see a couple of scenes that Robocop borrowed from here, but tell me which movies don't do that? many movies use other movies from other ideas and sometimes they are around. Fun movie!
