This movie is undoubtedly the best I've seen, and really shows what British talent can do. Its effect is extremely good, given that the film has taken place in the mid-18th century, and all the dreadful and disgusting dust of England has been caught very well at this time. The characters have been developed and refined, from MaCleane anti-whore to his development for road racing and show art "Gentleman Highwayman" is well in contradiction with Robert Carlyle, who is cynicism and glory that shows that you can love the thief and the criminal I quote: I got my with a little finger, more honor than any of your fat boys! "<br /> <br /> Not naturally referring to you! But it is arguably the most confusing and emotionally charged scene ever seen in the movie, but you just have to find it to find out it is enough to say it covers the rope around your neck. <br /> <br />
