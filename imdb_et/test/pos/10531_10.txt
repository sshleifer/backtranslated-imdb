This film is a remake of the resurrection of the famous Fritz Lang's masterpiece "M-murder". It is a well-made and entertaining key to talk about quite serious events and modern problems in Eurobes, but not just around the world. National intolerance is such great evil and very common today. So, the "wax children" or the known issue of distributing the US shows the question of hatred of Germany and Turkey in an amusing way. There is no doubt that it is good how big Weinsten brothers share it. And there's one more thing that I liked most about Lars von Trier's favorite actor in this Udo Kier, who shows that Bulgarian film director Ivan Nichev is playing this joy.
