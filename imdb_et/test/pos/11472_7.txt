You can't watch this movie for a lesson. It was the first thing I heard about Ma Barker's saga, but I can almost say that the facts were gone. And with a little bit of internet research I realized that I was, of course, right. I Barker sure that hell is not sexy, the woman whom the film represents, and apparently did not organize all the abduction plans, abductions and murders that her criminals did. <br /> <br /> Don't expect the brilliant criminal drama. Scripting and acting are sufficient, armed struggle is excessive and mostly unrealistic and there is a very ridiculous slowdown. Why did I give it to 7 out of 10? <br /> <br /> Because it was fucking fun. The fight is fun to watch, but there are some deeper issues between them. The film is intimidating the intimidation of the ego of alpha men, each with their own agenda. And I appreciate the minimal use of swearing during the period. Sets are great, reproducing a convincing 1930s era. <br /> <br /> So watch this movie as a cult film and take the excess bloody and mercilessly FBI man's cheese with extremely serious comments, who wants to take Barkers off at all costs. Other words, don't take it too seriously, just enjoy it. And if you like it, you'll love Serial Mom.
