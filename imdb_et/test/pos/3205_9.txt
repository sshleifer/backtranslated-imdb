I like this show. It has drama, romance and comedy that all rolls together. I'm 28 years old and I'm married to my mother, so I can find both Lorelei and Rory's experiences at exhibitions. Recently, I've mostly watched family channel repetitions so I'm not up to date on what's happening right now. I think women would like to show it more than men, but I know some men would enjoy it there! I like it for an hour and not half an hour because the hour seems to fly when I watch it! Give her a chance if you've never seen an exhibition! I think Lorelei and Luke are my favorite characters at my show, mainly because they are in contact with each other. How did you not see anything there (or take it long so I think I should say)? <br /> <br /> Happy viewing!
