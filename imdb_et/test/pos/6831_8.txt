A rather pleasant kidnapping capric in New Orleans, but its main downfall, in my opinion, is that it wraps too much political intrigue and double crossing, and not enough sexy young actors, vibrant colors, original cinematic style and biting humor. These aspects combine a refreshingly bold cinema that makes a whole bunch of recent things amazingly boring. We hope that SÃ©bastian Gutierrez will continue this elegance - he looks like a talent. The uneven bundle of small-time movies is embedded in the research partnership of Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman, whose humor of scenes is very necessary for making the film. The couple pulls their compulsory southern twitches as well as Yanks, and it is a pleasure to hear these two British movie stalwarts with each other in Lethal-Weapon-style flux ... just sorry the only scenes they have the chance to steal are just theirs. Anyway, a little less politics and authoritarianism (!), The movie would be almost perfect, so I'll give it a whole 8/10 and I hope some people will remember it a little better than the box office.
