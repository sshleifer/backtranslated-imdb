To the right, here we go, you've probably read from previous reviews of this movie that it's terrible, badly acted, to avoid at all costs. I think this is somehow true, it is fair to say that in this comment you cannot write a spoiler because there is no plot violation. However, the usual is terrible and completely fun and believe me that this movie is the last one. The action is so bad, the plot is not there and ends up being so puzzled that you laugh all the way. In this movie, there are scenes that take the comedy to a new level. Don't expect an Oscar winner, but believe me for the small price you pay for this disaster, it's worth every penny.
