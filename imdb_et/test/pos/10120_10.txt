I got home to see "Radio". I haven't seen such an inspiring story for a long time. My children are ages 8 and 5 and I would like to take them so that they would feel the message I did - you should try to find people the best and love them for who they are, not to treat their differences. Gooding, Jr and Ed Harris from Cuba both deserve the prizes of this film. I don't know why we don't get such movies more than the daily spam in theaters.
