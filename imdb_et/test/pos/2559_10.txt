Where do I start? Allow me to say that after watching all the peculiarities of the movie and the DVD, I watched my wife and the whole film with the director's comment. I can't remember ever having more than 7 minutes to comment on a movie. It's worth hearing. <br /> <br /> I'm not a southern boy, but I spent some time around Memphis and I know this area. This movie almost smells of lunch, it's so real. Samuel Jackson, one of my favorite actresses of all time, is great as emotionally bent Lazarus and Christina Ricci gives Rae, a lifetime performance, a woman who has been seriously wounded during her short life. I have always loved Mrs Ricci's work, but in this performance she gives 137% every second week. The prizes and small shapes are not enough to pay him for what he puts the audience in this movie. <br /> <br /> There are other places where you can read the nature of the story, so I just comment on the work. I heard Justin Timberlake before seeing BSM, but he had no idea what he looked like or even why he belonged. With my 60-year-old head in my head, I'm beyond my demographic target. After seeing the film, I know him. He can act! He gives a significant and incredible result as a county slut loving soulmate. <br /> <br /> Director is Memphis and shows respect for his home area. He is also a subtle story. <br /> <br /> ..... and I have to mention music. I love Blues and Black Snake Moan's soundtrack is a real party for the blues fan. <br /> <br /> I write less coherently than usual because my enthusiasm for this movie goes beyond the structure of my sentence. Watch this movie and I mean now.
