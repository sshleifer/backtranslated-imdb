Years ago, "Light of Light", Madonna broke into a truly amazing musical artistic level, and since then she has even crossed her own standards. This concert production with its hypnotic editing, amazing dance, hallucinative lighting effects, and trance-inducing procedures blows away all previous efforts. Madonna's obvious ambition - to achieve world peace through music and dance - may seem to some to be hasty or absurd to some. But hell, someone has to do it! Thanks to its strong talent for all the people involved in this production, the Confessions Tour Live from London is once again one of the top 10 artists working anywhere in the world on any medium.
