"Christmas in Connecticut" is a classic Christmas camera. Less known than some others - this is a delightful way to spend an evening on vacation. I look at it every year. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck is perfectly cast, Elizabeth Lane, a single career girl. The way before it was popular, Stanwyck embodies a growing girl alone. His NYC apartment and his friendly "uncle" restaurant player around the corner characterize the girl of one of the girls in the city. She can't eat yet, but she writes a home-made column for the magazine! <br /> <br /> Dennis Morgan is also superbly cast into our war hero, Jefferson Jones, who wants to meet amazing Elizabeth Lane. After being lost at sea, he wanted to spend the "real" home at Christmas. What creates an amazing and mad story that is evolving. It's fun from start to finish. We should also have uncle Felix!
