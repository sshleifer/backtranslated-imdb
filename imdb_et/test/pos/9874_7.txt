For some reason, I always enjoy movies that people hate when I really don't think they're so bad - and that's one of those movies. For this movie, I think it's too critical, I really don't have a movie at all. Actually, I think it's one of the best queues. "Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers" begins before the night of Halloween, where Michael is brutally murdering Jamie Lloyd (who was in the 5th "Man in Black" captive) after the birth of the child. We then introduce the Strode family, who now lives in an old Myers house (which seems to be changing in every film). Kara and her son Danny are the main characters with Tommy Doyle, an adult boy who lived over the original killing. They have to fight together to save Jamie's baby from the evil cult that takes care of Michael, while Michael himself is forced to kill an old Celtic ritual where he has to sacrifice a whole family in Haddonfield. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of the best queues in the series, in my opinion, and I do not understand all the booklets he has received. It was a nice varied, interesting plot (but sometimes confusing, I confess), some scary moments here and plenty of nails and a knife to attract you to all the gorehounde. Not all actors were particularly big, but it was convincing enough for me. Marianne Hagan is a leading lady and she is very happy. Paul Rudd plays adult Tommy Doyle and is also very talented and plays his part nicely. The rest of the supporting cast (besides the brilliant Donald Pleasance) is not much praise, but it wasn't too bad. I'm still not sure whether to explain why Michael kills was absolutely necessary, but ultimately it turned out to be good and I was not confused with how they all tied together. Ultimately, it was such a fear, but it could have been more. I have also seen the notorious "producer section" of this movie, its original paragraph, and I think it is better in some ways. In addition, it explains Thorn's curse that directs Michael and has some additional scenes that really helped the movie. It seemed more natural than finding that we were cut in the movie studio. I want Dimension to release this alternative movie because I think it's better. Opportunities that are still very thin. <br /> <br /> Generally "Halloween: The Michael Myers Curse" is a very good sequel and enjoys all the series fans. This movie is not the best of all horror films, but it is definitely worth renting if you want to see Michael doing his thing. Just don't wait for the shine and enjoy it. 7/10
