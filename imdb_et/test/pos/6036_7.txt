My first "Columbo". Rather I enjoyed it. The great format and character of Peter Falki is very good ... admirable, he can take his place next to Poirot, Miss Marple and also Marlowe and Rick Diamond. I see why this series has the following. As a professional musician, I have to say a few things. First of all, a conductor who produces only those pedestrian performances of the most basic examples of the repertoire (Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, Strauss Waltzes, Beethoven ...) never plans to own such a house or such a house. much less is called genius. And what the actor does is so bad that it is ridiculous. No orchestra takes him seriously. <br /> <br /> There are also a number of small things like practicing Eine Kleine Nachtmusik (why practice it when they played it on the TV? The musician of each orchestra would be able to play it in sleep mode ...). His instructions to the ensemble are completely absurd and when Columbo asks Blythe Danner what "quasi fantasy" means, he says it is Latin. It is an Italian language as well as most musical instructions. And finally, the two big music would not have the following IGA exchange: "Play something." "What should I play?" "Chopin". Music is their work and passion, they know it well. Something more specific will be asked and offered! <br /> <br /> I know. I should do more ...
