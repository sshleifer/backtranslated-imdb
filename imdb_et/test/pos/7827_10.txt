When I first saw the example that was advertised in Australian television at the end of the 90s, I ignored it, I thought it was just using Kevin Costner's "bodyguard" movie. But then I got an episode and I wish I had followed it from the start. The partnership between Sean Pertwee and Louise Lombard performed so well and the structure of each episode was extremely fun. It was not an overwhelmed TV show that could be said to have spent most of its energy to explode things so they could put the clip into commercial order to attract viewers and then at no other level. The exhibition rose in the lives of two main characters, and that is what made it interesting. The stories of each episode, well written with interesting characters, who were good actors. And of course there was a lot of action and intrigue that is always good. But what was great was that it had humor, and it flowed naturally from characters, it didn't seem to be settled. It was a British, but a good way, and if this exhibition was in America, it would no doubt be on DVD now. I don't know why British television companies don't want to release this sample on DVD. It was a great show and deserves a DVD.
