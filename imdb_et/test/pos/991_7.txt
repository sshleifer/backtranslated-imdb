Given that Dylan Thomas is an icon of modern Anglican poetry, I waited for a film that would be prone to the subject's hagiography. On the contrary, the poet is sexually irresponsible, drunk, bad father, lier and hypocritical, and perhaps coward. Of course, one could argue that all these things have the advantage of being an artist and especially a poet, because one purpose of art is to lower the standards of conventional morality, but it does not mean that a positive role model could cut such a set of personality traits. In no way did I find the title of Captain Cillic's second male hero more pleasing in nature. The two female roles were played by actors Knigtley and Miller, and they were truly charming, especially the first ones to make London-inspired songs bombarded during World War II. Another good idea is that sexual jealousy is playing even in a relatively progressive milieu that thinks that old old conventions are easily overcome. The blitz atmosphere was also convincing, as well as the striking prospects of experienced people as opposed to those who theoretically talk about its possible political outcomes. I think such a movie would recommend.
