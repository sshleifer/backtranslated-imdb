First I watched "They died of boots from there," about 1970, and although it has been for many years, this film and its impression has remained. The cast was good and great and the leading man was truly heroic. I knew the smartest and only real position to enjoy this movie as exciting entertainment and then some. I felt like I even feel that the silver screen as such does not offer a real image of anything to mention, but not the life of George Armstrong Custer, but the director Raoul Walsh was supposed to contribute to the real value represented by this film when I watched a half-documentary with other big directors like Vincent Mennell, where these central figures talked about their achievements with valuable comments that look at the Hollywood mood. That's what I find interesting and when it all became terribly interesting and very enjoyable. silver screen oblates and its story telling you that some of the enjoyment has disappeared and maybe you would find it true here too. Custer was a Grade 34 graduate in the class ... 34. Much has been done on Custer's last classification, but of the 68 cadets who entered the Military Academy in 1857, half of them had already finished or graduated on 24 June 1861. The film recommends the different instructors determine if the soldier is in command and then they come to George Armstrong Custer and there is a definite exchange between the two parties, and here is where Sargeant's Duty says even in a low tone even suggest that it be random "His squadron follows him Hell, "Your attention to Sargeant, tells Tape. When Iam didn't make a mistake when Flynn appeared on the first battlefield, he admitted that Custer was not immediately seeing action and he immediately worked on a reliable affirmation, not only for Sheridan, but also for Hancocks only until Potomac's army, General George McClellan. There is some truth that the attribution of the Custers battlefield hero is inconsistent, "the young Custer prompted him to lead and bravely broke into the Confederates. As a single soldier surrounded by rebels, Custer's courage was hoping for. He received several enemy soldiers, including the rebel captain , which he personally struck at the Battle of the First Confederacy of the Potomac Army, a remarkable act of courage as a promise officer of the great battlefield. ‚ÄùRobert L.Bateman armchair General, story and truth, like George Armstrong Custer, is a good story Hollywood entertainment, or even great entertainment, but for any reason that could all be said, the change was for d entertaining purposes. a few meters from where George Custer died, they were brothers and Tom Custer thanked s Day is distinguished by a very small group, maybe only 3 people who have been awarded a dual military career career. A list of arts that the film shows Custers really was an active young official. He was not with the forces of the Union in Chancellorsville and on this issue in Fredericksburg, but he was with them in the battle of Antietam, and at that time he was generally the captain of General McClellan, but it wasn't so long soon McClellan changed because of the historical fact that Potomac The army had the tools and information (discovered around some cigars), General Lee's plan to share his forces. Having been able to operate for about 17 hours. It can be assumed that the war may have passed and there it happened, but when McClellan did not act President Lincoln replaced him permanently and the promotion lost as a result. The biggest winnings are actually won in Gettysburg, Pa.Hi, who captured the Gettysburg cemetery branch in the summer of 1863, Jeb Stuart Led could have captured the cavalry by about 6,000 rebels, but only with the power of 2300. I think Custer's Gettysburg heroes deserve some discussion. In the film, there was speculation that Custer's appointment was blurry, well you think again, because not only Custer had men in his corner, he filed a petition with the Michigan governor, who was a relatively new reason for the Union and where the regiments of the cavalry are preparing. Although Custer was seriously warned of such a chananan when he showed that he was not random, as you should believe. The truth has been that Custer's protection in Gettysburg forbade Jeb Stuart's lunch behind the connoisseurs in the stores and defended this side alive. took place and was timed to coincide with Picketts Charge in order to achieve the highest probability of success. It was a critical victory and Custer was his brave and best. His men followed him in hell and lived to talk about it.
