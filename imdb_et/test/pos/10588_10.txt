The film was fantastic. If your Bams' cky videos, jackass or his exhibition Viva la Bam, you can't help but like it. I have some friends who are not fans who enjoyed it, and others who thought it wasn't that big. Those who didn't like it were mostly female friends, they didn't really think of some raw humor that personally thought the movie was so funny. I'm pretty sure the whole movie was filmed in Bams' hometown, which contains a lot of its regular places to visit. The pain consists of all his friends and acquaintances, as well as some great names of skateboarders. The soundtrack is phenomenal, with HIM music. I think Haggard has it all. Big plot, characters you never see. Lots of humor with excellent music and cast that was dedicated to the project.
