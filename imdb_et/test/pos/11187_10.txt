A large group of businessmen have to build a building to build a huge complex, but they can't remove the tenants. Tenants and businessmen who have been in contact with employees until the movie ends with one more fun fight! A man who has ginger hair who goes "eeeeehhhh" every time he throws a blow and another guy wearing a knife in his mouth instead of fighting, just to beat the camera, makes it a great watch if you want laugh rather than movies.
