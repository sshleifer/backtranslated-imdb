So, Madonna is not Meryl Streep. However, it is one of his first films and comedy about it. Give her a break! Of course, the film is at best mediocre, and compared to its former colleague Katherine Hepburn, Baby Up Up Baby. Because what it is, although it is (a fluffy piece), is quite fun to watch. I have not yet heard anyone who accuses Madonna of acting, evidence or even adjectives, except "terrible", "bad" or other such vague descriptive words. If you want to see bad behavior or justify the argument that singers should sing, how does Whitney Houston? He has had the most outstanding commercial success in history and could not get out of his challenge. The American public obviously cannot distinguish between the reliable performance of a film and a strong power. I think Madonna has always been at least credible in her films. Real people. Madonna-bashing is 90's.
