One of the biggest crimes committed against Sci-fi was the cancellation of Farscape. One of the most well-written, well-functioning and overall best exhibitions that has ever shown an air change, set new standards for Sci-fi television. If the flagship of the Sci-Fi channel, the highest-rated, critically dispersed exhibition, is unexplained, why Buffy, Tremors: Series and even StarGate: SG-1 as long as they have. Yes, even Buffy. But I'll save Buffy bashing one more time. The Sci-Fi channel was poorly processed by Farscape, constantly riding around, rarities rarely shown, and never advertised. But when the show is canceled, all those involved in making the show will want to show back (even Henson Company CEO Brian Henson). There is also an extensive fan-based movement to show back. In general, things look far from dark and hopefully fans will get their season 5.
