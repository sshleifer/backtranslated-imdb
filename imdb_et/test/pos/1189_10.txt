Thank God for this movie. This is a talent document that seems to be more unique and rarer retroactively three decades later. <br /> <br /> Music is just extraordinary, packed with so many talents of writing, performance, organization and production that it is totally infectious. Lyrics and vocal arrangements are incredible. The performances of discounted talents such as Nell Carter and Ren Woods raise my spirit every time I listen to them. Although the film may be different from the flattened version, I prefer a disc in a cast album that I find really grateful and underdeveloped. It is filled and expanded here into dynamic pieces that cannot be produced during the production. <br /> <br /> But music is not the only thing that is extraordinary about this movie. In fact, the collision of almost hyperrealistic dialogue scenes (reminds me of Altman movies) with surprising musical and dance numbers. The talent of this film - leadership, writing, photography, editing, music, choreography, casting, acting, costume, artistic direction - is perfect for one of the best-seen music films. <br /> <br /> I think it's amazing how much we know about "hair" characters on very little information or plot. They are not cartoons but realistic and very human people. We see a little glimpse of where they come from, but the portrait fills the vignettes that draw marks on the surface through acting, directing and editing. Under Berger's and Hud's mission, there is the current theme that color their characters, revealing their reckless macho-hippie ideology. The scene of Berger's home life shows important details of his psychology, and a brief glimpse of Claude's home tells us, through his background, through a simple, realistic and true relationship between Claude and (probably) his father. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. It mixes with the sixties ideas very well with the seventies (one of them must not forget the Treat Williams hair extensions ...). This is a document that shows how much was in the late seventies, contrary to the usual wisdom, that everything had a bad taste ever since. Claude's beige knitted tie was in 1979. The hot trend of the year, the singers and dancers' hair and garments (especially the white white of the Central Park scene) interrupt the decades in a way that refers to the timelessness of musical themes. These elements are incorporated into Twyla Tharpe's exceptionally top-notch choreography in a way that enhances both art. <br /> <br /> "Hair" is not a movie that rewards cynicism. If you expect this, your artists are likely to stick with your rules. For me, it opened my eyes and ears and the spirit of an understandable and passionate music story about war, friendship, and family that goes beyond that time and is still meaningful and relevant.
