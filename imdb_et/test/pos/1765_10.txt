In this short 34-second Thomas Edison-made short, we see Annabelle Moore, who performs the Loie Fuller choreographed "Serpentine Dance" in two different fantastic, flowing outfits. <br /> <br /> Moore was one of the biggest stars in the late Victorian era. He had appeared in a number of Edison Company shorts, including one of the first Kinetoscope films in London in 1894. <br /> <br /> Loie Fuller had actually patented the Serpentine dance, which Moore here dresses (as well as whole frames) that is often tinted on the film, presenting one quiet era from one of the most common symbolic devices. It was claimed that Moore's films were popular enough to be often redesigned (including refilming). The version now available may be a later version / remake. Moore became even more popular when it was announced that a restaurant in New York would appear naked. Later, in 1907, he went to Ziegfeld Folliid's "Gibson Bathing Girl". He appeared there until 1912. <br /> <br /> Short is remarkable in shaping this movement, which, especially in the "second half", becomes almost abstract. This is somewhat reminiscent of Morris Louis's painting, although it is almost 60 years before Louis's work. <br /> <br /> You should be able to find this on a DVD for a short time on the anthologies of many earlier films.
