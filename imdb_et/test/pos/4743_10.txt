Things that are only now "news" were taken in this shocking documentary. I'm afraid if the investigation continues, the producers of this film are just right under the pot. <br /> <br /> Manufacturers show us Davidian, government agencies, researchers, all their mistakes and all of humanity. No reviewer can say that one could approach the effects of tracking and listening. Evidence - Congressional Certificate, 911 tapes, news, expert opinions, interviews, photos, and home videos - have been knit and talking about a disturbing story. Don't wait. Watch this movie and tell your friends.
