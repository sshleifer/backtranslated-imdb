In 1956, the Communist Party's 20th Congress and the Soviet Prime Minister Krushchev spoke of Stalin and Stalinist cleansing and gulag labor systems, revealing previously banned information, publicly proclaiming terrible new truths that opened the door to the new Soviet Union. Cinema was directed by Mikhail Kalatozov, once head of film production at Stalin. This film has a red army that has not won, in fact, they are surrounded by a retreat mode where many people die, including a hero, on a film placed after 06-02-41, Germany's invasion of Russia, when Germany introduced a plan to Barbarossa that represents the rapid victory and enslavement of the Slavs, which was almost successful, reaching 20 miles from Moscow, the destruction of the Red Army, the destruction of human beings, 15 20 million Russians died, or 20% of the total population. Historically, it was a moment of great trauma and suffering, a psychological shock to the Russian people, but the Red Army kept and extended the war for four more years until they finally won. During the war, Stalin used the genre of war to enhance obvious morals by introducing female heroes who were ultra-patriotic and strong and idealistic, suggesting that if women can be so successful and patriotic, Russia could expect at least as much of its soldiers. Stalin removed the proletariat's mass hero and replaced it with an individual, bold leader who was able to kill many enemies, with an obvious reference to Stalin, always depicted as a brave, wise and winning leader in the film. However, Kalatozov changed this image because COLDS were flying after Stalin's death, causing political melting and creating a global feeling by winning the Cannes Film Festival Palm D'Or, as well as the best director and best actress (Tatyana Samoilova) for the first time after Eisenstein's IVAN THE TERRIBLE is in the 40s, reviving Western Soviet cinema. <br /> <br /> This movie featured excellent, breathtaking and very mobile works by Sergei Uresevsky's extraordinary cinematographer and surveillance, wartime images, battlefields, Moscow and crowded streets that are extremely lively and real. Another bright scene is the leading heroine of Veronica, who has not heard of his lover Boris during the 4-year war so he is considered dead, but he still loves him, expressed in a scene where he runs a bridge with a train that follows behind him, a moment when the viewer wondered if he could throw himself in front of this train, instead he recorded a 3-year-old boy named Boris, who was to be hit by the car. The second scene includes Boris's death on the battlefield, who dies in a futile death, and his thoughts spin and swirls on a beautiful assembly of trees, sky, leaves, all spinning kaleidoscope of his own thoughts and dreams, including the imaginary wedding of Veronicaga. This movie contains a famous line: "You can dream at the end of the war." When the war is over, the soldiers return to the streets in a massive scene, Veronica learns that Boris died, everyone is happy and excited by the return of a soldier, but Veronica is desperate for making flowers for soldiers and strangers on the street in extreme generosity and self-sensitivity that reveal "the white and gray sky" cranes ". <br /> <br /> The film appeared in 1957 in Russia and, according to some reviews, "silence in the theater was deep, between the art of living and living life ... and tears opened doors. "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
