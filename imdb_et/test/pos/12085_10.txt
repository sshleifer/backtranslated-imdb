I saw this movie so long ago, but it remains in my memory as the saddest movie. I cried not. My mother never looks at this movie because it is almost painful to watch. Anyway, this story is not exactly complicated ... Ann Margaret is dying and must give her 10 (?) Last. As if it is not bad enough, it is during depression and it has to crush close siblings one by one. I think it was very sad for me because I am also a very close family and I can identify every child's pain with the departure of my mother and siblings. see this movie again because it was well done and the end is surprisingly somewhat happy (so at least we could smile and spit at the same time). It should come on television sometime so I can see it again.
