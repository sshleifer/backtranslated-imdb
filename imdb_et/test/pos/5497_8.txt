Clint Eastwood has been a great thriller since 1993. In fact, Wolfgang Peterson, Eastwood, with his absolute master, has reached his seats, just as he can. John Malkovich is also one of the most effective screen villains in my cinema history. As Demented Assassin. As Rene Russo Clint's Love Of Interest, I think Kirk Douglas said it best when he said referring to his career, "I still get old, and my leading ladies continue to get younger." This movie is a very effective thriller with enough plot twists and surprises to keep you going. Top-quality film.
