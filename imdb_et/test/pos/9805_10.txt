I rented a movie and liked it so much that I bought it. Elijah Wood (Mikey) and Joseph Mazello (Bobby) are two great boys. Their new stepfather physically abuses Bobby. Abuse is expected to be mostly invisible, and I have a lot of passion to help abused children. The film has a magical quality because the boys' imagination helps them find a way to deal with abuse. You have to try to understand the story from the child's point of view. I still mean the end. I watched the movie 3 or 4 times and every time I meant possible new meanings. I'm not sure what Richard Donner was going to think of me, but it's a great movie! Joseph Mazello and Elijah Wood will make your children hug.
