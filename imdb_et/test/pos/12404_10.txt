Recently I rented this video after the same writer saw "Final Ascent". I wasn't ready to get this movie intense. I found it involved from the beginning to the end and rooted in the teenagers so they could stop the crime. The end was disturbing to some of this indirect violence, but well done. I highly recommend this picture.
