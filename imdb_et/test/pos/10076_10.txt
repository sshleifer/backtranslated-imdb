I loved this movie. You can't buy it, rent it or find it ... but it's a keeper. <br /> <br /> Excellent chemistry between Braccho and Walken ... and Ferrari .... <br /> <br /> Terroric non stop action and reactions .... loved it. <br /> <br /> I've been watching my pirate copy maybe 6 times in the last decade ... every time you show it to someone who has never heard of <br /> <br /> Find this movie and watch it . <br /> <br /> With so many movies on television, over and over again - without this little movie, it is pointless and out of style. <br /> <br /> I didn't know it was made for the TV. .. my copy is 8 paths that I pirate years ago ... I hope it will last.
