Well, guys, here's the movie. it is not the best, but for all of you in the 80's it is a memorable memory of your childhood. Personally, I love this movie. I still love the rainbow solution and the caring pads. so, in my opinion, if you are not a kid now or you are a child who loved and / or loves the rainbow, this movie doesn't like it at all.
