This Sarah Waters novel TV adaptation was so lovingly made that I couldn't judge that word. Not from "Tambi Velvet" (also highly recommended) I've seen performers like Sally Hawkins and Elaine Cassidy. They acted with their souls, and that's what gets to the audience! Supporting actors were also well chosen, they made an excellent ensemble. <br /> <br /> For those who think the story is almost lesbian - no, that's just one part. Another main topic is the betrayal of a loving person. And there are some more surprising twists on the plot. So the film should be interesting for both straight people and boys like me.
