"Traffi", despite its title, is not really a drug. According to the best traditions of British television drama, Traffik analyzes and comforts his visible theme, which is not a mystical scourge, but a matrix or process that has identifiable social, economic and historical roots, causes and consequences. There is something almost scientific about how a film takes a set of four characters from a magnificent, distinct global and classic background - a sweetheart forced by the poverty and cynical government of the Pakistani underworld; English, former Olympic champion spouse in drug baron trial; the two shameful German policemen whose determination to blame the latter rise as much as the class anger as any confidence in the law; and Tory, a junior minister whose daughter at Cambridge has become addicted. <br /> <br /> 'Traffi' is unapologetically didactic - from Jack Lithgow's early scenes in Pakistan, exploring the government's success in eliminating drugs before imposing sanctions on British aid, we are bombarded with facts related to the problem. But these "facts" come from a number of sources - the departure of government representatives; left-wing lawyers with ideological and domestic interest in corruption; poor farmers who have to survive. The facts that usually map markers are obviously not enough - the more facts we get, the less verifiable the situation is. Only when Jack, the moral center of the film, the man who unites all the narrative subjects, actually deals with the heart of the darkness of drugs, he learns to discourage his hypocrisy (deplores the use of drugs, but refuses to use serious funds) to solve the problem and create conditions through various free market initiatives , where drug trafficking flourishes, as the heroes of the old Warner gangsters were actually American capitalists, so that traffickers are ideal by Thatcher and Reagan) that at least the reality of the problem can be recognized. <br /> <br /> As I say, "Traffi" is not a drug. Finally, when Jack finally recognizes that drugs are not really fired as a Tory Minister, this is not really a problem. It is a society that is being demolished by a woman who said that there is no longer such a thing (as proved by Jack's non-existent family life), systematically leaving most of the hope and happiness of people who are increasingly turning to drugs. <br /> <br /> What is most frightening about "Traffick" is the graphic, anesthetic depiction of drug abuse (whose technical detail ironically reflects more "legitimate", verbal factual information), rather than the vision of dystopia from Britain, which was left out of every joy , from the beauty or community, from the blind body of abandoned buildings and the breathtaking modernity, from the defeatist society, ready to smug its makers and barons to stratify their trade. <br /> <br /> This is not just a modern British story - it reflects the decline in the reduced empire of trade for illegal drug trafficking. Certainly, it is important that other places in the program are Germany and Pakistan, critical subjects of the empire. Here, the immorality of the old empire is home to the formerly enslaved victims, the bodies abused by their mastery, returning to the Imperial Center to London, the seeds of its retreat in its own body, which reflects the fear of all those who were late in the 19th century Gothic novels. <br /> <br /> "Traffi" is one of the greatest achievements of British television and is, in many ways, a later Hollywood remake. The political focus is clearly sharper - Jack's fall is much more effective than Wakefield, because he, both government policy and bad father, is a big part of the problem, while America's only real political mistake is satisfaction. In almost all cases, characterization is more rigorous and much more plausible (compare Lindsay Duncan with sharp Helen, who has already experienced experience and failure, and his obvious superficial response). Unlike the suspicious "Traffic" racial down stream (making Mexico dark and other; the ultimate WASP horror when sex is black), Pakistan's portrait is rich, tragically drawn. drug protection that is passionate about violent violence scenes. Integrating the entire public and private sector is an expert. Visually, the film is remarkably inventive without ever being glowing or "kinematic", especially in the last episode where buildings and furnishings appear to be moving when the system is shut down. If "Truffle", as well as its remake, considers that shore residues are needed, the feelings of waste and loss are much more prevalent, Jack's call desperately.
