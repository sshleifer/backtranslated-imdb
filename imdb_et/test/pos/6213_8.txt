Let's get out of it, so those who are looking for this page are looking for the word "Breasts" (and you know who you are, googlers) can move: it's not pornographic. On the contrary, if it has any value as a masturbation material, frankly, the filmmaker did not do a good job, because the purpose is to keep it on the subject and on the experiences of women and their bodies and their own and society's images. health and so on. Indeed, I would be a little cautious about who came up on this DVD or, if he ever plays it, in late night at HBO or Cinemax and used it as an entertainment tool. Maybe you can go to the supermarket and pick up a couple of mature melons and take them home and squeeze them, and well, you get the idea. <br /> <br /> No, it's a semi-critical film designed to watch the premium late night, but it shouldn't be just for late night types. It's intimate, but not toned. All women have all shapes and sizes, races and even one man thrown into fake breast, something valuable to say, from the life experience in the simplest way. When I say it is semi-critical, the director thinks there are little small segments he has to go with, with old "videos" about puberty and sex and breasts and super-rare cartoons with knockers. about. This is not a problem but an asset: we need some small visual segments between these interviews. <br /> <br /> There is nothing left behind and we see it in a feminism-free form: they don't have to cover up, and even if they don't want to take off their tops and shirts, they're still open because it can be a natural part of the body that is sex, surprise, comfort, discomfort, curiosity, motherhood and unfortunately cancer. In this last part, another daring step is to see a woman who lived with only one breast of her cancer. You know that you have become an adult and an adult when you see a woman who has somehow lived a half-normal life with one breast (the bitterest moment is when she says that a fairy tale may have one desire for two full lines what he should think about), and you will not skimp or move "eww, gross". It's a test, people. <br /> <br /> It is not fired in the best conditions, but then again on the TV at a tight pace. It's never faded for a moment, and we never recognize anyone, especially if one can hear such a hard truth that the breasts may not be erogenous, or that the flat chest is very attractive to some men. Breasts: The documentary is about deconstructing myths with real faces and breasts and minds and hearts. If it is worth the session "I was alone" then I think more power, though it is not the goal.
