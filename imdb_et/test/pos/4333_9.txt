I could no longer accept as a comment that remained "coldshitaction" and how this film is a masterpiece. I've never seen a movie that would have had my adrenaline that made this movie, and it happened mostly when Bronson came out of a fire like M-60 and plowed like a 20 guy gang, it's a genius. Perhaps the best films have ever been made (not an exaggeration). From the very beginning you should know that you are into something sweet when the police let Bronson go and talk to him, tell him to clean the slums. Once again, genius. And again, Bronson is a bad ass. Paul Kersey is just as cool, maybe even cooler than John McClain or Terminator, he's just a bad ass. And what else is great is that he is a nice boy and buys an ice cream for the baby and helps out the old couple before he kills some bag bags. genius. Very recommended if you hate this movie.
