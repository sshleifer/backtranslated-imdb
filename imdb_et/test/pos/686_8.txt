This is a fun diamond. Functioning and plots are not as impressive, but the lines continue. It catches a lot of flick because it seems at first glance, like a good, bad movie, but it's so kooky that you can't help but be amused. Spasmodic, quick dialogue and peculiar characters keep it ... I was particularly fond of Sharon, Canuck's Shrooms eh? But the one who showed really was Andrew's little brother Andrew (Ira Heiden), his high level of whining was somehow loving. The whole movie in the movie.
