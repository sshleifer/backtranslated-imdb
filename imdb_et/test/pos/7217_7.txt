I found it truly shocking to see William Shakespeare's masterpiece of love, transformed into a cozy, violent and kinky sensual adaptation of the film. But once you look at it once, it will grow for the second and third time, when you look at this shock and start evaluating the film on your own initiative - with strong action, good dialogue, nice sequencing and choreography. not too bad sound and some (special) effects that continue. Oh, and also the end. What a riot!
