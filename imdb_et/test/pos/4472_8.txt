I love this movie, although I don't like how they portray Egyptians, being an Egyptian citizen! that is why it serves ten out of ten. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Augustin and Leopard is inconvenient and, of course, because of loneliness and living in this cave for so long, it develops a sort of madness and passion for this leopard. <br /> <br /> A very touching scene from Leopard's death, see Augustin's reaction. <br /> <br /> All in all, I find it enjoyable and I look forward to reading Balzac's story.
