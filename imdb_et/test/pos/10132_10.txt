Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. It is a heart-warming story that confirms the conviction that we can all make a difference when we just care. I think there were many realities with the characters. The scriptwriter did not add racism to the film in the way that most of the movies I thought were more realistic. <br /> <br /> Writers tend to inject racism, trying to create realism, but usually go overboard. <br /> <br /> There are so many cities where different races live harmoniously. Ed Harris should have applied for the Academy Award because he was a great leader and coach who was a realistic father and showed a warm, caring side in helping the radio.
