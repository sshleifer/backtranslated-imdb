In 1981 I was so moved by the film, I went to the theater four times to see it again! Something I haven't done for another movie. No film creates feelings of 60's growth like four friends. That so close to my own experience in the 1960s is probably something that many share. Jodi Thelen is fast and unforgettable! Why didn't he become a big star since then, I never know. The entire cast work is flawless, like the Steve Tisch script. I always wanted to know how much the story was autobiographical. But unfortunately, Steve no longer has to answer this question. I've got a copy of VHS from this great movie, but it's worn out! Highly recommended!
