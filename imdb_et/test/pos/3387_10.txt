I have 2 complete sets of time, this is my favorite movies of all time. Love all the actors and actors .. Awsome picture..Love Patrick Swazy..This is a movie that showed its true talent. But still, he doesn't get a credit for the screen he was preparing! Lots of credits are left in these films. Love is how they depicted the dry and dusty monons of civil war. It is one of the greatest love stories of all time and showing through all the forces of life the true freindship means. How to share the divided nations. But everything and all the freindship remained strong, though the war shared relatives and freindships. they stayed and taught us the viewer how true freind ships can still stay up to this day! Just the best. The wind is not comparable to this film. Patrick Swazy at his best .If you see this movie a hundred thousand times. I became a big fan of Swazy. And since then he has followed his career ... all his films after he made the north and south!
