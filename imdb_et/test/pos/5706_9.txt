When I set up my local PBS station last night to watch the "American War". I was waiting for a boring documentary, instead I got a very good and incredible time to recover. Now I see the causes of the American Revolution and the part played by Indian wars. Larry Nehring IS George Washington and he's the ideal for this part. Camera narration also works fantastically. I look forward to next week to see the rest. It is good to see that PBS really uses HD format to bring 1,700 directly to our living room. <br /> <br /> I hope Larry Nehring will see more in the future because he is such a talented actor.
