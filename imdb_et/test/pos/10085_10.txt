This is one of the best films I've ever seen ... <br /> <br /> It's so perfect, and every time you see it, you'll find new things ... Just like the dad is in the shower but still hears One voice, and if girls flutter, they can't do it at the same time if there are two girls and no. <br /> <br /> I have a problem with their "Uncle" in the middle of the movie, but why does his wife laugh?!? Another fantastic movie. The best Asian movie ever. <br /> <br /> I hope people enjoy it. There have been so many movies where the main character is skit-so (machine, secret window, etc.), but this movie is better than those !!!
