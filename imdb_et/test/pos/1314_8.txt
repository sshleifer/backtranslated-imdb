Paul Schrader and his brother Leonard wrote Mishima and parallels the life of Yukio Mishima and his work. The film is divided into four parts: beauty, art, action, and a fateful day, when Mishima held the general hostage of the army and talked to the garrison just to ridicule him and his Bushido ideals from the samurai code. On November 25, 1970, Mishima dedicated a ritual wreath and designed it to link beauty, art, and action. On this day, Schrader improves revival scenes with three different scenarios from Mishima's novel: The Golden Pavilion, Kyoko House, and Runaway Horses. The moment of Seppuku is perfectly realized with this shocking climax, pulling the camera back at the same time. <br /> <br /> Black and white sequences are mixed with the colorful moments depicted in Mishima novels. Black and white scenes represent memories of Mishima's childhood and youth. Schrader correlates some of these autobiographical moments with scenes from novels that are often parallel to Mishima's real life, such as his stammer, his bodybuilding obsession, and his samurai code promotion. Each of the three themes of beauty, art and action is shown in the selected images of the respective novels. Colored sequences resemble early technical color films that give the film a possible theme, considering the supposedly surreal quality. <br /> <br /> Ken Ogata plays the real Mishim, who has a definite decision, usually in the lead. this fateful day and resembles true Mishima. With this film, Schrader took enormous risks, focusing on the novels he made, and linking them thematically to Mishima's personal life and his literary ambitions. Editing a film between the three main parts of November 25, 1970, black and white growing segments, and colorful novel scenes clearly indicates the deliberate intersection of these elements of beauty, art and action in Mishima's life. Sometimes it is difficult to follow, and there may be few recommendations for an unwanted viewer. *** 4 stars.
