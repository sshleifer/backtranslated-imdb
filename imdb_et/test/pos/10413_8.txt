It was one of the best half-hour horror / arrest / fantasy performances of the eighties, no doubt. The exhibition was barely capable of casting a single episode and it remained as much as the output values ​​(i.e. kits) went, but it is not necessary for me to give him some credit for getting the plots. I mean, the plot of each episode was sharp enough that even me, the tempered film, the shock film, and the 70's grinding house horse got a little sick and slipped. A great show, just great, no matter what other reviewers said here. My favorite episode was called "Bug House", yes, it was the title I guess? Anyway, it still gives me every time I think about it, almost 20 years after the first release. Other exhibitions, such as "Tales From Darkside", "The Outer Limits" and (of course) "Twilight Zone", were definitely better product values, but I don't think they have anything to do as far as the land lines go like this sick little show! Certainly, this path paved the way for a more graphical cult classical phenomenon called "Tales From The Crypt".
