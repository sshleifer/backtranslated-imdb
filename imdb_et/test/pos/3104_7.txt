I have this movie in a collection of cheap B-movies. It hasn't been restored, actually it was hard to detect the sound in the first few minutes. <br /> <br /> At first, this typical haunted house movie seemed to look very similar to Clue, the predecessor of murder Death, House is Haunted Hill and the like. <br /> <br /> About half an hour into the movie, the storyline takes a really interesting twist - and it's going to be something completely different from the clich√© melodrama and far more entertaining than I originally thought. <br /> <br /> Check it out, it's a lot of fun, even when long clips and wider images (and almost no music scores) make it a little crazy for today's standards.
