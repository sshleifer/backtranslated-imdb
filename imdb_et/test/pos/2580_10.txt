If any potential film had to feel that it wouldn't work on reading the script on paper, it would be. Here is what looks like a gentle and gentle soft-porn s & m flick, with a huge theater poster that almost nude Christina Ricci who is chained to anyone other than Mr. Bad Ass MF himself, Samuel Jackson . But let me tell you if ever, a big film of pulp, living in a great time, is a spiritual power to save, it's Craig Brewer's redemptive follow-up to Hustle & Flow, Black Snake Moan. <br /> <br /> Unashamedly over from above, this movie sucks you with scenes that open and continues to deepen and deepen every next shot. This is the main story of two deeply damaged symbols that find strength and courage to move forward in more positive ways with their lives. This has been done before, of course, this story, but as I have always said, the way the story tells us is to give it heart, depth, meaning and power. <br /> <br /> Ricci Damaged - Childhood Abuse Wild Child Character Raise and Jackson's equally soulful musician Lazarus find each other in desperate circumstances, and Laz is trying to help Rae. This in itself is relatively unique: the idea that a man is genuinely trying to help a woman who is in serious pain instead of trying to make more use of her, and we know that the heart of Laz and the heart of the film are right from the start. The main part of this film is the redeeming, healing power of music (music is very close) and the film resonates deeply with that truth - spiritually, artificially and perfectly. <br /> <br /> The main reason for the movie to succeed is as deep as Ricci and Jackson. Scenes that would be both ridiculous and pathetic in the hands of fewer artists would instead be powerful as all exits. Especially in the film arc scene, where Jackson sings and plays with Ricci alone in his title song, in the midst of severe thunderstorms and the abominable demons from Rae's past that run into his head, leading him to Lazarus and clinging to his feet, not as ridiculously as technically , but rather intestinal cathartic. <br /> <br /> All supportive performances are also fantastic here. Justin Timberlake is completely believable when Rnee, the friend of Rae's anxiety-girlfriend, and always the wonderful S.Epatha Merkerson is also a perfectly character with obvious feelings about Latsarus. John Cothran Jr is also outstanding when Lazi's respecting friend R.L. Everything works on this movie, let's face it, including music / soundtrack that includes Burnside, Scott Bomar, Bobby Rush, Son House, and most importantly, Jackson himself, whose fantastic version of Stackolee I listen to when I I'll write this review. The film also features a really beautiful and touching version of "This Little Beam" that Ricci sings heartily and softly. <br /> <br /> Samuel Jackson said in recent interviews that he believes his performance in this film is by far his best career; I couldn't accept him anymore. It is a work he can be monumentally proud of, along with all this attentive, ultra-smart and deeply heartfelt mother * ucker.
