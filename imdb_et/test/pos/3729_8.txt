I thought Besson's film managed to do what some films did with them without words; Capture real human emotions. The protagonist's struggles, triumphs, back, hopes, and desires show everything so honestly that you don't know if he's acting at all. The film has a small budget and it is obviously done without the luminosity and glamor of most Hollywood productions, but this minimalism allows this movie to overcome the stereotypical Sci-Fi label and become a true drama. Calling this movie only drama would remove a fantastic post-apocalyptic plot. True, this type of movie has been done before, but I think it will hit this type of world of joy and sadness that may be better than any other.
