It is a rare and subtle speculation, an allegory of death and transformation that is neither preaching nor ugly. Mature and courageous understanding, Northfork avoids the distinction of arthouse, refusing to belong to the sort. Unlike the most memorable and achievable film that makes the obvious comparison, Wim Wenders' 1987 Wings of Desire (Der Himmel Ã¼ber Berlin) maintains ambivalence in the narrative spectrum that extends from everyday supernatural. This story of the earthly and heavenly prominent domains in the west of America prevents the fairy tale that marked its German predecessor in the ad hoc genre of angels, casting its wings with seemingly sentimentalism. His heavenly transcendence, whether inspired by nervous faith or a dream of fever, must never be rotten and rotten. This solid foundation brings great credit to writers and directors Mark and Michael Polish.
