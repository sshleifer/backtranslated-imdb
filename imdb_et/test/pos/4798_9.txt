This film is an exciting example of Luis Bunuel's narrative ability. This is a comedy that is not a comedy and a social drama that is not a social drama. Although I don't think it would be funny, it made me laugh. Despite the fact that you can never take Bunuel too seriously, the film thought about religion and its importance in the lives of some people. The Bunuel tells the story of a Catholic priest who is committed to his faith, like someone else and a witness to what happens when the priest's unconditional commitment to serve others. As usual, Bunuel's goal is Catholicism, but I don't think he's trying to mock the church often. At least I didn't take a movie to mock the institution. I think he is trying to make an interesting point about how religion could be disturbing in today's society. Not because faith in itself is bad, but because people always understand that concept is bastardized. Aside from the announcement, I think this is one of Bunuel's smartest works. Francisco Rabal is a great priest. Definitely one of the best filmmakers.
