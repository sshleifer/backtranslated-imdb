My college theater had a special screening of this movie last night. I have to say that I think everyone was impressed with how good this film was. Though my roommate didn't care about it, but she's never gone to horror movies and just went to see if Paris Hilton can act. By the way, if you worry about it, don't be. I'm not exactly one of his fans, but I have to be honest and say he was pretty good and has the best death scene. In general, all the actors were very good. I'm not going to the plot because I'm sure you know about it. Surpirsisngly, the characters are pretty interesting and you really care about them, especially Elisha Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray characters. We meet with rival-siblings and stop working with them. Another plus is that it doesn't have the nice look of Amityville Horror or Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and looks almost documentary, not a music video (don't get me wrong, loved Texas Chainsaw and enjoyed Amityville). <br /> <br /> Now for death scenes. In most slasher films, when a character is killed or killed, the scene immediately cuts to another scene, but not in it. When a character dies, they die quite gruesomely. But filmmakers don't stop there and add something for each victim every time. I'm not talking about death scenes and letting you see them. <br /> <br /> Although this is a great movie, it is in almost all slasher films (exploring the horrible house). if you were not supposed to, get a ride of dubious nature, splitting and shouting so that the killer could hear you). There is also a solid silly plot that was unnecessary and didn't add the movie at all. You could say that it was just added at the last moment, and if you took it out, it wouldn't have affected the film at all. <br /> <br /> Basically, if you are a fan of horror, check out this movie. You don't have to be disappointed. This is all that is needed to make it a big movie, maybe the best of the year, even though it is early on. The intercourse is felt and it's a funny movie at times. If you hate horror movies, you are likely to like it and if you are shared, I encourage you to let it go.
