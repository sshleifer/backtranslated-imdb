I remember that old movie. This is a great, cool, atmospheric scary picture of a man who is moving to the Scottish Castle to discover that there is a strange move in the corridors at night. The most familiar Hollywood cookie in Hollywood is also stranger events. Yes, it is a maze you have seen in all the full length movies that have ever brought the era of puzzle up to "The Shining." But the punchline of this story is about the last thing you think. I certainly didn't see it. This is a good example of how good and persuasive a film can be, even if the assumption is completely prominent and ridiculous. I recommend it to anyone.
