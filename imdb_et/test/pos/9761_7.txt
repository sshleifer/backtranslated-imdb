If you love this book, stop watching the video after Jean and Joe meet in Australia. So far, this book is a fairly faithful rendition and the visuals are great. 10 out of 10 and I've enjoyed it several times. After that, the story has been seriously rearranged and modified in a way that really destroys the main body of the book, ie how Jean creates the city like Alice (Springs). At first, the biggest change is to make a seventy-year-old widow instead of a 40-year-old bachelor in Strachan. Rather, it makes the story of this love worse, especially if there are also small changes that contribute to making it more self-conscious and gentle, such as: in the book he puts Joe on the ship that he can find more than the letter waiting for him in Australia, but he gives Joe some clue about the location or intentions of Jean. The last hour of a 5-hour video captures the book's last third. I see no reason why they threw in the battle between Joe and Jean - this is quite characteristic and seems to be just the Aussie who digs at Pommies to tell them what to do. Then they bring the wedding to Strachan (not after a few years) - and let him read the toast! - Very strange, especially regarding the relationship between Jean and Noel on video. The whole wedding scene is the invention of scriptwriters. These abominations take time in the last hour, which was not long enough to justify the exciting story that Jean revives Willstown, where he and Joe can both be happy.
