I saw it before the "bubba ho-tep" fantasy film festival in Montreal. all this is either tilting the hat (or fully ripping). I still enjoyed it, even if it is highly derived. What I was most impressed with was the quality of the visual material that had a clear shoe string. the configured design and props were ingenious and original, although the script was certainly not.
