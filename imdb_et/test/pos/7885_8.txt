At the same time with this film, the New York masters remember how reflective their time and how well cast and the team have taken this era in New York. <br /> <br /> The Norman Wexler script describes the different subgroups of the world living and the Avildsen direction brings out phenomenal performances. Peter Boyle's proud talent is on the screen like never before or later. It is clear that this is the best character image that is always pleasing to Dennis Patrick. <br /> <br /> What I always remember about JOE is the feeling that I was in a virtual shock coming out of the theater. Knowing that what the screen depicted was in the neighborhood of the five districts of New York City. <br /> <br /> This movie must be remembered.
