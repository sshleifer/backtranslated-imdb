This is a classic case where the American public is watching a great movie just because Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzenneger was not a leading person - Adrian Quinn performs better double performance, that's right what you heard in this movie if neither of them ever has his own pulled out of the quarry! Anyway, now in the overview ... <br /> <br /> The task is loosely based on the 1970's radical Carlos Jackal, who has terrorized Europe for years before he was finally captured by French agents. In this adaptation, the US Navy Officer (Adrian Quinn) is present in Israel when he is captured by Mossad (Israeli crack-intelligence / counter-terrorism agency) and took the survey as having a look just like a horn (this is a very cheesy part of the film, but trust me that it will not diminish the great value of this movie). When it is discovered that Mr. Ramirez is not Jackal, he is painted under the name of Jack Shaw recruited by a CIA agent (Donald Sutherland, who does his routine, mysterious state agency figure, but amazingly) who has spent his life in Jackal hunting and following Events link anyone who watches this movie - it is full of great action, without any clich√©s of ordinary feature films and one liner, and a great plot to surprise anyone. The three leading men - Quinn, Sutherland and Kingsley - carry this film a lot further than its modest budget would have allowed anyone to fill their shoes. Also leaning on the director and his staff, camera angles and cinematography are the upper limits, especially in action scenes. The task is better than letting what he could ever expect, a pity that the film did quite badly in the office, otherwise we could see a steep thriller of espionage. <br /> <br /> 9/10 stars, this reviewer suggests HARD to all potential viewers!
