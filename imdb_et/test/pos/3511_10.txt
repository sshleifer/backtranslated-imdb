I first saw it in the afternoon in the 80s T.V. I think I was like the 9th. (The picture today shows the flick of a violent horror on ordinary television). Anyway, I've seen it for years and it's like I remembered, it's a really good, scary flick. I think the reason why it may go unnoticed is that it was not followed by **** after-tax burden, ie Friday 13th. But this is one of those movies that takes the original idea and does it better. Although it is a killer in the forest like Friday, it's more common with the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The reason for this is that the film provides a certain atmosphere and a sense of fear even in daylight. And killers feel more dangerous than on Friday. There's also a good relationship. I suggest you see it now when it is released on DVD in late July.
