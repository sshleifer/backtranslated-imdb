It's also the best book I've ever read. Karl Urban and Steve Zahn are great together. It had drama, adventure and sweetness and sadness. I laughed. I cried. It's hard not to laugh when Gus talks. I wish Gus had finished Clare like he did Inez. Clara led Gus in all these years without ever going to marry her. She just loved to play her. It was sad that he spent all his life for him. It would have been nice if Woodrow had married Maggie, but he would have been dead anyway. Woodrow was a man who couldn't express his feelings and keep them in bottles. It was obvious that he loved Maggie after the Austin attack when the composers returned and ran for him. Val Kilmer is great to play odd characters. I loved her image of Captian Inish Skull. I loved the whole Lonesome Dove saga. Comanche Moon is the best in the bunch.
