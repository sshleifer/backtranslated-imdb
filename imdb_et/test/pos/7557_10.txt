... that people suddenly wake up. People who can resist the desire to separate everyone and everyone who sees the 60s for what they were. People who see just these people made those times; not the other way around. <br /> <br /> Forrest Gump is a good comparison. Both films look at the 60s, but the "four friends" are people, not cartoons. FF deepens deeply into what FG (quite successfully!) Is trying to condense and classify not just something as a backdrop. But as the "Gump" files from the 60's in the attic, like the old toys, "Four Friends" picks up and receives every toy that blurs the lines that you dear and what you are. <br /> <br /> When you associate romance with a shoe, you hate this movie.
