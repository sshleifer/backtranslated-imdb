I still remember Satya for the first time. I was completely blown away. Here was a movie that was very different from the other Gangster movies I saw. So realistic, so Mumbaiyya and so plausible. Despite the "Company" (which was a very good effort) and the "Inspiring" (more focused on the protagonist's journey) that approached, no underworld film could ever live against Satya. <br /> <br /> When I looked at Ab Tak 56 for the first time, I said to myself: "The Indian police now have their" Satya. "The quote from Nietzsche at the beginning tells you it's not an ordinary movie. It is a cold and scary feeling that you understand that it is part of their routine. <br /> <br /> Ab Tak 56 is not a police officer or a corrupt policeman, but a police officer, who is ready to do whatever is necessary to get rid of the criminals when all the legal means have been exhausted. is also impressive and haunting and will stay with you long after you leave the movie hall. <br /> <br /> But for me, what the cake really is is the dialogues and the super competition that works on every character. has done an excellent job as a writer. When I start listing my favorite dialogs, I'm afraid I will rewrite the entire script script. <br /> <br /> The film has some stars. Yashpal Sharma is being attacked as a sub-inspector by Imtiaz Siddiqui and by both Jeeva and Commissioner Suchak. Revath, Hrishita Bhatt, Mohan Agashe and Kunal Vijaykar have small roles they play perfectly. Nakul Only as a beginner Jatin Shukla was a revelation. A scene where he has to hesitate to shoot a wounded gangster? Oh my God! She is under the guidance of Sadhu Aghashe and she firmly believes in her. <br /> <br /> Prasad Purandhare as Zameer Zafar is impressive. His conversations with Sadhu are real dialogue writing. Never before has any movie in Indian cinema brought such a beautiful connection between the police and the gangster. <br /> <br /> Not that I am not a fan of Nana Patekari before, but this movie pushed me to a fan. Nana as Inspector Sadhu Agashe gives life and one of the best I've seen in Hindi cinema. How does he speak with his expressions about how he touches his cigarette, make his way? it's almost like Nana can't do anything wrong. He's the best on every scene, especially when he teaches Jatin about how police work. His cool and formed five things are sometimes scary. His dialogue and body language were convinced he was one of the best actors in the country. It is a shame that he did not win any popular prize for this. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, Shimit Amin does a great job of bringing all this talent together and making full use of the fire in a modern masterpiece of Indian cinema. In an industry that is not used to the story here and up there, Amin takes the original script and brings it to beautiful treatment. I just hope he will continue to do a great job and not give Bollywood isation! If he can do this, then I am sure he is the force to be taken into account in the coming years.
