A pretty charming image of the European Union, which will be among the young generation as representatives of this group, learns to live together in an apartment in Barcelona, ​​where they all learn from international scholarships. At the heart of the story is Xavier (Romain Duris), who may have lived a fairly ordinary life with his mother in France, but who quickly becomes the leader of the group, helping them deal with landlords and other problems. He learns about life and love quickly. Duris has a healthy look and excellent performance. The remaining majority plays well. Sometimes they lose everything to English if they want to make sure they are communicating, not sure what their apartment owners can understand in French or Danish or in any language. Cinematography is remarkable, including fine views of Barcelona and its famous Gaudi towers.
