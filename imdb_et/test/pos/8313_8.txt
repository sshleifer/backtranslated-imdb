Tomorrow is another day is not the aftermath of the wind, but the lovers-lam-story and surprisingly attentive and moving. Felix Feist proves that B-minus functions like Devil Thumbs A Ride, supposedly hacked, are capable of performing their work with unexpected, inventive details. Steve Cochran leaves the prison after 18 years when he killed his brutal father when he was only 13 years old, and now he is still an original, hairy pubescent that works in a man's stubborn frame. Single, he visits the 10-cent-dance palace and falls to the brass, rushing to Ruth Roman. However, the unexpected shooting of his police-bigwig boy causes an inappropriate pair to end, such as Joad, in a California migrant worker camp. <br /> <br /> The revelation of Rome; in his best-known role, as Farley Granger's fianc√©e on Hitchcock's stranger train, he was ill and underused. Here he convincingly modulates a bottle-blonde dancer to sacrifice a woman and a mother-to-be (and a brunette to get). Cochran is almost as good as suspected wounded child and underrepresented man's explosive reactions. And the end, though not convincing, is still welcome. With those who live at night and Gun Crazy, tomorrow will show another day of redeeming sweetness and warmth that will not let your movie noir genealogy.
