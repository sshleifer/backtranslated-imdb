This film would have given typical Hollywood "tears" of shame. The imagined emotions are very comfortable and weak. The plot is sufficient for a client who has a terminal illness (it is not a spoiler and it was early in the film). The method of execution is somehow unique to most of the love stories you have ever seen - not even a kiss was exchanged, and yet you feel a huge flow of love between two leaders. Initially, I thought that "limiting emotions" was something similar to typical "eastern values", but later decided against it. <br /> <br /> This movie is so underestimated that if you compare it to movies like "Cinema Paradiso", CP would have felt openly manipulative compared to. So, this is definitely not everyone's teapot. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie, I have the strong feeling that Holly-loving movies (or lovers of movies everywhere to be precise) have respected romance or passion and mark it as "love." I am sure we all have our own definitions and I would not say that these qualities are mutually exclusive. But I would like to say that the film allows you to think about whether you have any extra dimension with your loved one. <br /> <br /> It is very obvious that I enjoy this movie a lot. Given the fact that the film's appearance is so simple, it is paradoxically one of the "cinematographic" films I've seen lately.
