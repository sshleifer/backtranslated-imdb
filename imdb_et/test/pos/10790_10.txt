Never before has Oliver Stone's film or Eric Bogosian's films ever been seen, so I didn't know what to expect from this movie. Having played with the idea of ​​buying it for a while, I finally got it free as a Sunday newspaper supplement and I was extremely impressive. <br /> <br /> This is about Barry Champlain, the host of the talking radio, who can be incredibly rude to his callers, often placing them before they realize what is going on. Although it has made her a popular radio show, she has served her many enemies. <br /> <br /> The action in this movie was tremendously impressive when there wasn't one actor in it. Eric Bogosian is bright as Barry Champlain, an alarming radio receiver with Alec Baldwin, Barry boss, Dan. It also has Michael Wincott's voice and the appearance of the front panel (my reason to see it). <br /> <br /> The story was really well written, because despite his arrogance you know more about Barry's worrying life and you see how vulnerable he really is. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone because it is exciting and - more importantly - on multiple levels, two of which are inspired by the life of the actual radio receiver and the fact that you are actually sending the hosts and callers of the radio show like those in reality on film. <br /> <br /> High Recommendation and 10/10 <br /> <br /> Open to you, Cat Squire
