One of France's biggest successes in 2002 was "l'auberge espagnole" very well received abroad, which is quite extraordinary for the French film. The reasons for this success are not difficult to define. This film, made by Cédric Klapisch, one of the most interesting French filmmakers of recent years, introduces students from all over Europe and collects all under the same roof in Barcelona. These students are described as those you imagine or see in everyday life: atypical, serious or with a sense of humor. I think that if the film worked so well, many students have to be recognized in the portraits of the main characters and especially Xavier. <br /> <br /> We watch the film and its experience abroad as well as the Erasmus student through our eyes. Xavier is really an ordinary student with his own qualities, his mistakes. Intelligent making, with a lot of brilliant ideas, perfectly reflects his lost mind and anxiety about the world and the Erasmus student. There are two best examples of this topic. The first is when Xavier asks a woman at the university for the documents she has to send to prepare for DEA. If the same woman informs her of the different procedures required, all the documents appear on the screen when she calls them! In the following order, Xavier trusts the spectator of his vision of the world today. Now, where to find another example? Well, the scene where Xavier has a thorough medical examination, in which Klapisch's films his visions are broad enough to talk about himself. He left this point low. Rather, he put a lot of effort into Xavier's private life with his love for Anne Sophie, but also in his relationship with his associates. It's a true friendship that Klapisch shows us our moments of happiness, but also its arguments and tensions. At the end of Xavier's adventure and stay, he has begun a life that makes him more mature. The message that the author wanted to convey is not hard to guess. You naively believe that you live in an uncertain and complex world. You must not give up, but look intensely to get what you want, even if it is difficult. <br /> <br /> In addition, we may be afraid that Cédric Klapisch will not trap this issue: clichés. Let's be honest about this: they're involved in the scenario, but the director does their best to not spread them too much in the movie. Then the scenario includes convenient and predictable moments: at the airport and before boarding, we see Xavier's tear after leaving the family. But fortunately, the script's shortcomings stop. Pretty funny dialogues and cool young actors who are completely free to perform their duties form the whole. <br /> <br /> Despite their weaknesses, l'auberge espagnole has to be successful in the youth film. people. Moreover, the whole atmosphere that it brings out allows us to believe that this film is primarily aimed at a young audience. Ultimately, we show the end of the movie and its great success that Klapisch went to a fashion that goes to the right American cinema: developing post-production results. And indeed, the filmmaker is now working on a sequel called "les poupées russes". We hope it is as good as "l'auberge espagnole".
