I waited a lot for this movie and I can say I'm not disappointed. First of all, this film, which is a world wine making tour, allows the spectator to enjoy beautiful places. The people interviewed are also very interesting and funny, especially Hubert de Mont. Shooting can be confusing as the camera is always insecure and often focuses on background-based secondary elements. You may not like it, but I do not consider it a defect. <br /> <br /> The issues raised in the film may also be confusing, because globalization is not the only issue at stake. But Nossiter was able to consistently give his film. The great achievement of this film is to reveal all the characters involved in the wine industry when they are, avoiding clich√©s of "good evil". This may be the main difference between "Mondovino" and Michael Moore's documentaries; Nossiter's perspective appears in a subtle way through the expressions of his favorite characters. The richness of this documentary depends mainly on the characters, the history of long-standing winemaking families such as De Montilles, Mondavis, Antinor and Frescobaldi. Nossiter lets the spectator discover that wine is more about family, not just business and industry. This film does not want to drink wine, but you definitely want to discover vineyards and wine producers. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie as a student in Enology, and let's just learn a lot of ways. I will give this documentary out of 10 out of 10, despite its technical features.
