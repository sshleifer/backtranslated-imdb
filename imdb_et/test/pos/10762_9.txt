Stylish and sensitive film with intertwined plot lines. A general warning indicates that the film becomes dark in about half. As suddenly as it was, I found the change that suited the film's themes, especially the comparison of Ishani with the dirty riches, and (as Finn said at the end) how each person forms a tribe. and how the whole tribe is reflected in every human being. <br /> <br /> Anton Yelchin (Finn Earl) is remarkable in this film. He is probably the best known as Chekov Star Trek or Kyle Reese Terminator Salvation, but he has had a whole host of films you've probably never heard of (Alpha Dog, another great performance of Yelchini, House of D, Hearts at Atlantis, some naming the name ...) The point is that this guy really takes this movie and does it himself. Other great performances by Diane Lane and Donald Sutherland are what makes this movie great, great.
