This big movie never appeared in my city, so in fact I had no chance to watch it in the late 80s when I received it on German television. I was expecting a catastrophe, and instead found a great western country that was working well and had a great location. The tiny tube could not really damage it, and this 4-hour movie doesn't have a nearly dull moment so I hope to see it again on the big screen. What speculation would be! Don't miss it if you have a chance. Unfortunately, the harsh treatment of "Heaven's Gate" destroyed Michael Cimino's career at the opening, and he moved inevitably ("dragon year") to a ridiculously ridiculous ("Sicilian") and amazingly stupid ("Desperate Hours").
