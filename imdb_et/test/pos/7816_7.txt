It is a mere cast that says it is the usual western part of Italy. Veterans actors Robert Ryan and Arthur Kennedy compete with Alex Cord, who at that time seemed to be on the edge of the start. The result is a movie that is both amazing and discounted, but it satisfies those looking for more from the West than just a bomb. Of particular interest here is the play played by Alex Cord. It is assumed that the hero in the west is quiet and introspective, but "Clay McCord" is an extreme example and, surprisingly, is often passive, even weak. Much has been done about the fact that he is afraid that he will begin to immobilize his father on epilepsy, and in these helplessnesses he has the mercy of those who want to harm him or who want to help him. To emphasize your passivity Clay McCord - don't you know that name? It is often shined off of the waist if it is a little more than an attractive toy that is shown. In her nature there is even a strong masochistic streak, the most evident when her enemies use a punching bag and then stopped with her wrists and left to the middle of the street. Not only is he often unable to defend himself, but McCord is just as effective in protecting the people around. Almost everyone who helps her is killed. <br /> <br /> Although "minute prayer, second death" is far from complete success, it has a depth and tone that sets it apart and causes it to remain in memory. It is also a good show for Alex Cord, whose career after this point after the mid-1960s some promising years fell. He must be about 36 years old when he filmed it - in his physical primacy - and his scene, which he hung hanging, naked crust and sweaty, is a memorable cinema "beefcake".
