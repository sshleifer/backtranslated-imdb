This existential thriller, in English with subtitles in Portuguese, is a modern version of the noire in the 40's American film, at the end of which is a surprise. It's riveting from start to finish. My only criticism is its poor production values. The film looks cheap and it was probably that black and white filmmaking is far worse than Vivre Sa Vie than Godard, to quote a film that has been going on for more than 30 years. Most crazy subtitles are often difficult to read. When filmmakers learn and give yellow subtitles so that they can be read with a white background. I'd give it to 8, though with better production values ​​it could have been bigger.
