These are the films I loved and still love to grow. Unlike the big budget movies that create huge plot holes and never recognize them. This movie takes everything together and does something you can sit and enjoy. <br /> <br /> In the past, there was a film student complaining that this is not a list A material. But that's not the case. The idea behind this movie is that nobody likes big movies with CGI clich√©s. There are a lot of people who like movies that are just for you, and not get as much money as you can. dead yet.
