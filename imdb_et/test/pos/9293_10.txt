This exhibition is where the best comedies in Australia are made, because it does pretty much everything our public wants. Some of the best bits show an advertising road test that tests how advertising works in real life. For the show, it's really good how original it is and that it has people (entertainers) who love what they do and who are not. There are a lot of bits in this show that can hit someone like the one I mentioned, Mr Ten, where he asks 10 quick questions about famous celebrities like Hugh Jackman and Beach boys, temporary like The Chasers Emmys and those who are It has been from the very beginning, as we have learned from the things running this week. In general I appreciate the thin exhibition of 98%.
