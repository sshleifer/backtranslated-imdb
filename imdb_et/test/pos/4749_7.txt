How did they get this movie hit in the car with a semi-rear? And then Roy is sitting up! It looks like DVD is scheduled for May 2006 - about time !! See it on the big screen or revitalize the movie in the theater if it is possible to fully understand the overall aspect ratio. My other favorites in this category are: Original Italian Work by Michael Cainega; Bullit with Steve McQueen; Live and die in LA with a CSI man when he was young; French connection to Gene Hackman; Ronin with Robert Deniro; The missing point with Barry Newman; State enemy again with Hackman - what are your favorites?
