Two years after the plane's success, Jim Abrahams and Jerry & David Zucker achieved this great sitcom that celebrated the great Leslie Nielsen as a simple dressed detective Frank Drebin. Alan North was also cast as "Captain Ed Hocken", Ed Williams as "Ted Olsen" and William Duell as "Johnny Shoe Shine Boy". "Police Team!" in the background unashamedly corny jokes and smart visual gags. Each episode ends with a whispering frame in which the characters in the frame remain completely. One of the best "freezing frame" sequences saw that one of the characters poured coffee while standing still, causing the cup to overflow! The guest stars were killed in the opening titles, one of them including Georg Stanford Brown, which shattered the safe! Despite receiving positive reviews and much critical recognition, "Squad!" only six episodes lasted before cancellation. However, this does not mean the end, but five years later this exhibition was screened for the first screening of "Naked Gun" films.
