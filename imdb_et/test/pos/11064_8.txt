I have to admit that I have voted on this movie, but I have strong reasons because I know the true history that Hollywood treatment has given here. Edna Ferber's novel on which it is based is the era in which the real name cannot be used. In a sense, this film is smoke and mirrors. Although it appeared in 1946, it was filmed immediately after Casablanca. Ingrid Bergman is the brightest in her film than a brunette. <br /> <br /> She plays a beautiful woman trying to trade her beauty to become a rich spouse. Today it is a gold digger, but in this social age it is desirable and a woman who does all the men wants her, and all the old snooty societies who talk about her and avoid her, wanting them to be. Ingrid is his best and plays this role well. <br /> <br /> Some sympathy for Ingrids's character is raised in this film for New Orleans, as he succeeds in getting a decent late tomb for his scandalous mother as part of his relatives' agreement to leave New Orleans. His family of relatives is so scandalous that he is doing almost everything he asks for to leave the city. <br /> <br /> Gary Cooper is good in this movie, although he seems to be getting a bit older to play a striking Texan bachelor. He pulls it out well, bearing in mind that he was older than his actual life cycle smoking. Flora Robison, like Ingrid Maid, became an Oscar nominee for this film. Jerry Austin as Cupidor looked at his role in many ways to review, but it is the only comic relief in the film and does it well. <br /> <br /> When a movie moves to Sarat, it is just how important Sarato was in this era. I like the sequence when Bergman walks to Saratoge until spring to get some of the "sulfur" water that everyone thought was so healthy. When he drinks, he forces himself not to see and comment on how good it is and to have more. True history is the railway battle that really happened on a railway line in New York, which is the actual title of Saratoga's trunk movie. This battle actually took place in 1869 between representatives of Andrew Carnagie & J. Morgan. The line was the country's economic key in 1869, which united coal and the east coast. The references to it are very real in the film. There is even some dialogue that describes Carnagie as "Scot", although the reference is vague and unknown to anyone who doesn't know the historical history of the battle. <br /> <br /> The railway and railway tunnel in New York (code no. 13848) is still there, although the film was taken in California. The actual tunnel is about 1 mile long. It is still part of the freight route today, years after. I grew up there. Gary Cooper's line in the movie, when he drives a train into the tunnel, is right, it's still a "mighty beautiful country".
