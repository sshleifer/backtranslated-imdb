Frankly, I was completely interested in the original Sleeper Cell. After watching the best part of the series on the FX channel (UK), my heaven shattered the meaning that fell between the important finals. But what I saw, I thought it was a great story, a good acting, and if I didn't look at '24', I thought it was great and it was confirmed during the second season ... <br /> <br /> One of the best TV shows I've seen. Much more realistic and credible than "24." Excellent character development and plot line. Does not subvert Islam, but gives a thoughtful and thoughtful approach that shows the difference between radical terrorist Islam and true Islam. Everyone should see this show! <br /> <br /> Stringy xx
