Todd Sheets has created one of the biggest LOW BUDGET Zombie movies EVER. The story is great, gore is great, psychos are evil! However, the film has little dialogue and slow shooting from time to time. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, ZB2 offers any Zombie movie, gore, good plot, quick adventure in macarbe. When only a 100-kroon budget was given to MR pages, this film even makes all zombie films deadly almighty Dawn. <br /> <br /> But as time goes on, he gets better and when he gets more money comes in his pocket. This allows this person to better shape his vision of today's Genius. Just remember that Zombie Bloodbath 2 was just one of his great steps when he was on Gore Hill
