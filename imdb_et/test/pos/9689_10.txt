Seriously people have to relieve and just agree that funny is funny and this movie is f ** king fun. Better than the first and Knoxville really got a pair for this movie and made it more subtle tricks than the first. When Ebert and Roper (not saying I'm a big fan of them), this is a pure idiot of the movie that is enough to give it two thumbs, so I think other people can do it. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was flooring and it's rare if the sequel is better than the original. This new faith exceeds the first great time. so do what i did, just relax, try not to try a barfit at some point and laugh your ass.
