Dirty Dancing follows the story of Frances 'Baby' Houseman (Jennifer Gray) and her family when they spend the summer at the Clan Family in Summer. We see her discovering when she falls in love with a dance teacher, Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze). <br /> <br /> The film is full of wonderful dancing (hence the title!), which is great music and terrible scenery. It deals with some difficult questions with dignity and grace and is, of course, a shocking spoiler here! You know how it ends in the beginning, but it's not here. Point is a trip, a trip that affects all family members. <br /> <br /> This is one of the movies I have to watch when it is on television. remembered!
