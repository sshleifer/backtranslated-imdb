I liked "Happy Ever After," but "Terry & June" was completely hypnotized. When Aunt Lucy went, it seemed that the emphasis was on the relationship between Terry and June, a middle-aged, middle-class English couple, and I enjoyed it thoroughly, losing myself happily in every episode. <br /> <br /> The 1980s were an era of alternative comedy, but they were also a decade of choice - Terry and June were definitely more traditional. And my - and I was a big fan of "Youth"! Every week Terry got into a stupid situation and in June he pulled himself in and usually came out. When timed exhibitions are now - a different world, but it's fun to see the 1980s trends - such as the 1982 CB radio (CB radio legalized in England in November 1981), where Terry was imprisoned at the back of his truck truck! I've recently been watching DVDs again and I think they are terrible! The enlightened elite is not loved - talk-like classes, but a huge hit with the masses! Wonderful!
