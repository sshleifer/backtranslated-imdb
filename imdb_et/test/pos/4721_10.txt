This film should be seen by as many people as possible, as it focuses on human rights issues in Burma. When I watched this movie in the mid-1990s, it changed my life completely. I knew very little about Aung San Suu Kyi or his democracy movement. It made me want to understand more about the situation. Every movie that has the right to know more has done its job properly. Patricia Arquette is great as an American lady who, due to her personal tragedy, has become negligent with her own life-style solutions and a subsequent conflict. It is a powerful film about a subject that deserves more publicity. As the film itself says that the 1988 pro-democracy activist massacre was not on television and therefore it remained unnoticed by the world. I invite all of these comments to read to take time to learn more about the current situation in the Burmese people. <br /> <br /> This is the time when this movie appeared on the DVD. Can you do anything?
