I loved this example, but then I never remember that he didn't love what he did, starting with "Emily Americanization". The city sheriff, who is trying to steal the city blind and drive to Mexico, must love it. Like everything he does, it also has a cheek flavor that marks it as Garner's product. James plays many of his exhibitions and films of the same nature, but it never gets hidden. <br /> <br /> P.S. re: killing the main game <br /> <br /> When I remember correctly, a "good" brother was killed by replacing "evil" with a twin to increase ratings, i.e. Change it while watching television on every other west side. I think this exhibition was too far from that time and I still won't miss it. There's nothing on TV without Jimmy G show.
