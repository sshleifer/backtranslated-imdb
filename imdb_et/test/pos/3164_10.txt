It's worth checking out. You saw it on MLK's birthday in 2006 and it hit me a lot of time. Sometimes we all seem to be trapped and condemned to repeat the past no matter how much we try to change. All we can do is continue and talk. Just continue. Don't mean that it is down, because it's not the thing, but maybe we have to go before we see how much we have to work with ourselves. What happens when the best people, like MLK, talk about what should happen to pull us out of our "dead road", but we don't listen. I know some of us are listening, but how can we see things in the rest of the world as they really are? Just keep going, I guess. This movie was all about that, so I think it has done what it did. This is what I consider to be a good movie or game or book or poem or anything: something that makes you think and move to move in an active direction, not to sit and bored and hopeless.
