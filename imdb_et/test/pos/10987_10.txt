Heaven is heaven in heaven. It's a family movie - teenagers and grandparents can enjoy it together. But it is not sweet syrup or silly. The characters are really "characters". The plot is somewhat complicated and you have to pay attention, but it's like putting a puzzle together, because it's all set. The beginning of the period is like watching an old photo album or remembering it. It is very well done with very precise hairstyles and costumes. The story moves quickly with twists, turns and fun. <br /> <br /> Special treatment is to look at the great light of familiar faces that many of us have not seen for too long. Part of the entertainment is to recognize and name them mentally as they appear, although it may interfere. At the end of the movie, Cloris Leachman looks like he'd been over "Oprah". I've never seen Faye Grant in the movie - I knew her only as Grace's mother in the TV series "Saving Grace". He was great, even minus the southern accent. And I didn't even know Shelly Duvall. Five sisters who created this very cute movie are a very talented quintet and sister Theresa is a heavenly treasure.
