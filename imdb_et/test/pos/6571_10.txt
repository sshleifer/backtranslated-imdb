Each frame in the movie is a lesson for new directors or existing directors to learn how to take a movie. Hats for Sekhar. He is undervalued in the Indian film industry. The director has all the qualities that Satyajir ray, Adoor has, in acquiring this film. Each film is effectively depicted on the film. Although it is a simple story, it has been done so much that it can be considered one of the best in India. I don't have enough adjectives to praise the film. Just like life in today's atmosphere, the film is made. Although Indian movie stories are considered a weak area, the songs in this film have given additional energy to the film's potential.
