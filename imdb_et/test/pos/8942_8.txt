Wales seems to have recently released some peculiar films. In fact, it seems that Wales is developing its small film industry. I recently saw Annie Mary very much, which I thought was very good. But the plots with a view are not only peculiar, laugh loudly, painfully cast by talented actors (Brenda Blethyn is amazing), and a plot that is not entirely original, but so wisely written that man has always cleverly picked up, which can almost to be thrown on the lines. It was a movie I wanted to look at again and one of the very few I really wanted. Although many characters are cartoons and you have to be in the village of Wales to understand that they are also very human, and communication between Blethyn and Molina is a pleasure to see.
