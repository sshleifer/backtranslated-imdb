Well, I tend to watch movies for three reasons. Unfortunately, there are no Transformers in this movie, so I can only recommend it for the value of comedy and beautiful women (reading girls). <br /> <br /> Yes, it's funny, I know the number of people in the cinema who always smiled. Personally, however, I loved it for Laura Fraser, for whom IMHO is FIT!
