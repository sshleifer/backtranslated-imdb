Orphan Tom (Tommy Pender), who works for a couple of shady chimney sweeps, is wrongly accused of a mansion where he works with Mr Grimes (James Mason) - a real thief - and continues to run. Tom's only alibi is the mansion's brother's daughter (Samantha Gates, a slender, blue-eyed blonde, with long wavy hair who I'm sure this was the main reason I was watching this boy repeatedly). He and his dog jump on the river and the witch turns them into a breathable comic book! During the underwater he communicates with his friends and rescues a group of infants who are known as water-baby sharks. <br /> <br /> A very interesting and always fascinating fabel placed in 1850 that should appeal to all children. Animation (42 minutes of HBO VHS 85 minutes) is just average, but it's better than the most advanced animation - even computer animation! My only real grip is the hole in the plot caused by the deleted scene. 42:06, after the first "High Cockalorum" verse, the movie cuts the octopus swimming scene, followed by Tom and Jacque meeting with Terence. This leads to a scene where the killer (expressed by Mason) leads our heroes into a trap. Hai then welcomes Tom, "Young Tom, so nice to see your ugly mug again" - but this is the first time HBO has printed that Tom answers shark! Most literary lists list driving time for 92 or 93 minutes and were previously available for Sultan Entertainment and Nelson, so it is highly likely that the HBO edition is edited and / or time-compressed. In 2002, MGM published a full screen, 76-minute injury to DVD. We hope that a restored version will appear in the near future. <br /> <br /> The film is copyrighted by Ariadne Films in 1978. "Ariadne" is a child of water expressed by Samantha Gates. Bernard Cribbins, who plays Mason's partner in a crime, also speaks of eels. A.K.A. Slip Adventures.
