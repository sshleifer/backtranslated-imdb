Francois Villoni's great quiet version. Although in the 1930s it was reused when I was king, with Frank Lloyd's leadership, Preston Sturges scripting and Ronald Colman starring, this version is even better. Barrymore, who is with comics, plays the comic fool and the wine-pressed Villon that Colman couldn't fit. Photography amazes her beauty and innovation and supportive casting, especially Conrad Veidt in her American premiere, the incredibly beautiful Marceline Day, and supporting comic strips by Slim Summerville and Hank Mann steal all the scenes they have. <br /> It is a shame that Barrymore made so few first-class comedies. Only his leading role in TWENTIETH CENTURY and his supporting role in MIDNIGHT can be compared to his sound films, and they stand only because of his excellent voice. In this silent movie, Barrymore has to tell his story without words and he does it, alternately unknown as a king of fools and gently like Villon in love. He can even jump around in Fairbanks, who is convincing. He also lets his supporting casting in his glory, this band's competition works like a gifted comic in every era. <br /> <br /> Finally, a brief word about Alan Crosland, who is now known only for leadership. The first talking function, The JAZZ SINGER in the same year, was released. Crosland was cautious, innovative, a pleasantly original director, and it is a shame that more of his work is unknown. Perhaps this film, which is much more interesting than a film than its best-known work, is your introduction to his other talents. If so, you could do a lot worse.
