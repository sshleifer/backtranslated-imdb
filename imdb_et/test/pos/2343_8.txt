We must agree that this film, and its talented director, will not get these injustices. We hope that DVD will do very well and will bring the attention of such a wider audience. The actors gave great performances and the plot is great. Perhaps the overall film is a bit long, but May Miles Thomas seems to enjoy his actors when they perform strong performances and therefore keep them sometimes longer than necessary. Good actors I am sure of, but sometimes as an audience you are ready to move on to talk to the plot. May Miles Thomas deserves more recognition from the film industry than one of our most important digital film directors.
