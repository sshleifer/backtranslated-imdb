This is probably the best film of 2002 about Romanian cinema. I recommend that it be an intense drama without action and excitement. The film focuses on the teenage life of the suburbs of Bucharest through basic education, not so much on the character or definition of the character, but rather on the anger he and other characters feel. The title "Furia" means rage rather than anger, but it could be treated in the film both in the minds and in the behavior of the actors. A pretty strange love story (not a typical romantic, but rather a modern suburban concept) is well-designed to the end. This is an enchanting picture and the cinematic art is pretty good when trying to capture the suburban nightlife, so it's nice to watch and listen to the movie. <br /> <br /> You will not forget for a moment, I promise!
