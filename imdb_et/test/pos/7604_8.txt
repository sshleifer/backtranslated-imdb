This movie probably turned out to be pretty much. Of course, this is cute, of course it's predictable. We all know the fairy tale. But knowing that if you look at it, it's a pretty pleasant look. It was funny and cute. I found it annoying that they showed geeks as kids who didn't wash their hair or kids who loved mathematics and joined mathematics clubs and wore mathematics with T-shirts. I was called in high school and I didn't. It's much deeper. A lot of things, some about how much money your family has, how much you are willing to hide from your uniqueness and how you are prepared for other children. Anyway, I don't get into that. I disagree with other opinions that Drew is not convincing. Braces, no makeup and no hair, I don't think too many people are pristine about her. And even if he goes back to high school and throws them away. She's still wearing "wrong" clothes, "wrong" hair and has a "wrong" attitude that is considered cool. And his second "geek" friend can be beautiful, but it doesn't matter where I come from, you can still be challenged and be beautiful. (in and out)
