I saw it originally several years ago when I sat on the couch and stuck in HBO. With my remote control at my fingertips, I decided to go with it and waited for an unhappy movie that I avoided during the year. So it started and I was not very optimistic about it, but after about ten minutes I found myself laughing. Complete the opposite when I waited. Comedy was smart, acting pretty good, given that the cast was very well together, and the story (albeit a little uncomfortable and fake) was actually quite fun. <br /> <br /> Three convicted brothers are capable of punishing and eventually seeking their fortune. The film was set in the 1930s. So, along the way, they experience many funny and interesting features. Everyone has a different story or achievement that they are trying to achieve. Indeed, most of the film may seem random. Some may say it was pointless and boring, but if you are looking for a smart comedy (and sometimes a fool) that is integrated with the film, then I'm sure you enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I liked George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson presentations. All of them did very well in their roles, they worked together. But to finish it, "Oh brother, where are you?" is a smart, funny and movie adventure that I won't let up.
