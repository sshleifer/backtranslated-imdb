Films belonging to the "film noir" genre usually contain similar elements: the "deus ex machina" plot revolution that guides the main game to the sun, a beautiful but psychotic girl, a beautiful but psychotic thug, a lot of money, a lot of cruelty and usually in the desert. Consider "High Sierra" or "White Heat". <br /> <br /> There's a lot of hard-boiled bad film noir. But if the film's good is good, you can't take your eyes off the train of human lives. <br /> <br /> This is the last tradition of "Dark Places". The film follows the worrying teenager Danny Alton (perfectly played by depth, grace, emotional immunity, and even brightness by James Franco, who throws himself into this group) who is in love with the rough edge, Darcy. <Br /> <br /> From the beginning you know it's bad. <br /> <br /> Darcy invites Danni to his house. But the house is empty and for sale, and bloody control of thousands of dollars is on the floor. Danny has been kidnapped by his clothes and assets, but uses this suicide for April - Darcy's second lover. When they reach Darcy's real home, they find Wayne, who is a wild man who has been stolen for Darcy. Together, the three Darcyd deserts can be located in a dusty and deserted motel. But this is just the beginning of the story, because plastic explosives, drugs, arms, creepy funerals, bisexual assassins, and a lone semi-finished house in the desert bring events to an explosive spot outside the tattoo salon. Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> This movie contains some of the best young cinematography I've seen for years. In one scene, Danny walks through the desert in the wilderness, where he believes the mobiles took this night in Darcy. A very long-fired sharp illumination effect shows Danny - the flailing of his hands and feet, the terrifying fear of his face (visible even at this distance), the dust cloud behind him, when the wind is whispering toward him - racing in the desert. towards the house. Loneliness, Despair, Despair Danny seems to be shocking. There are many scenes in this movie that have been perfectly designed by experienced Maximo Munz. This is the Oscar winning material. <br /> <br /> Editing is just amazing. The film contains a few moments where characters get an overview of themselves or their situation. Timeballs where memory and feeling come back. During this time, the images are quickly blinking on the screen. This is a great edit by the director-writer-editor Stephan Woloszczuk. In an early assembly, Danny describes the wonderful feelings he now has in Darcy's life. Fast pictures from Danny's diary are blinking across the screen: the words "4 lives", "happy" and "secure" stop for a moment, while the page on the words page, the human heart, the races across the screen - out of focus, too fast to read. It's like feeling the flood Danny himself feels. <br /> <br /> Flooding shows something different about this movie: just how beautiful the design of Nathaniel Waters is. Darcy's quonset-hut home is the perfect high-tech and slippery game (tribute set to interior designer Kimberly Foster). The stunning desert house scene is just totally scary. A damaged motel where Darcy hides can be found in any abandoned small town in America. The terrifying (and astonishingly illuminated) funeral home, where the plot has a terrible move, mixes the harshness with the death of the whole film. (It is too bad that the film's lighting driver is not credited.) This film is a great product design that enhances each frame and every actor's performance. <br /> <br /> This is the fourth element of this movie that will grab it and hold it with you: acting. James Franco is a great actor. Even in the "Spider-Man", where practically nothing was given to him - Franco showed that he understood the emotions of a person like no one in his generation. She is not a beautiful boy who looks like good Brad Pitt to his good women. Franco represents deep emotion with full power. In his performance, the pure heart of man is. Think of a scene in a telephone booth outside a funeral home where Danny collapses after April and Wayne say Darcy is dead. Smaller actors could not completely disrupt the human being. Franco does that. <br /> <br /> Shawn Montgomery, in his first movie, just hits you with his suicide April. Deeply in love with Darcy, who suffers from massive depression after he has to bury his unborn child (after a spontaneous break in the fetus) in a wood-filled perfume box, his luxury and perfection are now overwhelmed: April is one of the best - drawn characters on the film I ever I've seen. Although Danny's relationship with Darcy is slowly being eliminated during the film, the nerve damage in April is only visible to the audience. Danny and Wayne don't seem like a man to him. In April, the despair, when he realizes that Danny is also a Darcy mistress, is embarrassing and intense, even if it is the inability of a cut character to feel emotions for a very long time. Montgomery will bring in sins until April, which will put your heart to exhaust. <br /> <br /> Mark Patrick Gleason is given the hardest job in the film: taking something human and real, Wayne. At first, Wayne is just one of the many violent, unpleasant, obsessed drug-driving forces / rifles that appear on any number of films (from "Kindergarten Cop" to Beverly Hills Cop 2). Gleason is doing very well, but he doesn't There's a lot to it that looks like a lot to Wayne. It's hard to tell if it's a Gleason problem or a material. There's a moment - where Wayne (who is Darcy's brother, though neither Danny nor April knows it) reads Danny's diary and understands sexual and emotional connection between two men - where you just know that Wayne is going to be homophobic in Danny's ass. But the explosion will never come. (Thanks to God! Trite plots are a death film.) When the revelation of siblings appears at the end of the film, the audience is quite astonished, that he understands the depth of love and compassion. Danny's homosexual love for his bisexual brother. But it all happens off the screen. It must be very frustrating for the performer. <br /> <br /> The story is quite inventive, although the smuggling device at the end of the movie is likely to remind viewers of "Diamonds Are Forever" (yes, James Bond). The traditional narrative voice command (which proves that Franco is such a big voice as a physical actor) offers a terrible atmosphere, although it tends to flow through Schmaltz (giving inadvertent laughter) sometimes. Terrible places play a visual role in the film. Tissue to find amazing buildings! The end of the movie hit me a bit in a hurry; not pat, but a bit too sure about my movie noir taste. <br /> <br /> Now I have seen viewers either in hatred or in love in the "Dark Place". Today's movie audiences, exposed to the most extreme brutality and violence, often have little appreciation for the nuances of the film's twins. My suggestion is to take a small group of friends who do not see despair, emotional collapse, despair or depression as ridiculous. Take them to a small theater where they can respect the view of the film's vision, but where the crowd who does not know the good film of the movie is not being destroyed. Take them to some popcorns (trust me, they're so engrossed that they won't stop), take them in soda and let them crowd. Go to some places bright and cheerful to wash your lingerie and soul in your breath. Because this movie is so good that you feel, you need to restore it.
