Another popular screening for a British picture at the Coalville Century Theater. Well-designed, solid drama with a growing plot of land and ongoing "punches" ... as it lies! The Master Class, which works flawlessly for the first time by Julian Fellowes. Tom Wilkinson's outstanding performance, but all involved, including the support of actors Linda Bassett and John Neville. Our film has got into this movie that includes a couple of shock events that really make you "jump". Pretty dense production in about 80 minutes, probably produced in a very limited budget, but a success that should see Fellowes again on the big screen. Some publicity of the film seemed to have been set during the 50s (as Nigel Balchin's novel), but apparently it is not. Recommended viewing.
