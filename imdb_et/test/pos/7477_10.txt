This movie was great from start to finish. I had swallowed action, black humor, and the incredibly bad luck our hero had every time. Thomas Jane is a great actor and I hope to see him in many future films. As I read other people's comments, I have to admit that I have never thought of Tarrantino while watching "Thursday", but now that I mean, I think there are some similarities. I think I don't spend much time associating everything else. The rape scene between Porizkova and Thomas Jane is one of the record books - the sexiest scene ever.
