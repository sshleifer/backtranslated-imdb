"Unconditional Love" begins with a great promise. The film, led by Mr Hogan, works perfectly up to the last third of the film, when it falls on its face. The screen game Hogan and Jocelyn Moorehouse wrote that there are many options at the end. It seems that the artistic team behind the film hopes it will play differently. The reality is the film that looks in different directions, how to bring it to a resolution that ultimately fails. Don't make me wrong, the movie is tremendously tempting and resonates with watching the public. <br /> <br /> Based on strong casting, we decided to look. Excellent talent Kathy Bates is the perfect choice for Grace Beasley, a woman who finds at the beginning of the movie that not everyone is well married. Ms. Bates is a great actor who deserves much better, even if her character does not help the authors in their film. <br /> <br /> Rupert Everett is always trustworthy. His role, like the late Victor Fox lover, is well written, ie, until Dirk has been tempted to come to Chicago to find Victor's murderer. It is odd and it violates all the logic rules. Dirk doesn't seem to be able to fly hurt, let alone killing Grace and his daughter-in-law, with incredible funny Maudey. <br /> <br /> This little woman, Maudey, is one of the best things about the movie. He's dirty and says he sees it. Peter Sarsgaard, the best actors in these days, have nothing to do with the picture; he's completely wasted. Dan Aykroyd has nothing to do. We see him at the beginning and end of the movie, and his Max doesn't make sense. He seems to want to make changes in his life and marriage, but turn back to Grace without any explanation, everything was forgiven. <br /> <br /> English actors are good. Lynn Redgrave has a better hysterical arrow. Jonathan Pryce is seen as a ghost singer throughout the film. Julie Andrews makes a funny contribution to a couple of priceless scenes. <br /> <br /> After all, Sally Jesse's Raphael TV show is off and it doesn't add anything to the movie. The best part is singing Kathy Bates. What a beautiful voice he has! In fact, Mrs Bates is the best way to get rid of the end.
