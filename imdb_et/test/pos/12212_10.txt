When I first started to look at the "surface", I was hooked. It was all I wanted to show in the mid-term review, in action, in the mystery, in the big plot and in the big character. My whole family loved to watch the show. if there is a big show on television, the network usually cancels it like an exhibition. They go through the Nielson rating system, which I find foolish, because there are a lot of spam they see, what the networks are watching for air. If only there was an opportunity for everyone to vote for an exhibition, maybe good exhibitions can't be canceled. TV now, I just look at good shows, so now I don't watch the whole TV. I hope that the network will bring the show back, but if they do so with a decisive decision, they seem to stick to it. I hope there are many people who feel the same way.
