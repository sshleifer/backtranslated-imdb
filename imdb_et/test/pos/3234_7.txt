I think this version of the NORTHANGER ABBEY movie is actually pretty good. It's definitely fun. Well, this is not a masterpiece like PRIDE AND PREJUDICE ('95), but there are very good things ... especially in the city of Bath !!! .. Royal Crescent, Roman baths, an exciting Georgian atmosphere. That's great. If you're like a bath fan, you'll love watching this movie! The performances may seem a bit too melodramatic, but I have the impression that this film, like the novel itself, will deliberately entertain the stories of a novel of novel and terror and age society. The only drawback is probably the female leader, because I personally have another idea of ​​Catherine Morland's physical appearance. The music is also a bit 'unusual', but I find it acceptable, even though it is not related to the historical period. I don't know what old old Jane thinks ... :)
