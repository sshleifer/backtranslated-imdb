I've always been a big fan of "Homicide: Life On The Street," so when I heard there was a meeting movie, I couldn't wait. <br /> <br /> Let me just say I wasn't disappointed. It was one of the most powerful 2 hours of television I've ever seen. It was nice to see everyone again, but the biggest joy was the return of Andre Braugher, because the relationship between Pembleton and Bayliss was always the strongest part of the great show.
