Being a fan of Dario Argento as well as an opera fan, I died to see my first story before it is so good "Dario Argento's opera Phantom". The film is just terrible, even a plot that here is one of Argento's best united stories. How he turns the classic romantic story is terrible. The film has a very spooky feeling that helps you keep the edge of your seat. The colors in Argento's film have never been better than the jaw's falling "Suspiria". Murder is wise and gory, all made in Argento brand style. With this film's eyes, the thing is just confusing and has done much better than Fulci's burst. Action is so-called, but when you see the film several times, you understand the motivation of the characters and get used to it. My two biggest complaints about this are the use of rock music. I think it was a wise idea to mix beautiful opera fragments with heavy metal, but this is not very well done here. The end is very disappointing, which is the worst thing about the film, which seems to be argo to reflect previous "phenomena", but which has done terribly, just doesn't have to stop it. The same happened to the "Exorcist" cut by the director. I wanted them to keep their original end. But still this is a fantastic movie and really black-and-white, just for a series of memorable murders by Daria Nicolod.
