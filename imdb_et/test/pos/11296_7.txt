I just picked it in a decent, if not outstanding, DVD version for one dollar for Wal Mart. <br /> <br /> Run and buy. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure this version is a short, incomplete version published against the animator's wishes in the late fifties, but even in this case, it's an incredible * bargain. <br /> <br /> This movie was made in small pieces in series at the beginning of the 60's, TV channels for children showed that almost all stations took place these days on weekdays afternoon - "Mr. Bill and Bozo", "Monty Gang" (Channel 4, Greenville SC) and Captain Grady (Channel 13, Asheville NC - where I saw it). He made such an impression on the twelve or so old that I immediately recognized it when I noticed it in Wal Mart tonight and seized it. <br /> <br /> Wonderful. You should get it.
