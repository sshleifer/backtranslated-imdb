It seems to me that many people have never seen this movie, and those who usually leave it are really bad. <br /> <br /> For the first time I saw this movie was almost one of those people ... thank God for being patient, otherwise I would never have found such a classic. <br /> <br /> As this movie is funny, it is for everyone who is either a fan of 80's movies or just happens to have a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> I know there are a lot of people who will tell you that this movie has a better look Dead ... what if it is? They were both great movies! <br /> <br /> I can honestly say that Savage Steve Holland is a genius! 10/10
