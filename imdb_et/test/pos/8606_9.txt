Shohei Imamaura Black Rain was released in 1989 at the very beginning of the AIDS epidemic, which gives the film a breath of slow worsening of the victims of Hiroshima radiation. The black rain title refers to a combination of ash, radioactive precipitation and water that fell one or two hours after the explosion. There have been other books and films about the fall of the atomic bomb, but none of them are as unique and powerful as it is. Based on the Masuji Ibus novel, which gathered information on interviews and diaries of real bomb victims, the film depicts the whole family psychologically and physically influencing the bomb year after the initial explosion. It is a terrible vision, but one that resonates with deep compassion for humanity. <br /> <br /> The film begins in Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, when soldiers and civilians attend their usual daily activities. Suddenly, the dazzling light flashes and hears an acute blow. Almost every building is destroyed or damaged after repair. The first atomic bomb that once fell on the city is now part of history. Survivors must somehow restart their lives without knowing the devastating consequences of the bomb. Filmed in high contrast black and white, nature centers around Yasuko (Yoshiko Tanaka), a young woman caught in radioactive rain when her boat drives back to the city to find friends and relatives. In Hiroshima, Imamura shows us indelible images that remain with us: a young boy whose skin hangs from his body, asks his brother to recognize him, the older man is tears when he is unable to release his son's debris, mother. is embarrassing when he tends to have his child's dark body. <br /> <br /> When the family returns to their countryside, Yasuko's life has changed forever. She sees her friends dying around her and waiting for the inevitable radiation illnesses that have already affected her uncle Shigematsu Shimuza (Kazuo Kitamura) and Aunt Shigeko Shimuza (Etsuko Ichihara). Assuming that normal activity is only, the family denies that the bomb has affected Yasuko. "He forgot about how Hiroshima and Nagasaki were destroyed. They all forgot. They forget about fire hell and go like annual festivals. I'm sick of it," says friend Katayama (Akiji Kobayashi). Yasuko internalizes the tragedy, fears that it is different from others and is guilty of contamination. <br /> <br /> When her aunt and uncle try to find her husband, eligible men refuse to marry her after her suspicions of health, although Shigematsu has copied her diary to prove she was not directly exposed to the bomb. The only one he knows is another injured man, Yuichi (Keisuke Ishida), who has a panic attack every time he hears the noise of his engine. Finally, the beauty of life shows itself as short as Yasuko goes into the pond and sees the sight of his longing for his life, the king tends to jump in the water, playing as if he said that there is still joy in despair. Unfortunately, we hear from politicians' radio statements that the bomb is being used again in the Korean War. "People don't learn anything," says Shigematsu. "They are suffocating themselves. Unfair peace is better than a legal war. Why don't they see it?" Hopefully, Immamura Black Rain has enabled us to see more clearly.
