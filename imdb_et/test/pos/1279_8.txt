A rude person, known as Bill, lives in a small tough apartment with a wall-mounted Marilyn Monroe poster and a corporate typewriter. Only man can't write anything. He travels along the streets along the streets to see where they are going. Maybe it gives him inspiration to write. He starts to follow a well-dressed man with a bag. He will follow him for a few days. While in the cafe, a well-dressed person sits on Bill's counterpart and asks why Bill is watching him. A well dressed man says his name is Cobb. Cobb then surprisingly tells Bill that he is a burglary and even begins to steal Bill with him; although Cobb demands that he not go to other people's homes to simply steal. She says she likes to let people know she's been there and cut off their things for granted. He puts tricks on another burglary, for example, in men's pants. <br /> <br /> The film is also occasionally spotted by setbacks. The director used this technique in his recent function Memento. Bill finally decides to cut her hair and dress at Cobb's request. She meets a blonde woman in a club who is still the owner, a bald man who is very dangerous, she says. We see a scene where a rock man uses a man's fingers in a blonde woman's apartment. These are some pieces of the ball that the director shows us, and they all fit in when we come to a surprising conclusion.
