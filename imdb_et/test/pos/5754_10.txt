I own this movie on a DVD and I watched it about 10 times and it's still funny. Jokes never get bored and I often broke laugh at inappropriate times, but thought about them. It is a prerequisite that the famous Richard and Eddie of Bottom are the cheapest hotels in the UK next to a nuclear power plant. They desperately need money, and if the hiding movie star luck, it may be. <br /> <br /> To watch this movie and not totally boring or disgusting, you must first like humor. Some would say that only hardcore fans really enjoy watching it. But in general, it's a great movie.
