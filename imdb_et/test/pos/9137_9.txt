Everyone likes a cool, memorable movie. Alain Delon offers antihero, Melville offers cool and handful of other great talents (mostly Yves Montand, Gian Maria Volonte and Andre Bourvil) to add a crisp movie ... <br /> <br /> very little dialogue. This is great, because one aspect of the genre tends to be a lot of dialogue involving quick responders and their different repartories. However, this movie could be viewed when the sound is completely turned off and not too daunting. Not to say that sound is bad, and no, jazz soundtrack and sharp sounds that catch small movements, make patients slow, patient discussion very weighty. <br /> <br /> What this movie really is about is that the color art is pretty fantastic. Usually when it comes to cinematography, black and white films tend to stick to my mind, but this film has some very strong and beautiful shapes that make the movie a visual entertainment. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
