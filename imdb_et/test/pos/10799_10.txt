From compensation I knew it was a great movie, tempo, operator, natives of the Dallas region, diversification of characters, not to mention director Oliver Stone and of course Eric Bogasian ... The film starts on Friday (at first glance occult) and starts with a radio station in Dallas that organizes its number-one radio show The Barry Champlain Show (based on Talk Radio Host Alan Berg) ... Barry (Eric Biogas) is an abrasive radio show show player and his job is to devote all his audience to the sensational nuances of his show ... He's trying to force him alone, vulnerable changes in society. Barry Champlain, who has a masochistic craving for being publicly frightened, is effective in coping with this insecure scream by casting them down socially, rather than simply submitting them to calls. logs serve a dazzling purpose for Dallas radio audiences and highly understandable thoughts take the perverse back, talking about "baseball results, orgasms, and human pets!" <br /> <br /> The whole thing is the drug cacophony induced diatry and potpourri for psychopathic paranoia! This high-profile cannon feed is something Barry Champlain is booming !!! Collapsible sinus, uncertain proclivities from pornography inaccuracies and porridge, and general pop culture ailments for voluptuous ammunition for Barry Champlain's dirty combat forces! <br /> <br /> The setting for this movie is perfect because there are two thousand foot drops in ideology. The Dallas Center has a cosmopolitan awareness of overflowing, with 20 miles of an important chapter in Ku Klux Klan ... Game in Denver This is where the real story takes place, while other small theaters show the cities of Louisville, Atlanta and Cleveland. Dallas is the city where the film takes place, I thought it was a great choice! ... This film shows how people have a terrible and erroneous and deadly misconception about the Jewish people in America, where they control the banks, their agenda is different than everyone else and their intellectual literature leads to a perverse! These predefined concepts combine the general dilemma of Barry Champlain !!! The personal withdrawal of Barry Champlain is that he is reluctant and does not react to his alcoholism, and his abrasive and politically controversial nature is his final setback, making the film so plausible !! <br /> <br /> The movie was well depicted, Dan, who is a custom middle-hatchet man (played by Alec Baldwin) who is constantly watching Barry Champlain for every move !! .. Laura, her girlfriend, also her producer, is constantly Barry's someone who has always misunderstood! Ellen, her ex-husband, is the recipient of Barry's anxiety and selfishness, but she can't really give up her feelings, despite the personal destruction she's doing! The Dallas Radio audience is a melting plate for socially misplaced retrobats who have been dementedly amused by their real disadvantages !!! ... Partially all Barry Champlain's built-in hangings are Barry Champlain! ! His audience ogles mercilessness, seeks improvement, and finally turns Barry Champlain's pet project into sinners! Conflicts of social culture become Barry Champlain's fall! <br /> <br /> This movie is great !! In my opinion, Oliver Stone is the best picture, including Plato and the natural born killers. This statement tells you how wonderful Talk Radio is ... The story of Eric Bogosiani consulting and acting and co-production is just convincing! Camera Angles, Dialogue, Haunted Characters, All Upper Limits .. Dallas Silhouette Cinematography at the End of the Movie is Terrible! Dallas has a dubious distinction between a larger metropolis ... Like now, like Los Angeles and New York, there are too many childhood cases to calculate, cheap housing districts of Hellist and budget cuts, which means a significant number of people who are dead next year! !!! ... Dallas confirms the status of its metropolitan area with uncertainty about how human devastation prevails! The city has a list of radio listeners who have given a pejorative spin to admire the national airflow! These are the culprits in the movie! Ghoulish tabloid abandons who wants to meet a big bad wolf, and their decadent curiosity has morally destroyed America's last neighborhood
