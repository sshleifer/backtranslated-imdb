Every year, no one can forget the highly anticipated red hot big budget, which has the right combination of a star, director, and substance that will not fail in the office. This year it was Superman Returns. In 1982 it was a Blade Runner. In 1957, Billy Wilder's St Louis spirit, a film that had everything - a top manager, a big star, the most sold real story of the American hero - except enough audience to cover his expenses. Perhaps the public still remembered Lucky Lindy's anti-Semitism and his hard admiration for the achievements of the Nazi Germany before the war (not covered by a film ending with his arrival in Paris before the legend faded). Perhaps because they thought they knew this story or that it was just one man who was stuck in the cab for two hours. Certainly, Wilder and co-author Wendell Mayes are aware of the dramatic bonfires of Lindbergh's infinitely endless flight, alternating between a well-executed setback and the main points of his life, and his own flight. When the film is in the air, it is both surprising and tense, finding real dramas with wakefulness and navigating without suitable means. <br /> <br /> It also creates a rather remarkable sense of fear that is nothing else. Wilder's filmography, related to the epic real idea: pictures like malicious storm clouds over the hanger, dark dawn before the flight bears a real prophecy. Even traditionally silenced and problematic, WarnerColor adds the film rather than reducing it. In addition to the excellent use of CinemaScope, Franz Waxman has a remarkable score: majestic, jumping, but underestimated with a threat, and is used skillfully as a film, not just a musical accompaniment. The film loses points that mean, though never actually saying, that it was the competition that was the first to fly the Atlantic - in fact, Lindbergh was the third person to fly over the almost forgotten British Alcock and Brown's amazing flights eight years earlier - But it is still a very tense and tempting adventure story that deserves the success he never found.
