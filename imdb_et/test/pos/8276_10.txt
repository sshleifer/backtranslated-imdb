I was - unlike most reviewers - who wasn't born in the 80s. I was born on May 14, 1994. Nevertheless, my life was in the style of the 80s. When other children played playstations, I played Zeld in my NES, and so on. Now this film has a special place in my heart, even though I am only 15 years old when writing this review. Because of my 80-year-old childhood, I watched several TV shows and saw many movies that other kids didn't see, and this movie was one of them and one of the biggest. <br /> <br /> Starts at home in Los Angeles with Alvin Seville, Simon Seville, Theodore Seville and David Seville. Chipmunk's Adopter David is going to the airport sooner when he goes on a business trip across Europe. His taxi is almost there and Chipmunks helps him pack. Although they speak, Alvin expresses his will to come with Dave and see the world (although technically Dave goes to Europe only, so Alvin is probably the only American and European "World"). David leaves Chipmunks under Miss Miller's care, which is boys' dissatisfaction. Soon, Dave will be at the airport and Chipmunks will be left with Miss Miller. Later on, Chipmunks play in a local caf√© against Chipetts (Brittany, Jeanette, and Eleanore) in '' Worldwide 30 Day ''. After losing the Brittany game after eating his balloon with a crocodile in the sky, Alvin gets an argument against Brittany who really wins the whole world. Two diamond smugglers sitting at a nearby table, listening to Klaus and Claudia Furschtien listening to their arguments and needing a safe way to transport their diamonds around the world, decide to fool the children to deliver them. They create a contest all over the world where each team has to store the doll in their own similarity (secret diamonds) around the world and become the diamond of the similarity of the puppet team (which is a secret payment) to "change that they were there". The winning team will then receive a $ 100,000 fee. They do this because they believe that Jamal (an Interpol agent who has been around for some time in hot heels) would never question them because they are just children (but it seems superfluous because children do not have to go through their trips no security checks and never been questioned by the dolls, I suspect that neither Klaus nor Claudia could have taken the diamonds personally. This movie is classic and I see no reason why nobody would want it. It has great animation and a top-notch voice, not to mention Kick-ass music (Pardon my french: P). My favorite song is without a doubt: '' Rock and Roll 'Girls and Boys'' An amazing rock song that can't be upgraded. It's also my favorite moment in the movie. Other remarkable songs include '' Getting Lucky '' (for a film for children?) And '' My Mother '' and '' Wooly Bully '' and '' Off to see the world ''. During the opening ceremony of the Royal London Philharmonic Orchestra, she heard the film's main theme. The 'My Mother' Scene Still Tears the Eye. With the song '' Getting Lucky '' I didn't think of anything at all, but when I got older and learned from life, it became clear that this song was a bit encouraging. This song, with the animators demanding an audience who knows the color of Chipettes panties. This is especially evident at the Egyptian scene when Chipette is driven by the men of the Arab princes, when Eleanor leans over the side of the hot air balloon and his skirt is full of gravity. Although it does nothing about the overall quality of the film, it is one of the inexplicable reasons why no one in the world thinks that the 4-foot-long Chipmunks will walk and speak with incredibly high voice and treat them as if they were every human being. Anyway, a bit after this scene, Chipettes dolls discover diamonds and decide to find Chipmunks and go home. Janice Karman's direction complements this film as her and her husband Ross Bagdasari Jr. They even make Chipmunks and Chipettes voices. Ross makes Alvin and Simon (as well as Dave) votes and Janice makes all the voices of Chipetts and Theodore. Nancy Cartwright (Bart Simpson's voice) speaks to this film when talking about male characters expressed by female voice actors. He plays a part of the Arab prince, which is a very small but important role. The end is, of course, happy. Crooks are caught, loose ends are tied, and the movie ends when children, Dave and Miss Miller, go to sunset, Alvin complains that he hasn't received his $ 100,000 reward for winning the Dave, until he finally shouts '' ALVIN! '' And the screen goes black <br /> <br /> The classic ending, by the way. I hope you've found that reviewing my movie is useful, and if you haven't seen it, look at it, it's worth the money. This 80's nostalgic classical class gets 10 to 10 solid. <br /> <br /> '' Headin '', don't you know! we never stop believing now ''
