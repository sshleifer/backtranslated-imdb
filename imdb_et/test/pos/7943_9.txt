The school taught how some of the frames were invited and two leaders constantly mentioned: Orson Welles and Sergei M. Eisenstein. I don't care much about it (I was a child!), But now I know why, Eisenstein is a genius and it is a shame to see what was possible in 1938, when for almost half a century we have caught countless blank movies! Some say that this movie is not worth the Eisenstein gene (then they have to watch it again and again until they get a bad say) or even worse that it is just propagandamovie for Russians. Let's say it as it is, it's really pure propaganda for patriotism, but isn't it "Personal Ryan" or "Longest Day"? Could I summarize as many films where America is raised to the top, so why not Russia, and after every war, fight for isriotism, why would they otherwise raise the flag? Alexander Nevsky is a must for anyone who cares about cinematography, because almost every shot is a superb picture. Maybe it's all been tracked, but I'm wondering why it's not in the IMDB Top 250, where so many overrated Oscarcraps are.
