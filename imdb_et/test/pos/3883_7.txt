James Aaron, a chubby actor living in Chicago, is a man who loves to eat things that are not good for him. It has been made clear at an early stage, because Dick, a friendly store manager, advises him to stay away from junk food. Aaron, an actor working in another city in Chicago, is a loving man who doesn't have much luck in the love department. She still lives with her mother, a cheerful lady who encourages her to go and enjoy. James has another job that is a kind of gross "Candid Camera", where people are created in unusual situations, such as a mechanic's surprise, and tell him he's a daughter's father he never knew. <br /> <br /> On the day he meets his friend Larry, he will find out what is his appeal for transforming his favorite film "Marty". Being a big man, he clearly identifies the character of the film. In many ways, James's own life is parallel to the creation of Paddy Chayefsky. He wants to try this part because he knows he can play the role correctly. <br /> <br /> One day he meets Beth with a soda fountain. Jacob loves a woman who one day invites her to shop for her closest clothes. She got sex with her, I thought they had a nice thing, but Beth has another surprise when she tells her why they went to bed because she had never done it with a fat man. After disappointment, James stumbles upon an attractive primary school teacher who seems to share his love for jazz. Finally, we look at James, who fulfills his long-term dream of "Marty" theater production at a nursing home. <br /> <br /> Jeff Garlin, a pleasant person, shows the talent of his type with the comedy associated with his friend Larry David. Although both men are different in actress style, taking money from James Aaron is right. As a director, he has done this before, although it is the original concept he should follow. One of the assets of the film is the people involved in the project. Sarah Silverman gives the impression she takes Beth. Bonnie Hunt shows her teacher's role in good results. Ms. Kolbit is considered her mother, she has played a role in Curb Your Enthusiasm with great results. Director Paul Mazursky also has a small role. Joey Slotnick, Tim Kazurinsky, Richard Kind, David Pasques, Larry Neumann Jr., Gina Gershon and the rest give valuable contributions. <br /> <br /> Jeff Garlin is a talented person whose next effort is welcomed by his fans.
