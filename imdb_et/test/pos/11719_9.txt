Intense, dark action drama with unusually rich support from Casey, Keith, and others. many of them get the best roles in their careers and work with them. The film has a strange shape - the activity often slows down to keep the characters odd but well done in seemingly improved dialogues - almost all of the "machines" came in perfectly delivered humorous monologues. Reynolds deserves a lot of credit for Reynolds being a step back and giving them room. And unlike most movies, you really like the characters that make the 2nd half if their different destinies are good and bad, which has an unusual effect. Character development, brutal violence, jazz soundtrack (Tarantino must be a fan - look at it and then "Jackie Brown" and see what I'm talking about) makes this occasionally faulty movie (bad guys are a bit melodramatic) one of the best modern police films and I think better than many overpriced modern noirs like "Body Heat" and such.
