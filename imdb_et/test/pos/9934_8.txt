After killing the opera's leading actress in a car accident, his youthful Betty is in the foreground. It is very happy for him, with one problem: he has an admirer who has decided that he will kill all his friends and make his watch. What is his relationship with opera and what is his fascination with Betty? <br /> <br /> I love Dario Argentot with every part of the body. And I don't think it's an Orthodox fan. Many people, especially critics, praised their earlier work ("Suspiria" and "Deep Red"), but cherishes later films like "Sleep", which I liked. My favorite, "Phenomena", is usually significantly underestimated. "Opera" tends to fall somewhere. Some see it as one of their last big films, others see it as part of their so-called fall. I loved it. <br /> <br /> The picture is crisp, the music is great (unlike other critics, I love the metal soundtrack), the female leader is that I feel (not unlike Jennifer Connelly, "Phenomena"). great cinematography and some amazing kill scenes, the concept of killing needles in human eyes so they can't flash ... brilliant, my assistant Tina thinks it seemed fake, but even if it is, the idea is more than enough. And some big effects, like a knife blade that comes in a person's mouth? Awesome. <br /> <br /> Jim Harper calls the film "stunning" and highlights "innovative cinematography, well-built frames, and extraordinarily violent murders". completely - one picture follows the camera through the windings through the tunnels, and the crows are a very interesting visual use for the whole story, and Mike Mayo also calls it a "visually exciting eye candy" and praises "crisp editing and running the camera". e is really a wonder that it is not one of Argento's highly appreciated works. <br /> <br /> Argento returned to the opera "Opera Opera", which was a bit unsuccessful despite his daughter Asian and Julian Sands. Even more interesting this year was Michele Soavi's "Stagefright", which (like "Opera") released the theater, kills the people involved. Both are great films where Soavi is more on the slasher side. (Soavi was "Opera" as the head of another unit ... you can make your own conclusions.) <br /> <br /> My only complaint with this film is length and pace. Although it is very beautifully captured and the scenes are glorious, they are not as frequent as they should. The first takes over half an hour and then we fall between the ages. The leading actor should be in constant fear, but he will be given time between killings to calm down as if everything were normal again. Not cool, Dario. We need to keep the sacred low and the intensity.
