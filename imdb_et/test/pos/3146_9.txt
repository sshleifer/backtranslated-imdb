"Shorts" in the world (most of them are not) is a film of pearl. <br /> <br /> A quiet, short look at the young woman's world, a blind woman's reader. here are the stars Elizabeth Franz - this film carries the visual narration of textures, layers and visual stories. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is minimal, cinematography is stunning, and direction is clear, convincing and convincing. I saw this movie at a film festival that took place in a hard and crowded Tribeca bar - and during the first two minutes (and for the first time at night), the crowd remained silent. <br /> <br /> It says it all.
