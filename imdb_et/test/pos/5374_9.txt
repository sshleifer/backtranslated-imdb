The 70s were a great time for scenes. Satan's brotherhood is another remarkable pearl. It's extremely full of very surreal and unpleasant scenes. It's also good to see Stother Martin and L.Q. Jones (who also produced) in decent roles. <br /> <br /> Some of them are little dated and cheesy, but Satan's brotherhood is fleeing with Race the Devil and many other 70's Satanism dashes.
