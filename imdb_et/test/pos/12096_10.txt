This movie is one of the most memorable films I've seen. I reluctantly went to a Turkish friend who suggested it. I am not a very enthusiastic proponent of documentary documentaries, but when Aurdur, a Kurdish woman who had been singing in Turkey for years, sings her works, the theater was frightening. I'd give you everything to hear the CD of this haunting and proud song. And he is just one of many interviewed and recorded artists, talking about his experiences in Istanbul. Already, a month later, I remember Aynuri's footage in the acoustic auditorium and try to remember music when it was in the cinema. Well done film director Faith Akin and his great idea to collect many great sounds from such a cosmopolitan city. I would definitely encourage me to visit Istanbul.
