One of the best, Lackawanna Blues <br /> <br /> Great movie, great cast, great music, it's one of those movies that is so good that if it's over, you'd like to continue for another 90 minutes. several times. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that grabs you from the start and emotionally twists you with the whole function. The cast is extraordinary without anyone being uncomfortable in their role. You have the feeling that you really take it all. A lot of care was given to the period sets, costumes and music. The relationship between our meetings is as simple and complex as the film continues, but Mrs Merkerson's persistent power is so powerful that the film ends before we have met the great malformations. All other than "Nanny" displays injustice because we have very good performances by excellent veteran artists, including: Jeffery Wright, Jimmy Smits, Terrence Howard and Delroy Lindo. But that is Marcus Franklin, Macy Gray and Mrs Merkerson, which makes it a great experience. <br /> <br /> Film moves fast and is short for today's standards, but it is undoubtedly one of the best films. we see this year. If you like the good pieces of the period that are challenging you emotionally, you will draw you to the heart, cheer you up and knock your feet at the same time, this is a movie for you. I have shown it to several friends and they all want my copy that says everything is so good. Check it out for yourself. <br /> <br /> danceability-1, Amsterdam Holland
