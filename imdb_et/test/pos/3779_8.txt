In the last film of 1918, Chaplin is a friend of dough who doesn't see him marching straight. He spends time in the "world" of the First World War. Several gags stand out: Limburger's cheese is a place of grenade. The pitfalls of the mines' barracks and when Chaplin and his associates are washed out of the nests due to the floods are highlighted. Chaplin hits several German soldiers with one hand and the German-speaking leader refuses to give up the cigarette. When asked how he did, Chaplin replies that he surrounds them. Chaplin hides the tree of things behind enemy lines and these scenes are very funny. She flees to a bombing house where she meets a French girl played by Edna Purviance. He monitors the German soldiers, removes them and removes Purviance by helping him. Chaplin is able to pull quickly with the capture of one soldier and a soldier's uniform. He will, of course, end the rescue of Purviance and the capture of Kaiser. Along the way, Chaplin uses some visions when returning German soldiers. With this film, Chaplin explored the possibilities of filming, keeping the audience alert to the length of the feature that his contract with Mutual Film Corporation prohibited. The film also gave him the fun of the enemy, which he would again be more influenced by the larger dictator. *** 4 stars.
