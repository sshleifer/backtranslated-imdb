I probably watched this movie more than 20 times. The jokes are now 10-15 years old, but every time I look at it, it is down from my board. Here are the two main actors Salman Khan and Aamir Khan. Even though Aamir Khan is a much better actor and has a better role to play (a smart man) in the movie Salman Khan is suitable and sometimes even a better guy. All the characters are memorable. This movie is full of fun single-layered and funny situations (a little too silly). Don't try to look for logic in this movie. Let your brain relax for a while. I promise this is a memorable experience.
