Red Skelton (first starring) plays Wally Benton, who plays "Foxit". He writes about the mysteries of the murder and when "Fox" solves them. Joseph Jones (Conrad Veidt) is trying to find out how to make a perfect murder. He kidnaps Benton, his girlfriend (Ann Rutherford) and another girlfriend (Virginia Gray). He says Benton is writing a perfect murder ... or his girlfriends get it ... <br /> <br /> A very funny and enjoyable movie. Fast movement (only 77 minutes), a good script and perfect casting really put it over. Skelton is very good in his first star - very funny, fast, beautiful and intelligent. The face is great as evil Jones. Rutherford and Gray have a lot of fun with Skelton's girlfriends. All three of them play great each other - their verbal sparring is the highlight of this picture. It is also fun to see the small role of Eve Arden. <br /> <br /> Well worth your time.
