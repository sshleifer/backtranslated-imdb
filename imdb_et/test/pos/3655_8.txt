On one level, Hari Om's film is from a familiar genre - a film of tea - that tells a familiar story: a curious West explores the mysterious East. But from his heart, the film is about two people, a young French beauty (Father) who has lived perfectly and a motivated rake leader (Hari Om) with Bollywood aspirations, from very different cultures, their slowly growing attraction to every other and beautiful crazy chaos that is India today. The gap between them can never be overcome, but the director manages to bring these two things as close as possible without compromising the credibility of the story. India and its people are important components of the narrative, and apart from the main characters, the roles are played beautifully and convincingly by the local people who have been recruited during the film production, being on the way between Indian cities and villages that make up the film. One main downside for the viewer: Keystone Kops pursues the film's summary as Hari escapes from the mobsters who have curved their gambling debt. But the closed scenes where the Father and Hari say goodbye are surprising and unforgettable.
