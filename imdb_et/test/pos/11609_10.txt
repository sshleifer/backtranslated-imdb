I've seen this big movie in Fantasyfilmfest in Berlin and when I went to the cinema, I felt like I was stunned under * g *! I've really seen a lot of movies and there's just anything I would call perfect, like Fight Club or Koyaanisqatsi! Unconscious cruelty is now one of them! Half of the people who watch it in Berlin went out of the room and I understand it completely because it can be a real shock to someone who lives in his perfect world every day, dreaming of his dreams, not thinking about our fear in our lives! I don't think I have to describe the story of the movie because people are already on this page! This is a movie that shows everything and more !!! 10 points + 10! It would be cool if the people who loved it would email me! So far, I have never met anyone because I am impressed and delighted! Finally i apologize for my bad english-i haven't learned a person (und das ist auch gut so !!! :-))))))
