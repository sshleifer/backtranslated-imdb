A beautiful, sensitive film that brings home the ineffectiveness of wars and cruelty regardless of the causes. The performance of Cage and Cruz was quite impressive, but the older Greek characters are characterized by the highest. Irene Papas is as proud as ever! While some scenes seem a bit long, this film is a difficult Oscar candidate.
