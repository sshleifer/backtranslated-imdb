It's really too bad for anyone to know this movie. I think if it just got up and if it wasn't such a small budget, I think one of the biggest movie companies would have wanted to take it. I saw this movie for the first time when I was 11 years old, and I thought it was as big as the many, but illegal, lengths that Mitchell is going to keep for his family. It inspired me and it amazes me now. If you have managed to find a copy of this movie, don't miss it!
