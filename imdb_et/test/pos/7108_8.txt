"House of Dracula" is a good sequel to "Frankenstein House". There are not so many measures, but action is just as good. Onslow Stevens is a benevolent doctor who takes blood from Dracula after a blood transfusion (Dracula actually got "wrong", but he spelled a delicate sister and then blood transfusions). It turns out that Dracula did not really come to look for treatment, but instead put the blood out of her beautiful sister. Dracula is destroyed and Wolf Man is for the next treatment (which is successful). Meanwhile, Frankenstein's monster is discovered and revived briefly before his death (don't worry, the same trio came back to "Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein"). John Carradine plays again the poor Draculat (Baron Latos at his alias at the beginning of the movie and in the "Frankenstein House"). Lon Chaney is a sympathetic Wolf Man and Glenn Strange return to Frankenstein's monster. Lionel Atwill plays the inspector again, which he often does in Universal Studios monster films.
