Some people have access to only 3 neurons, one to eat, one to breathe and the other to s ** ting ... It's not a movie for them ... <br /> <br /> But those who enjoy the brain. The whole movie is a metaphor, everything is for that purpose, every single detail, a coffee pot, a red sofa, everything ... is an underestimated masterpiece ... <br /> <br /> It's fun, it's raw and completely realistic, how are we actually communicating ... this is a royal comedy ... all the causal relationship ... <br /> <br /> Just hang, don 't let the first scene shock ... ... hang ... and enjoy exhibition.
