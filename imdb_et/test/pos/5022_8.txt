I've made a lot of international trips for both business and tourists. For both types, I assure you that the best advice is also the oldest: always drink national wine. In this film, Michael the Archangel comes to business on Earth, wraps it up quickly and decides to hang around a little. Boy! Does he "drink a country wine." <br /> <br /> Will a person forever drink, love, and fight? These are things you can't do in heaven, so he enjoys them when he's here! Of course it turns out that he had a few other jobs, and if he is less direct than he was the first, he is just as successful. The final scene is small but also wonderful. Jean Stapleton dances with John Travolt.
