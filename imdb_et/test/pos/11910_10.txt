I don't understand how people didn't like this movie. You have Gossit Jr, a boy who played the main character Stand By Me, Sean Astin and many other great actors. Lots of activities and fun that you no longer see in today's movies. It's really a shame. <br /> <br /> This is an underrated movie that is among the other great movies, like Let's Get Harry. In the early 80s and 90s, great films were created that are never supported by today's standards. <br /> <br /> They tried to restore this movie to Mastermind, but they came short with some very bad effects. The only thing the film had gone was Patrick Stewart, but apparently it wasn't enough.
