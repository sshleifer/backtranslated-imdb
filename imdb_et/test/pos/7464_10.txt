My friends and we rented this movie just to satisfy a friend who had leased very hard, despite not knowing what it was. We all thought it would be like a "Canadian American pie", but when we looked at it, we were all surprised, and we all loved it! It was not like American Pie and he had a plot that teenage girls would certainly adore (seeing when the boy beat him at the end), then after that night it became my favorite movie not only for this plot, but for actors and great writing. There was no moment when I thought it was incredible. Everything is very realistic and relates to small prospects in small towns. I absolutely adore this movie and I would recommend renting it next time if you have the opportunity, it's worth it.
