The copy of the movie I've seen is not very good. It is grainy and in some parts there is almost no color. It switches between English and French, often in the middle and sometimes even in the middle of the word! To make things worse, there are no subtitles in English that make up at least one quarter of the movie. But amazingly, this movie is still very understandable and enjoyable, even in this situation, and I think it says a lot about how well this movie is. <br /> <br /> Great actor, interesting story and great music score. It also has a cool main character, a beautiful dark hair girl, some strange characters and events, and a general melancholic feeling. In this film, "Euro" is written everywhere. <br /> <br /> I hope there are pristine negative or printed films out there, because it deserves a high quality DVD, and when it comes out, be one of the first to get it!
