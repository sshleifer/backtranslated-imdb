Now it is for sure that Bruce Will has been one of the lightest stories to date - it is still relevant. I really like Bruce's style and personality, I haven't loved everything she's ever had, but she brings it to most of my film projects for a great time for me. <br /> <br /> The story begins ..... He has power, confidence and style with capital "S". He leads Porshe, who lives well, in a palace building with a great view of a fair city. It's Russell Duritz. He is an image counselor for those who are up or up. His appreciation, he's Russell Duritz, he knows what he's doing. It just seems that if life goes fast and basically, the problem, the intruder at his home, is activated! <br /> <br /> Russell is currently unable to find out what is happening to him. It's different and yet it's familiar. A little boy who looks just like ...--. As their life runs odor with each other, it seems to have screaming reasons: "You have an unfinished business to take care of now!" <br /> <br /> Amy's young lady story is probably the best balance she has ever seen and had in her life. He works with him, stops his "ego" and is still robbed with Russell. Very much. When Rusty in his past "spoke" in the past and speaks a mile a minute, sings too late in the night, everything that was the foundation becomes like jelly! <br /> <br /> Willis is a fun, egocentric, and sometimes out of his head in this lovable Disney's modern classic "Kid" and adding his low-strength side line, Spencer Breslin is a great addition to this sparkling childhood story for an adult and childhood adventure. Chi McBride is an inspirational supportive character because she is a heavyweight master, teaching "little" rust, how to play against the playground fighters. All in all, this is the true winner of the film, even though Lillie Tomlin is Russell's secretary and assistant. I saw it initially in 2000 and then again a year later, with equal enjoyment. This is a shiny family comedy with a super ending that warms the hearts of all the Disney fans (*****)
