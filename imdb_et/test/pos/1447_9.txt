If you like your movies to pull your emotions out of you, if you like your movies, where you can root and relate, if you like black and white movies, you have to see this movie! Look at it from start to finish, because you don't want to skip. Sometimes it is slow and it makes you think when something happens, when the plot starts to open, you are on the edge of your seat! I know I was! My mother told me about this movie because our family had the same things that happened in the movie. We loved Frankie, who is convincing. Whatever you think of Frank Sinatra, put it aside, he's skinny and he didn't sing, so keep your mind open. For the era in which it was made, this story is still being spoken today in homes across the country and most likely in the world. Please see if you want older movies, try it.
