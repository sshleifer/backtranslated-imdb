The standard bearer for all the movie series, a solid good man - Flash Gordon - against Bad Guy - Ming the Merciless. Although the special effects seem terrible to today's standards, they were the upper limit in 1936. But the essence of the story is the battle between Earthman Flash Gordon (Buster Crabbe) and Mongo Emporer Ming (Charles Middleton). Crabbe and Middleton are terrible in their parts. And the supporting characters are playing Dale Arden, Dr. Zarkov, Princess Aura, Prince Barin, Vulcan and the rest are very good. This series is much better than the 1980 film, mainly because Crabbe is much better than JJ Jones than Flash Gordon. <br /> <br /> This series is the standard carrier for all film elements. There is no question about that.
