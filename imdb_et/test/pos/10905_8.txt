this movie is extremely funny and enjoyable, with appropriate, funny and experienced pains. I find that this movie is enjoyed not only by humor elements, but also in different scenes of music. A good comedian, Kevin Kline, has done a lot of work with a movie with Tom Sellec, who is amazingly different from many other movies. The humor of this film is buggy, which makes various exaggerations of various scenes, especially of the starting bits. Joan Cusack is also very funny and exaggerated; the same applies to all other pains. This movie has many funny humor elements and it is enjoyable if you want to laugh.
