In Hungary, in November 1956, it is a story of foreign citizens who tried to leave the country at the time of the resurrection. <br /> <br /> Once the airport is closed, the bus starts with a bus that takes them to Austria. As would be obvious, they will be stopped on the road where they will come up almost flawlessly with Yul Brynner, whose military power as Red Army Major was celebrated with loneliness, his inner struggle between right and wrong, his search for truth, and his need to feel emotions for other people. He was sad that his work had passed him on to his friends and enemies and he wanted social contact. <br /> <br /> Robert Morley plays a basic rigid overpowered Englishman, no matter how serious his role is, to maintain an almost mild logical outlook on life, while Jason Robards has a stunning movie that enforces the reason he had all his life. so many roles during the career. Deborah Kerr, a leading lady, exhibits the grace and femininity we have come to associate with her, but she can bring the strength and solution she needs for her character. <br /> <br /> The film takes a very busy time in European history, but it doesn't need to remind us that we all have a good one and you will never be able to fully appreciate the book. Fabulous scriptwriting ensures that the seriousness of the whole subject can still have large liners and comics that add a film rather than a movie. The spin and mouse game between Kerri and Brynner will help you understand why they appeared in more than one movie. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a very appealing movie that I will definitely watch again. 8/10
