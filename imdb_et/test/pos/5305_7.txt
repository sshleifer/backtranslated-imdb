For a long time as a fan of Studio Ghibli and especially Hayao Miyazaki, I went to the film on the opening day. When I left the theater, I had such a strange feeling that something was missing, the "magic" feeling I experienced in all Miyazaki films, but I couldn't tell why this failed this time. After thinking about other Ghibli films, I can find out the reason: this film had the most important elements of Miyazaki's anime: lovely characters, wonderful key animation, Joe Hisaishi's excellent soundtrack and a warm story that made you feel like watching a high-quality Japanese animated film. However, there were no two elements: deep story and dramaturgy. The purpose of this film was obviously to have small children entertained with a simple storyline like "Totoro", so the complicated story "Breathed Away" or "Princess Mononoke" is not really necessary, but on the other hand, this story was just too superficial. I couldn't get in touch with the main characters because there was no character development, dramatic scenes were only limited and didn't last long. I really hate to give only 7 stars to Miyazaki's film because I would give all the previous films 10 stars right away, but this time it wasn't just a wonderful "ghibli experience".
