Let me start by saying in general that I enjoyed The Long Kiss Goodnight. I'd give it 7/10. Good: 1. Acting: Samuel L Jackson is fun in almost every role. In this film he doesn't play his usual character, the type that is under control, instead Geena Davis is under control and Sam is driving. His timing on his lines is great and he is the highest point of the movie. Geena Davis also gives an excellent result as Samantha Caine / Charlie Baltimore. He is a credible hero of deeds and I don't think too many other actors could fail Geena Kas. Action 2: This is a very actionable movie. Things are always crashing or blowing, or someone is chasing someone else. Special effects are pretty good, especially for almost 8-year-olds. I see the green screen stuff, but it does not diminish too much performance. <br /> <br /> Bad: 1. Why did half of the film take to create a plot? This movie had to be edited at the script stage so that it didn't work as long as it happened. Maybe drama or something like that can be steered for a long time, but people have to keep the movie constantly for the whole time. I think if you can get out of the first half, you will be on the other side. 2. Geena Davis is cold weather and the top of the tank, but she never seems cold. 3. Some things are unrealistic. Sam Jackson flies through a giant mark after he has dropped out of the room and then lands on the tree and just rises. If you see this part, you think it's gag. fun movie 7/10
