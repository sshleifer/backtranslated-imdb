The Prime Minister suspects the exploitation of the unexplored and excluded seekers of truth and justice, Jane Tennison, a detective commander; the first of three miners (PS4, PS5, & PS6), where loans showed a significant lack of a Lynda La Plante writer. The first three series with double reality, against Tennison, against other forces of evil that will cope with medieval, loneliness, indiscretions, personal and professional problems and resolutions that are sometimes less than ideal. The PS4 is two stories, while the PS5 & PS6 are single episodes, each of which finds that Tennison is brutally seeking justice for wrongdoing when he fights against institutions that are willing to sacrifice their victims for greater interests. In other words, Tennison has to overcome both the evil and the good forces that make the PS series always gray-hearted, and Tennison's wars both in principle and in finding murderers. Very good things that are getting better from the series. (B +)
