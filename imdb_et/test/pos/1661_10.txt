There are not many movies that I would describe as perfect, but Rififi is definitely an invoice. No other film has come close to it before or after. The plot is simple but surrounded by you. It doesn't stop me anymore, how to grab a movie every time you look at it. You care about all the characters, although they are bank robbers, because they are presented as human beings with all their problems and shortcomings. In the role of Tony le St√©phanoise, it is difficult to imagine any other actor beside Jean Servaise. When team members talk to everyone about what they do with their money and finally reach Tony, his answer and expression are all in his form. Though the 30-minute sequence of throws is the most famous part of the film (and rightly so), the film actually gets better later. Director Jules Dassin knew what he was doing when he decided he had no music at the time of the stage or the final. Shootout, but Tony entered a great climatic score towards his fate during the final race. To think that if American director Dassin wasn't on the black list in Hollywood and forced to work in France, this cinema would never have been made. Certainly it would not have been as good as it would be with an American film over time. It was absolutely terrible what Dassin was supposed to go through, but he did his best work for the benefit of all of us. I'm just talking about the thought of the future Al Pacino remake. Most crosses because Rifif has already borrowed it or another. There is no reason to rewrite this masterpiece after money. Leave the classics alone!
