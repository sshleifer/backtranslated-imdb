At first glance, a city flooded in 1955, such as Northfork and a 6-seat group sent to evacuate the rest of the city, would just be a normal film. As we will soon meet the rest of the priest who takes care of the sick child, the greedy landowner, we could create a simple story that we can all easily digest. However, when this film is first introduced, you will notice an amazing wide-ranging cinematography and church hall with no walls opening to pastures and picturesque mountain views. It will soon become clear that after this scene and some of the introductions of the peoples of the city that it is not an ordinary film and a normal story, it is something very special and unique. <br /> <br /> At first glance, things are not as clear, but the cinematography and the terrain that the viewer is witnessing are stunning, and the characters that characterize this little dead area are just amazing. This is what can draw you closer to this qwerky movie, or whether you are bored sitting there waiting for something to happen. <br /> <br /> Movies have deep spiritual and dreamy qualities, give him a slow, and methodological approach, I'm sure it was wearing some viewers, but if you're patient and see a bigger picture, the film is a great witness. <br /> <br /> Rating from 8 out of 10
