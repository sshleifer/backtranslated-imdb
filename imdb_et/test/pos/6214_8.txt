This is a wonderful look, you should forgive the bear, 22 women who talk about the chest - theirs, their mothers, other women and how they affect so many aspects of their lives. Young girls, old women and all (all shapes, sizes, configurations, etc.) talk about developing, responding, marking, hiding, enlarging or reducing their breasts. <br /> <br /> It's charming, delightful, sad, funny and all in the meantime. Intercut documentaries and the clips of these famous old "young women movies" that girls saw at the cafe are an exciting window for men who love women and their breasts, which the other party says when they don't know you're listening.
