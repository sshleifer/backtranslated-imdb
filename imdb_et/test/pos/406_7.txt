You have to be terribly patient to sit through a one-liner film that is so flat and uncomfortable that you don't know what all this noise was like when WISTLING IN THE DARK opened such an enthusiastic greeting in the 1940s. <br /> <br /> In addition to some weak liners and ordinary sightings, the plot is pulled as far as the Fox (Red Skelton) talks to its radio audience. You have to think why somebody thinks he could find a real solution to how to make the perfect crime and abandon it. But then, it's so unrealistic that comedy is. <br /> <br /> But if you are a true Red Skelton fan and look back on how comedies are made in the 40s - you can at least enjoy the friendly majority that supports him. Ann Rutherford and Virginia Gray do well for their love and Conrad Veidt, as always, makes an interesting cable. One of his funniest moments is his reaction to Skelton, explaining the secrets of wearing turbans. "I never knew it," in the mouth, impressed by a somewhat clever introduction. <br /> <br /> All in all, typical nonsense that requires you to accept a lack of credibility and accept them is. Not always easy for a discriminating viewer, as many of them simply fall off, as many of the comedies of this age do, because the novelty of the eyesight and one of the linings is simply worn.
