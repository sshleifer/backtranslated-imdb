Despite me as I like this movie. Pauley Shore is always ridiculous and there is no exception here. He's just great, who's playing with a golden heart. Perhaps it is because he is a boy who is easy to crash. <br /> <br /> Keyboards in this life are very fun, and how Shore's cousin, Crawl, has such a contradictory way of life is also funny, but it's not just that who catches the water; comedy also stems from the fact that any "ordinary" person or people is indexed as a man's senseless nightmare. That's why this movie works in such a great way: we love Crawl, it is the breath of fresh air, but we can also express sympathy with the ward. He is one of the hell of a cultural shock. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is a classic Pauley Shore, you don't need a lot of brain power to enjoy the movie, and enjoy it, and even "never compose it under this cover" type of morality here somewhere. Not bad, not at all bad.
