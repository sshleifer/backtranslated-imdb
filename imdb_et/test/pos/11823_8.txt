This is one of the most touching movies I've ever watched. No movie has made me so. It's a great movie and you have to see yourself. Usually, I find it impossible for these filthy stories to film, but it did for me. I was at the end of the tears. You want this film-like friendship. When I get this movie, I get a billion stars.
