When I was in 7th grade (1977), I was asked to read a novel based on my English class studies. I remember being very touched and excited when the television version came out a year later. <br /> <br /> Kristy McNichol was a popular TV actress when this movie was introduced and already played in her daughter's dysfunctional family in the TV series Family. It was clear that he had that part and we could pull that part. I sometimes remember him a bit "stiff" but he does a good job. He wears the film well. <br /> <br /> Esther Rolle is fantastic as a homeowner who seems to be the only household that really looks after him. Barbara Barrie as a somewhat frightened and somewhat neurotic mother is also good, as is the young Robin Lively (who eventually appears in the black widow Lana Milford "Twin Peaks") as a sweet younger sister who appears to be the center of her parent. affection. Bruce Davidson is also a good title, a German soldier. <br /> <br /> But the best performance comes from Michael Constantine. It is truly powerful and deserves more recognition than it was at that time. It expresses bitterness and frost, which changes the scenes it is difficult to see, but which is much easier to understand the silent despair of a rejected daughter. Constantine gives everything to the right intensity and she seems to have a good understanding of psychological motivations. <br /> <br /> The film differs from the book only in small ways. It's wonderful and inspiring to look at, and I hope it will appear again on video or DVD. <br /> <br />
