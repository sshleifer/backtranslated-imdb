SPOILERS AHEAD ------------------------- Mel has done this. From open credits to final credits, this film is laughing. Dave Chappel shows why he is a comic force. Cary Eewes carries most of the time, but the support cast is strong when the plot is away from Robin Hood. From the very beginning, this film announces that it will not be taken seriously. If you took the time machine and gave the thoughts of this press, you would get that movie. What makes this movie special? Throughout the film you will see blinken and acuhu walking alongside each other as Robin Hood's sidekicks. But this Blinken is never spoken or understood to be black until the crowd says "black sheriff", Blinken repeats "He's Black". It's a timeless scene. Easy is the most enjoyable film of our time.
