How often do you see a movie that has a talent show with snacks? The Waldo Last Stand is refreshing. Here, Waldo sells lemonade, but does not make money. Lucerne, Spanky, Darla, Mickey, and Tatar come to visit him, which is ironic because of the 3 men in the room as well as shooting where there was competition between Alfalfa and Waldo against Darla's affection. Back to Story: Gang tastes lemonade to see if Waldo did it right. One funny moment is when the alfalfa gets a glass cup of lemonade and Waldo fills it and gives it to Darla and the alfalfa has an angry expression on her face. Spanky offers a lemonade floor, and even Mickey ever agrees so cute. If the floor plan starts, there is no one, but then the client (Froggy) comes. Spanky asks her if she wants lemonade, but all she does is nods. Spanky asks her a lot of time short and every time Froggy doesn't see that none of Spanky sees many expressions that are funny. Spanky tries to make a number of ways to quench her thirst. One option is, after Mickey once said so nicely, "These crackers are salty and they make me thirsty." There are also many entertaining music, it's short. The opening number is Darla, whom she dances and sings. The second involves the Alfalfa song off-key (as usual) with Mickey, Leonard, Spanky and Tatar about "When dry I'm!" (I believe they are singing to make Froggy thirsty. It also made me laugh.). The final number is for boys and girls dressed in old fashion. It was Waldo's last of our Gang short. A great musical short, which is pure 10 out of 10.
