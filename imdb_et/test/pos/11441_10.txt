This little film brings back many memories that are both affectionate and bad about what gets and what happens when a person is a working musician. Not so pleasant for the ensemble, management of the place jumps up and down, tells you what to play, applause for ecstasy, .............. In fact, it is very accurate about how musicians who are professional and otherwise, who have gone a long way to organize the season. There are times when everything goes perfectly, there are other times when you start to miss your partner right now and wonder what the hell you are doing far from home. Finally, you have to do it because there is no other way out.
