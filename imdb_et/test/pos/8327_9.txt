If you haven't seen it yet, you should actually have a DVD. I can't believe how much I enjoyed it! It is amazingly realistic and plausible. True, much of this has been speculated, and I would have liked to know more about what was speculative and what the proven facts (many of them are not), but it does everything pretty well with the "cruel mother nature" theme. It reminds you of the nature programs you've seen on Animal Planet and Discovery Channel, only the animals here are dinosaurs. They act naturally; they eat, kill, mate, play and fight for survival. You really find yourself rooting against some and others. <br /> <br /> Mostly, the effect is great. Sometimes they look a bit like CGIs, but then you see them at a different angle, which makes them more realistic. In some cases, you are actually convinced that you have seen a dinosaur. My favorites were Coelophysis, raptors, diplodocus, iguanadones, allosaurus, and arctic bipeds. I was the most disappointed with T-Rex, which seemed too few computers at times. <br /> <br /> In any case, you should definitely see this production. It's educational, well done and fun. What it is, its A!
