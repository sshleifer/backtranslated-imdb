The Vampire Prince falls on a human girl without knowing that her brother is a famous vampire man. This is the theme of the martial arts rhythm that borrows "Underworld" and "Buffy The Vampire Slayer", but manages to maintain its style. I was confused by Britain and Hong Kong entitled "Gemini" because the story is not twins. It turns out that the two main female characters are played by Hong Kong pop stars who perform "The Twins". Don't let it put you down. These girls can act (at least well enough for this type of film) and add a lot of charm to the procedure. Jackie Chan appears on a couple of pairs of images by adding his own brand slapstick chaos. All in all, it is fun for those who like their vampires, helping with language-in-cheek humor.
