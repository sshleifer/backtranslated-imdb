The 2006 Cannes Film Festival and the fairly famous film seem to be another modern and deep school lesson. It's about the number of adolescents who go through the school's revealing and desperate days. Everything circulates around suicide, which is to some extent at the beginning of 23:37. The characters are somehow related to each other. They are moved through short interviews that are strictly captured in b / w. The characters are well written, acting intriguing (especially Teresa Palmer as Melody and Frank Sweet as Marcus has discoveries). <br /> <br /> Capture the film technique. That's what I really impressed. There are rarely cuts, most of the time the camera follows one main character, such as the elephant of Gus van Sants. Some scenes are played more often than once, but each time from another perspective (here: sign). It will definitely create a slow-developing but thrilling atmosphere that will literally pull you down. Colors are viable, somehow inappropriate, given the tough plot - but it's nothing but a clever contrast, a disturbing "everything good". The use of lighting is always sufficient to emphasize the mood of the characters. And finally, there are decent music layouts. <br /> <br /> 2:37 somehow it starts with you. It does not compromise or laugh. Rather, it combines what psychologists would define as terrorist acts. This film mainly focuses on emotional layers. There is no one who should handle any neurosis, even if the smaller parts (eg teachers) appear to be in some situation. And it really keeps this movie good. Its suppression of tragedies is unrealistic for very bones. Not: friendship, love, smile, truth, passion. There are: forgery, humiliation, despair, illness and beating. It's like having a face that is really hard at all times, but you are dull after the first hour. This flick will keep you until it reveals something quite instructive. <br /> <br /> To be sensitive and wonderful: 9. To be technically innovative and original: 9. To be the same size: 3. <br /> <br /> Make it solid in 7 out of 10.
