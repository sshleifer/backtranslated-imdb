I have never read Jacqueline Susan's novel, but I have also seen the Dolls Valley, based on her second book. In both cases, I was thinking that the film is probably better than the book and improves with age (definitely the opposite of books). The reason is that the film focuses more on the specific style of fashion, design and behavioral patterns. And in this aspect, Love Machine offers quite a lot. The kit design is perfect for the story. And all the characters fit well. They are perfect so that they fulfill a well-balanced overall picture. They are superficial and do not develop, this is true, but in this film I would not like it different. <br /> <br /> David Hemmings repeats the role of Antonion Blow Up. And it's more than a rip-off. She is a fashion photographer, looks visibly outdated and seems to start sowing a little. Robert Ryan repeats the role he played in Max Oph√ºl's Caught, he is again Smith Ohlrig, greedy, boring and boring, uninspired and uninspiring. Maybe Ryan did not want to be in this picture and act accordingly, on the other hand he could think a lot and then carefully studied the results. Whatever happened, it fits the picture. Dyan Cannon is a great (fantastic wardrobe!), He dominates every scene he is in, and participates in two highlights of the film: the luxurious bed burning and the knocking of Hemmings character with the Academy Award. The title, The Love Machine, is of course ironic. Robin Stone is a kind of pop-era Barry Lyndon (by the way, the film is a little kubrickysh). He seems to choose a television station to work his way up. He sees love (ie sexual advantage) only as a means of personal advancement. There are quite frightening hints of worrying sexuality that is not explored in the film. Homosexuality is treated very randomly and not likely as a standard for the mayor's films. The open cynicism of TV leaders does not have to fear a theme such as A Face in a crowd or online or a Truman show compared to other good films. They produce crap, they agree that they are crap and they know they do a lot of dough. <br /> <br /> I did not regret spending 108 minutes with this film and would not be surprised if it rose from the cult when it was given (DVD edition).
