If I ever write or do movies, I'd like one of them to be like that. I enjoy humorous sense of humor and fun. This movie makes stupid things without it. The names of places and characters are invaluable, Generic New York High School, Squid Calimari (George's sister), etc. I've seen this movie so many times because it was the backbone of cable TV when I grew up, of course I didn't get all the fun back, but it was still funny. This movie is a time-consuming classic.
