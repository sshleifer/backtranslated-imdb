This short is one of the best of all time and is proof (just like most of Charlie Chaplin's work) that sound and color are not quality work requirements. In fact, this comic (and possibly started) uses some gags and devices that are later animated to a standard like celebrity cartoons (including Chaplin mentioned above. Although the characters are silent, they speak) like the word "balloons", as well Comics, as Felix started as a comic in the newspapers, this device is natural and the short atmosphere and style is perfectly harmonious with the addition of another dimension (literally and figuratively) and makes it a short joy to watch. It takes time and effort to get.
