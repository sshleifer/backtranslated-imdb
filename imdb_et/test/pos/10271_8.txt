Slick production, which has an interest in the first scene, where Max chooses around the jewelry store. Much of this follows reminds us of Shakespeare's "Mid-Summer Night Dream", in which Demetrius and Lysander fall in love with each other's girls. Here, Max and Lucien, both of whom tend to love at first glance, mix with Lisa and Alice, and Alice makes things worse when she adds. In addition to joyful blending, Max is ready to take part in incidents that bring back two years of memories. And since Max has a lot of these dreamy episodes, we have another fugitive, too much in my opinion, because when I first saw the movie, I wasn't sure if I was present or in the past. many running corridors, stairs, doorways, lifts, etc. I accept everything in a fast-moving movie, but do we have to contact so many people? After four clashes, there is no effect any more if you apologize for it. High marks of art design! The apartment itself is beautiful and tastefully furnished, but I ask myself how a couple of young women can afford such a luxury in Paris. Recording a person who wants to jump out of the window of suicide is always fascinating, and this is also the case when Max leaves almost at the same time. But a kiss or two makes her feel better. If you manage to find all the way through all the setbacks, you will eventually find yourself at the airport where Max's dedicated sister gives her the most loving kiss. It can be said that he solves the complications of love, such as Puck, in the midst of a medieval dream.
