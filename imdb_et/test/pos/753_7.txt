Nurse Charlotte Beale (lovely Rosie Holotik) has been crazy for a new job at Dr. Stephen's Clinic. What he does not expect is to find another presumed doctor in his post after Stephens has attacked an ax-dependent manic "judge" Oliver W Cameron (.. during a running hat when he is facing a situation under his control, he repeats his name ). This doctor is Geraldine Masters (Annabelle Weenick) who is not sure whether Beale is suitable for their establishment. After a long discussion of the situation (which is a rather uncomfortable scene when two discussions about Beale were sent to Stephen to work in a clinic where Masters often reminds him that he is no longer responsible) Masters agrees to let him work in nursing position but good the doctor may not be the one who looks like it. <br /> <br /> In the Loonies assortment, Sam (Bill McGee) is a simple-minded child who was Stephens's last victim of lobotomy, a woman of Jennifer (Harryette Warren) who needs adults to comfort her when she comforts her Master's puppy, Danny (Jessie Kirby), who often makes a fake baby with Harriet (Camilla Carr), Allyson (Betty Chandler) is a sexy nymph who just wants to be loved and hunk with any man she sees, & "Sergeant" Jaffee (Hugh Feagin) is your typical case for a soldier who has not escaped the madness of war. /> <br /> The film shows the Masters' unusual methods of operating the clinic, allowing patients to roam free doors to all rooms without questioning their locks ... and not to mention that Oliver is still allowed to move around, despite dr. And what exactly happened to Dr. Stephens? Ah ha .. <br /> <br /> The Tacky 70 trash can be a lot of fun if you are somewhat distorted in the cinema. I've attracted strange beats for mental rejection because of their unpredictable nature .. you never know what hell can happen, especially if they are often allowed to be unattended. Some will have a low budget commitment, but this film will improve the experience. With cheap photography and weak production values ​​(taken off in a terrible house for peanuts), it seems to be horrible and I felt it was a voyeur who hides crazy through the camera lens.
