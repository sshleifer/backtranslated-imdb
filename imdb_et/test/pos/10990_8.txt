Being in the Buffalo area, I was well aware that the film had read many articles in local publications. I was most impressed with the film, especially its smart plot, exemplary and local scenes. Nice to see so many older, high-quality letters in different roles. I feel especially those who are over the age of 50 find the movie great and you can leave the theater feeling that your time has gone well.
