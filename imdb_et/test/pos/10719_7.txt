I've seen this movie on three different occasions. The first time I was over this movie. It appeared to me as a very kind movie. I hated this movie as sentimental garbage at my second viewing. But my third review confirmed my conviction that it was a good movie. There are many emotional abilities in this film, especially the scenes of emotional confrontation between Mr. Kramer and Mrs. Kramer. There are some scenes where Meryl Streep is a cruel person despite being in real life. Hustman seems to have disappeared as a heroine who is unable to grasp the recent task of caring for his child. There was even a contradiction about this set of films. he just escaped hurt when Mr. Kramer's character to show the intensity of his anger decides to break the glass. Fortunately, nothing happened to Nestor. Kramer v Kramer shows the destruction of the family structure. how f If children are involved, they should be carefully preserved.
