'' Meet Sherri ... luckily Pleasure and Terror! '' Special Special Effects, Cheesy Lines, Yep Its Original 1978 Movie '' Nurse Sherri '' Starting with Geoffrey Land as Peter Desmond and Jill Jacobson at Sherri Martin and director at Al Adamson. <br /> <br /> The movie has about an evil ancient spirit that has a nurse in the hospital, so he starts killing doctors one by one. The operation was okay, but some of the operations were robotic. The storyline was good, but the sex scenes were just there to get more views. The leadership was bad, and the special effects looked like a drawing, the effects did not fool anyone. too many things out there that didn't make any sense like sex scenes, nudity, soccer player and more. <br /> <br /> Generally it is a good movie, but not the best. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
