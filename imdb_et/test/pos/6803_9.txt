One of the enduring classics of MGM appeared in the late years of World War II, a film that changed the stars of the young Elizabeth Taylor. He had made some films as a child's actress before National Velvet, but when he came out of his films, he was sure. Ironically, he had grown biologically fast enough after National Velvet had stepped out and his next struggle as an actor was to gain significant adult roles, as casting directors saw him as the innocent little Velvet Brown who loved him. <br /> I am not sure how this would work, because the sharply dug horses must be certified blood circulation, and Pi is a topic that National Velvet does not address. We all know that he is a reckless and uncontrollable horse in Reginald Owen and that, after he is free and causes considerable damage, Owen will be freed from his nominal local butcher Donald Crisp. <br /> <br /> While these things are happening, Mickey Rooney talks about the Brown family, consisting of Crisp, his wife Anne Revere and her daughters Angela Lansbury, Juanita Quigley and Elizabeth Taylor, and their little brother Butch Jenkins. . Rooney is a former jockey who is now on the road and goes to the Brown family, where his father was once a horse trainer of the Anne Revere family. This is the one who sees the potential of the Pi (short of pirates) as a drastic leap, and that is Elizabeth, who persuades Crisp not to pass this opportunity. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Taylor was both sweet and innocent in National Velvet. A good book says you must have faith like a child and have it free. He infects Rooney with it to believe in Pi's heart and abilities and leave him a bit behind him. <br /> <br /> Anne Revere won the Best Supporting Actress Award for National Velvet. She is a very wise mother, with her hidden depths that the audience does not doubt. It turns out that in his youth he was famous for his fame and swimming in the English Channel and his prize money, which saved all those years, he gives his daughter. This scene is probably his Oscar won. National Velvet also won another Academy Award for film editing. <br /> <br /> Over 60 years after he made his debut at National Velvet, the family's classic thing is gone. The formation of world wars in Britain is still special. And National Velvet launched the film legend. Can't do much better than high respect.
