This film, based on the true story of Gerrit Wolfhardt, is one of the best films I've seen in South Africa's racial relationship; a very good lesson from the confusion of the 80s in South Africa. I put it in American history X, in so far as it depicts how a young man can seduce Aryan's doctrine and how "certain" segments of the Christian church taught false science of race to justify injustice. <br /> <br /> This is a strong message of forgiveness and redemption that is rare in today's movies. Violence is well done to show the seriousness of Gerrit's crimes and the size of his transformation. <br /> <br /> One word from Jan Ellis who played Gerrit Wolfardard. He will lead you through the beginning of Gerrit's darkness to his enlightened transformation. He went to some dark place as an actor and was praised for his actions. <br /> <br /> Another special show was Mpho Lovinga, who is the victim of Moses Morem, the crime of Gerrit. He was able to pull from some place that really touched you when you looked at his work. <br /> <br /> Very good movie to show teens.
