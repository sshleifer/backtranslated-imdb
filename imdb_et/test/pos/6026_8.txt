I came to the last stop one day in a video store and sold it for only $ 2. I decided to try it and bought it. It was pretty good, I enjoyed it. The story is about a number of people who somewhere somewhere somewhere in the office. There's a police officer, nancy, his former girlfriend, two brothers who just came out of prison, an older man and his lover, a black man and a couple who have cabins and their raised son who never talks. Suddenly, it is found that some are murdered and a cash bag is found. Everyone is a suspect. The last stop is a pretty good thriller, I'd give it 8/10
