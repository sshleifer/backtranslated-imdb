When I started to look, I thought I was watching some of Koresh's amateur documentaries. But I had never seen 3/4 of my film footage. They interviewed people saying that the FBI / ATF encouraged all those things that sounded so far, but then followed the FBI video and testimonies. I was surprised. The documentary followed the investigation of the Senates after the fire, and after the interview and the video footage, you are shocked at how the Senate and Prosecutor General turn their backs to Davidian basically to cover FBI / ATF aggression. If you look at it, you must stop it. Otherwise, you think this is something of a propaganda.
