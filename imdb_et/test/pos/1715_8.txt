One of the most successful exhibitions in television history is back. Now I testify that I never came to the original show ... Okay, so I haven't watched it at all. But the new exhibition is impressive. <br /> <br /> Sci-Fi has premiered the first two episodes of "Rose" and "End of the World" this weekend. Let's meet Rose, who is twenty officials who are run by remote-controlled dummies. He saved a mysterious stranger who calls himself a doctor. Through the Internet, he finds a conspiracy to warn him that wherever a doctor goes, death follows. When his geeky boy Mickey has been replaced by a specialist, the doctor will tell him about the plot to use the Earth as a growing area for more of the plastic monsters that the doctor has won over space and time while traveling in the 50s of Tardis. -style police call box. <br /> <br /> He will help him save the world - not shown otherwise - and decide to join him. But when he puts his life at risk, he has failed and doubts whether his company was worth the risk. <br /> <br /> Although the special effects are cool and some scenes are a bit tiny, "Doctor Who" (after two episodes in the US) is a smart, well-written job. Probably the second season is already in the UK, so I predict the same success here.
