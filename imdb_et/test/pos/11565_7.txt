This is a lovely little French quiet comedy about a man who contributes to the other that he cannot stop this castle for one hour because of his haunting. And when a boy enters the house, it looks much more like a crazy sensual house, or maybe like the LSD aftermath !! Although there are ghosts and skeletons, the animals are also strange menagerie, odd special effects and gags. It is terribly difficult to describe, but only the visuals make the movie worth it. At the same time, realize that the self-directed director also had many funny gags that fell completely and injured the film. His "camera tricks" were not that complicated, but tedious and stupid. EXCHANGING THEM AND ITS - it will improve. The film is fast paced, funny and worthwhile. I especially liked watching Max Linder's behavior and looting - he was so expressive and funny! Too bad that he is almost forgotten today. For an interesting but very sad reading, check out her IMDb biography.
