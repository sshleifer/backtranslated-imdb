Although sometimes I was the only cinema that laughed, this is the main joy I dug in "thirst" - laughter. Although sometimes it seemed that the film had an identity crisis, and that he did not know whether it was a tragedy or comedy, the darkest humor appeared at regular intervals. <br /> <br /> Of course, it helped make the standard of action for all involved wonderful, and that I was a little obsessed with the sometimes misguided leading lady who was proudly elegant, no matter how bloody soaked and malicious she was. <br /> <br /> I read the comments that suggested this movie was too long. I didn't think so. In fact, the last scenes, moving and fun (I mean, brown shoes ....) alternately, one of the best in the movie.
