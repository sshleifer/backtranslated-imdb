Captain and Tennille have released a very good 3-DVD package with minimal editing. Unlike most different demonstration projects, these exhibitions have not been hacked to bits. The musical and dance numbers are included with the sketches as they were for the first time. I suspect that there are some musical numbers on the DVD edited for exhibitions where they did not originally appear, but could not check this doubt. I have noticed some contradictions between what is on the DVD and the program data on the network. I have not been able to check whether the online information is inaccurate or whether the musical performance has been changed to DVD shows. Regardless of what the truth may be, I appreciate the efforts made by the manufacturing company. I wish every release of the released event would show respect for the same form. I think about half of the exhibitions have been added. I believe they came up with problems with rights in examples that were not involved. Hopefully these issues can be resolved and Volume 2 can be released in the future. Includes some individual music videos with a dance suit. I recommend this DVD to any C&T fan.
