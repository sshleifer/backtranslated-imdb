Two hours ago I watched this brilliant film that amazed me with his imprisonment. It is perfectly understandable how he won the Cannes 2000 Best Camera Award. Close the walls, people and many other things. Warm colored lighting (which is also usually done by the director) gave the film a warm atmosphere. Most of it is just two people. An interesting music and especially three songs or themes accompany the movie all the time. All these themes represented a certain atmosphere throughout the film. Film is a quiet and slow motion. Some scenes were longer moments or serious close-ups. Not only did Tony Leung deserve the prize for his great actor because Maggie Cheung was so brilliant. I don't know how many dresses she had in different scenes. The story was also related to the history of Hong Kong and the region in the 1960s. This prevented me from understanding some of its details especially at the end. In a nutshell, I would recommend watching the artistic film fans in the cinema.
