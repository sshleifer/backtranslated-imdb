I can be sentimental. But I found this movie really moving. It was the first film that made me tear. And it did it more than once !! I recommend it to anyone, both gay and str8. Religious or not! Supporting co-star Jackie Bisset stole the show, especially with one of her liners. Nude scenes were also superbly designed and all had good taste. The most shocking was the portrayal of the Mormon-oriented direction-orientation programming by the Mormon Church. It shocked me that it is still happening in the world. However, I enjoyed the movie enormously. This is definitely the best gay movie from Torch Song Trilogy. And much better than the other gay movie that this year - Fluffer.
