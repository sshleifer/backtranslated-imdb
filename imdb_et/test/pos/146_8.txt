When things get worse, he's trying to keep his humanity left behind ... The Vampire Story injects new blood by putting simple things in perspective. <br /> <br /> These vampires have reflections and not fangs, but still eat and die the same. Realizing the main protagonist as a priest really opens the worms that question them.

Movie. We see that the daughter raises her mother to the board in front of everyone, and when she understands her strength she just puts on the chair and continues. Pleasant. <br /> <br /> The final act would not be on the film or even on the three Stooges because the couple is fighting for survival / death. <br /> <br /> CGI is exquisite and fantastic, and the scenes where they jump from building to building are so graceful that you can watch ballet. <br /> <br /> The vampire type knows fresh and lively after that, but more importantly, the eroticism and intensity that most vampire films lack in these days. It is violent, but the director concerned did not expect anything else. <br /> <br /> Truly interesting story with fantastic characters and beautiful cinema.
