(Some Spoilers) Faced with the middle life crisis and married to their marriage to Cindy, Teddi Siddall, who seemed more to say what he did and where he stayed then Air Force, USAF elite Red Beret Sgt. Major Davis Bay, Gary Cole, decided to just walk one morning and start a new life as a civilian. <br /> <br /> David was the first to meet this idea when he met Alyson, Karen Sillas, a cute and adorable Halloween party. He kept a secret behind him, saying to Alyson that he had the ultimate secret military equipment that was the perfect cover for him. Returning to Jackson AFB outside Austin Tex, David begins to explore his life with Cindy and the USF and decides to change his identity when he leaves. Then David calls Alyson, who only met him once and makes a date with him. Before you know it, David, who is now using the name Haywood, is married to him. <br /> <br /> When escaping your death in a bicycle accident, Dave deliberately leaves his wife and children cold and gives up his military duty to his country. Dave did not take a long time to find out that he simply didn't like him in civilian life. It is too late now for Dave to return to her first wife, Cindy and her two boys, who are facing a brigade and a military court fight when she returns to the United States. Dave takes the only job he could do to support him and Alyson and their infant son Chris: using his skills he learned in the Red Berets to rob banks. <br /> <br /> Based on True Story Lies He said that Dave Bay / Haywood lives three, not two different lives. One hard-working family man who is a ruthless bank robber and another dead and highly adorned US President and Prime Minister Of GB, American Hero, Gary Cole is very effective at Master Sgt David Bay & husband David Haywood Davides activities, though unforgivable, understand his depression in Cindy's marriage. but he would have had to look for professional advice from the US Air Force, which he would have been happy to offer, rather than to choose a simple way out. He eventually led directly to Levenworth Ferderal Prison. Dave thought his career would have been a bad sign, as well as his ego to get help with his problems. <br /> <br /> Karen Sillas as Alyson is the glue that keeps the movie with her first with her new husbands to explain their frequent disappearances, some even two weeks, when she takes hidden action to keep the country protected from domestic and foreign terrorists. The real reasons for his long absence were due to his planing and robbery. It was the only way he knew how to earn the livelihood he studied in subversive activities, all those years in elite-red beta. <br /> <br /> Alyson watched Dave's mother, Carolyn Bay (Linda Goranson), who said she was a little boy, died in Portland of the truth about the double or triple life she had led since she married. As a result, Alyson found out about his marriage to Linda and the two sons he had with him, as well as his fake death and now AWOL from USAF. Being a true story, the end was the end I would have thought it would be in normal Hollywood or television. It makes the movie "He says it's much better than what you would have expected."
