If you like the dignity and the best values ​​of your sports movies, it will work for you for a long time. Is it universal at times? Of course, this is - and proud of it. This is Carnivi's biggest and best ride and should be enjoyed. <br /> <br /> Great product values, simple message, creative images: it's not complicated, it's a very nice and remarkably sweet movie. Bill Paxton seems to be a work of love; and I bet your son will get it. <br /> <br /> Collecting is slow enough to enjoy it, conflicts and British and Americans interact to some extent with the wacky villains, but the dignity of the two main transatlantic protagonists is always at the forefront. I have small grips: the score wants to be James Horner, but is too crowded and there are too many close-ups and shots in 2005, but if you want a simple, decent and beautiful sports film, then this is the case, and I feel I know my movie, but I liked it more than Seabiscuit: what is a better movie, but the Greatest Story is just Disney's core and immensely enjoyable! Thank you, Bill.
