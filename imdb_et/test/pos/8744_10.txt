I remember it when it was done, and I thought it was great at that time. Watching it for the second time nearly 20 years later, I still think Traffi is brilliant and much better than the film based on this drama. <br /> <br /> This should also be observed by all of our lost tomorrow's politicians who think they can fight drugs because the issues raised in this film are as relevant today as they were in the late 1980s, and when they will not change the policy, it will be another 20 years. <br /> <br /> Well-written, well-done, beautifully worked and superbly filmed. A provocative drama that raises some of the difficulties of criminal drug trafficking.
