Hummmm, ... Another Keystone Comedy Park !!! It seems that the number one spot on the spot was in the same local park because so many of Chaplin's and Arbuckle's movies are there! And while this is another one, it is quite different and well done that I still enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Fatty is interested in younger than normal viewing and acting in Mabel Normandy. I think he should be a little younger, though in the eyes of his mother he is too young to be interested in men. Well, Fatty doesn't share his feelings and soon he and Mabel will flee for some innocent fun. Things become difficult when the mother's watch is stolen. The fatty finds it and gives it to Mabel as a gift, ... and as a result of many problems. cute and enjoyable little movie.
