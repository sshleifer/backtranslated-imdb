Who plays the role of J. Douglas Williamson in the poker poker scene will do a great job. He probably didn't get a credit. Too bad. <br /> <br /> All Dead End kids do their job in 1939. It's strange to look at them in the west with their Brooklin accent (I think it should be Bowery). They even show some swimming abilities. <br /> <br /> I think there are many special scenes that can be left to this boxer / love / crime story viewer. My favorite is the fight scene at the end of the movie. Busby Berkeley shows the knowledge of his dance film when John Garfield changes his legs and when we look at it, the camera moves on his face. I'm not giving away why or when, but the look on her face at that moment brought the audience in 1939 to the feet in theaters. <br /> <br /> Some think John Garfield looks like Frank Sinatra's many scenes. Just his face. In fact, Frank is still not making films, so perhaps Frank looked like John. In the film, the boxer named Smith, like Beg Begley piano, Jr. <br /> <br /> Now I have to tell you something that is not a spoiler, but when you watch a movie, look at Grandma's hand. Mai Robson is doing his part well. He seems to have a hand that goes a little. In the scene where he and the crowd go into the dressing room of John Garfield, see where he touches the sliding John Garfield when he only carries his own trolley. <br /> <br /> Great End. Lots of great signs. <br /> <br /> The best line can be at a gas station, "... eight gallons, that's a dollar twenty-eight ..." Tom Willett
