After a very long time, Marathi's cinema has come with a good movie. This movie is one of the best Marathi films. This shows how the old grandfather tries to save his grandchild's eye. He's trying to get everything he can to save the child's eye. The doctor and his relative will try to help him in his attempt. <br /> <br /> Grandfather, boy and doctor are just great. They have shown a real picture of a typical Marathi life. Each activity has some meaning in this. I would recommend watching this movie because initially I thought it would be a documentary type, but it was higher than I expected. <br /> <br /> This movie really touches your hearts. such performances come out.
