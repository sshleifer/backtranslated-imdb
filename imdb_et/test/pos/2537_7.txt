It's not a walk in the park. I saw it when it came out and I haven't had any traces of it. You will never see a more horrifying or depressing movie ever. I felt seriously beaten. What kind of world do we live in when we have children who are treated less well than garbage? It is our world that we have created, what we have promised to happen. And I would like to say that I-ME-WE is not responsible for this. Babenco made this film awaken us, shake us into our hearts and succeed. How can we be cruel, self-conscious or careless for our children when we see the graphical results of such behavior? He guides us all to the finger of blame for making it the smallest and least powerful of our society. And if you don't do it every day to prevent it, you're part of the problem. I'm not a religious fanatic, but this film made me think about the state of my soul.
