"The Cell" is an exotic masterpiece, a dizzying trip not only to the massive mind of a successive killer, but also to a very talented director. This is convincing evidence of what can be achieved when people unleash their unimpeded imagination. It is the courage at work, the rejection of thoughts to get into formulas and clich√©s and to create something truly wonderful. This is the best film of the year. <br /> <br /> I've read many film-related complaints from styles and subjects to badly cast characters and bad behavior. To critically criticize this film, this point must be omitted. This film can be a landmark, a tradition where future films will hopefully follow. "The Cell" has just opened another world of imagination. So can we slip the door on our face and say it and its director Tarsem Singh that we no longer want to? Personally, I would like to welcome more than Tarsem's second film and it would be nice to see someone trying to challenge him. <br /> <br /> We've all heard about the serum killer in the talk and yes, I agree that the "genre" is a bit redundant. The 90s were full of films that tried to imagine what makes serum killers; some of them worked but most failed. But "The Cell" does not hit the same path, we are given a new twist, we are physically transported in the mind and are offered nothing more than an exciting journey that has ever been studied. br /> I like how the film does not tell us too much about scientific jargon, trying to explain how Jennifer Lopez actually enters another brain. Instead, he just stands behind the laboratory table and is packed with what looks like a really long Twizzlers and bends to another unit. The "cell" wants to let you see what it is all about and not "how" it is all, and I think that's what some people don't like. True, I like the explanations of my movies, but if you start with a new ground, you must allow it to do what it wants and just take it. <br /> <br /> I noticed how the movie was very dark when it showed reality, maybe contrasting bright visuals inside another brain. However, the design was just amazing. I would not be surprised if this film could have some of the best stones in cinematography, the best costumes, the best director and the like. If it were from me, I would at least be a candidate for the best picture. <br /> <br /> I've noticed that I repeat myself. Not because there is nothing else to say, but because I can't emphasize enough how fantastic I thought the "cell" was. If you walk into the film with a very open mind and want to take it on with miracles and an outstanding party, you have a certain time. I think this movie was just too much for some people, writing it "strange" or "crazy". I'm very into psychology and the imagination of the human mind, so it was under me. When I left the theater, I heard one member of the audience say, "Who made this movie made a lot of good drugs." If so, I want what he smokes. <br /> <br /> **** (from 4)
