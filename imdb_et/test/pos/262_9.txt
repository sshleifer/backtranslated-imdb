This is just one of those movies, you are loving it or hate me, my girlfriend and I loved it, told my brother to rent it, and he hated it, said it was too flashy and spoken, then he usually goes watch big movies so obviously not enough explosions disappointed. There were some great new talents (I would never have heard before)? Especially good was Des Brady (brother of the leaders?). Playing the right dick at first, I thought he would never let himself be redeemed, but he managed to defeat the blind hole he created and finally I was actually routing him. A very surprising film that has a lot of heart when you can live without the hope of the body and explosions, it is very original. Yashimo. Brixton in the UK.
