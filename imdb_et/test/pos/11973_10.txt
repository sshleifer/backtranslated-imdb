Watchers is a fun movie, if not taken too seriously, Dean R. Koontz's novel is probably much better, but the film itself is entertaining. There are many changes in the film to observers of novels, one of which is Travis, the main character. He was an adult and retired Delta Force soldier in the book when he is a teenager. Watchers have good points, the film has some gory scenes. I'm a fan of Micheal Ironside and it was nice to see her in this movie, she always makes a great result in her movies. The OXCOM costume looks like cheesy, but the camera doesn't really show the creature until the end of the movie. The dog Einstien was impressive as it was well trained. <br /> <br /> The film shows two genetic experiments that get to the lab, dog and monster. Both experiments are telepathic because the two animals are part of a military project where the dog would have penetrated the enemy base, and the stories would have been attacked and eliminated. The dog finds a teenager named Travis, who takes him home and finds that he is intelligent, and thus he calls Einstein, while OXCOM travels by killing people and crowding eyes, two government agents are sent to find two attempts before the incident goes out of hand . Soon Travis learns that he is not safe when OXCOM is pulled out of a dog and he does not have to kill him or anyone, so Travis and his mother are going to save his girlfriend, who is being kept in the hospital by two substances. They then hide in the woods while government representatives and OXCOM are not far away. <br /> <br /> The observers are not a great adaptation of Dean R. Koontz's novel, but it is enthralling to the 80's frightening, some fans may not watch it because it is not a loyalty to the book, but fans of the 80's horror movies can watch it.
