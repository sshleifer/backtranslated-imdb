Jamie Foxx is absolutely Ray Charles. His performance is just a genius. He owns a movie, as Spacek had Coal Miner's Daughter and Quaid's "Great Balls of Fire". In fact, it's hard to remember that Ray Charles's part is running and doesn't play it. Ray Charles is legendary. He is a well-known musician and music is deep, complex and innovative ~ even more innovative than I realized before watching this movie. The film should make new fans of young audiences who could find out little about their music. The life of Ray Charles gave the film an excellent biographical material that goes beyond just a film related to music. I admit I knew very little about a man's life until I saw this movie. I came out of it that I am impressed by Ray Charles's courage, strength and innovation as a person and musician.
