Valeria, an elegant and beautiful young lady, lives in a world surrounded by her harsh and depressed walls. Although he may have loneliness, or if someone lives with him, it is not entirely alone. Valeria is also a passionate woman who can take action to approach this special man, Massimo, and at the same time fear, which allows him to answer his questions only "yes", "no" or "I don't know". How the sign is loneliness is great. For example, there would be a distance between Massimo and Valeria, taking coffee in the same room, separated by a fine distribution and without seeing each other. I could mention several sequences, but the movie is better to see. It is impressive to see that the director does not check any details. Although all the actions are performed in slow motion, no shouts, no special effects are needed, but only great exhibitions and a well-written story. I love it.
