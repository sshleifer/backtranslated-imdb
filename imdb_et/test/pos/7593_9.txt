I'm very surprised that so many people don't like this movie. I think it is much better than most recently released teen movies - Ten Things I Hate You (Can We Tell You Whether a Nice Bopper Movie and Basically Writing Their Porn Novels?), Cruel Intentions (If Signed) gives up his innocence after a fun ride), and he's all (mediocre). If you are looking for something that is just fun - I say I've never been able to. My mom loved it and hates movies (one of her favorites is BEACHES). This is a great fantasy about what you would do if you could go back to high school. People who had emigrated from high school probably liked this film better. It reminds me of "Romy and Michele's high school reunion". And the end will stop me the best. Of course, the plot has been made, but many of the last films can be honestly said that it hasn't been done in one form or another. The cast is also charming. And for those who think Drew can't be geeky - he pulls it out great. Another good teenage comedy that I recently recommend is election, but it is rather satiric in school and politics.
