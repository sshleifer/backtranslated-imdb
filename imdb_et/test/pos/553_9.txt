The communication between Portman and Sarandon was quite interesting, and I was really a mother-daughter relationship. This is a family story that is not distinguished by delicacies and special effects; the story of how it really is. I couldn't give it at the end of the movie, but it is unfortunately a well-told story of growing the bittersweet story and communicating with family and friends. The action was pretty fine and I hope we can see both Portman and Sarandon's familiar roles along the way ...
