The Japanese city takes on a terribly brutal abstract shape: a spiral. It becomes a theme for all animals from clouds to people and their spiritual and direct turning. This movie shows that this is happening with several groups of people. Some demonic possession is implicit, but nothing is absolutely certain except that the best choice is to get out of the devil. The film evolves from truly normal life to abnormal phenomena (giant snails and crazy people) to truly supernatural (dead dead). <br /> <br /> As it is a fan of the American horror movie, it was just what I needed. Perhaps it was just a novelty of a new culture film, but it seemed to have a very initial progress, a set of signs and a prerequisite was certainly new. Japanese people may think that "horrors" (Uzumaki means "spiral," I have said) are now old, but it was pleasing to me because I am used to monster / alien / virus / disaster / Undead films. In an American movie, you know who dies (annoying / nasty / stupid / racist characters) and who lives (children / hero / dogs / cats / nice boy). This is not true in the horror of Japan. It was not predictable how they would fight against evil or how it would end. It was also a new (but probably usually Japanese) color soaked cloudy day in the Pacific Northwest style, which was a fresh visual effect for me. The frightening moments were terribly horrible, relying on a small gore, but mostly simply impossible to overwhelm facial expressions (think of the Ring) and body manipulation. It should be one of the surprises, once there are original ideas like the first nightmare on Elm Street or the night of the living dead.
