I saw this movie early in the early 90s when I was about 12.I've been trying to find what it was and finally I did! I remember enjoying it and being a bit overwhelmed at the end when he showed the tombstone of a young boy and his ghostly face! Please, does anyone allow me to do this when I get a copy of it because I would like to see it again. I remember that a child gets off a corn tin mine and then a boyfriend as a friend. you can't remember that the kids were stuck in the miners there, but the boy helps them get out of the mine and turns out to be the son who was dead there.
