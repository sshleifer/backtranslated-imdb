Thank you for the goodness of Coen Brothers. Their success has brought them larger budgets, but does not relieve them of their creativity. I was planning to see another movie, but it was sold out so I went instead. By the time it started, I had forgotten what movie I saw. I was surprised at more than one. This movie is fun, but they don't make cheap jokes just to laugh. Writing is brilliant and George Clooney has gained this great skill (after that, no one can say he is just a beautiful face) and the rest. This can be evaluated at multiple levels, whether you remember Odyssey. I don't remember the last time the movie that was smart. I've seen others that I would describe as beautiful, intriguing, funny and charming, all of which describe "Oh Brother", but this film reminded me of the older seinfeldi episodes where all the subplots finally came together. You may feel that their trip is building something, but you can't say what. And Coen's brothers do not make us unsuccessful, the end is certainly not disappointing. It is surprising and binds all loose ends properly without carrying the story.
