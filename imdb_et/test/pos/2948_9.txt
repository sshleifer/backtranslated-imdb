This movie is remarkable in how remarkable it is. This is a true story of one woman and one man and their success in happiness for the eternal life of the housewife and the "house man". It can be any pair, any family, in any city ... but it makes this story so mobile. It touches us all and reminds us of someone we know and love, or of ourselves. I laughed, I cried, I couldn't think about it ... and what else could you ask about the film? Especially documentary. This is a great movie and what I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys documentaries, stories from families like you, stories about love, life, parenting, loss, expectation, searching for the soul, longing, seeking and searching for life.
