In the eighties, as Richard Bell has written and instructed, there may be too many stories to say at the same time that the 102-minute film is completely successful, but all the cast and team members are committed to the viewer's willingness to work on the movie - and so does. Yes, aspects could have been funded if the producer had more money for final cutting, but as a small independent film from Canada, it is a gentle, gentle humor, very touching story about vulnerability and communication and dedication. It works on many levels. <br /> <br /> In a very choreographic opening, we have a male dinner at a family dinner where obviously something has gone wrong and the result is a father and two sons driving in the car and having an accident where one of the sons is killed. As an introduction, the mood has been set for the surviving 18-year-old Pipi's son (Paul Anthony, who is too old to be a teenager) to destroy his family and live on the streets. He will meet Clark (Clarence Sponagle) male prostitute, who will give Pipi and shelter, Jenny (very exquisite Carly Pope), who will save him from his companion Derek (Ryan McDonell), and will become romantic with Pip and Father Chris (Alan Cumming) as a priest. Pipi's 18th birthday and his father (Serge Houde) are following Pipi to give him a gift from a dead grandfather with instructions to open on the 18th birthday of Pipi. <br /> <br /> Pip, though drinking too much and full of anger, blames the tape machine, but keeps the tape and starts listening to the words of his grandfather Jason (Ian McKellen's voice) who introduces his 18th birthday in World War II, France, where he (now very sensitive actor Brendan) Fletcher has experience with wounded medicine called Macauley (Mark Hildreth, also great) and reflects his one-night marriage cabaret singer Hannah (Thea Gill 'Queer as folk music in fame and beautiful singer and actor here), just to do something live during the war: Jason offers Macauley help when he dies, with the redemption of the two men at the end. The pipi and grandfather Jason's parallels work every time Pip listens to the tape and eventually turns Pipi's views on life and love into Pipi. The subspots are Clark's isolated existence, which was changed by Jeff (David Beazely, a surprisingly fine film debut) who just wants to be loved; an unexpected pregnancy between Jenny and Pip; for the sake of trust that father Chris replaces both Pipi and Clark in a good shepherd way: and a rebound in a car accident where Pip could have abused his brother Daniel (Paul Dzenkiw) in his father, just before the accident, but was unable to do so by opening him deep guilt and the resulting false anger reflected by his grandfather's taped experience. All of these sub-blocks pull together at the end, creating a closing feeling for each involved person. <br /> <br /> The aspects of this film show that it seems to be a big budget: the musical result Bramwell Tovey is filled by members of the Vancouver Symphony, Kevin Van Niekerk's cinematic art is aptly atmospheric, and the overall quality of this Canadian cast is very good. While Paul Anthony is well on his way, taking a very young teenager in a central role has made the story much better, and Richard Bell, who has only one other film "Two Brothers", hopes to look at a young talent. Despite the shortcomings, eighty useful films are worthy of attention. Grady Harp
