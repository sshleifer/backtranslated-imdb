I thought this movie was amazing. I was a little skeptical because I had no idea what it was, but it was a beautiful story. I cried a lot and smiled aloud. <br /> <br /> I think it's very important to create films that are related to the Holocaust and how it affects people (it only happened 60 years ago!) I've been to Germany and Eastern Europe and I've learned the Holocaust, so this movie meant a lot to me. I think this movie made this story amazing work (I don't go into detail, I don't want to break it). But I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a movie that I know can be a clich√©, but your way of thinking becomes things.
