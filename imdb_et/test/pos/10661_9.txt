Eisenstein created the theory of Russian Montage and this film is his best example. It took years before anyone could use their ideas and make them work (The Limey, 1999). However, the stroller scene really shows the inconvenience of RMT. Simple, like most movies, it will change in some parts for a long time, the film's beauty is amazing. One of the best silent movies I've ever seen.
