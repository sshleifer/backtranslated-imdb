Darr (1993) was an incredible film. In my opinion, this is one of Bollywood's best. The film itself creates compassion, fear, confusion, happiness and sadness. The role of Shahruk was unbelievable because he gave the obsession a new face. The character of Chawla's innocent and gyril was largely in contradiction with the hot and passionate nature of Shahrukhi. The role of Sunny Deoli gave a "good guy" role to the "bad guy". The fact that Shahrukh, not Sunny, conquered the audience's attention, proves that everyone has such a helpless inner journey to continue something that is not in their hands. Although the film is several years old, it is all over the last. The song "Tu Mere Samne" was full of passion and meaning. His personality is perfect. He should seriously consider playing again with a similar film.
