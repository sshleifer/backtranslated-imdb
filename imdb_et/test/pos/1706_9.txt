Paraphrasing Thora Birch: "I like this movie. It's exactly the opposite of what I hate in the movie". <br /> <br /> This covert movie was too low a key and intelligent to get the theatrical success a chance would require a costly advertising campaign. And an age-old story where nothing remarkable happens - where instead the focus is on character development is a limited target group. Who has heard of mature teen movie? <br /> <br /> But if you have the opportunity to see it or if you get a few bucks on a DVD, you can do a lot worse. "My Teacher's Wife" is nothing revolutionary, but it has a lot of it and it keeps well over repetitive views. <br /> <br /> Jason London (as a high school senior Todd Boomer) is a star and suits this character as well as his parts "Man of the Moon" and "Frustrated and Confused". He is helping his extraordinary work with extraordinary work. The role of Tia Carrere in the title is revelation (she can act) as a tutor of Todd's calculator and love interest. Christopher McDonald is a teacher with a beautiful, independent performance. Zak Orth and Alexondra Lee like Todd's best friends and Jeffrey Tabor as father. <br /> <br /> As someone commented earlier, this is a "mature" movie, because romantic relationships have generally failed - at least with traditional happy end standards. Even Todd's parents are indifferent to each other, his father polishes the character of the title and his mother (Leslie Lyles) literally on the phone during the entire screen (a device that gives a comedy relief for every successive look). The London-Carrere Romantic is an unexpected charm and is much more plausible than any other older woman you probably find. But the true strength of the film is the evolution of the three friends. There are no burnt melodrama here, but three immature people who alternate between testing and trust, depending on all the dynamics that three young people can bring to such a thing. They can really pull the "unbelievable" three-member relationship, perhaps in the first film's history. <br /> <br /> Then what do I know? I'm just a child.
