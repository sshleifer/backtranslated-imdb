I saw my video tape for the first time last night for at least ten years. I found the job myself and the performances as captivating as they were in my memory. George Hearn was, of course, the master of Sweeney's role; he has never seen any softness when he decides to get rid of those whom he believes his wife died and his daughter lost; at least not to the end when he discovers that his thirst for revenge has led him to murder his wife. However, Angela Lansbury creates a more complex image, like Mrs Lovett. He realized that Sondheim wanted this role to be "comic" against Sweeney; and even Sweeney and his son will bring tenderness to caring for Tobias. For those who have long memories, this performance is one of the backdrop to their debut performances by Dorian Gray and Gaslight long before the murder, he wrote. Only a year ago I saw music in the Lyric Opera in Chicago. current opera superstar Brynn Terfel as Sweeney. Others have commented on the operational quality of the score. My conclusion is that "Sweeney" works better with actors who can handle at least vocal features than operators with limited operational skills. Finally, I congratulate the rapporteur, who represented Tobia. his mixed loyalty and the confusion surrounding him. He seemed to have almost the last word.
