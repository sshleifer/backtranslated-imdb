A lovely little thriller from Hitchcock, where there are many nice shenanigans with murdered spy, abducted child, nasty church, foreign plot and some random taxodermists. Jimmy Stewart is just as big a hero for Hitchcock, the story goes with his cool climax embassy function, but he doesn't have a Hitchcock black and white, low budget original. Nonetheless, it is a wonderful wonderful movie from a great master.
