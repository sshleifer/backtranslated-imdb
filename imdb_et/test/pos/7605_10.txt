"Never Failed" is a real good movie. If you haven't seen it yet, rent it out. I buy it when it is released because I loved it. Drew Barrymore is great again, he plays his part well. I felt like I could relate to this movie because I had the same bad school day. I thought the plot was well written, comedy and romance, a type of beloved movies. I loved the end, because while you know what happens, it still leaves you sitting on the edge of your seat!
