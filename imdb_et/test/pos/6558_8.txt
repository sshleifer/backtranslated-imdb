Anyone who enjoys Twin Peaks' Lynchia Strange or HP Lovecraft fan who knows that the most frightening things are familiar things, enjoys this movie. Don't look at it as a horror movie in the "traditional" western war, but rather a Grimma fairy tale. It's gory and definitely for 16+, but when you start looking at it, you'll find yourself pulled into a vortex. Definitely one of those films that will hang with you a few days after you watch (I never look at my works the same way!)
