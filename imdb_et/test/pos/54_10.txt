It was a great movie. Nothing not only about the month of black history, but a reminder of the goodness and statement of the people that it really grows up to grow a child. S Eptath's performances were outstanding. Mos Def and his song were out of the hook. When I saw that it was Rosie Perez, it had to double. But the supportive cast of actors and actors made it worth watching. All the different stories were amazing. And how Nanny defended Jr and literally everyone else who was in his presence. I can really understand that he is the matriarch of this period and even more so when he was tired of helping everyone. Don't wait until it appears on the DVD. This would be a welcome addition to every movie collection.
