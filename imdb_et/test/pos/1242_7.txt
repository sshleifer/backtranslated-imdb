Maybe I was in a good mood when watching this movie. but for any reason it really liked this movie. Was it terribly original? Was it a little predictable? Yes, yes. So what? It was really a nice movie. I've always liked Bruce Willis (well, almost always Hudson Hawk and The Fifth Element), and he was a selfish, sarcastic b *** ardi. Perhaps this film is not the material of the Academy Award, but it is certainly a good material. Go for rent.
