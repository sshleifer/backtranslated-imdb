The film had no help at all, a promotional way: if there was an ad review on television or radio, I didn't see / hear it. The only newspaper ad I saw was its opening weekend: a tiny, slick B & W mainstream photo of Andy as Val-Com, behind the prison, titled "WANTED! Runaway Robot!" (which was also a poster in front of 3 movies, I saw it - NOT a nice little color poster on this site, where all the pictures and the Crimebuster comic - which really wasn't good - they'd use the action itself - don't have a photographer Poster should help a potential audience decide if they want to see a movie - there were so many people who couldn't get their choice and wanted to know what the heart problems were - and that didn't help the poster! The photos offered were so inseparable that B & Ws were worthless.) There was no trailer for the movie: only one slide on the theater containing the heart-shaped word "Heartbeeps" with the Cupid arrow over and one completely black image: just Andy and Bernadette's voices say, "Val-Com! My entertainment center doesn't work!" "So it's mine; do you think we should talk to our owners?" It doesn't help people who were unaware of the movie. <br /> <br /> While filming, Andy told reporters that he could not eat after wearing plastic lips, so he would "cook at breakfast and fast" during the day. I don't know what Bernadette did: but at that time I was wondering why they didn't pour protein drinks through long straw or eat astronaut-style pyred food through pipes? <br /> <br /> Phil-Co, a baby robot, seemed to have a short-run of Johnny-Five with the same eyes, with a similar face. I've been trying to find out if they have the same designer but no help. I have press articles about the film and the design team was proud of their work and went for a special prize for their innovative device that created a smokeless smoke for Catskill cigars. Just shortly thereafter, LucasFilm did not use this device, even though they had done so, to return the Jedi scene to Jabba Hut: the man created Jabba around "steam", blowing smoke into the smoke pipe, joking that everything he needed was a glass brand and he would be happy man. I thought LucasFilm's actual use of tobacco products did not feel sensitive to the people who were smoking. <br /> <br /> John Williams, who recently succeeded in the late, great Arthur Fielder as a Boston Pops maestro (which was then a rating but never recovered from Fielder's death, and is now a shadow of its former glory) a sample of the movies with which he transmitted music. He premiere there for "The Empire Strikes Back" score; and you think he would have helped Heartbeeps playing some numbers there? One thing the critics liked for this film was Williams' score - but it wasn't possible to buy it! I saw one vinyl album, halfway with Heartbeeps in 1982, half the second movie - but it disappeared. I just saw the CDs listed on this site tonight and ordered it. If I get a scanner and time for writing articles, I would like to create a Heartbeeps tribute site. I liked the movie and don't care what the dissidents say! <br /> <br /> The only problem with the movie was that at the end of it it was logically reasonable: the robots ran free from the factory so they could freely decide their destiny. your choices; moreover, if the junkyard owners tell them that Phil must go to the factory to program him a "target", he doesn't even ask for it; they just mock each other thoughtfully and they go. Along the way, all adult batteries are lost and die. They are not really dead because they are robots and only need new batteries, but it is treated as "death", little Phili crying over them and rolls. So, what was that point? Phil will never get back to the factory and become a "target!" And of course, the Junkyard owners COULD''VE them to drive, or gave them all the battery charges with backup batteries; but the real thing was this poignant scene where all the robots wore and Phil was crying. Finally, Val-Com is a golf instructor and Aqua-Com is - I'm not sure what. Catskill is ENTERTAINER - what should ELSE be like? I'm not sure they made it clear. The Junkyard owners seem to take it lightly, lying on the sun loungers, drinking Phil lemonade, their "barman". Val and Aqua's new "daughter" Philsia - I think the name is - maybe it's Sylvania - doesn't seem much more than a desk lamp. <br /> <br /> There are no shots that are sad - from the photos I think the missing stuff contains a sweet scene where Phil has Christmas, and Val gives him the car's steering wheel; Aqua supplies horn; Catskill has taken a firefighter helmet to give Phil as we saw; and they have Christmas trees. I don't know if the missing film material will provide a better logic or if writers just don't think about a better crisis / resolution. The film was cut for 72-75 minutes to tie it to other missing films. Nothing else. For the DVD, I would like to hope, because I want to see interviews with cast / team and John Williams and Merv Griffin's interview. Production of film material; and reintroducing and restoring lost material to make it better.
