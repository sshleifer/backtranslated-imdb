I think this is quite an achievement so that I can give the audience a true tail for a weak person; tail, where the protagonist spends most of the film on the back, in bed and cannot move completely. But achieving is a dramatic piece of film efficiency; as a memory of a true story, and I think as an argument why people should have the right to die if they so desire. But the film is not a political statement and maybe fortunately it is away from the scenes of too many discussions, even though it contains any argument. What's more, it is one of those foreign language films that depicts its leading character as a gap with which nothing can be done, but to talk to the people around it, and yet capable of appealing and attractive anyway. <br /> <br So, instead of a movie, we need to point out a rather sweet but timely dramatic piece of another person who wants to look for something or search for something; the only difference is that achieving this "goal" would mean ending someone's life and achieving it if there is no physical activity. Javier Bardem plays the real life of Galician Ramón Sampedro, an individual who has been divorced much earlier in water purification, which was too low for such activity. It gave her a bed for the rest of her life and her desire to die is at the heart of the film by Alejandro Amenábar, the director of Chile. We have seen so many films in our lives where characters have certain goals or goals before the film is over, to provide the audience with a satisfying experience, but the change in pace at sea is delicate; it does not include young, energetic, attractive heroes who are not going to make a battle in distant places, but for a real person something that means so much to them. <br /> <br /> Even if you have a strong policy, whether pro or anti-euthanasia, you can find yourself in the hope that Ramón will get everything he wants at the end. The film speaks very early to Ramon about why he wants to die to see family members, presenting the situation and watching the audience who may not know what the film is. Interestingly, some family members are "given" what he wants, which can put any member of the audience who knows his shoes strongly about this issue. But the purpose of this task is to say to the audience: "No, it's not one man after he accidentally supported his whole family." Quite easy, the film has gone along the route where it is the Sampedro family and everyone else, but some have the idea of ​​an anti-Ramon; some are too young to admit what is really happening and others are seemingly too embarrassed to even express their opinion if they want Ramón to stay a little longer, love him. <br /> <br /> The Sea Room has a story around the victims of the following events. Ramón is quadriplegic and from his point of view we see things. This is something that can dissipate viewers or meet a movie because we are presented with a film as a victim rather than an initiator or a token in a movie that is always the cause of cause and effect drive. However, this is not a criticism and it is the Director's responsibility to implement such an approach in an effective manner. The film asks questions; it offers its audience a scenario. If you were in Ramon's position: what would you do or think or dream or talk about? Consequently, dreams of lawyer Juila (Rueda) have not enjoyed so much audience as they are rather small windows in one man's evangelical fantasies about her discomfort. <br /> <br /> Julia's study intensifies somewhat later when she shares some similarities with Ramon and this is when she starts to have a stroke caused by her illness. This feature seems to be timely in their relationship and adds another ingredient to the community that is already enthralling. This is because Julia feels physical pain and restraint not in some sense that she can't stand up and walk, but I think she understands the value of life when she felt emotionally bad in the past. Although the film is based on a true story and involves the subject of euthanasia, it seems to be more about a land drama person in a situation where he is willing to fight for what he wants but must do it orally. It's refreshing to see movies like The Sea Inside because it not only refers to history and gives us an insight into it, but as an independent film, it offers emotional and interesting levels.
