I got this movie with my BBC "Jane Austen Collection" (5 DVDs from old BBC customizations) and didn't like it first. It is completely different from others and it is not, or I thought that one of the qualities I enjoy in all other Austen films: a cheerful mind. Particularly irritating was a nightmare, where Mrs Richards gently sews her fingers. <br /> <br /> I still don't want to look at the fingerprint landscape, but I like that Mrs. R. dreams of dreaming when she sews, "My only acquaintance ... banged my dress." This movie is now my current favorite Austen. I've watched it 7 or 8 times so far. I think the actor is incredible. The way I see good action is when I have to look at what I do (sewing, though not my fingers together, hopefully, or boondoggling, or whatever) to see how the character is delivering his character. It is a rhythm of expression, a posture that makes words alive - it does what I have good to do, as far as I am concerned. <br /> <br /> Well, I look at almost every part of this Norther's monastery, because almost all the actors play their role with such a charisma. Peter Firth is amazing as Mr. Tilney, the perfect combination of Bath's fop and true masculine heroes - you I'm not sure if he's for Catherine's money or not. I love him (Wales?) Share. Mr. and Mrs. Richards are charming: a combination of their behavior - especially the high voice of Mr Richards, the granting of a loan contrary to his wisdom and wisdom - makes them so real.General Tilney, as a hard-hearted father who may be a murderer, is also exciting. And Captain Tilney, a laughing rake who so clearly enjoys ... and moneygrubbing sister and brother whose names I don't remember now - Two of them are so perfect, correct, intelligent, and smarmy. <br /> Another reason I love this adaptation is that it is the most romantic of all Jane Austen's adjustments. that is, places (well, it is worrying about me): although all of his novels are love stories, it is hard to feel that his heroes and heroes are finally in love. And if they don't really fall in love, what's the point? All the other changes I've seen (except the early Olivier / Garson one) are a nice kiss at the end if they can. I don't like the movie at all, but it's really necessary with a heart kiss. And the ending of Norther's kiss is amazing. <br /> <br /> The overall approach to costumes, music and lighting is, in my opinion, very good. And the script is extremely clever - how we cultivated gothic romance, Bath's high life, Cathy's upbringing, etc., are well done because they are usually in BBC productions. I also like that part when the little black leaf rides the wheels. I think Marchionesse was a perfectly fit and very smart exposition device. <br /> <br /> Some people are opposed to this version being the opposite of what Jane Austen was going to do in the Northanger monastery. fun gothic romance, not promoting it. But I don't think he was going to put down "Udolpho Secrets" etc. He just made the difference between reality and fiction. And this point is made when Mr. Tilney chides Catherine in her mother's room. Besides, General Tilney was a villain, though a prostate. This point must have happened.
