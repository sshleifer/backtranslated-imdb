I wanted to inform everyone who might be interested in the movie "New Jersey Drive" was my personal favorite. I admire the work that Nick Gomez and Spike Lee put on the masterpiece of the film. This film made me quite impressed by the recognition of this reality and quality of life in New Jersey. It struck the chord with me personally because I grew up with friends like the ones on the film. It also impressed me because I spent a couple of years in Teaneck, so some characters remained "real". Sometimes this film seemed like a documentary, because you didn't know if they were real events. Although films such as "Boys in Hood" and "Menace II Society" attract more attention, I personally feel that these films were somewhat "improved" to appeal to a wider audience. "New Jersey Drive" was an uncompromising "reality". Lee and Gomez covered all the drama details of this city from music, clothing, slang and location. Unlike some of the films mentioned earlier, the actors acted as if they were not "actors". Nothing succeeded in creating a good "theater". The only misfortune of this movie was that many people "slept" on it. Hopefully I expect more Nick and Spike artworks in the near future.
