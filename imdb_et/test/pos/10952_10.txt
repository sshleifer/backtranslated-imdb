The twin effect, starring some of HK's most popular stars, is one of the most enjoyable movie experiences to come out of HK. It has something for everyone, action, comedy, horror, romance and some drama. This movie cannot be taken too seriously, otherwise you would be ridiculous, but if you leave your brain at the door and watch the movie just for fun, you will surely enjoy it. <br /> Great special effect, great action, lovely twins, cool HK actors, FUN movie! <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone!
