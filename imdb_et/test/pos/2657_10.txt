This movie is not just good, amazing. In addition to our good performances, original plot, fantastic special effects, thoughtful messages, and much more, it was an invisible world for the public. This is the first sci-fi movie that takes us to the unknown space of our galaxy with both the magnificent effects and the bursting of the mind that the audience remains without words. I'm only 16 years old and that's why I brought the world of modern effects and 3D animations to movies. However, I was really, and I fully understand that the quality of these effects has been blown up for almost 40 years. The visual effects were just one of the advantages of this movie, the camera was amazing and enchanting. You seem to be consuming the screen and sucking into this surreal world (especially in a circular control room or whatever you call it). The impact, the camera, and the size of this movie hit me from my guards, even though I had seen this rating before I bought it. But this movie has more than that. The meaning of this film can also be interpreted as you wish, although I think there are clear points about humanity (including the true Kubrick style). Just as humanity, along with its evolution, is simply caring on board and therefore it is not necessary for the computer, one of the humanitarian tools. How we appear in the room as children, learn to walk once more, lose control of our tools with zero difficulty, breathing through devices like fish out of water. At the cutting edge of evolution, we entered an endless adventure as simple primates. Many may think that the length and slow pace of this movie is boring? ridiculous? or just a waste of time. But before you can come to these conclusions, think about why Kubrick spends time in peaceful space and spacecraft in the center for several minutes. This is to illustrate this beauty. Beauty, beauty is not justified for viewers in many cases. Kubrick wants to show us the beauty and if we don't let it go, we can't enjoy the movie. It's not an ordinary movie, we can't just sit back and watch as we can with another movie, it takes time, thoughts, and above all a commitment and feel. All this makes it one of the greatest achievements of moving images in the world. 10/10 Let me know if you agree with me.
