When commenting on this movie, it should be understood that it is based on a real story and therefore needs to be viewed to assess the quality and accuracy of the portrayal of its events and the value of entertainment. It may be unreliable that Jack Shepherd should give up Jack Wild twice because Wild had seized Edgeworth Bess. However, it happened. It should also be noted that the director was young and inexperienced, explaining why he was relying on tried and tested techniques. There were cases when Clavell had no confidence to write a script. The film would be better than it would. And yes, I had a copy of the script (a copy of Stanley Baker - one in five) that I recently returned with my father Rafe Newhouse, a writer.
