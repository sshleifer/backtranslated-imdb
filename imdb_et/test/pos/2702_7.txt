Every time I hear Karen Carpenter's voice, this old acquaintance is 70's blues. What was an overwhelmingly beautiful and mature voice he had. Cynthia Gibb did a good job in the title, but I thought Karen Allen would have been a better choice. This is a tearjerker film that makes Karen Karen and Richard a professional career as well as personal struggles that Karen dealt with and her illness. The recordings at Herp Albert's studio are very well done. But Karen Carpenter found that it was a time when she was very special and brought joy to her fans and music lovers. Even if you were not a Carpenter fan, this is a nice story that shows how big talent can fall under the pressure of society.
