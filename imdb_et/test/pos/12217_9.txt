It is not often the case that the TV series takes me out of the bat right away; recently, the Surface pilot download option was glued to me for the whole episode, after which I immediately launched a fever search to learn all I got about this wonderful series. I discovered my ghost that it was canceled after only 15 episodes, despite its strong ratings and extremely favorable reviews. Such shame. Since then I have acquired the rest of the episodes and found that the first 5 or 6 are among the best television I've ever watched. Just fantastic from start to finish, and as another comment commented, I loved how they finished every episode with a great finish. I imagine that I look at it every week if I had been beating and just fascinated, waiting desperately for the release of the next episode. Growing up, I always heard that it was an early series of films that were used before, ending up with a huge client to get the crowds back to the next episode in the theater. <br /> <br /> Well, for some reason or otherwise, the suits decided to kill it, and the people behind the show will probably have to write on the wall because after episode 6 things will definitely get worse. I wouldn't say the episodes actually turn into BORING, but many plot elements become a bit more clich√© and I have to say that the last episode left me deceived. I just want the creators of the exhibition to have a fair chance. ONLY * other exhibitions that stayed with me like this were Stargate SG-1's first season, which just resonated immensely, feeling very "real", made of soul and heart. The surface was great, and maybe one day a good-looking TV looks like a lover for canceling the entire exhibition and brings it back. At least one can count. :)
