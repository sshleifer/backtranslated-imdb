I really loved this movie. I thought it was very well done. The interaction of the characters was excellent as a characterization. The participants were certainly credible. The plot was very deep and intriguing. Although its parts are somewhat slow and sometimes a bit boring, you should definitely watch several times. The three major actors in chemistry were great. If you don't want to look at it, look at the symbols at least. I think this was just "Whoa!" It was like I didn't see. The whole movie grabbed my attention and kept my interest even through a slow part. I loved this movie and almost everything. I loved the end because it was so interesting and when you watch the movie a second time, it is quite reasonable. But I'm not breaking anything.
