So I think Bud and Lou just liked the classic stories (though they had interesting results). In this case, they are the babysitter's bad boy and Lou tries to read him as "Jack and Beanstalk", but sleeps and dreams that he is Jack and Bud's butcher, and they climb beanstal to save the prince and princess from the giant (Buddy Baer). <br /> <br /> I think my favorite scene was when Lou tried to make a giant omelette, and ... well, I'll let you see what happens. Because it was Abbott and Costello, they had some unnecessary songs, but it was pretty funny. For the other interpretations of the classic story "Bewitched" and "Gilligan's Island", both episodes depicted it.
