Even just 6,000 bucks and part-time actors were Christopher Nolan. Nolan is, in my opinion, the next Nolan big and our first taste that is not against it. <br /> <br /> No problem that continually wants to discriminate against low-budget stand-alone images, denies Nolan and the team. Our actors are inexperienced and young, but they offer us in this story. Frankly, I think that follows the best scenario of Nolan, because it was the one he got the most. This is a beautifully imagined film. This leads us to a world where we are not aware of limited budget constraints. Dialogue and atmosphere are bold and intelligent. <br /> <br /> The Nolan trademark method, which tells the story of continuity, is first implemented here, and here it happens that the story tells you completely. With Memento and The Prestige, you have to think a little bit about understanding the genius, but Nolan doesn't try to confuse people with his prototype. We can distinguish the time with the appearance of our protagonist. This method of telling the story is both creative and interesting. I am pleased that Nolan has been so successful because his films are becoming more than they could use with this method. Prestige and Memento's salary increase would not be exciting if the film was spoken in the usual way. This idea has been made with moderate progress, but Nolan has indeed done it himself. <br /> <br /> The script here is Nolan's best. I had some doubts about his writing abilities, I all imagined that his brother Jonathon was writing talent, but he proves me wrong. It is a provocative story that makes people interesting observations and their functioning. Cobb's assessments of burglarisation and how it can detect you will testify to people. <br /> <br /> My only real complaint is that the camera's work gets somewhat, but it doesn't take anything away from the story or actor. <br /> <br /> Next is the man's first film that personalizes the 21st century film selection at its best.
