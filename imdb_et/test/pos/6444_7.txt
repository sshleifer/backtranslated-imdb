I loved this movie as a child. I can't find it anywhere! I just mentioned it to some friends the other day and none of them remember it! Can anyone help me? My older sister blurs this vaguely. There was also another movie I remember that it was a semi-lively activity and half an animation, but I don't remember its name. The characters were animated and the background was real ... It seems to me that I remember the kangaroo, and I believe that the setting of the movie was in Australia. I go out of my mind to try to get copies of those films that were so memorable in my very enjoyable childhood. Edit: I was looking for IMDb for this second movie and I found out it's called Dot and Kangaroo! All I had to do was enter "kangaroo" in the search bar and the name of the movie in the list was like a clock! MAN, I love IMDb! Thank you!
