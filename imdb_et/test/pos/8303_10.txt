I think this is a great, classic monster movie for the family. Mole, what a machine! A high-needle creature, green lizards, Ranthorincus / mayas or whatever they are, and monkeys talk to them. Fighting against rubber men fights for the doll's breakfast umm! Nami! Class, what else to say? How would they make this 2002 re-evaluation?
