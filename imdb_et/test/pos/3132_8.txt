Travis and Sandy (Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, Jr.) are horse traders who are forced to sell their animals to the Mormon group and direct them to the border. What they do not expect is to meet the infamous Clegg's murderer, their wounded uncle, Shiloh (Charles Kemper). Ward Bond depicts a senior Wiggs, the main voice that the Mormon group moves to the wagon train to the Lord's destination. Along the way, they also meet "Doctor" Locksley Hall and his "Hoochey Koochey Wagon" and give them help. <br /> <br /> Ford-led manager who pays great attention to detail and realistic problems during a long wagon ride. The film has a wonderful lie that consists of characteristic actors who have a real star in the film, which is actually a blessing to see, if not just to change the tempo. Young Johnson and Carey, Jr., come really well, but this is Bond's film that looks like it has the best features. Johnson is the one who seems to understand the ruffles and brides like Shiloh and is definitely comfortable when a certain conflict can occur when the Clegg boys fly along those pieces. <br /> <br /> I have to say this is one of his best and least appreciated neighbors and it seems that it flows very well.
