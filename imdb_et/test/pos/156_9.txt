From the oldboy director, this slippery vampire comes. Kang-ho Song stars like a priest who has accidentally become a vampire in the treatment of a deadly, mysterious virus. His vampireism and priesthood are quite conflicting, but he is able to survive by robbing the hospital's blood bank and unconscious patients who may not hold some form of blood. Because of his supposedly wonderful survival, he comes to the life of the Ha-kyun Shin family. Shin has cancer and his mother believes the song can heal it. Unfortunately, Song's vampire raises the level of his lust to a height where he can't help but falls for Shin's young wife, OK-vin Kim. Kim is intensely interested in the world of vampireism and two of them become lovers. The film coming from there goes into strange directions, which I think should be for yourself. What really should be mentioned is the mastery of the Chan-wook Park cinema media. My God, I have rarely seen such a masterful visual artist at the top of my mandate. The main mistake of the movie is that it is a little inconsistent, especially at the beginning. The park is interested in telling its stories about mostly visual images that are difficult to follow from time to time. But if it works, man, will it fly. The film is also wrong for fun. The final sequence, which is easily one of the best of the decade, is at the same time heartbreaking and joyfully ridiculous. OK-vin Kim should get a global letter after this movie. It gives the best results of the year.
