I hit this movie on a movie channel the other night and I didn't laugh for a long time. This movie was so funny that I went out and bought the next day. I love this type of comedy. It seemed as real as the participants respond to different situations here. I was Rollin. I had never heard of it and just started looking at the title "Seeing Other People". The title caused me to shoot it and I'm glad I did. I laughed so hard that it hurt. Now it's part of my collection. I definitely recommend it to all those who enjoy smart-ass type comedy. I look at it over and over again.
