Terry and June were, in my opinion, one of the classic British sitcome. You knew what to expect - and it's not that typical! :) Unlike modern sitcoms, which have fully developed plots, this exhibition is still a breath of fresh air. If cute does not see or hear any comments about bodily functions or does not see her family late for breakfast or impossible with a teenage family. And there is a secret: Terry & June was based on a middle-class couple who lived in a relative harmony instead of today's tense parcels with an insecure de rigueur family (looking at the hip). Personally, I vote for the "Bridge to far" episode as one of the best. In some ways, Terry antics reminds me of Basil Fawlty - sometimes they're almost impossible to embarrass! <br /> <br /> Terry & June is highly recommended. Let your tea and cookies ready!
