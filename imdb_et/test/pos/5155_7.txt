Large bar ring rings alternating with recent orders and inevitably a quick queue of forms on the counter? do we want what we need only when it's too late? Or is the passionate irony of the open scene that reflects our understanding of individual existence? There is an endless charm where writer-director Roy Andersson wants us to be our fourth feature "You, Life". Fifty or so half-tied vignettes assembled against tragicomic hyperrealism, its poor interpretation and symbolic life events that bind us all in this great cosmic insider struggle. The simplicity of these vignettes facilitates the separation and enormous value of symbiotic relationships. Andersson can overcome the complexity of the human situation through harsh and quick claws as he should, but he also reminds us of the natural, soothing tribute to wake up each morning to the new tomorrow, when we are all aware of our special forms of development of the arrested person.
