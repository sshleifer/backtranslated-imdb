Chick Flick That Guys Still Like - Yes! Wonderful. Now I can have fun, enjoy my girl's business and don't feel like I can't wait until the movie ends! Light - but funny. Good stuff. Whatever you do, don't miss out on DVDs. It is also a big "blind date" file. Will Smith does it well - although it is lightweight, he pulls it all right. The film is slow - don't expect too much action - laughs are there - and so is the message, but time is a bit slow. Use the low moments to whisper or kiss - it accelerates. The end makes you feel good moments worth it. Most are waiting for a fun white heart rate - and make sure the supporters see a big movie - they make a movie. Plotting a plot is predictable - but it's a date move so I can get popcorn fillers from the kitchen - and don't take a break. Read more dates after this movie - she wants to see what's next. Remember Hitch's advice! <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
