Really sure back and forth for both talented boys. Eventually Brutus will win thanks to his great fan support during the game. <br /> <br /> Match 5: 'Rowdy' by Roddy Piper vs Bad News Brown - not a technical classic, but a pretty decent hit for WrestleMania. Piper comes out semi-black / semi-white, which is a very classic moment. Ultimately, both men are fighting with a double count without a clear winner. Hart Foundation gets a simple victory. Surprisingly, WWE had a division of the label team in the past. Not memorable, but good to go back and watch years later. <br /> <br /> 8th Place: Randy Savage and Sensational Sherri vs. Dusty Rhodes & Sapphire - The Great Gender Labels Team.

But Roberts gets his DiBias money and gives it away. <br /> <br /> Match 12: Big Boss Man vs Aceem (with Slick) - One man Gang is a sad attempt to be an African dream named Akeem. In fact, a short game that still needs time to match. The Boss Man wins the slut. </p> </p> <p> Match 13: Jimmy "Superfly" Snuka vs Rick Rude - Heenan comes to Rude for this game. Snuka, it never got well at WrestleMania. He always seemed to lose. After a short 5 minutes, Rude Snuka will win. <br /> <br /> Game 14: WWF Champion Hulk Hogan vs Continental Champion Ultimate Warrior - Duplicated as "The Ultimate Challenge". at night earlier.
