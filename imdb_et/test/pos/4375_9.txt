Mr. Carlin left our joint forum in June 2008, shortly after going to the chest (he had had heart problems). The media and comics everywhere covered the damage more than I or he would have ever expected ... but he was the grandfather of the observation comedy. <br /> <br /> This recording was his last production and contains a large part of the theme of death and its prospects. The project was filmed just after his seventeenth birthday, which he was happy to (noticed). I have followed Carlini's career as a fuzzy black-and-white television and enjoyed his current record albums. <br /> <br /> An ANY Carlin fan has the privilege to see (if not a copy) at least the show. He was still moving fast and with great timing even in the 70's! As he says, "He hasn't smiled of you from heaven". When he does something, he doesn't take the harps; maybe he's looking up !!!
