I always wanted to see this movie, and the first three quarters proved I was not in vain. But what the hell happened at last? I mean, don't get me wrong, I liked the movie. It certainly made me nostalgic over the 80's realistic, unique NYC that we have lost thanks to Giuliani. But that was still half an hour!
