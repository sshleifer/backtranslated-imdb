This film, as well as a large part of their music, is underestimated or overlooked by a random observer. It's awful and in many ways before your time. <br /> <br /> Images are funny, annoying, and at least participating. <br /> <br /> Music is amazing. <br /> <br /> This is not a "candy pop" sound that they unfortunately associate. This is the band's sound investigation and resurrection. <br /> <br /> HEAD alone should turn the monkeys into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. <br /> <br /> Can anyone tell me why these guys aren't there?
