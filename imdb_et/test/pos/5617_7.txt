A stylish young person who is interested in "serious" music (that is, a losing breed - who plays a violin if no one can play a violin?) - can find this interesting fiction about street children and big musical stars. indeed, his generation's biggest violinist and the film rarely gives him the opportunity to display his technique, the kids, especially Gene Reynolds, are good and, overall, the picture is a good example of a first-class studio family at the end of the 1930s that didn't hit the top of the '39 list, but that's nice way for an intelligent family to spend a rainy afternoon with an AMC or video store --- good luck Blockbuster !!! !
