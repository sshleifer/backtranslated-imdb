People who know me say I have a weakness in animated films. <br /> <br /> To be fair, these people are better than HALF My actual weakness is exceptionally well-made animated films, such as the vintage family film Maxist and David Fleischer. <br /> <br /> Can you think of yourself, "well if it's so big, why haven't I heard about it?" The fair question. This film appeared in the same week as the Pearl Harbor attacks. Inevitably bad timing caused the film to sink into relative ambiguity. However, things look up because it is finally published on DVD under the heading "BUGVILLE". <br /> <br /> It's funny that the movie passed all this because it reflects the real plot. While some people claim that the film is trying to send an environmental message (ugh), I think the main idea of ​​the film is persistence through accidents and difficult times (ultimately, the country was barely pulled out of depression). The problem: every time he tries, whether through other people's bad will or simple bad luck, he can't fail unhappy ... and starts to slowly disappoint those people he's trying to save. Although he does his best to maintain a positive outlook, he decomposes from time to time, and it is only through encouragement and support from his friends that he goes back to his feet and fights for a good fight. Just a whole reminder that when everything is said and done, nobody really is independent. <br /> <br /> "Okay," you say. "It has a good message (two actually). Does it really change it very well?" <br /> <br /> My answer: partly. <br /> <br /> This is not just a movie that makes this movie special. This is a characterization. This is one of those films where you can see the personality of every cast member in your animation. You almost do not need rows. A good way to put it together is "energetic" or "lively". Many films have used a sales point, "lovable characters". When I hear this line, it always makes me think about this movie. <br /> <br /> A coincidence, bad guys: hit the fly and smile at the mosquito. Many movies have "lovers" of villains, but I don't think you'll find anything like entertainment or love like these companions. Forget the 3 Stooges Cartoon from the 60s. Swat and Smack are Moe and Curly (but unfortunately not Larry) animated version of the closest thing you will ever find. Almost all the funniest moments are somehow related to this tough two. Yes, they are rotten non-good, but you care about them. This is the power you only see from a talented writer, director, and team. <br /> <br /> The film has two short jokes that revolve around native american and Chinese. I don't think they were meant to be malicious; but they are there, no matter what. They didn't bother me, but it would be fairly unfair for me not to warn anyone who potentially disturbs them. <br /> <br /> So when you share your weakness (and I think you do), give it one.
