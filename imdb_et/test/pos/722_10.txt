I watched this movie knew nothing about it. I had assumed it was some kind of sci-fi b. When I was wrong. The plot is appealing and intelligent, all charismatic is cast, and the whole film makes you think about change. Some of the puzzles were full of me, but finally the answers were quite simple. I'm quite puzzled by the low score of this movie because I thought it was quite unusual. If you liked Se7en (seven) Brad Pit or Matrix, then you like it. There are no great special effects or fancy tricks here. It is a plot, building characters and creating an atmosphere. But this is a movie, but it does not end up giving any answers to some people, but I thought the ending was great. I'm still not sure if the movie is based on a real story or not .......
