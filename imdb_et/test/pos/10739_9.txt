Kramer vs. Kramer is one film that must be kept and not forgotten. This is not one of the most popular movies ever made and is definitely one of the weakest best films, but that doesn't mean it's still not important. I thought the film was well done and just made you look more and more. The performances were the most positive for the film, and Dustin Hoffman played one of his best roles he has ever made as a lonely workaholic who has to take care of his son as his wife separates. Billy, son of Hoffman, played another great show with Meryl Streep, playing Billy's depressed mother. Kramer vs. Kramer is not one of the biggest films and is not perfect for 10, but it is worth making a movie and looking after it. Definitely one of Hoffman's best films he's ever made. I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> Hedian Views: 9/10 *** + A-
