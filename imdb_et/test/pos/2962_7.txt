After Meredit was seen "Beyond the Prairie", I had to buy another movie with my star. I can't believe how he put himself in this teen flick. It's best to look at this sound, but just focus on Meredith when it moves across the screen. Save your money until the TV network appears on the DVD "Beyond the Prairie". It is worth it at any cost, it has to cost you. This beautiful lady needs someone to put her in a script that can be used both by her talent as an actor and her beauty wife. Maybe some of her last fit, but I haven't seen them. She has a smile on Cathrine Bell and Dana Delany's eyes on her much younger body. <br /> <br />
