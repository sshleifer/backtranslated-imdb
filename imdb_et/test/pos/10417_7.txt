Despite his New York setup & New York characters, Summer in the City is not an American film, it's better. The most unusual is the mixing of styles and genres. Director Niami shows comedy combining comedy with tragedy, sinful drama. <br /> <br /> The secret of Miami's success seems to be a symbol of great symbols, each of which may have a film built around them, and then filling them with beautifully executed performances from one of the most amazing eclectic productions that would be hard to find in the same country, not to mention the same movie, from Bai Ling to Ornella Muti, Robert Burke Peter Stormaren, who here shows that he has a lot more of him than the bad stereotypes he plays on Hollywood pictures. Even Sandra Bernhard is funny here. <br /> <br /> An additional bonus, the cream on the important cake, is John Cale's soundtrack.
