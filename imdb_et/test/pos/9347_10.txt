The first music video I ever saw, Thriller, my mother told me she took me home from the hospital and when we arrived, I had MTV on my wicked TV and Thriller played, my mother said I smiled. I know, but I've loved Michael Jackson since that day, the music video Thriller inspired me to dance, but the dance is still remembered. I even presented it to the audience 3 times! The words cannot describe the power of the song that makes you sing and dance, but of course Michael had to lift the MTV bar at that time by signing up for American Werewolf director John Land in London and leading one, the only Thriller. <br /> <br /> Michael and his date, Ola Ray, ended the gas in a dark wooded area. They walk into the woods and Michael asks him if he wants to stay. She accepts and gives her a circle. He warns him, however, that he is not like other boys, not really, not like others. Will a full moon appear and Michael will torture in agony? becoming a terrible werewolf! His date strikes and runs away, but the werewolf arrives, knocks it down and begins to lunge with his claws. The scene cuts a movie where Michael and his date look at the scene in Thriller's movie. Michael smiles, but his day is scared and tells him he's leaving. Michael catches him and says it's just a movie, but he doesn't like his jokes and he starts to walk. Michael and his date walked down the blurry street and he tempted him with Thriller's pop-ups. They pass through the graveyard, where the corpses suddenly begin to rise from their graves when Vincent Price fills its oilseed rape. Michael and his date find themselves surrounded by zombies and suddenly Michael becomes a zombie himself. Michael and Undead perform with a complex song and dance number, followed by the Thriller Choir. <br /> <br /> Thriller is arguably the best music video of all time, the funny thing is people wanting to say they have other Michael Jackson videos, but what makes Thriller so special is dance, story, consequences, it was the most expensive music video at the time. Of course Michael went up again with his famous music video Scream and then again with Ghosts. But tell me what you want, Michael was the star of the 1980s, he had no fame, he loved life, he lived, breathed and embraced. Thriller proves that he was ready to work to do the best and what we got with the legend that is Thriller. <br /> <br /> 10/10
