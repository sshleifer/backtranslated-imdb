This is a movie that finally led me to the IMDb registration so I can vote (and comment) on it. I have only recently been able to evaluate well-produced "war" movies and this is one of the most thoughtful things I've seen. <br /> <br /> "Stunning" is the word that comes to mind when I think of this viewing experience. My husband and I watched this movie last night for the first time. It moves gently, but at the same time exciting (not contradictory). This story in Hollywood could have been another fragrant, exciting, Top Gun timeline. <br /> <br /> The two leading actors who played Frantisek and Karel played perfectly; and Krystof Hadek is a very "beautiful" boy who does not seem to overdo or exploit this fact. As for Hadek's ability to act and look, my husband (language-in-cheek) said: "Well, he's not Tom Cruise." I replied, "Thank God!" If you appreciate the beautiful and undervalued action, look at it.
