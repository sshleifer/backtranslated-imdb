"Opera" (1987) <br /> <br /> Director: Dario Argento (Deep Red, Suspiria) Scenario: Dario Argento and Franco Ferrini (Church, Sleepless, Demons) Photography: Ronnie Taylor (Choral, Sleepless) Music: Claudio Simonetti (Phenomena, "Goblin") <br /> <br /> Story: Betty (Cristina Marsillach) is Lady Macbeth, who has understood the highly styled performance of Verdi Macbeth's opera. Betty's time will shine when the star of the diva crushes her leg before the evening opens, when she is hit by a car running in a struggle. The famous Macbeth curse takes more evil and computational revolution when the body begins to rise immediately. It seems that Betty gets her first fan stalker who binds her and the tapes to her eyes to force her to witness the murderous murder of the people around her. Story: 3 of 5 <br /> <br /> Action: In many of these Italian films, action can sometimes be difficult to judge. English, Italian, French, German, Spanish can sometimes be the same flick as they usually speak in their own language, making thumb rule and difficult to understand. As a result, I usually cut off somewhat. Action: 4 of 5 <br /> <br /> Direction: Giallo maestro Argento will return to the genre that helped the pioneer. "Opera" shows her a mixture of fine gore, tension and beauty at the top of her game. Direction: 4 of 5 <br /> <br /> Visual: This must be one of Argento's best movies. Taylor's superbly filmed "Opera" contains some stunning and inventive camera work that keeps the movie fast and hard and keeps an eye on candy. The camera always seems to have wondered if it is a wonderful camera that rises to a spiral staircase or queue to the end of a bird's eye view that circles the crowd's opera house. Visual: 5 of 5 <br /> <br /> Audio: Frequent Argentinean Simonetti (through his various bands Goblin, Demonian, and solo efforts) congratulates the screen eagerly when his score touches the classic (Verdi) metal (Brian and Roger Eno and Bill Wyman's little help) and borrow the music muscles on the bloody scree of the screen. Sound design gives you everything you need to break the shocks, scream and masterly remaster the Anchor Bay plate in glorious 6.1 for every dump and well. Audio: 5/5 <br /> <br /> Technical: Editing keeps the movie moving and great. With the camera's work, editing helps keep a surreal dream image. The exquisite opera house is one of the hell that is perfect for staging the Macbeth horror version. The review of the Argentine movie cannot be completed without commenting on the killing. This time Argento is sending round characters with a brilliant gripping system, a crow's eye movement and a highlighting of a gun spray through the keyhole in the eye and the back of the head, which once again sends the Argento's former wife Daria Nicolod into the morgue. Priceless! Technical: 5 of 5 <br /> <br /> Difficult: Almost flawless giallo that suffers from a somewhat unnecessary epilogue in Switzerland that offers all the visual excitement that Argento fans crave. <br /> <br /> Overall: 4 out of 5
