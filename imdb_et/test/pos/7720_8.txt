This film talks about a young India who comes home one day and finds himself against a woman. The problem is that he is gay. To stop the wedding without telling your parents that he is gay, one wrong leads to another until it is controlled by the spiral. <br /> <br /> This movie is fun and made me laugh several times. The action of Sally Banks is great and she plays this strong woman who does what she wants convincingly. The plot is also outstanding. I find the plot very realistic and I can fully identify Jim's feeling that he is scared, worried and upset. On the other hand, Jim's boy, Jack, has paid much less attention to the film. I would have liked to have more film features and more character. But as I think the director wants to make this mainstream movie, the love between Jimi and Jack hasn't been developed in the movie. <br /> <br /> It's nice to watch a gay-positive movie. What's more, this film proclaims us to accept the difference of other people, be it sexuality, culture and lifestyle. This film makes viewers meaningful. <br /> <br /> We need such movies to give us a boost. Thank you for making this movie!
