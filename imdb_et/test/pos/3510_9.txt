I was watching this movie for the first time in about 1990 as a young child and it frightened me out. I loved it so much and I died to get my hands on. <br /> <br /> In 2002 I remembered that this movie existed, but I had no idea what it was called so I went to IMDb to know and explain what the movie was and what was its name. Anyway, someone from IMDb told me, so I researched and tried to buy a movie. So finally I got it on the DVD and I keep this movie one of the most valuable horror films. I really love it and I think everybody who looks at it is very scared the next time. 9/10
