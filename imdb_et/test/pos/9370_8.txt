"Crossfire" feels like an underdeveloped masterpiece - it has worked well and nicely filmed but thinly written and too short. As it is, it is just a decent police procedure, with tips for the film Noir (1947) and social commentary (also trendy) thrown into good action. Today it is recalled as the first two Hollywood films that deal with anti-Semitism and are much better than the similarly-themed "Gentleman's Agreement". But its real issue is the difficulty that the soldiers of the Second World War, like trained killers, went into the transition to civilian life. (To know more about this topic, try "The best years of our life.") In the first frames of the movie, the man is beaten to death. We don't see his attacker. The film deals with the investigation of this murder, which is actually quite simple, but it takes some unnecessary detours, as when the main suspect, a depressed soldier, rises to the Gloria Grahame Dance Center, a weird pimp played by Paul Kelly. The film is also a semi-civic lecture on civic education, which slows down the procedure until it is indexed, and the end is good enough for a police show. But otherwise it's a pretty decent mystery. However, what a great noir might have been. Director Edward Dmytryk falls into a couple of tips on the original novel - homosexuality, not anti-Semitism - as when the sadistic sliding Monty sees his friend Mitch in a picture that speaks to a strange man at a bar. And the cast is great. Robert Ryan makes a very reliable cretin and even becomes somewhat sympathetic in recent scenes, unlike Peter Lorre as the "M" child breaker. He deserves the Oscar, but lost to Edmund Gwenn this year (you can't kick Santa Claus). Robert Mitchum is a friend of the accused killer soldier. Was Mitchum a great actor or a big star? Someone else can exclude it, but his sleepy eyes and puzzling half-smile work very well here because they suggest that his character knows something not everyone else. (And he does.) And Robert Young, like a murdered detective, is surprisingly sharp, aside from his usual avuncular feeling, even when he has to give a civil rights sermon in the middle of the picture. There is no doubt that Bogart or Tracy would have been excellent in this role, but neither of them was in RKO in 1947, so you just have to deal with Dr. Welby. Still, Young is good enough for you to have someone wanted him a "Dad Knows Best" detection drama that he hated and brought him to alcoholism and suicide attempts. The man deserves better than smarm and Sanka.
