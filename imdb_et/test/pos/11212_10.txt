It has taken me about a year after I saw this movie about it. The Lord knows I wanted to, after I saw it, I knew I saw something I had never seen before, but was not sure why. Now, after I have been thinking for a while, these are the characters that I can't even think of right now. <br /> <br /> Far from being brief and slow, this relative (Yusuf), who comes from rural areas, is a short-lived speaker to make a photographer (Mahmut) in the city, hoping to find a job. However, it turns out that after Yusuf hypotheses about the seafarer's and his employment perspective, he is really looking for something else, a purpose in his life. is taken through a seasonal environment that is filmed finely. The context in which they happen to make scenes in two specific situations more powerful when the girl Yusuf has suddenly come into contact with her second significant and Yusuf face when she looks at the fish basket and shooting. reflects his tortured face. This scene itself must be one of the gorgeously filmed pieces that I have witnessed, I don't know how long it is. <br /> <br /> Finally, Mahmutil also has his own demons, but faces his relative that he is not really trying to find a job and is forced to ask him to leave on a scene that is very simple but has a real conscience. <br /> <br /> What the viewer misses is a lot of reflection and contemplation for the two people everyone sees about themselves. You should not delay the pace of this movie because it is truly worth every breathtaking second. <br /> <br /> Rating 10 out of 10.
