Amazing, amazing, brilliant, great. These are the four adjectives that support my head when I start describing "The Kite Runner". The adaptation of Khaled Hossein's books had already taken many thoughts, in fact, the rumor that he himself broke tears after watching the premiere. I have to say before I even start reading the book before I saw "Kite Runner's" advanced screening. So my rating and opinions can be a bit biased. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me say that although I think the book was better than the final product of the film, it is not a bad adaptation. I am thinking of a two-hour film that has received a earned response. Things are coming up quickly in the last twenty minutes, but besides, it has succeeded in what the book did. It has hit millions worldwide. The magic integrated by Khaled Hossein, which gives us a sense of joy, sadness, pain, loyalty, is an adaptation. Especially on the first scene, when Hassan says, "If you tell me to eat dirt, I know. But I know you don't ask me." Such a touching line is to capture the hearts of many. The two young actresses were excellent, absolutely superb. Especially this innocent but loyal Hassan, the boy who refuses to give up hope, because he promised his best friend to bring him to him, but it can be abused by big tempters who beat him and use him sexually and then his best girlfriend as a coward . The whole thing is so moving that it can't irrigate the eyes. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is well placed, saving the last bit. At a time when Amir was studying her true relationship with Hassan and reading Hassan's first and last not to her when she breaks down in tears, being helpless, lonely, and unfortunate, she seemed a little hurried and felt Amir was behind the facade. In the book, Khaled Hossein had dedicated about 10-12 pages to describe Amir's mental state in that position. But it was in the penultimate segment of his film, when Amir stood for Hassan's son, his nephew Sohrab, before his father under his command. The end was well earned and I am sure it will be recognized. It felt that the torch had fallen from one generation to another. <br /> <br /> Transfer to technical aspects. First, acting. Just one word - Superb. From start to finish, young Hassan and Amir, their father, his friend Rahim Khan. Everyone has been great, especially young Hassan. Secondly, the direction was amazing, with some great camera work. The background was also impressive. Right from the start to the end of the credit card and I especially loved Amir's western and Islamic fusion of the Pakistani mosque, which made it particularly special. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is definitely one of the best movies, and it's a welcome break from all the Iranian-inspired films that we float throughout this year. 9/10 !!!
