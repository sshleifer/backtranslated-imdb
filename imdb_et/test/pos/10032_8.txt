If one stops at the frequent screen of Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland, "They Died With Their Boots" (1941) is probably the most remembered one. This is the grand saga of General Custer (Flynn) - since he entered the West Point Military Academy and falls on the lush Elizabeth Bacon (DeHavilland) during his tenure in the American Civil War and finally his death at Little Big Horn. Director, Raoul Walsh, reaffirms his historical epic re-rewriting of historical texts to laureates, written by Wally Kline and Aeneas MacKenzie, until the truth and fiction are all proportional. Thus, fighting an anti-battle horse (Anthony Quinn) between politicians - California Joe (Charley Grapewin) and a foolishly missing company who wants to reclaim the land Custer gave the Indians a systematic genocide of peoples. first peoples. <br /> <br /> Flynn, who plays Custer as part of Arnold Schwartzenegger in two parts, Albert Schweitzer, has never been more attentive. He literally repels any pore that easily melts the heart, charm and sex appeal of his loyal heroine. Resident Warner's stock players, Arthur Kennedy and Sidney Greenstreet, offer beautiful columns that look much deeper and more characteristic than the material they write. <br /> <br /> All in all, despite the fact that history has disappeared in favor of a good romantic yarn, "They died with their boots", there is plenty of film to feed on Saturday night or Sunday night with their loved one. Warner's DVD is pretty nice. Although the film grains are often obvious, the grayscale is very well modified with deep, solid black and very pure whites. Some disruptions are obvious during the transition of the scene. The sound is very nicely cleaned and presented at a sufficient level of listening.
