"Zen and Lanscaping Art", written and directed by David Kartch, is a short film about a young man named David (his friends call him Zen) and which appears in one of his strange days of life. Zen works as a top middle class family lanscaper. The house guy is trying to help Zen help his wife. Unfortunately his son walks instead of his wife. From that moment on, the film begins to accelerate between many characters with the possible involvement of the house man. "Zen and landscaping" is witty, intelligent and generally very well written. The comic timing of the actors is also very strong. This is a fun and easy movie that I would strongly recommend.
