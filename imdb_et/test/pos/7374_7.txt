Definitely not just for urban legends, Campfire Tales is often a scary and always fun journey through several popular readings. It is also a film that exceeded (low) expectations. A movie that I have never heard or read, live video (given, the latter often gives us a pleasant surprise, but it can be anything or nothing of the horror nowadays), mostly unknown. .. well, I'll leave you with math. <br /> <br /> Film turns out to be an entertaining, tense, and very enjoyable experience. Four stories are working well and satisfying. The only one I knew was a bit weaker than The Locket, for the simple reason that it didn't provide much of an explanation of what his plot or characters were doing; however, I loved the story, its atmosphere and end. My favorite was the third story, "People can beat too" - this relationship is not only understandable, but also educational. <br /> <br /> I found Campfire Tales one of these horrors. chance, and then wants it for everyone. <br /> <br /> 7/10
