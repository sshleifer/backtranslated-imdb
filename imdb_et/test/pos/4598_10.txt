I'm not sure why there are no articles or posters about such movies because I saw it and thought it was AWESOME. I think it's not for everyone because it's basically Kafka's "The Trial" meeting "Beevis and Butt-Head", which is a pretty tough combination to swallow. However, I thought it was great. If you want to see it because you want to continue with Office space, you are probably disappointed. But if you want to see one brutal, acidic language and a cheerfully honest look at where our society is headed, then you are a treat. I just saw at 18:00 in Los Angeles and only 12 people open in the theater, which means that the film will probably go in a week. It's really a shame, because Idiocracy is one of the best satires in its own way, which come for a long time. But then again, it is basically funny for people who make up about 99% of the audience, so I think it's no wonder that the studio was panic and tried to shoot it.
