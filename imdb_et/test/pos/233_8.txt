I'm not a big fan of musicals, but I was always happy about the look of Mrs Hayworth, so I thought I'd give it a try. <br /> <br /> This may be the best talented Mrs Hayworth. He has never felt love in the film (except for "Gilda", where he is a sexual symbol par excellence). <br /> <br /> Rita is mostly assisted by Gene Kelly and Phil Silvers. Comedy can be dated, but it's still quite fun. Kelly does one of her dance-dance-dances, dances with her picture window. <br /> <br /> But Rita controls all this movie. Otto Kruger, perfectly cast and always wonderful, smart cracking Eve Arden doesn't hurt. <br /> <br /> Rita is singing, Rita is dancing, at the same time looking beautiful! Music can be classic, but the lyrics to most of the songs are pretty smart. <br /> <br /> I think this movie works better than Gilda, which I find to be a defective film. He also runs "Gilda" for Mr. Hayworth's credit, and Gilda rides the man with red blood. <br /> <br /> The film is well after these years. A lot of foot candy for the men's audience is a nice bonus!
