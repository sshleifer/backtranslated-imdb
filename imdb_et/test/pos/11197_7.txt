Study of one of these well-known physical and / or emotional states: isolation. I think the film also comments on cultural relocation. <br /> <br /> The movie shows the experience of two Turkish men (cousins). One is money (and the convenience that comes from making income); the other is not and is going to look for work. Not happy too. Waiting for life is not here - loneliness, warts and everything. <br /> <br /> The movie manages to deliver gloomy movements through the "low lands" of the human situation. Brave movie making. Well done and well viewed in my opinion (port trips are my own favorites). A film that should inspire everyone who is not alien to happiness and lifestyle (not to mention employment); everyone else finds a companion in this movie. A film that has all the heat and tempo of the ice glass. Wait a bitter pill, not a "happy pill".
