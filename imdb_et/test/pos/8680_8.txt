I read most of the comments here when everyone saw only the film's mistakes. I agree that the director is not Kuprik, the actors are not the winners of the Oscar, but it has something that everyone could relate to. I do not want to spoil, but talk more than a plot - graduation from school and a trip to a big party, or if you want to see beyond the metaphor, you have to choose a minimal life. Remember the young days? days when did you or our friend act like characters? Or do you think you should act like one of them and now you regret not doing that? if you can go back to this time and if you can ask yourself, maybe the movie wasn't so bad.
