If you haven't seen it, look at it. It is available on DVD. This is the production of channel 4 (uk), possibly with German and Danish television. When you've seen the movie, it's basically the same plot. Several broken songs have been linked through drug trafficking. The story jumps between a housewife (played by a magnificent Lyndsay Duncan) who tries to work on behalf of her husband who is surprised by her international drug dealer (and a generally dangerous person). <br /> <br /> A minister who is involved in his work to the detriment of his family is investigating the whole situation with international drug trafficking. He gets some eye openers to the reality of heroin when his daughter is a "problem". He then officially visits Pakistan, where he seems to be taught that abuse (not just a drug or its accidental use) is a problem and that you can also try some products (a great scene where he understands the attraction and why it is and why this is such a problem). In Pakistan, we see the other side. Farmers' despair who can barely survive by turning to opium production and criminals. Absolute attempts to subsidize, resulting in system enrichment. And a country that is so stunned with drugs, but only a relative share of the abuse we have in the West. Around this, a customs official / interpol representative attempts a "Dutch" connection for heroin smuggling. Finding justice for his murdered partner. It's really a masterpiece. Super and undervalued performances by all major players only through European cinema. <br /> <br /> Must see. Especially when you have seen the film, they congratulate each other and present some subjectively different opinions / attitudes on both sides of the pond.
