"Confirmed Dead" is an important episode in the series because it highlights four new characters: a rescue team with whom Naomi contacted before Locke got her knife back. As I say in my one-line summary, their real purpose on the island may be something else. All new characters seem intriguing (especially in Miles, some psychological / exorcist), but it's still too early to make firm decisions. I felt that this episode was a small step from "End of The End" (without the flash at this time; short-term returns), but it still has wonderful moments and ends up in steam. *** 4
