When I went to this movie, I thought it would be just another chic that I should take with my sister. Even Amanda Bayne's last film was not so hot, which made me question about the film that is her leading actor. But after 5 minutes, I smiled so hard that I had tears in my eyes, the jokes were not "there", so that more time was spent to understand it, but very funny. The script was not too complicated for me to understand the love triangle, but was very true to the original Shakepeare game. I loved it so much every minute that I threw two men from the seat away from me with laughter lol! very embarrassing! I would definitely recommend people to see this movie, especially girls, because the guys in this movie are hot (lol) so much that I can get it just on DVD.
