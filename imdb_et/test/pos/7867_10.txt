A clever psychosexual drama about a wounded Union soldier (Clint Eastwood), who is seeking refuge in an isolated Confederacy school for young women during the Civil War. Slowly, Eastwood starts to seduce every outstanding girl until the boards are turned and becomes traceable in the gothic finals. The film has never been so delicious erotic but at the same time worrying. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly Eastwood's best time (those who tune in "Dirty Harry" will be surprised), while the rest casts evenly great performances. Try to see the movie on the video because the prints of the TV usually erase important rebounds between the Geraldine page and Patrick Culliton.
