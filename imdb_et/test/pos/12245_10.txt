Truly terrible, touching movie. A female melodrama with her best, lots of comedy: great dialogue, characters and writing. Every woman can associate the story because it's classic: you are in love with "Mr. Right", but she's not interested in you until a man who seems completely wrong is going and you're in love with the head. But, of course, it's not that easy. The characters are real and all the performances are perfect. The film is also fun for every scene in the stalk society. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves well-written humor and melodrama. You can associate with each character and the graph moves in unexpected directions. Excellent, undervalued film.
