A child's actress certainly deserves a lot of credit. It was a pretty weak field for the best picture this year. I think "Apocalypse now" should have taken it, but the Academy felt it was too violent and strange, and Vietnam was still too late. Meryl Streep was huge, as always, playing a very unlikely character. I usually fail to congratulate the directors, but I really liked it with the doors of the lifts. Rating: B
