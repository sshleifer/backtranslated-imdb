Stepford's children show that besides a very good TV movie, indoctrination shows a very disturbing result. This is quite a statement of how to do what works within "good" behavior can destroy whatever it is that makes a person unique and individual. I think this is a film that parents who want to keep some sense to have their young hearts and minds look at their children and discuss what the film is about. I don't know if this was the purpose of this film in any way, but I have always believed that this is one of the best film equipment that is against the desire to have children as an unrealistic and dominant pretense of what is happening in the interests of children other than their own. I hope one day I can see this movie on DVD. I'm in the original ... waiting.
