"National Velvet" talks about Velvet Brown, a young English girl whose dreams come to her beloved horse in the competition at the prestigious Grand National horse race. The film follows her when she trains her horse with the help of former jockey and her parents. <br /> <br /> Although "National Velvet" is a family movie, it should not prevent anyone who normally looks at such movies to give up. Indeed, the film is one that turns to the whole family, not just to the attentive youth. He even succeeded in five Oscar candidates, hardly a sign for the public. <br /> <br /> Anne Revere, part of Velvet's mother, won an Oscar for her performance. He really played a great role, but it's 12-year-old Elizabeth Taylor who steals the show. She has a charming presence and exhibits talent over her years. Also Oscar winner Donald Crisp's Velvet father, Mickey Rooney's former Jockey Mi Taylor and Angela Lansbury (one of his first film roles) as Velvet's parent. <br /> <br /> The film's shining Technicolor makes it an attractive viewing experience, while editing secures the second part of the movie. In addition, Clarence Brown was nominated for film directing, cinematography and art. It is also worth noting the ten-year-old Oscar candidate Herbert Stothart's score, although it was vague. <br /> <br /> All in all, National Velvet is a great film that deserves a higher rating. I understand that the prospect of watching a movie with a girl and her horse does not seem to be exciting for some people, but it is a worthwhile opportunity.
