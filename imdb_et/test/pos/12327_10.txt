It's my favorite movie all the time. And I always think of it as John Huston's props. <br /> <br /> I had to see it at least 20 times and never tire it. Mood, script, singing, dinner, it's like calling someone home and watching events and can't get involved though you want ... It's a rare treasure, this movie, and I can't write enough praise for it. <br /> <br /> It is amazingly well, with quite a few Abbey Theater faces and Frank Patterson's excellent tenor voice. In the film is a poem by Lady Gregory, one of the most written. Anjelica stage, which, while walking down the stairs, is one of the best performances that every film can see. I cry every time I see it ... all the right reasons. <br /> <br /> We have all lost love at an early age and we cry for our young lotus societies. <br /> <br /> Donal McCann, in my opinion, had too few movies, he just loved stage work and it was stuck and our loss is that we no longer have our productions on film because it does so because of its sensitive and expressive role . Imagine a deep love for your wife, who is never interconnected, and she communicates this inner sorrow knowing it. <br /> <br /> If you want the film's action and plots to be packed, there's no start, no middle, or just stop the 80-year-old Dublin dinner party with just the lens and all the subtle nuances and shades of beautifully portrayed personalities. <br /> <br /> Bravo to all who participated in this production. 10 out of 10
