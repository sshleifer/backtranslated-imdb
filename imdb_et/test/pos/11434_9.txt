Today's Marco Polo, from Venice to China, is coming back to Amel, taking on the task of turning us into a gray area that is in the middle of a world of two eyes. To the detriment of globalization, Europe's pessimistic vision is shared with China. <br /> <br /> A look at this charming but puzzling state is dealt with below to learn or express any statement. However, reality is tough. Abandoned and exploited children, bee homes, lagging regions are the other China we ignore. The steelworks technician Vincenzo (Castellitto) is one of us. His trip to China is an excuse to understand, learn from within a country where progress and third world problems live together in a notorious balance. It is not entirely clear whether Vincenzo knew for the first time that the mechanical component was already fixed; anyway there is a small aspect. Chinese girl Liu is the key to the whole movie. She has a lot of trouble behind her, she has the strength to overcome, but how can she get little money and little help to fight? <br /> <br /> A realistic and impartial view of the girls who refused Vincenzo's money touched me a lot. The package of banknotes cannot protect his wife, his child (forced to be treated as a foreign law), by protecting him with intimidation. Liu knew that his intentions were benign and kind, far from the cold charity act. Their friendship is beautifully told how he is step by step, dignified and formative, unique. An invaluable legacy to keep. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are stunning for the actors (Vincenzo crying on the ferry) or dialogues (restaurant, rail). In addition to careless editing and a pretty lazy start, "La Stella che non c'Ã¨" is great and sharp just because it crowns incredible truths. <br /> <br /> At the 63rd Venice Film Festival, the contest has a lot to do with the Thai Mastroian Award, which is dedicated to evolving stars. He certainly earned this award. <br /> <br /> [8/10]
