My family and I usually don't watch local movies just because they're poorly prepared, have no depth, and just aren't worth our time. <br /> <br /> The "Nasan also man" trailer hit my attention, my daughter in law and her daughter, so we took the time to see it this afternoon. The film exceeded our expectations. Cinema was very good, the story was beautiful and exemplary. Jericho Rosales was really great, so is Claudine Barretto. The fact that I despised Diether Ocampo proves that he was effective in his role. I have never touched, moved, or influenced the local film. Imagine a cynic, like me, at the end of the film with my eyes? Congratulations to Star Cinema! Tea, Jericho and Claudine !!
