It's hard for me to explain this to my grown-up friends. I have a number of Shasta Daisy in the backyard, which I love to call "Chuckle Patch". My friends are laughing at me and watching me as I have 2 heads. It would be nice to see this series on DVD for us who remember it with our other childhood memories, or to show our friends that there was really a smile! Where a child's TV has been made today of violent cartoons, magical characters, or a talking sponge who lives under the pineapple under the sea, Magic Garden was honest that he taught us good values. <br /> <br /> I like the nice memories of Carole and Paula and Chuckle Patch.
