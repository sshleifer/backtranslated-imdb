"Minute to Pray, A to Die to" is a high quality spaghetti, western, solid and interesting story. It's filmed beautifully, with a relatively high production value for this genre movie. <br /> <br /> Alex Cord is doing a terrible job with Clay McCord, a law-abiding crippler. He looks for amnesty before his enemies are close to him, but he wants him to get it for himself. Robert Ryan offers the best results in the film as Governor of New Mexico. Mario Brega and Arthur Kennedy are also great here. <br /> <br /> This movie is very good, but it doesn't seem to me that it is one of the best western countries of spaghetti. There are not too many styles to be in the same league as any of them. It has some cool spaghetti, but in general it is a bit too much like western America. This is especially evident in the music score, which is OK, because the movies are generally, but they are pretty boring according to the Euro-West standards. Music reminds me of "The Unforgiven" music. Although there is an interesting story here, what is common to my taste is said. If the western spaghetti fan and the Hollywood western fan had to watch the movie together, it would be an ideal compromise. <br /> <br /> All this does not mean that anyone should avoid this movie. I enjoyed watching it very much. As I said, this is a very well done film and I recommend it to anyone who likes Western, spaghetti, or otherwise.
