Other reviewers are that WAAAAY has turned off why the Farscape show is (temporarily) cleaned. It has no connection with the quality of the slacking exhibitions. In fact, the exact OPPOSITE is true. They were better and better! :) I have seen every episode and if you just look at them to really be amazed at how much cooler it is moving forward and further, and the wormhole and Aeryni subfields are really very interesting and gave it MORE vibe, not less. Before it was sort of chaotic, it was slow and rather useless. They spent the first two seasons of this type of enemy, but on the other two occasions they tried to do something :) I have never seen Sci-Fi such a sexy gal and attitude. The blue girl - Zahn - was cool but not "sexy". They literally went to the point where gals ran in leather corsets and high heels blasting foreigners - now tell me what could be cooler than this? :)) <br /> <br /> The real reason why Farscape went a bit is that it cost too much - and it's a good thing for fans, because the show, to the end, is a really nice 60-hour epic movie with all the cinematics of the movie (ok ok they use a lot of similar sets, but CG is great and the gals are sexxxy). <br /> <br /> Blah Blah - The real reason is that TV shows are about profit. It's a business, and a Sci Fi channel, or someone who didn't get that expensive example of Farscape as big as they could junk show like "Stargate". Lexx had actually cooled down until they got rid of a hot German girl and replaced it with a strange fat. <br /> <br /> Anyway, yes, remember this: Farscape held better and better until it really liked a little real movie every week. Then the nets decided, "that people look at every old piece we breathe when it is the only sci fi thing this hour, so why do we spend all that money on Farscape, let the cheese get the low budget" Stargate "against the human throat and call it a "hit series" because it's like everything we play every night LOL :)) <br /> <br /> It is so, and I must say that Claudia Black is really a cool actress. got her face in place (tight eyes tightened), she was really cool - one of those dynamic types like Judy Davis and sometimes hot looking, sometimes ugly - like a skateboarder. I would be Claudia Black with Lucy Lawless in style and essence - so much fun to watch - not just Chrichton :) And yes, it can be said that pregnancy was fun, but how many sci fi shows that it is RELIGIOUS and DEEP a romantic sub-block that really goes somewhere and is progressing? u - Exhibition participants are great. It's really a shame that the show is uncomfortable right now, but I hope it will arrive soon for more episodes and movies because I buy them deffinately! :-D
