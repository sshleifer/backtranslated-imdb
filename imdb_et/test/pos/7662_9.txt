Eliza (Elizabeth Moorman) is a farm girl from a country that comes to town to find love. He has met a man who has told him astrologer who is showing him the stars. This is the journey of the soul ... Eliza has been put to the test, can she understand her true love when she sees her? Tommy (Tommy Lee Jones) is a builder who tries to find himself in his heritage. They show each other different things. Eliza is still looking for love and Tommy is trying to protect the reservation her grandmother lives on. It's a tricky story that sees obvious and beautiful beauty from simple everyday things. The style is artistic and symbolic. A psychedelic camera style can frighten the average mobility, but a deeper message and interesting frames make it worth watching the movie. This is a film that explores the underworld of strange, sad and devastated individuals. It pulls off the road, but it's definitely worth a look!
