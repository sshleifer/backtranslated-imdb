I saw the movie in my original theater release in Austin Texas. The Old Paramount Theater (I don't know if it still exists.) Wandered through the speakers around walls that were exactly connected to all six channels. At the age of 15 I was blown. The concept of spatial sound was completely unfamiliar with music and film. <br /> <br /> I can clearly remember at least three outstanding scenes that have had a great impact on spatial sound. (Although please forgive me when the time has distorted my memories because of inaccuracies.) The first was the trip that the camera conducted with Catfish Row, alive with the areas and sounds of daily activities. You saw the first one, for example the blacksmith, when the camera passed through their sound, he would hear left or right down the theater side. The other one was the march field, which was first seen before, then he went left and right along the crack of the camera. The sound of each instrument not only followed its path, but also changed in the temporal sense as it did toward you, toward you, and then away. And if it wasn't enough, they also formed the Doppler effect of each instrument when it went. The third scene was near the end of the movie, as Porgy leaves Catfish Row to New York to look for Bess. He and about half of the majority of the members pass the camera because they leave the village with the same sound effects as the march field. The other half of the cast / chorus sings with them as well as the wave and voice say goodbye to Porgy and their other friends. Your friends' answers can then be heard from the sides and from the back. <br /> <br /> The surrounding sound was used with all the amazing effects of the film. I think I remember a stone or something that was thrown out of the mule and heard it in the water behind me. Such small things were obvious to such happy theater visitors that they had all six channels - things that would probably be in everyday theaters without it. <br /> <br /> I stayed in the theater for several exhibitions. You could do that. And I went back several times before he left the city. I never saw this movie. It is literally a BEGS that allows you to play back a restored image on a DVD using fidelity and spatial sound. I hope someone has kept it. Please, Gershwin's family, allow it to be released before it is good for other generations.
