As a person in the Pan-Hellenic corporation, I wasn't sure what to expect when I set up this show. After seeing so many dramas about TV shows and the madness of reality exhibitions, I was curious whether Greece would be able to show real college and Greek life experience. <br /> <br /> I was very pleasantly surprised at how the exhibition gave the viewer satisfaction with identifying the more familiar characters in this genre, but it was also able to add symbols deeper. Greek life is not just about parties and little conflict. Although these things are happening in Greek life, they also take place in any other social or professional circle throughout the life of a person. It would be wrong to characterize it as an exclusive experience for the Greek organization. Most of the Greek-language stories and situations can and do occur everywhere, in every group of friends, in sports teams, in real life. But I've been watching both episodes and my "little sister", which I am still very close to, and I have laughed at both episodes and recalled how they really captured the spirit of our college years and experiences. I liked how the second episode showed how the characters fight other aspects of their lives; school, relationships, goals, etc. Cappie tells Rusty that the school will come first and go to your brothers for help that was very alive. You can't stay in an organization if you have a bad rating. Rusty got his professor far away, but it was fun. Even the dynamics between Casey and Rusty; It happens, you grow up and no matter what your relationship with your brother was, it changed so you need to adapt. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: Greece is a great show, a great entertainment value and enough "real life" to be credible and definitely worth the time of viewers.
