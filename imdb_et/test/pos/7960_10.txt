A photographer in a small town in Gunsan in South Korea learns that he has a terminal illness, but it reduces the seriousness of his family and friends. We never know the nature of the disease, but in August, Hur Jin-ho was not focused on his illness on the first movie near Christmas. It is the grace in which he directs his life - his ability to accept what is in stock without regret. Unfortunately, this was the last film of the filmmaker Yoo Young-kilo before his death and the film is dedicated to his memory. <br /> <br /> Photographer Jung-won plays by Han Suk-kyu, at one time, Korea's most popular star. A man who has an infectious laugh at the beginning of his thirties is so warm and viable that it is hard to imagine him until the end of life. Jung-won owns a small photo shop and lives at home with his hard-hearted head (Goo Shin) and sister (Oh Ji-hye), teaching his father how to play movies on video, and writes instructions on how to take over his shop when he dies. As Jung-won goes into his daily activities, Dar-im (Shim Eun-ha), a meter reader, comes to his shop with an urgent demand for some photographic extensions. > <br /> Strong and impatient, he treats him with contempt, but later apologizes and becomes a loyal customer. Without the obvious expression of romantic feelings, their relationship to growing intimacy develops. Love is not something they say or do. It is their being, the place they come from. In order to protect Dar-im from suffering, Jung-won doesn't tell him he has only a short time to live, but it doesn't make him any easier. Inevitably, his growing lack of a shop causes him to feel betrayed and disappointed until he throws the stone through the store window. Although Jung-win decided to abandon Dar-im, it has been questioned but naturally organic in the film and is not simply used as a plot device or an excuse for the character to "live a full life" playing around. <br /> <br /> One of the film's most relevant sequences is when an older woman returns to her studio to take a memorial. Jung-won ensures that the image is exactly the same, knowing that it will soon take its own picture of memory. In August, Christmas is a modest film that never talks about melodrama. It is a joy in the ordinary moments: cycling, sharing fun, eating ice cream, thoughtful and attentive, and feeling good about what life offers. This is a love story where love means you have to say that you are sorry. Although there have been many films in the mortality process, in August the Christmas genre brings new trends and offers unforgettable comments on the human condition in this process. This is an experience that is incompatible with death and is extremely happy.
