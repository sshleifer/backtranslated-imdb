The plot's start is interesting, but in the end too many people die in too short a time, making the story a mysterious aspect of the thriller for slaughter. <br /> <br /> The only real highlight was Adam Beach and JÃ¼rgen Prochnow, who were once again in their excellent selves. Nice to try the inappropriate last third, though a good ending.
