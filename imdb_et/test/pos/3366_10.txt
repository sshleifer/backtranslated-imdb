There is nothing left of this Perry and Croft masterpiece - as good as any of the best episodes, fortunately, it was filmed well before the late James Beck left to show off this talent. <br /> <br /> It shows from the very beginning how the group is formed from the state of national emergency, showing boys like Captain Mainwaring (Arthur Lowe) and Sergeant Wilson (John Le Mesurier) because they are usually through the series. On the way, Mainwaring makes his usual longing to show authority, but the knees can't help but let him down every step of the way during wargames and suspicion of intrusion. However, they have the opportunity to redeem the film if they actually gather Nazi pilots who have taken hostage to the congregation. <br /> <br /> It was a nice finale, especially when Mainwaring was able to prove itself, getting one of the last ways to shape it. A big movie, a lot of good features and a laugh, this is another for the DVD cabinet - I'm glad the BBC is repeating it - and that day on August 2, they had a worthy "father's army night". Don't be skipped!
