It is an excellent German linguist, which is often quite embarrassing and creative, a fun story and strong performances. All the characters are cool and Benno Fürmann is great as a psycho-killer and Franka Potente is a great leader. It took a while to get around, but it was never boring and had good scenes of death, and the music was wonderfully horrible. I was fortunate to get a subtitled version instead of dubbed, and I thought all the characters were pretty nice, well done and written. It also has some very good plot twists and the effects are very well done and the end is great. Finale is particularly tense and I think Franka Potente was the perfect election choice, and I would like Arndt Schwering-Sohnrey (David) not to die so quickly because she was really cool. In fact, there were a few moments in which I felt uncomfortable, but in a good way, and I have to say that this film deserves all this praise, plus if it has holes in the plot, it is not enough to stop the film. It's a great German slasher, it's often pretty cool and creative, fun stories and solid performances, I highly recommend it! The direction is great! Stefan Ruzowitzky is great! Work here with great camera work, very good angles, great close-ups (see the opening scene of sex), doing a great job when you add a horrible atmosphere, and just keep the movie at a very fast pace. <br /> <br /> There's pretty little blood and gore. We get the shots open, lots of very delicate surgical scenes, lots of bleeding, people being dissociated, yet conscious, broken finger, self-injury, cracking, bloody slit, lots of frozen corpses looking for wicked people, lots of blood and much more <br /> > Acting is very strong! Franka Potente is fantastic as the main leader, she was very pleasant, she was under pressure, was vulnerable, easily eyes and we were able to take care of her character, the only time she felt hurt. here and there a little bit of a bad dialogue, but it wasn't very often, he was wonderful!. Benno Fürmann is a great psycho killer, he just chilled and wonderfully OTT, he really gave me a slip and was one effective killer! Anna Loos played her role very well, because the smart bitch I dug her. Sebastian Blomberg was big here as Caspar, he was quite pleasant and had a mysterious character, he also had chemistry with Potent, and at the end he was very complicated. Holger Speckhahn was good as an idiot Phil and did his job well. Traugott Buhre is good as Prof Grombek. Arndt Schwering-Sohnrey was great as David, he really had a cool character and I wanted him not to be killed so quickly. The rest is good. <br /> <br /> In general, I recommend this great German slasher! *** 1/2 out of five
