The timing of the release of this film cannot be better, especially given the current instability in the world. The film is a warm, loving and funny piece of heart. If you have siblings and parents are still alive, it hits the viewer well. If you have lost your parents, it will deeply affect you. Often laughing, the ensemble's cast works very well and are believable. This movie is intelligently written and the lines that come from every actor make the viewer laugh often. There are also moments that also bring tears to your eyes. I recommend this movie to anyone who respects the importance of the family and is able to follow an intelligent movie.
