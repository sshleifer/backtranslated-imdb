I know it, I'm 40 years old and still tear every time I watch Johnny, who finally called his robot back. <br /> <br /> Robot, now stop! Attack ... Robot, what do you do, Robot ... Robot, where are you going? Robot, come back! Robot ... Robot please! Don't do it you die ... Robot ... Robot, please, back! I need you here? Giant Robot ... Robot! Giant Robot? "-Johnny Sokko, the last emperor guillotine <br /> <br /> Of all Tokus there is a giant robot in my heart a special place and is always there. I credit this sci-fi and anime when I was a kid. <br /> <br /> LIVE ON GR!
