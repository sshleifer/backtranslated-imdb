After all these years, I am puzzled why Julie Brown (West Coast) is not a household name or a well-known comedy star. She's one of the funniest women on the planet. In this scourge he takes Madonna, one of her favorite objects. He is Medusa, a very successful singer, like Madonna, who also had a documentary "Truth or Dare". Julie Brown talks about Madonna as Medusa, who came from Wisconsin, dairy and oil. I remember the segment where he went to Wisconsin to visit his family and the grave. I don't remember if it was a parent or his pet. I remember someone saying that Medusa didn't do anything original. He just copied the others. I have to say that I hope this corrupted documentary is available on DVD somewhere. Julie Brown was on her best mockery and spam.
