The film I would like to say was absolutely wonderful. I see how many people think it's just a shocking film. It is not entirely wrong, but it is as shocking as the books of Chuck Palahniuk. One of my favorite films, Bijo no Harawata, is a type of witty film that can be almost any kind. It's frightening, funny, silly, harsh, full of top material and some people. The nervous time I saw it was with my friend and her mother brought it home to see it. He said it was just a Japanese movie, but I saw it a lot more. It's badly done, yes, but it also has a type of boy that is beautiful. As the director himself says, this is a shocking film for some reason. A similar atrophy. If you leave the audience soft, the entire human race is soft. I think this is a good philosophy and I agree with one hundred percent. Bijo no Harawata is a type of film that comes from hell out of power, yogurt and all new waves.
