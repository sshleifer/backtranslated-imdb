Until today, I thought that only three people, including myself, considered the Gate of Heaven (1980) to be masterpieces and perhaps the last great Western (since 1970), after Little Big Man (1970), Jeremiah Johnson (1972), The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) and The Long Riders (1980). <br /> <br /> I was stunned and happy to see 22.5% of IMDB voters rate this movie 10 as I do. The recent book, the worst films of all time, contains the gate of Heaven. It was unfortunate because of this production and release, because Cleopatra had no movie nearly twenty years earlier. At one time it was always considered the most expensive budget, even going beyond Cleopatra. It was accused of falling off of his studio Artists, until all of them finally saw that all the studios fell. Michael Cimino, fresh from his glory with Deer Hunter, hated and despised his success and film making, but clearly, it was a little jealousy worst. <br /> <br /> Cimino finished one of the great American experience shows. This movie must not be missed, but one serious American filmmaker.
