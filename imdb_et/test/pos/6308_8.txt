I saw the week that was opened four years ago and I really didn't know what to expect from Sorrentino's work at that time. He has created a very intriguing and ultimately strange account that no longer has the word "life to life". It exceeded me every step of the way and I was constantly surprised. I enjoyed the very fast pace and how I was gradually given pieces to work out what happened. Tony Servillo is great, as is Magnani. It opens up perfectly with a stylish wide picture and ends with a very moving picture that takes you to the top of the movie. I was thinking long after the main character and position where he was and his final destiny, and I didn't shake that week. I recently bought a movie and its final scene where he thinks his friend will get me every time. I still have to tell everyone who saw it. It is a shame that it did not reach a wider audience if it were the direction of the Italian cinema, it could only be good.
