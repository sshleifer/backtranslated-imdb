I'm a big, lovable, heterosexual male challenger, an ex-rugby player and a former boxer, and I love this movie. <br /> <br /> It's not a mystical river. It's a piece of fluff. But there's plenty of room in life, and if it's fluffy, well-behaved by attractive people, well-drawn, well-drawn and full of good dialogue, there's more room for it. <br /> <br /> I am not the biggest fan of Tom Sellec. But he's good at it. So is Julianne Nicholson (love your bald head and freckles), Ellen Degeneres, Kate Capshaw and even Tom Everett Scott (the thing you do!). <br /> <br /> The landscape is nice, the mood is amazing, there is heartache and misery and farce and even a little redemption. <br /> <br /> Every (male) reviewer who splits this movie does not say that it is not certain in her masculinity. In the meantime, I will continue to capture bits and pieces without excuses when it appears on the cable.
