Marking this movie "Lesbian Love Story" is about as accurate as calling Pride & Prejudice's "straight love story". There's so much more to it. <br /> <br /> Yes, the main character is lesbian, but his story is a classic bildungsroman, a journey from childhood to adulthood, from sexual innocence to maturity, from personal darkness to self-discovery. The stylistic element of the camp is the direction of the film, but it is not an obstacle; rather it is to emphasize the staged and dramatic parts of the life of the main character. <br /> <br /> Those who are familiar with the Anna Chancellor Pride and the Prejudice BBC are sure to be surprised. Rachael Stirling is the main character of Nan, and Keeley Hawes has all her outstanding goodness as her lover Kitty Butler. The Chancellor may have an outstanding role that is aside from Sally Hawkins, who plays Zena Butler. This movie is not a weak heart, but it is also not pro-gay advertising. This is a real story that has a real comedy and drama, an interesting story that has compelling characters and is worth a look.
