Errol Flynn had a great gift for comedy, which was rarely used unfortunately. Due to the right material, this film shows that it could have been in Cary Grant's style, luckily in delicate comedies. It is definitely the best of its contemporary genres. Patti Brady gives an excellent result in childhood, and Eleanor Parker just looks stunning on the whole film. The extra bonus is the wonderful Hattie McDaniel, who unfortunately is too little used by this film - a welcome presence is still great. Flynn carries his comedy tasks with the same style he brought to his ridiculous roles. The fact that it looks as simple does not mean that it is. Super small family comedy, great for Christmas or any other time you feel happy.
