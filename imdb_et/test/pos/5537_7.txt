The only problem with Married Mob is that it's not funny. It dresses like a romantic comedy, but almost anything that happens is funny. But if you can watch it as a movie where almost something funny happens, you really have a good time. This is the title of the glitzy mob movie. Extremely cloudy. However, director Jonathan Demme is one of the few leading cult leaders who would fully and completely embrace their work from the decade in the 1980s instead of realizing that it was still in the 1970s. <br /> <br /> Open credits combine animation from the 1980s, Italian-American and mise-en-scene alternated one at a time. Nevertheless, despite the 1980s, it seems right. Demme's frequent operator Tak Fujimoto and jukebet's soundtrack, with very different pop and alternative jams, are gaudy and it's really under control and nuance. Demme has a good color with a straightforward character in his visual and sometimes seemingly booming fun styles that can be gone in any way, with a smooth FBI agent played by a very sharp Matthew Modine trying to break into the mafia family's chance of a mole trying by Michelle Pfeiffer's alien weapon to leave the criminal lifestyle after she is the husband of the dismissal man, just what you would expect from Alec Baldwin's performance <br /> <br /> How it works for a while, because Demme seems to be on a solid hand bike. He knows the importance of showing us very subjective and relative life-at-home scenes with Pfeiffer, as well as his care and longing as a morally controversial mother, although his relationship with his son Joey is a bit self-evident. What does the son of a mobster listen to the boy-father's mother when his father's boss played Dean Stockwell's brand-natural and overwhelmingly stunning display, giving him such awesome gifts? All in all, Demme's inclined stylizations are easy to see as novel, taking on a fun crime thriller story. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, however, we find that we have gone wrong because inevitably, Modine and Pfeiffer must fall in love. It is not bad, of course, and everyone here and there is really tolerated, but as a romantic sub-platform it is not considered interesting or well, barely at all, as it jumps over the various clich√©s that fulfill the original expectation of the 1980s cheeses, and its audience, I think that it is just the right effect. But someone who is really interested in the story and the aesthetic approach is in tedium. <br /> <br /> So this is a decent film that has big bugs at certain points but, as it grew up in the 80s, a movie or a nostalgic piece that perhaps saw a lot of movies in the 1980s not likely to be fluctuating except for a real laugh. Maybe a couple of scoffs, and this is a very linguistic one, but I wouldn't leave the comedy aisle with the great hopes I would have in the first place. Whatever the case, there are big players who have now disappeared, like Nancy Travis, Joan Cusack and Oliver Platt.
