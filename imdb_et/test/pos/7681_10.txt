Certainly, the Gershwin family understands that it is one of America's greatest operas. You have thousands of fans of this opera waiting to appear on the DVD. Please do not be so stubborn, give us a break. Think of the joy and wonder that you can bring to hungry quality music by releasing this great GEM. Don't wait until the movie is repairing. Cast is first class, music is just awesome, we need beautiful music in today's world. It can never be filmed again with such great pain. With the need for today's home theater systems, great sound systems and great music, I have a look and release of this fantastic movie with the Gershwin family. Big thanks
