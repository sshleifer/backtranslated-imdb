Everyone agrees with the technical excellence of this film by Jutra (whose life ended so tragically). As far as content is concerned, it is, of course, a difference if you are a Quebecker, and this explains some divergences of opinion. For me, Vignault's "Mon pays, ce n'est pas and pays" will be filmed by the cinema. In addition, Jean Duceppe was part of the legendary Quebec. <br /> <br /> This movie can be contrasted with "CRAZY", the current release of Quebec, which is successful enough to show up here in Spain and is around the 1960s. Urban Quebec (Crazy) vs. Quebec Countryside (Antoine). But the film, which keeps aliens and people who know the inside of Quebec, is very different.
