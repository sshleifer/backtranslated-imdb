At the end of the cycle of universal monsters horror films and before the golden age of sci-fi movies, the Drakula House is more horrific than horror and contains some of the more cheesy elements that come to characterize future-sci-fi movies. Lon Chaney Jr. plays Wolf Man and John Carradine, Dracula and Glenn Strange, Frankenstein monster. <br /> <br /> The crazy scientist sets the goal of "treating" both of his "sickness" monsters with the modern Read: mad science. When a scientist's beautiful sister-assistant is hidden from the film early, the viewer is warned that this film is not a typical universal price; this film provides that in the 1950s, sci-fi is self-evidently exploited. <br /> <br /> If you don't mind, don't let older movies and black and white slower pace make you throw this movie at a recommended look. Afaik, this is not currently available on DVD, but AMC brings it from time to time, so keep watching, or you can always want it on your TiVo!
