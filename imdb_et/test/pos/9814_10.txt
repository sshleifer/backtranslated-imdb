In response to the "Confusion", dog injuries seem to be abruptly disappearing, but it can only be a continuity error. But like children trying to build a plane, it's just imagination. These are two very young children who have very active ideas and must rely on these imaginations to keep up with the level of abuse that continues in their home country for their stepfather. In the case of a big one, it is very interesting that the director decided not to show his face. It makes him feel like a monster. When you see your face, it becomes a personality and not just a "monster" who terrorizes the childhood of these two innocent children. By showing only the failures of his abuse and not focusing on the abuse of scenes, children become the main focus of the film. This film has no end, but runs like a father's story to his children. It has embelleshments. This is a good American classic.
