I do not comment on this story as such. I agree that most people comment that this is a good all-round action film with a well-told story and a good course of action. <br /> <br /> This film deserves 100% cinematography in the order in which it was opened. Opening is stunning and I have not yet understood how they did it. The film deserves to be viewed alone! It is a pity that the DVD currently being released is only a movie and no information is given about making a movie. We hope that someone will come to a special edition. And even better is that the opening order also changes to the end, which leaves you completely unlikely! Good stuff. Must be a classic movie torch collector.
