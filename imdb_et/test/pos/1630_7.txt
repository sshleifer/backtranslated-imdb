I was in Rome last night. I am not a book expert, but many changes have been made in the book. The pace of this movie is much faster than the Davinci code. Many things were cut, otherwise it would be a 4-hour movie. Many things were also changed to give the film a fast pace. I think it is important to feel the film and it works well for Hanks, Brown and the company. <br /> <br /> There are some things in the book that seem very unlikely in the film. I don't give any spoilers except saying that the end of the movie is a little different. Finding Leonardo Vetra is also different. Those who see the film may be interested in reading the book to get the story completely. Some small details are also cut from the film. <br /> <br /> Although they made a movie in Rome, they had to redo their internal shots. Since I went to Rome for a walk before the film, I can say that the interior sites are authentic and authentic. Kohler is not in the movie and there is not much to see about CERN. Hanks does a good job and there are interesting scenes in the Vatican archives. Of course, they had no access to this area and I'm not sure if anyone knows what the Vatican archive looks like. Eyelet Zurer is in this movie as Victoria Vetra and she does a good job like eye candy for Hanks. <br /> <br /> This movie should be better received by critics and the public, but you never know. Ron Howard mentioned several times in the interviews and as we saw him and in front of the film before it was just a film.
