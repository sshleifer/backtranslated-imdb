Spike Milligan's books and games have captured filmmakers over the years and, unfortunately, the 2002 Puckon is no exception. Created in 1924, the novel concerns the separation of Ireland, especially its impact on the individual community (the title "Puckoon"). Because of the colossal threat, half of the village is in Northern Ireland, the other half in the Republic. Locals go to their gardens to find a barbed wire that blocks their path. Drinkers gather like sardines in the pub corner to enjoy a cheaper pint. A dead person must get a passport with his name before the villagers can bury the parish. <br /> <br /> "Puckoon" is a kind of Irish "Under Milk Wood" that has a lot of comics and surreal events. The leader, Dan Milligan (named "Madigan" in the film), plays Sean Hughes consistently and has conversations with a narrator (Richard Attenborough). The film also includes Milo O'Shea, Griff Rhys Jones, David Kelly (Robin's Nest), Freddie Jones, Joe McGann and Elliott Gould. "The documentary, writer / director Terence Ryan, expressed an unwanted admiration for the book. It shows on the screen. But, unfortunately, a good book is not a badly guided film, "Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy," which may not be a good movie. The problem with "Puckoon" is that, like other Milligan books, they don't just work on the big screen. "Puckoon" is basically a collection of jokes when looking for a plot. <br /> <br /> In no way can a movie be compared to train wrecks like "Potato Men", "Fat Slag", and "Lesbian Vampire Killers", but then not as good as it should have been. there are a lot of police, the British army, some locals who have put explosives in their coffins, and it's really annoying to sit in. Ryan's decision to stick to the book is the main reason he didn't work in the movie. The second problem is the complete lack of charm. "Waking Ned" it was a pot, while the Ted Ted television series was a lot more fun, Spike lived long enough to watch the movie and apparently enjoyed it. His daughter Jane is Madigi's bride, which is the front for me. <br /> <br /> For me, the highlight was at first: "I don't mind!", Said Spike: "I just don't" Don't want to be when it happens! ".
