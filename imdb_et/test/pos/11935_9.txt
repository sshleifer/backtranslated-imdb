This is one of the best "Bloke" movies since the early 90s, and although a bit outdated, it is one of those films that never came out today, which makes it very special! In fact, in the '90s, the Masterminds was a very similar film, and it was a PG variation on the same subject, but it wasn't nearly as fun or realistic on this issue. <br /> <br /> So what is it? so special about this movie? This is the film's main characters and contradictory themes. Sean Astin is very pleasant and played the most memorable films of the 90s / 90s, especially The Goonies. He also went to bigger things with trilogy "Rudy" and "Lord of the Rings", but "Encino Man" is a good travel memory. Whether Wheaton from "Stand by Me" gives the movie a good support and Andrew Divoff is a terrible villain. Louis Gossett Jr is in his role, but he adds a bit shorter, especially his relationship with Astin to the film. <br /> <br /> So how is this? According to today's standards, it is quite annoying and inexpensive, almost like a TV movie, but the production values ​​are good and violence is actually quite disgusting for a schoolgirl film. The director compensates for a limited budget with some nicely alternating moments and well-placed humor. <br /> <br /> So park your brain on the door and enjoy this memorable action but don't wait for the Oscar material!
