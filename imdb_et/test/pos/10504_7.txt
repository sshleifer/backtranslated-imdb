<----- Small spoilers! -----> <br /> <br /> Woman gets pregnant but not her husband. He develops something inside him or at least what his wife thinks. They go through a lot of difficult times, while it is on the brink of nervous system breakdown. The husband contacts the UFO professor and, with his help, tries to find out what is wrong with him. <br /> <br /> <----- Small spoilers! ----> <br /> <br The story could have been a little better or at least less predictable, but the movie is memorable and it got me and my sister tried the whole movie without any problems. Action is very good and filming is much better than normal b-alien movies. Effects are good and every second of every movie is done. The characters are really nice, and besides the stylish sister onÃ© scene they are all very convincing in their roles. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a good movie and may recommend it if you like alien / monster-abduction movies! <br /> <br /> 7/10 - The story could have been a bit less predictable.
