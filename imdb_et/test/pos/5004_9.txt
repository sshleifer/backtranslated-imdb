I saw it last week and the sketch for Korea was funny. Very language is cheek and suitable for political climate. A complete reference to writers and Spike. The part where his translator pulls the rickshaw and throws out Korean words could only have pulled Spike. This is Fox's daring test. This is a great show and I hope it pulls out. My wife and I are TIVOing this on a regular basis, and although it comes into contact with another program, let's look at it now on MySpace. I hope Fox dedicates full resources to the exhibitions and does it every day. I can't wait to show Bobby Lee at the show. People like Bernard Abedalla's show are on the right track. Also Mary Mae as her wife looks beautiful.
