A great period that shows how attitudes have changed over 40 years. Good product development, tempting stars, big lines ("Miss Bender, I don't care if you beat it on the local drum!", Says Joan Crawford to Amanda Farrow Hope Lange, when Lange asks incredibly how he should summarize for a very short time). If you have seen and scanned this movie on TV, not in pay-TV or AMC (American Movie Classics) inbox format, you haven't actually seen it. Hopefully, this innocent joy of the movie will soon be available on DVD with a typeface and its original four-track stereo soundtrack. The great opening order that really strives for the 1959 New York mood, Johnny Mathis sings "Everything" theme in the echo chamber, surrounded by the violin bark and the second peeling cream. Breaches! Madness! Office Romance! Bitchy Cold Heart Bosses! Pleasant love! It's all here.
