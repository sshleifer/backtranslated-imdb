Halloween: The Michael Myers Curse is probably the best Halloween clips. Jamie, the serpent killer, Michael Myers' sister, is a child who was taken by a Halloween man's hair 5. A human sister helps Jamie escape, but Myers follows her quickly and kills her. Jamie's child has been found and rescued by Tommy Doyle, one of Jamie Lee's babysate from the original film, and Myers arrives at Haddonfield and begins to kill the Strode clan living in her old house. The film ends with scenes that reveal the story of Michael's evil, the identity of the Black Human, and the whole story of Dr. Loomis / Michael Myers. I recommend this brilliant masterpiece of horror. <br /> <br /> Halloween: The curse of Michael Myers is rated R for strong graphical violence, extreme gore, short sexuality, language and short nudity.
