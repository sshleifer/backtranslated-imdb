I'm saying, unfortunately, because when you see this movie now, you understand how low our media is - all the warning signs in this movie. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie, I think the last big James Brooks movie, but others may disagree. It has rich characters (who are also believable), great actors, great writing, and although the music got a little cheesy, it even liked it. <br /> <br /> William Hurt has never been better. Holly Hunter is stunning. And Albert Brooks walks in every scene where he is - this human triangle is beautifully drawn and convincing and made the whole film surprising, it is an important and important topic in the news, and how it slowly threatens our people. <br /> <br /> See it with NETWORK for a really fun and frightening evening.
