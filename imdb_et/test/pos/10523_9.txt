I was captured after the last 45 minutes of the movie, late night about 8 years ago. What a wild and funny 45 minutes. I was completely at night in the old hotel that was broken by breaking the ball. I remember Stacy Keach vaguely stealing a police car, fake that they are cops and strong weapons some winosid. Wino that Keach "Hey, why Ya is for us ...? Keach" It's my job. They don't do it like that. Great movie. Golden70 ... Hopefully it will see daylight as a DVD with other lost treasures ... Hickey and Boggs are one of them.
