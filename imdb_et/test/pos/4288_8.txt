If we could have "separate tables" why not "separate". <br /> <br /> It's somewhat involved. The caretaker's husband is killed when he is under the car while riding a bicycle. The culprit is the woman she cleans. The latter interacted with a friend and drove by car during the accident. To make it even more complicated, the housekeeper once worked for the parents of the boys and imprisoned him. Therefore, people believe that the accident was caused by his car. Sounds like he wants revenge. <br /> <br /> It's all twisted. When our housekeeper discovers that his boss was driving a car, he tells his testimony to the resentment of a large case officer. <br /> <br /> As it would not be enough, many months later, our lover (Rupert Everett) becomes ill and our lady (Emily Watson) leaves her husband (Tom Wilkinson) to take care of her. <br /> <br /> The characters are pretty good despite a never-ending theme like "Peyton". Tom Wilkinson is a lawyer trying to protect his wife. <br /> <br /> The film is good, but we could have been without Well, the marriage ended anyway.
