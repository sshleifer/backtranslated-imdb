I can't believe people give bad comments on this movie! I don't know why ...... maybe because of this book ..... I have to admit that it doesn't follow the book ... definitely ... the dean's book is much better. but the movie is also good! it has a relationship ... doing good is good ... especially Michael ironside, who has been given a great show in the movie !!! <br /> <br /> Come one man, give this movie a chance. .. is a lot worse than a movie .... like the sum of all the fears ... phantoms ... da vinci code ... this is some of the worst movie i've seen ... really boring when compared to observers who has really great elements in the movie ... this movie contains a great break and a non-stop action !!! I'm looking for this movie ... but it's really hard to find a DVD ... <br /> <br /> da way ... i really suggested this movie to everyone ... watch it! !!! you will never regret !!! <br /> <br /> 10/10 *
