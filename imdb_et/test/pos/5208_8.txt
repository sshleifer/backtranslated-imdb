The film is the battle of Stalingrad. For those who don't know anything about it, it was the worst fight during World War II. More than 1 million people died during the battle. This is the only movie I've seen that seems to be in fact the bad things in the war between Russia and Germany. What I really liked is that two ideologies (Nazism and Communism) were not in the film anywhere. Unlike most American films, the Germans do not see blood cancer as murderers, but what the average German infantry was was human. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around four soldiers fighting in Stalingrad. They were taken from there to try to take the city. The film follows these men from August 1942 to the beginning of 1943. During this time, they learn the horrors of war and try to find a way out of the battle. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, you feel the desperation of the whole battle. Unlike the "enemy gates", the filmmakers did not try to put in an odd love story or dress up the actual events of the battle. This film can be a fiction, but it will continue what happened in the bloody battle of World War II.
