I like many others to see it as a child, and I loved it, and it frightened me until I became an adult, I tried to find this movie and even searched for it on television ever since it was originally played on US networks. Does anyone know where to buy this movie, or is anyone ready and ready to make a copy for me? Does anyone know if the TV still has a chance to play? Maybe all of us fans should write a station that hopes they will be a beating again. I don't think they did this movie before, because no one really knows, people only know Stepford's women and Stepford's wife movies. No one knows the fact that the children's version was there. Maybe they should do it again because they seem to have done a lot in recent years, doing a lot of my favorite old thriller / horror. Well, if anyone has any input. Please write me the information.
