"Termination" can be as much as exiting a predetermined identity, such as drug withdrawal. As a rural man coming to Beijing must strike a classic and successful face of this young artist as a call to separate his roots and overcome the success of his peasant parents. However, problems arise when a new man is too new if it requires too much departure from family, history, nature and personal identity. The following splits and confusion between the imaginary and the real and the heroic between the ordinary and the heroic are on the one hand intestinal controls or on the other hand self-release. Hongshen slips into the last and his long and lonely road back can be grim. <br /> <br /> But what makes Zhang Yang, the leader of honesty, sensuality, and his actors, all the way to this journey. No clich√©s, stereotypes, rigid gender roles, required gender, romance, or violence scenes, no street language required, and no sense of money for character and capricorn. <br /> <br /> Hongshen Jia is in the mid-twenties. He is a talented actor, impressive, in vain, idealistic and maybe emotionally hungry. The perfect recipe for his enhancers. Soon he will be a "cool" actor who has been idolized by young people. "He was hot in the early 1990s." "He always had to be the most modern." He needs extremes and goes to heavy metals, takes on earrings and scarf. His action means art, friends and roles, but not one that offers any personal challenge or input. And his self-criticism, which has destroyed the success of success, opens doors to irrational self-consciousness, external anger - "I didn't know how to act" "I felt like fake" - and readily available drugs. He says, "I had to do high to do what the director wanted." Thus, his low identity as an actor becomes an escape from identity through drugs. <br /> <br /> Hongshen's departure from drugs and his false life is very gradual, intermittent - and he's his own. Loneliness, space, meditative thinking, refusal of speech, replace treatment. The abstract is off. And much of his changes take place - not in ideal locations, but mainly in green places under the Beijing highways, bridges and high climbs. Physics is almost romantic, but not. The bike park is driven by Ritan Park, long spontaneous walks, drying sun and rain, grassland picnics, sky patterns and kites that are absorbed are very specific. He moves to reach, while pulling clues to a more realistic and realistic identity. "I started to open," he says back then. And it seems that the contact begins with his harsh body that designs a certain type of dancer position (clumsy, graceful, humorous, talkable) in the current situation. If the spirit or spirit is missing, his legs may force him to walk overnight. <br /> <br /> His return is centered on rejection of set roles. In order to finish his action and his determination for a new identity, he crushes his videos and TV and beats his head up to his "John Lennon Forever" poster. He has let his iconic anti-agency artist --- but he's the only viable guide he knows. He even depicts himself as the son of John (Yoko Ono) and accepts his "Mother Mary" as "the hour of darkness" and "in distress." "The music is so much more real than action," he says. And talking about the effect of Lennon as "showing me a new way". At the spiritual institute, life-saving apples (resistance, nutrition) reflect Lennon's presence, as does Hongshen's need to re-hang his hero's poster in his rebuilt room. <br /> <br /> When Lennon's influence is enchanting, Hongshen's father's influence is grounded. Although father and son are both actors and users (drugs and drinks), Fegsen's differences are his son, who ensures his change. Because the father himself is more solid: he admits that he is a Chinese, peasant in the peasantry, director of rural theater. And he controls both his habit and emotions. This is the recognizable identity that guides Hongshen to treat him like a loud voice, sometimes with anger and rage, sometimes with humor (blue jeans, Beatles) and passivity. His most mad and violent shift with his father, where he accuses him of being a liar and a fake person, is more than a father: "all the acts I behaved before were whores ... life is funny." And Hongshen's empathetic "you are not my Father replies softly, "Why can't a peasant be your father?" With the help of many additional help from these two teachers and his mother, sister, friends, prisoners, he makes a real (not whole) self. As the long-term effects of drugs are diminishing, his old identity. Debt replaces pride, distrust of trust. Honesty forbids your black cloud. All his edges soften. "You're just a human being," he repeats indefinitely after he has been released from refusal. Back to home, the pig litter with soap is now good. And once her "rare and true friendships" begin again, as it is so obvious, she is backward with her girlfriend on the back. Hongshen says of this movie: "It's a good way to think about your life." And I can add, become a new actor, art and life. Like Lennon, he has achieved success without losing identity.
