Surprisingly good "Mean Streets" type of crime drama. Shows "Goodfellase" and "Casino" elements. Joe Pesc's first big role. Smart Dialog. I think Maltin's guide will give it a bomb. I can only guess that nobody bothered to watch it. <br /> <br /> I saw it at Tarantino Film Festival and said Scorsese used several of them at Raging Bull.
