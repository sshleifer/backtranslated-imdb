"Do not torture a duckling" is one of the coolest Italian horror effects I've ever seen, and I've seen my part. To name it, giallo is a bit misleading because it is not a typical mystery of murder. This is a more straight horror movie. <br /> <br /> Complete with one of the oldest films ever in the movie, such as Fulci's twisted and twisted film, with a creepy atmosphere and an old-school Italian feel. This place is perfect: an old Italian village. Music is ridiculously perfect. Finale is genuine and original. <br /> <br /> After you see "Don't Torture a Duckling", you really have to think about how Fulci's later things will beat you. I like all his stuff, but he's wrong. Maybe he thought he'd already done that ... Because he's a bullmaster with this movie. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who thinks Dario Argento has a giallo genre. Fulci wins it with him. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10, kids.
