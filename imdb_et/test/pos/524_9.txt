This movie must be exported to the rest of the world! An absolute masterpiece with a strange and gloomy film as four different stories from four different locations in Sweden. Recently renovated, with an improper wooden shape of the old finance minister, it is absolutely the best of the four strange stories of love or career. I would like to see all four films on their own, so they can be expanded so much. <br /> <br /> The unique break in the middle is something I've never seen before. <br /> <br /> Can't wait for a series (if they do) or an extended DVD. Apparently, they had already cut off a lot within 3.5 hours.
