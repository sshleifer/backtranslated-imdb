This is a great movie. No, it's not Mel Gibson's "Braveheart", but then it's not trying. In fact, "the Emperor and the Assassin" is probably (fortunately) more common with Shakespeare's production than Hollywood's buggy. <br /> <br /> In the third century BC, King Qin tries to unite (in other words "conquer") the seven kingdoms of China. He has already destroyed the kingdom of Han. Now he needs an excuse to break into the Yani Kingdom. <br /> <br /> This is where Lady Zhao is. He and his king have been friends since childhood. They are obviously very in love, but can't get married for political reasons. They work together on the plot. He pretends to be at a disadvantage to the king and flee to Yani. Once there, he persuades the prince of Yani to send the king to kill the assassin. If the murder fails, the King is excused for invading Yani. <br /> <br /> When Yanis is there, Lady Zhao begins to review. When you hear and see more and more examples of the mercy of your old childhood friend, he begins to wonder if the king may need to be murdered for real. Final meeting between King and Assassin. Unlike the Hollywood movie, where the hero and the villain are clearly defined and the end result has already been determined beforehand, it is a fight that could really go to both sides. <br /> <br /> This is a well-designed and well-behaved story poisonous during Chinese history. There is a mixture of incredible beauty and incredible ugliness. The most beautiful, however, is Gong Li as Lady Zhao. I'm growing more and more to make sure every time I see him, Gong Li is the most beautiful woman in the world. <br /> <br /> But I have to say that he has an unintentionally funny line in this movie. At the beginning of Gong Li, one of his servants asked, "Do I have a beautiful face?" <br /> <br /> Duh !!!
