This movie is what most industry has forgotten about how to do: FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT, which means something that is enjoyable for people of all ages. This particular Wallace & Gromit can be enjoyed by all toddlers who love the colors and the cute bunnies of their grandparents who understand adult references. <br /> <br /> This movie is as good as anyone I've ever seen, and I mean it literally. It's also full of tiny humor components, and every scene has so many humorous details in the background that I have to buy, just to read all the characters and handrails in the W&G world. <br /> <br /> I plan to see it in movie theaters at least twice and buy it on DVD. You should see it too.
