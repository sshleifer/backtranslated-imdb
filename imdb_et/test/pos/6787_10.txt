Wow! What a lovely, warm, rural movie! The story focuses on Mi Taylor (Mickey Rooney), a young man whose journey takes him to a quiet, rural coastal area. There he is with the Brown family. Velvet (Liz Taylor), their youngest daughter Mi, who is calm with friends, is passionate about horses and wins at auction. This horse is a beautiful, maroon slave; by his former owner as a "murderous pirate", but Velvet calls him a pie. Not long afterwards, Velvet advises him to enter the big national race, Mi and his family are against the idea, but soon agree that Velvet and Mi began to train him for Britain's most famous horse race? This movie is a beautiful example of British movies. I remember seeing it for the first time when I was eight and on my summer vacation. My parents recorded it off the TV and I warmed it up immediately? watching it for the most days, instead of collecting a large number of Disney movies I belonged to. <br /> <br /> I believe this was one of Liz Taylor's first films and good! His character is naive, but sweet? his action is extremely convincing, especially when he depicts his love for horses. It is also a good opportunity to see Angela Lansbury in one of her early roles; who together celebrate Velvet's older sister, who spends most of the time in the movie that the boy strikes with the city! I have to say he was younger than he was younger. Beautiful blonde hair and rosy face. Although he does not have a significant role in the film, he has several scenes - so he does not disappoint his fans! Parents who read it, do I have to emphasize? if you can get this copy, please do! If you are kids loving animals? I suggest you show it to them! They can find a couple of scenes bored, but you can see Velvet on horseback riding throughout the film and will be happy to have fun with the kids! Cute and nostalgic movie. I can just go away now and put it on!
