Since I first met divine Mrs Merkerson as a sex therapist Spike Lee, "She's Gotta Have It," I have been sold to this highly talented but terribly undervalued actress. She got emmy for her portrayal and said it was well-earned, an underestimated masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Here she just looks like a leading force and a hand in her community. It was particularly embarrassing for me because I grew up at the same time. The details of the production were phenomenal and induced woooooooooooooon-beautiful memories of life and times in the 50s and 60s and women like Mrs Merkerson. He was carefully and carefully accompanied by hot, hot cast with performances could be enjoyed over and over again. I first saw Macy Gray's name credit and went to ho. His performance was so good that I didn't even know him up to a third. I am particularly proud of the obvious care and attention to detail to create a feeling and look for another beautiful newspaper that has been very tastefully made. <br /> <br /> Another very interesting aspect is that the project was less of a worry about the racial fabric of time, but it is endlessly related to the wealth and emotional diversity of the characters they show that ultimately we are talking about the choices we make and to what extent we take responsibility for these choices. <br /> <br /> This is a worthy and elegant presentation of African-American life and is definitely a classic. You forged it as part of your collection. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend.
