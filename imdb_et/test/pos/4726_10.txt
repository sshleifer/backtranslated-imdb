This is one of the most underrated films of the 1990s. If you allow yourself to be identified by the character of Patricia Arquette, you will find that this is a very moving story that a woman restores a sense of purpose from her life and finds a new will to live. <br /> <br /> Arquette's play is daring because it is deliberately "wooden" - this is the way to define the spiritual death of her character, her complete absence in life. He moves through life like a zombie because his family is murdered and he doesn't see the point of life. This is how the story is re-aroused by the beautiful quality of the Burmese landscape, people and landscapes, and is forced to resist because of the initial choices. <br /> <br /> Boorman visually supports it (and Hans Zimmer supports it with one of his great, haunting results), often with a static camera and a tendency to shoot through glass, windows, windshields, etc. like Arquette .... until she finds himself deep in the jungle and is forced to choose whether to fight for her life. <br /> <br /> I also recommend the 1954 PURPLE PLAIN movie. It is similar to the story in a similar environment and makes it exciting.
