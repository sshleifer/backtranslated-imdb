Cool action - yes, the assumption is made - but not so - it's a trick. hey folks - SHOCK - this is an X file. <br /> <br /> Me - it's cool that Scully / Mulder has almost no scene together - they have to adapt, rely on each other's inner thoughts, what's really going on - and each other's adaptability skills. They read each other's moves and work ... (sort of). <br /> <br /> Oh yes --- really good action - can these people do it? Or - a slow day when the store doesn't call them to work. (hey - Duchovny - where are the everyday donuts? Malcolm - go to school ...)
