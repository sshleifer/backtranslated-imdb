Okay, I am 12 years old, so this is where you see the movie from a pre-earning point of view. I've also commented on Magnolia and Bicentennial Man, both great movies if you want to check it out. Alright, here on Earth there was a beautiful film with outstanding scenes and pictures. Writer (I don't know who it was, check IMDB) either worked very hard or appreciated love, poetry, and drama. I shouted this movie 4 times, once over 30 minutes. It was really sad, really beautiful, really worthwhile. It's a great movie for everyone, say, 11 and up, who's not a romantic comedy freak. Yes, it's romantic, yes, it's a comedian, but (in my opinion) is better than "He's all this" or "Whatever it takes". I never shout! It's a gentle story. Go to rent and record it :).
