Of course, every episode seems to have real content in just about 17 minutes, but it's definitely fun to watch. You may find that you are guiding your chair when a friend puts his mouth in the mouth and strikes or strikes his head when a ridiculous line is actually working. The host panel has more benevolent, friendly (dare to say Canadian) style comments compared to US reality programs. I think people who complain about this show won't be joking. They take the show more seriously than the show itself takes. VIP keys are a great cartoon of reality shows, sports television culture and club scene. I hope they will do another season and I would like to see if there is a US version. This is definitely a fun and original assumption.
