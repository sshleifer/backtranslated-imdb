I was sure about this movie before renting it and assured that Hilary Swank has always given great performances in her films. He seems to rely on a security system to get the emotional effect he does. And he didn't prove me wrong in this movie. <br /> <br /> But the film also had a fantastic presentation of all the cast members who spoke and talked. I have to stand out for two main protagonists, Jamie Bartlett and Chiwetel Ejiofor, for portraying their excellent ability to act and the feelings and flaws of real people. The whole movie ran almost like a documentary. <br /> <br /> I have to praise Tom Hooper as director and editor of Avril Beuke to keep the multilayered story smooth, keeping fashion and understanding in the direction of fashion. The order of opening the South African landscape was striking and I had to press the pause button to enjoy photography. <br /> <br /> Why doesn't such a film become an international award. It seems to me that it hits all the lists high. It was not only a film, but a real life experience in a country that came out of apartheid. The life of poverty was everywhere, but it marked the dignity of the human spirit.
