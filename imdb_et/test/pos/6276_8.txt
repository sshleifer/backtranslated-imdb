Jazz Singer is one of the many films made in the late 1940s and 1950s on the Jewish experience of the United States. In addition to Crossfire (1947) and the gentlemen's agreement (1947) on anti-Semitism, they usually had a musical-theater background. These films included The Jolson Story (1946), Jolson Sings Again (1949), Eddy Duchin Story (1951), Eddie Cantor Story (1953), Benny Goodman Story (1956), and Margorie Morningstar (1958). The leading actors in these Jewish films were always non-Jews. For example, Larry Parks, a non-Jew, played Al Jolson and Gene Kelly played Noel Airman at Marjorie Morningstar. This pain was likely to have been made to make the Jewish issue visible to a non-Jewish audience. Jazz Singer (1952) is no different. Danny Thomas was a devoted Catholic, and Peggy Lee was certainly not a Jew, although he plays a non-practicing Jew. His background image is when he participates in a Golding family meal, he says, "I have not left home (passover service)." <br /> <br /> The film is about the son of a cantor who has just left Korea after his service. His dilemma is to become a cantor, a family doctor, or to be a musical theater singer. His choice of theater brings inevitable conflict with his father. <br /> <br /> There is much more to this movie. This film was made after the Rosenberg trial at McCarthy's cool and Hollywood blacklist. That's why Jews are shown as good loyal citizens in this movie and are Americans. Synagogue choir plays baseball rather than practice. Cantor's friends also speak of a baseball, one of which is a big league judge. The synagogue itself dates back to 1790 and has been visited by George Washington. Therefore, Jews are an integral part of American society. There is no Eastern European accent in this film. Peggy Lee appeared in very few feature films. In this movie, you see him admiring "Lover" and "Just One of the Things". Danny Thomas is quite believable and acts very well and sings. Comedic routines could have been omitted. Yes, the film is schmaltzy and sentimental, but it's worth noting. I enjoyed it very much.
