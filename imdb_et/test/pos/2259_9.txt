I saw it last night and voted for it "8". Since then it has grown for me and I would give it "9". <br /> <br /> The film has (at first) a seemingly loose facade between the first and second sides. In the first half there is comedy and there are few clues about the ages, life, wars, religious intolerance that appear on the other side. Although this may be somewhat disturbing at first, because it is a somewhat unknown narrative sequence, it works in reflection. <br /> <br /> I have scanned most of the other "User Reviews" and have seen some who have read the book are happy with the film if there are few who don't. Of course, both feelings are valid. <br /> <br /> For me, the retired family physician and one of the world's believers, the film was appropriate for two different levels. <br /> <br /> The first, as history, gave a strong reminder of how often polarizations occur - demonizing and trying to destroy some of those who have a different moral value system of smoke. The second was that, at first, it also showed something that is common to all of us, all our families - that each of us must go back to our roots to understand better. br /> <br /> TS Eliot excelled it in his fourth four quarters when he said: "We will not finish the investigation // And complete our investigation // Must reach where we started // And we know this place for the first time. " <br /> <br /> Jonathan continues the perfect journey that one of us finds fantastically enlightening - to explore and discover our roots; what these people went through, who they were - really! - before, when and in the first years before and after birth? So the film first gives us an impression of comedy, then shifts to give us a story about history and human deficiencies, but everything that gives us - subconsciously - a. message for everyone. All of us would benefit a lot from going back and understanding where we first started.
