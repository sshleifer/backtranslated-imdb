A great story that the filmmaker is talking about. The relationship between man and leopard brought a lot of questions to the viewers just about who was human. For some reason, people only killed the animals to survive. At the end of the film, I wondered who was the true hero of the film. Well-spoken story. The human actor did a great job, but the leopard stole every scene.
