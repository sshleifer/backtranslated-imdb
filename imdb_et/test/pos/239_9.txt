One of my favorite non-MGM music, it's classic!> Rita Hayworth is up, her beauty jumps off the screen. Gene Kelly shows her dance skills and introduces her nervous and innovative choreography to the musicals, which would eventually change the choreographer of the musicals. Phil Silvers is the perfect second banana and Eve Arden injects this movie with a lot of class. <br /> <br /> The structure is so theatrical that you have to think about why in this era, when the big Broadway exhibitions come from movies, Cover Girl is not tailored to the theater.
