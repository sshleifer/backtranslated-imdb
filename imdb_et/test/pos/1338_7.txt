This movie is the most traumatic and painful horror movie I've ever seen in my life. To find out that this movie is based on a real story and looking at the brutal murder of Jeffrey Dahmer (Carl Crew), his victims are tearful enough with my eyes. I admit that this was a low-budget film with no best dialogue, but explained why Jeffrey Dahmer was a Psychotic Maniac. Because he was so selfish / inner, emotional and selfish in his brain went so far as to become a murderer. Every person he attracted to his apartment was attracted to him and felt, and the reasons why he was murdered were not only the excitement of killing them, but because he could not cope with leaving. In the scene, when he killed his first victim, trying to catch the object on the back of the boys with what I noticed was not because he wanted to kill him, but because he was devastated by the idea that the man left. Since then, he has been killed and killed his hobby - both for evil and emotional reasons. <br /> <br /> Scene when she spoke when she woke up with her mom on the phone and told her how much she loved her and the love she showed her grandmother and she didn't want to go out of her house there is love in your heart. One scene that I found quite spooky and strange was when the priest heard of Jeffrey in a pub calling for the boy to return to his apartment and then calling to Jeffrey in a pub in the pub, so that the boy would lose patience and lose his patience to lose his patience Jeffrey. When the boy left the pub, the priest hung a phone and laughed at Jeffrey. I also found that Carl Crew played a remarkable role in the role of Jeffrey Dahmer. His evil and cold blood facial expressions, before he killed his victims, were so real, I trembled in my seat. His facial expression reminded me of Vincent D'onofrio's (Private Pyle / Leonard) film "Full Metal Jacket" just before he fell into the public barracks. <br /> <br /> If your emotional person I don't want to watch this movie, but if you are not, go ahead and watch it.
