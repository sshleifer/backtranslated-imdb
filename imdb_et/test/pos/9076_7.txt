This is definitely a good movie, unlike what other people say. Peline and I have both seen the movie 3x and the end is cheesy, but it's part of the package ... to experiment with death is the same as trying to hit it so the movie is cool. For those who want to see the classic Kevin Bacon movie, look at it. Take care of welcoming Istanbul. we write 10 lines if you really want us 2, but we think it's a waste of time. The rest of this review should not be taken seriously, because we wrote to meet the demands of the 10 lines (which is crazy), but we are kind people and therefore we adapt them to the rules we have established. So people watch this movie not because we wrote 10 lines, but because it's good. and by the way we wrote 12 lines !!
