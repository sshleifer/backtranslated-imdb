This movie made Dr. Giggles look like the best movie I've ever seen. The plot was large, the plot turned even better and cast large. It is hard to believe that they made the most unknown people 8 years ago and they would be big names today! <br /> <br /> The plot is simple. 4 teenagers destroy their car somewhere in the middle. They stumble on its camp site and do what everyone should do in an accident. Build a fire and talk about scary stories. <br /> <br /> 1. "Hook." Great opener. Anyone in high school has heard the variations of this story at Prom night. But they do it really good in the movie. <br /> <br /> 2. "Honeymoon." Okay, it wasn't the 4th best. It was pretty good and you look somewhat. The word "some" in Emphisis. It's just your main creature in the forest story. <br /> <br /> 3. "People can hit too." This is a deterrent story of what is happening in online chat rooms across the country. This segment alone should be viewed to see parents whose children have access to the Internet. <br /> <br /> 4. The Locket. Now this is the best story of the whole movie. The motorcycle boy breaks and goes to the mute girl. Very good plot twist. <br /> <br /> "The Campfire" has the biggest and best twist on the entire movie. I'm not saying what it is because I don't want to destroy it. I was never shocked during my movie. <br /> <br /> Plot: A + <br /> <br /> Action: A + <br /> <br /> Writing: A + <br /> Management: A + <br /> <br /> Music: A + <br /> <br /> Generally: A + <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone over the age of 13, except "People get Lick too." Every child who has child access to the internet must look at it with their child.
