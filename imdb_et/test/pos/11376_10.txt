It was the best film of 1998 and one of the best of the 90s. Yes, it is a crowding out of Goodfellas. But as they say, good poets borrow, big poets steal. And PTA has stolen some of the best, with some of its own geniuses added. I gave it ten (which is very rare for me). <br /> <br /> The main reason I comment on this (because I can just drag it at night) is all those people who have seen this VHS standard question ... what do you mean? It deserves the FULL SCREEN experience. Look at the relationship he was in! I saw it in the cinema 5 times and didn't bother to watch this video. <br /> <br /> Nuff said!
