When I was younger, this film was always on Friday night on channel 40 (this was the year when Fox was a network and took over the program). I always looked at it. I'd go to the grocery store with my parents, then sit down with my Swanson TV feed and Lady Lee Cola (the only week I was allowed to drink the cola and enjoy. Of course, the script is late late in the 70's, Little Darlings), but it's a fun movie and I loved Rudy and Tripper, Bill Murray on the beach with a little effort, but he's charming. You have to love Spazi and those taped glasses (before Nerds revenge) Chris Makepeace has pretty much the same character he played at "My bodyguard" but it does so well.
