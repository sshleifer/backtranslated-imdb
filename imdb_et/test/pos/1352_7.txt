Burt Kennedy wrote and directed this novel from the West. Kennedy was a well-known good writer and director, mostly Western. <br /> <br /> Robert Mitchum has had a deadline of over 20 years. This role was like many of what he had already done. You can see why he was a great star for so many years. <br /> <br /> He filled this role just like a well-used glove. <br /> <br /> The title character is played by Robert Walker Jr. (His father's fine actor Robert Walker - died tragically at the age of 32 - his mother is seen by actor Jennifer Jones). <br /> <br /> Robert was easy to build, and although he had only a few films talent. (she was near Rita Hayworth in the last movie. <br /> <br /> SALINAS DIRECTION --- same year and very good). <br /> <br /> He looked like his father, but he seemed to have no fathers' charm. He did just a few movies. She still lives and I wish her well. <br /> <br /> Most of his scenes are with another Hollywood son. David Carradine's son David, who is still making movies. they did a nice team. <br /> <br /> In Western, you always have a female and usually a ballroom performer. (today they call them whores), Angie Dickinson analyzes this role nicely. West Stalwarts, John Anderson and Jack Kelly are also highlighted. <br /> <br /> It was a movie in Tucson, outside the center of Tucaon Azi. & terrain is fantastic. <br /> <br /> It is typical of the older West that it is not too big, has good humor and normal termination. <br /> <br /> It's 89 minutes to enjoy. <br /> <br /> Ratings: *** (of 10) 84 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)
