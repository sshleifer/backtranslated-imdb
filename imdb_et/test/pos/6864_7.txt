Anatomy (Anatomy) is an entertaining and enthralling film that does not offer any inconvenience that should be associated with the theme of films. The idea of ​​ethical ignorance in the world of medical sciences is what pushes the viewer into discomfort and the institutional realities (Heidelberg) and special effects make it not a simple film to watch. However, characters, scripts, and film glosses seem too familiar with Scream movies that redesigned such a genre. Unfortunately, although the subject is caring, the viewer is presented with another college-filled movie that we really can't take care of, unsolved sub-blocks and hammy stages that have been reinvented by themselves, as the memorable Drew Barrymore opened in Scream several years ago . <br /> <br /> Steven Ruzowillzky does a fairly scripted script and direction, but does not make any other boundaries on a general topic. While we are presenting an entertaining film with some sensible performances, we are unfortunately feeling old: nothing is wrong with this film, but nothing is extraordinary. <br /> <br /> An entertaining movie and an interesting movie to see how foreigners' filmmakers have been affected by terrifying culture. 6 out of 10
