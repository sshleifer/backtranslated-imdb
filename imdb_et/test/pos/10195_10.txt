The combination of amazing special effects and Oscars makes Vindicator one of the most important sci-fi films of recent years. For some reason that is unknown to me, this pearl was found on the pallet, why some meaningless person thought that today's classic is dirty filthy. I've never been so scary when a man is in tin foil and accidental fires. Forget about Terminator, Robocop, Aliens, and other movies that will beat this masterpiece, the vindicator is an unstoppable force.
