This is a great movie as a movie - it gets from 8 out of 10. As a filmed piece of accurate history ... wants to be more loving, but that's 5 out of 10. And I think I'm really very charitable. <br /> <br /> What was he - a horse and a sword man who was the youngest "boy" in the United States Civil War army, and ended up dead with all his commandments in the greatest military victory of Indian tribes in North America? Guessed, soldiers, harsh, bloody hands, ambitious, smart, too smart, Indian enemies, Indian friend (?) And national hero. His death in 1876 was dealt with as a national tragedy and was dismissed as famous, equal to Washington, Lincoln, Jackson and Grant / Lee and Sherman / Jackson. Only a growing awareness of the mistakes made in his career - an overly ambitious hot stimulus that his reputation has diminished. But to this day, George Armstrong Custer remains the best memorable feature of our military in our history to lose his last battle (I can't really think of it - maybe General Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright, forced to stay with his men at Bataan Death March - but Wainwright lived in March and World War II) . <br /> <br /> Due to Western adventures and Little Big Horn, Custer has appeared in more films than much better generals. It is a pity that the details of the actual career were never treated as lovingly as Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn did in this film. But even in 1941 the legend was still strong. Olivia De Haviland depicted Libby Custer, who was recently highlighted in a film description on this subject until he lived in George until 1933, so his actual treatment of the story was only eight years later. Custer was considered to be our pathway, but as a brave knight, and as we approached the shadow of the Second World War, we had to keep myth and bury the truth. John Ford would have fully understood and approved it. <br /> <br /> So we see he was in a hot style, but he was patriotic. Although Custer was almost excluded from West Point (which was true), Custer was in 1861 and would have been very stupid to be funny this year. You see, most of the so-called military talents from West Point (Robert E. Lee) were southern and joined the Confederation. The Union needed every northern "man" they could find. <br /> <br /> Custer's Civil War career should be explored more closely - he was associated with Secretary General George B. McClellan's staff and distinguished himself in the peninsula campaign and other Eastern warfare. But he was a cavalry - and he rose to Grant and Sherman's friend Phil Sheridan under the watchful eyes of the last parts of the war. In particular, he served with a hyphen and a distinction in the Battle of Cedar Creek, which ended the Confederacy's threat in the Shenandoah Valley. It also personally hit Custer (his close West Point friend Stephen Ramseur joined the Confederation and rose to a position like Custer - deadly wounded, Custer sat down with Ramseur last night). <br /> Things worsened after the war. He wanted to make his brevet - Major Generalship permanent (it wasn't because it was a battlefield promotion). They only had a colonelite who gave him a finite army. He tried to play politics by making the mistake of President Andrew Johnson in his 1866 political journey and found most of the North hated Johnson's idiot. He admired the admiration of the Indians (he was obviously admired by them and the West in writing), but in 1868 he caused a real military massacre of Indian women and children who ended up with a judicial struggle. Later, during the 1870s, he supported India's allegations against a group of politicians (which went to War Secretary William Belknap) who bought and sold Indian trading positions for profit. It destroyed Belknap and left a black eye on the support. It made him with Grants and Sherman (who was former Belknap) and Sheridan barely saved his career. Then he was sent to the last Big Horn campaign. And immortality arrived. <br /> <br /> This career is worth a real movie, but would it be too critical? Should we keep a man of the 1850s to 1876s with the standards of 2007? Would we like this to happen to us for a hundred years? Certainly this may happen, but I'm not sure we would like it. <br /> <br /> Custer (1941 Style) fits with Flynn like a glove, where he gives the closest "dance" to any of his main films. His last film with Olivia De Haviland is highlighted by melancholy due to the character of the hero. Supporters such as Sidney Greenstreet, Stanley Ridges, Arthur Kennedy and Anthony Quinn did very well with friends, enemies, or even fraudulent sneake (Kennedy). As an entertaining myth that still makes it high, but as a complex military hero, it's not what it should be.
