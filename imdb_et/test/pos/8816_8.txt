Feisty Dianna Jackson (excellent former Playboy Playmate Jeanne Bell's triumphantly dirty performance) goes to Hong Kong to take her brother's murdered heroin ring. Dianna is assisted by friendly karate champion Joe (friendly Chiquito), resistance to the secret drug agent Elaine (lovely, buxom blonde babe Pat Anderson) and romanticizes the harsh, mercilessly ambitious Charlie (essay with the ultra arrogant supreme Stan Shaw), at the same time drawing his vengeance against the malicious drug captain Sid (effectively narrowed by Ken Metcalfe). Directed by Cirio H. Santiago, working from anything other than Dick Miller (!) Together written perfectly from the trash script, the crams lively and eventful 72-minute driving time, with lots of free scenes of free jokes and martial arts battles (Bell has clearly doubled to squat who bears a huge afro wig!). Certain sliding highlighting occurs when topless Bell strikes clusters in his hotel rooms. Felipe Sacdalan's raw, grainy, scratched cinematography, intense sluggish use of slow motion, funky-groovin score, ridiculously failed choreography, and a surprisingly frightening conclusion add tremendously to the overall blur of this delicious cheese flooring. hoot.
