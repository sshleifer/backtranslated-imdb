A rare exception to the rule that great literature makes disappointing films is that John Huston's beautiful goodbye to life and films is almost entirely in line with James Joyce's story of gentle meditation of love, death and time. Twelfth Night Party Events in Middle Class Dublin in 1910. It is obviously unlikely that the film will tell the story of its silent, obviously insignificant thoughts, instead of forcing the usual cinematic shape point and dramatic incidents. Only once is the wrong note when the old Miss Julia (a trained singer and music teacher whose voice should be split by age not broken) sings so badly that the viewer saw it in the cinema. Luckily, the melancholy mood will be restored quietly and gently for a long time when it turns out that the couple Gabriel and Gretta Conroy are in the hotel bedroom, as the snow begins to fall. I think this is a sad story, but what makes you feel better, not blue. Particularly recommended as a date film - for people who love those who are not afraid of the sweetness and sadness of life.
