America's next top model is a great reality in every sense. She has a great hostess, big guests, big production and some of the best modeling environment professionals who are helping something they haven't achieved yet: present a real American next model. Of course, this is not easy to do, so the US and the world would already have a total of 10 top models that are fighting together. <br /> <br /> But it is obvious that its purpose is not to present America's next top model, but yes, America's next pop model. The exhibition brings together a number of models that have no experience with different personalities and big personal, professional and financial problems, giving them the opportunity to dream about life changing or making their life valuable. It is obvious that the Tyra Banks use all that is in his favor, he gives a dream, but in return he gets the audience and popularity. Anyway, he deserves it because he is intelligent and when I say it is the pioneer of such an exhibition. Tyra is also a great observer and knows how to give in-depth opinions that differ from other models and foreign language versions of NEXT TOP MODEL. For example, in Brazil, Fernanda Motta is her hostess and "once and for all" - the top model. He doesn't even have 1/10 of Tyra's professional skills that keeps Tyra Banks up. Tyra has professional and personal knowledge of what he says, and he is a great mentor because he not only criticizes, but refers to a mistake and teaches wisdom in wisdom. <br /> <br /> The exhibition does not suffer from major problems, it does and fills what it allows during cycles. The models chosen to work at the show are not the best unknown models in the whole country, because Tyra Banks contributes to the difference and is right because he (and also a good part of the audience) believes it is time to model some of the straightforward parameters. During the cycles, he and his team make fair discussions where the weaker ones go away and the promising ones have new opportunities to prove their capability, but they have to do it quickly, otherwise they will lose it. <br /> <br /> Another very interesting thing is that Tyra also knows who should win or not to win, even if she is against people's opinion. He knows that everyone who wins is famous, but has very little chance of being a truly globally recognized top model. Similarly, he knows that sometimes the second place is more valuable than the first, because the first place wins the title, but the other does not get the title. He hardly makes mistakes when he decides on the future of any model. <br /> <br /> After 9 cycles, showing that some old ideas are a bit tired, it's time for Tyra to change some things and lines, because it's boring and compared to the first cycles that we see she gets bored, so he must do it if he wants the show to live a little longer. <br /> <br /> In any case, the play shows the fashion and the modeling world, but it is also fun for those outside. It gives a chance to some girls and also to the market and also gives great tips for those who share the same dream.
