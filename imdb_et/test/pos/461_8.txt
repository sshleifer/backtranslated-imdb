A very literate, intelligent drama about a group of international migrants in 1956 in Hungary, invaded the Russian Communist regime. Kerr and Robards are lovers, he is a British baroness, he is a Hungarian freedom fighter who is trying to do his bit for his country. Other New York City Stars from Anne Jackson & E G Marshall play an American couple traveling with their two young sons, including Ronny Howard's debut. Jackson's character is extremely pregnant and does not want to give birth soon in a communist country; in the third window of this film, he gives a commendable statement that speaks today of the natural style of Redgrave, Fonda and Streep. The management of the Soviet wolf package is Yul Brynner, who is a great commandant and his sexiest one, because he played "King and Me" against Kerri. He is average and disgusting and terribly contrary to his attraction to the cute, patriotic and heroic Kerr. It is the great transition films of the last parts of the golden era of American films. Don't miss it.
