This Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle's comedy is best remembered by the young Buster Keaton, who is fresh by subtracting his family from Vaudeville, his film debut. Buster gets a pretty significant part of this movie and it's pretty funny. "The Butcher Boy" is a lot of laughs and is an example of a clean old-fashioned slapstick, although it seems to be a short timing of two-reel comedies when filmmakers still represent a single roll in the segment. courses. <br /> <br /> The first part of the movie is in a general store, where the title of the beef chop is Arbuckle. It is an excuse to extract many opportunities for the quick physical humor offered by the general store, and indeed Arbuckle shows itself as a 300-pound acrobat, showing sophistication, skill and grace in his performance of what might have been an unnoticeable routine. Raise them to different levels. In the running gag, he is sliding into a big butcher so that it spins in exactly the right position, which is a stick to the cutting board, and I'm still stunned that Arbuckle really looks like this every time. There is also a really nice gag that sees him on his scale and confused about why his meat pieces weigh so much. <br /> <br /> Buster Keaton is a boy who starts buying some molasses and gently completes the following floors routine. In addition to the odd and almost undisturbed half-smile, his idiosynthetic attitude and body language make him immediately recognizable when we know Buster. He even has his own branded laminated hat - here it was first destroyed when it was filled with molasses. <br /> <br /> The other side of the movie moves more to a situation-based comedy and Arbuckle and his rival Al St. John dresses to get into Fatty's girlfriend. Many humor comes from the general surreal and mysterious ridicule of these two bizarre companions who suffer and try to "be girls". The buster is also in this segment, but mostly it stays there randomly, helping John. <br /> <br /> "Butcher Boy" quitting is a bit empty, but in its entirety and beyond the historical curiosity of interest, it's a well-made comedy that gets just the joke that laughs.
