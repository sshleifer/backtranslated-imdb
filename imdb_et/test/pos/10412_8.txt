I think it's great how Chiller took this series and show it to this generation. Making films has come so far, especially for special effects, and for a person to be able to see archived evidence that they never knew they existed, they can certainly see the current development. MONSTERS is neither flat nor spectacular, but it's fun. It takes creativity to the lines that they came with, and each generation seems to be in their horror. This series was not as frightening as Friday, 13, or adult-oriented, like Freddy's nightmares. It was something the whole family could look at and still laugh and fear. I'm happy that the Chiller Channel shows it in its lineup, I'm almost caught up in the episodes I was getting up to.
