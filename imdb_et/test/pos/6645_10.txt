First of all, the story is not as simple as many previous reviewers emphasize, it is actually a very complicated story, unlike Bergman's other films, which are more of a characteristic study. There are two main characters in Skamma, but if we are thrown out of the middle of the war, we have no idea who is fighting and why everything is open for any resolution. It creates tremendous tension and makes every event meaningful. As the story emerges, we introduce numerous signs that have become human symbols, both dark and bright. We have an example of innocent bystanders trying to get absurd during a war, a cynical doctor who smiles his patients and gives the whole film the only bitter humor, the perverted opportunists who try to make a cruel event (Bjornstrand's character), innocent dead children, call numbers that almost became boats to animals, etc. All of them are seen in the eyes of Jani (von Sydow) and Eva (Ulmann), their characters are then more restrained in other Begrman films (En Passion), and precisely because there is an important story of how external events can radically change human nature. <br /> <br /> Bergman made this film two years after Persona, where the main conclusion expressed by the only word expressed by Liv Ulman's character is INGENTING, something. That is: the meaning of art and the meaning of life, the latter is more than a game that involves all plays. What about war? And especially those who destroy the XX century. Personality is the only real emotion that Ulmanni carries when he sees the victim of the Vietnam War as a human factor. In Skammen, the idea of ​​a complex analysis of the dehumanizing nature of war is expanded. In an area without the name of an unnamed country (we assume it is Sweeden), two factions speaking the same language are fighting against the absurd war. Jan and Eva are two dreams who have been caught in the middle, but their dreams are woven in the opposite direction. Jan is an idealist who is unable to respond properly to the world and the will of his wife. Finally, he becomes a radically different person who is able to motivate murder, strongly deliberate, ruthless (observe the boat suicide closely. The simplicity of the law is harassing). On the other hand, Eva loses contact with reality, and finally she is completely full of her unfulfilled dream. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, the whole movie is very effective in transmitting your message. Bergman places the viewer next to the character by placing the camera with the actors in the car or behind the extreme surroundings. Nykvist manages the camera's extraordinary controls, has some masterful "handheld" effects, very good that everything seems to be "real". The shots, when the symbols are captured by the army, are remarkably documentary. The scenario is minimalistic, but the story is quite complicated on this issue. In fact, the whole film is paradoxical, it has an intensity in an object that is in sharp contrast with the lack of cold and emotional involvement with which it is directed and filmed. Nothing here is melodramatic, no compassion, no hope, no obvious redemption. But like Liv Ulmann's dream at the end, it's all so beautiful that it can't help but surprise it ... It wasn't so terrible because it was so beautiful!
