This is the best comedy period. It's so underestimated! Smart funny humor, great casting! Jerry Stiller is a jewel of the exhibition, he is so incredibly funny and peculiar, just a comic genius! Doug and Carrie have great chemistry! So I don't see what the hype is saying when it comes to anyone who loves Raymond, because it is both overpriced and flat jokes mostly forced humor and just not a witty show, I don't remember more than 1 episode laughing. The Queen of the Queen is a rare comedy with all the right ingredients that will give you a serious stomach laugh, usually caused by Arthur Spooner, I think this comedy will deserve after this time, not the fool Raymond & CO.
