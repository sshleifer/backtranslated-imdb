This is an underrated little thriller with a lot of excitement, cool story, Sandra Bullock is terrible! All the characters are big and I was surprised how unpredictable it was because there were only a few predictable moments, and Sandra Bullock is just amazing at that! Jeremy Northam played a fantastic villain, and I know what this Bullock character is, because I'm the same type of person (I hardly ever go out), plus it's pretty well done and mostly written. I think it should be higher than 5.5 and Denis Miller was surprisingly better than his small role. The scene in which Northam terrorizes Bullock with his boat was quite tense and was one of my favorite moments, and I also liked the carnival chase, and I liked the end too, because it was pretty well done, even though I thought Northam would hit too fast. There are also many other good chasing scenes, it is also sometimes smart too plus there are also quite a few shocking moments, it is a strong underrated little thriller with a lot of cool story, Sandra Bullock is terrible, I recommend it! The direction is great! Irwin Winkler does great! work here with great camera work, adding a good atmosphere, good angles and keeping the movie at a very fast pace. Action is awesome! Sandra Bullock is amazing as always and is amazing here, she is extremely pleasant, harsh like nails, which are quite vulnerable, and I had the opportunity to feel her, because as I said I am like Angela, I hardly go, really enjoyed his work in this movie! (Bullock Rules !!!!!!!). Jeremy Northam is great as a villain, he was a lame, unpredictable and very dangerous, he was great. Dennis Miller is surprisingly OK and is not annoying in his small role and managed to bring some comics. The rest is good. In general, I highly recommend it! *** 1/2 out of five
