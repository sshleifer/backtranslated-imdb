It is an action packed film that makes me feel very calm and relaxed. The film (despite this summary) shows that it is still possible to control extreme coefficients. <br /> <br /> This movie is very refreshing and probably banned at any time. Get a copy of it before the idea of ​​the police burns every copy you find. They don't want you to have hope for the future or think you have the opportunity. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, if political correctness doesn't push it, it would be a great movie to release on DVD. Such release may include interviews with the writer and the director and related sweets. I'm sure it would sell some copies and I'd be one of the first to buy it. <br /> <br /> Mincka
