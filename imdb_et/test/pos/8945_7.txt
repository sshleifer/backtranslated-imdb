A humorous trip to the usual gloomy funeral activity. It's easy to see and even steals Blethyn & Molina from the old Fred & Ginger movie. Walken is upright as Molina's enthusiastic competitor in the business sector, trying to bring the old-style city to the old style. We see a couple of very funny examples of "new style". The plot thickens with Pugh, who has a thing with Watts, and he says they're making Blethyn. Meanwhile, Molina has restarted her long-suffering romantic feeling for Blethyn and persuades her to fake her death so they can get to the southern sea and dance their days together. In a "fake" funeral, Blethyn learns about the infidelity of his spouses and gives him revenge. See it to see what funeral is likely to be - celebrating life!
