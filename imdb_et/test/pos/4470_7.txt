This is another movie where cinema is the best suggestion to do it. It would be good if the film was a travel document, but a dramatic cinematic exercise that is not good enough. The subject of inter-species respect and cooperation is disgracefully linked to the banned world of inter-species love, but its approach is stereotypical, suggesting that the behavioral motives of both species are incomprehensible. As with many movies, you always wonder what could have been achieved by a more innovative driver and a more creative scriptwriter. Unfortunately, we probably never know.
