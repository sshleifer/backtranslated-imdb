Let me start by saying that Tourist Trap is a better movie than 99.9% of the horror films that have come out of Hollywood lately. If you don't believe me, see Darkness Falls or Need. And it's definitely better than any of these crappies directly for video releases like Stab, Bleed, The Pool, and so on. One of the biggest problems with the Tourist Trap is that it has never been found. When the film was opened in 1979, PG rating was given to MPAA. Anyone who knows horror films knows that the horror movie PG is usually a kiss of movie death. (Director David Schmoeller talks about this problem on the DVD commentary.) There are exceptions, however, such as Polterge, who had also been rated PG. However, there are great differences between the Tourist and the Poltergeist. Tourist Trap was not a big budget Hollywood movie like Poltergeist and it wasn't brought by Steven Spielberg. That alone was enough to ensure Poltergeist's success. (For those who have seen the trappers, you can scratch your head so that MPAA rated this movie for PG. The "Burst" scene should be enough for the film to rip and R-rating how the tube on the back would be I have to admit that when I was young, I looked at a copy of Poltergeist on the shelf of a video store, I started to pick it up, I saw it was rated PG and put it on the shelf in favor of a movie called R. Years later I finally saw Poltergeist and realized what a big movie was for renting a PG horror movie. Ever since, I never understand a movie based on that rating. This is probably what happened to Tourist Trap. People, like myself with Poltergeist, will probably forget it for a film called R. It would probably be a teenager to whom most of these films are directed. On Friday the 13th place was not a masterpiece, but made a very good ticket office because it was rated by R and during the Paramount advertisement. He found his audience and made enough money to knit several sequences. If you look at it, the tourist Trap is as good as the 13th of Friday. The same thing could have happened to a tourist trap. We could have seen 2, 3, 4 and so on tourist traps. As for the film, Tourist Trap is an entertaining horror film made on extremely small budgets, but it has worked well, well managed and well done on many levels. Chuck Connors is a rebellion like Mr Slausen and gives the film the best result. Special credit must be given to the composer Pino Donaggio, whose score for this film is really what distinguishes it from others and gives it its scary. The music of the scenes associated with mannequins is particularly horrible. Donaggio worked on the horror film Carrie and many other movie spots after a trap of tourists. He has done an exceptionally good job in the film and continues to score films to this day. The weakness of Tourist Trap is that Davey's powers have never been explained. Maybe it should be. He has them just and we should accept it to make the film work. We accept this for some point, but then there are incidents such as Davey makes the phone ring when it is in the basement of the house. In this case, is Davey limited by his powers? Can he call in Houston, Detroit, Los Angeles? What is his choice? These are things that people who don't care about this movie would probably point to errors. Others would accept this as a mistake. I accept it. The questions posed by this movie are not enough to hate me. It's a horror movie. We should not be obliged to read this too much. Many people have called it a "killer dummy" movie. I assure you that no mannequin kills anyone in this movie. The dummies are controlled by Davey's power, who uses them as a weapon. This is the general misconception of this movie. Some people have problems with dummies and some have even said they are just stupid. I think they will add the overall peace of the movie. In general, the tourist is a fun rental. *** (5hrs)
