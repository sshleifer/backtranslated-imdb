Eisenstien "Potempkin" (Bronenosets Potyomkin) is one of the best films ever made, and perhaps the best of a quiet era. Eisenstien was a pioneer of film format and the use of editing editing has influenced films to date. The mass material of the Odessa steps is as powerful today as what was first seen over 70 years ago. DON'T give the opportunity to see this movie!
