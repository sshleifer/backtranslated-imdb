This movie is eery, but an interesting movie. I will tell you why this review will be useful later. <br /> <br /> The film is interesting because it was the first movie ever to contain sound. No, it may not be a one-hour and forty-two-minute movie, it may not contain great scenes, but it's still a great movie. It created the whole movie, if you want, sound films. It may be a bit eery to look at, knowing that everything in this movie is now dead, I hear a man's voice at first, who no longer sees Earth and that sound is cracked and broken. > <br /> I recommend this video to everyone. It created movies as we know it today!
