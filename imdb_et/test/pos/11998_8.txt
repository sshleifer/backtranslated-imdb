This is undoubtedly one of my favorite Columbo episodes. Operation is very well done, music is very memorable, the script is brilliant and the direction is fabulous. <br /> <br /> Peter Columbis, who works great in every Columbo episode, is doing very well in this episode. <br /> <br /> Also great performances by Stephen Caffrey, Gary Hershberger, Alan Fudge and Robert Culp. <br /> <br /> The end is absolutely brilliant and I love how Columbo describes it. > <br /> This is a Columbo film that NOT, goes wrong.
