I was very interested in watching this movie for one. <br /> <br /> Although I knew this was another type of movie in Nerds' revenge, I was still impressed. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of truth to this fact of learning and I firmly believe that it should be allowed in a "new training style". <br /> <br /> Traditional teaching methods do not always teach students what they need to know or know or want to know. <br /> <br /> This way of teaching should be searched through real academic courses. <br /> <br /> Although there were still too many festive scenes, it probably had to be thrown there - after Hollywood's college comedy ... ... although we all know that life isn't in any way that way. <br /> <br /> Unbelievable, still funny and killer touch. <br /> <br /> Finish Awesome. The whole story is important and very surprising. <br /> <br /> Without the final scene, the film would have been half good. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie and it didn't have to have too much swearing or nudity or funny jokes to make it good. <br /> <br /> A great team and cast, story, and even the overall mandatory "Hampton frat members" were well written. <br / / <br /> American Pie 1, 2 3, and American Wedding, or any clones it does, do not measure it by 1/3. <br /> <br /> Better than most of the first year college comedies without foolish jokes to bring down someone to throw. <br /> <br /> I liked it though it was easy ... it was interesting and even heart ... my only regret for watching this movie is that it was no longer.
