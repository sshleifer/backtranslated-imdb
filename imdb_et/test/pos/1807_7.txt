There were many stupid teenagers who received 80's sex films and many slasher-cinemas, but there were only a handful of ideas that made you laugh and stick to time; it was one of them. Cage is Hillarious, so is Forman who has lost his bio unfortuatley from Hollywood luminosity. I would like to see it appear on a DVD in a special version with comments from Cage and Forman. I want to think, I know. Never want to plan a real 80's movie weekend, rent it, Sure Thing and 16 candles and Breakfast Club. This will bring you back to "Totally Rad", which seemed much easier at that time. Reminder for Studio: Time to Release a DVD!
