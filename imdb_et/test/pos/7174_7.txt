On June 22, 1941, the Polish city of Przemysl is divided between German and Russian. When Germany penetrates the city, the Nazis send a Jewish ghetto. The young Catholic Fusia Podgorska (Kellie Martin), a young sister, presents and hides a lot of Jews in the attic of her house for two to half years until the end of the war. "Hidden Silence" is another good story of human compassion in World War II. This film looks like "rescuers: stories of courage" and is based on a real story. Unfortunately, actor Kellie Martin has a strong and strong leadership role, but he is very weak for this role. In many dramatic situations, his expression is not convincing. I've noticed that many IMDb users liked his activities, but I'm not sure if they like his wonderful character or his performance. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ocultos no Medo" ("Hidden Fear")
