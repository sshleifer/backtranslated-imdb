Although the story is light, the film flows so beautifully and visually so calmly and poetically that it can carry almost the entire film. <br /> <br /> The film is made up of four intertwined tides associated with a different aspect of attractiveness between a man and / or a woman and how it is often essential. Their real desire seems to always be something they can't hold, it flows out like a handful of sand. <br /> <br /> I thought the most interesting story was the last one that could no longer be achieved, the more the man wants him. It is equal to his deep love for God who is infinitely inaccessible, but never closer to his heart. <br /> <br /> Very good movie. 7/10
