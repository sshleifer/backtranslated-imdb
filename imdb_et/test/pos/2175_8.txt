Recently I read this story to see how the two fit, and if you can believe it, this film will improve Balzac. I think the story is moved around the idea that Colonel Chabert is a person who has suffered a lot, but he comes home, not as a hero, but descended. <br /> <br /> As anyone mentioned I was initially confused when Chabert was similar to Martin Guerre's return. No. Balzac is firmly convinced that Chabert is the real thing. However, it is interesting whether he is not, but whether his wife and society treats him. <br /> <br /> I think this is a timeless story of men who fight for their fight for the country and when they get home they are left behind. Chabert is a tragic figure, the most amazing of which is the amazing Gerard Depardieu. I don't care that he's been in 1 million movies, he's exciting. <br /> <br /> Fanny Ardant has a terrible character. If she is a prostitute, Rose has used her feminine words to climb the social ladders. Is his emotions true for Compte Ferraud? I think they are, and maybe a couple of, their social status at this time, and you will begin to feel empathy. <br /> <br /> Fabrice Lucini runs slowly in his heart. He's extraordinary here as Derville. <br /> <br /> I think you can't regret if you get the pearl of this movie. French cinema at its best.
