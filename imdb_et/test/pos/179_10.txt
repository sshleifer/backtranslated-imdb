Goldrush: Real Life Alaska Adventure is a great movie film for all ages. At the heart of the film is "Fizzy" (Alyssa Milano) who wants to travel gold in Alaska. The only person hiring him is Pierce Thomas Madison (Bruce Campbell). Next to him is the adventure he never forgets. This movie was great. It's # 1 (especially by Bruce Campbell and Alyssa Milan) and I also learned about Goldrush. I would recommend without hesitation to this TV show to everyone. It is also based on a real story. <br /> <br /> 10/10
