It's one of my favorite James bonds in games because: missions are fun to play because they have a lot of these activities, they can be heavy, making them fun when the weapons you use are good. How James Bond in this James Bond game is beautiful, you see him in what's cool, and all the other characters in this game look like those who played in the movie. It's not that you can't play this game when I loved it. Also this game follows the movie pretty much maybe a couple of added things, but it follows the movie pretty much. Also, this James Bond game is a pretty good graphics for Nintendo 64 and bad players didn't play in this game, but took care of as long as the game was fun to play. <br /> <br /> Overall Score ** ****** at the End **********
