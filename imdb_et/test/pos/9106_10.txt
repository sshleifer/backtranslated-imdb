This is the only thing I can see since 2006 and now say it's shaken. It hardens hard, but it also shook the delicious. Mr MEATLOAF added a nice little touch to this film's plate before the open games even rolled. Now that tells you something was filmed before he started! Now I don't want to give much or be a "spoiler", but this movie ROCKED! When you've heard a new album and thought to yourself, "it seems a bit inadequate for Tenacious material, it's like I'm just playing badminton with Satan, what gives?" Then the film will appreciate the music and admire this steamy satanic masterpiece. For those who want it better, they don't know what they want, because it wouldn't be better D. This movie is a D period. So if you dare to the local spectacle theater if you want your socks to shake.
