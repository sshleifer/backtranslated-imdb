Barney is about "IMAGINATION" that you don't have if my preschooler never wanted to show that they were showing, as they show, then I would be worried. What is 2 or 3 years old really gets all that is about color and singing. For those who say that everything they do in Barney, eat junk food and recommend Sesame Street better than a "cookie monster", which is all he eats, but I haven't seen anyone commenting on it. I agree that sesame is a better education, but barney is like an exhibition for fun is not too serious if you do not like your child watching television and worrying about what you do not believe, then you shouldn't "t come in front of the TV first confirm, because all this is fake, all are fake makers who are fake, why don't you take your fake brains and use it and think if you have a problem with fake TV kids, turn it off and play with them and teach them what you want them not to learn from BIG BIRD or Bert & Ernie or barney who had seen all of them before and seen a fine.
