College teacher Larry Donner (Billy Cristal) is a blocked writer because his ex-wife Margareth (Kate Mulgrew) destroyed her by stealing her novel that became the best seller. She does not hide her hate for Margareth, disturbing her friend Beth Ryan (Kim Greist), a teacher of the same college anthropologists. While giving creative writing classes, she is led by student Owen (Danny DeVito) who wants to know her opinion about her crime. Larry says he doesn't like him and explains that in every mystery the murderer should remove the motive and create an alibi, otherwise he would catch. In addition, Larry Owen suggests watching Hitchcock movies to understand the structure of the temporary story. Owen, who wants to kill her attacking mother (Anne Ramsey), looks at "Strangers is a Train" and misunderstands Larry's advice, believing that her teacher wants to eliminate murders to eliminate the motive. Owen travels to Hawaii and Margareth falls on the ship at sea disappearing and is considered dead. However, Larry is not an alibi and he becomes the main suspect, while the failed Owen pushes him to kill his mother as part of his expected deal. <br /> <br /> "Mommi Throw The Train" is one of the 80's more comedy comedies and a great honor for Alfred Hitchcock. The direct reference is "to the stranger on the train", but the jokes are "Vertigo" (with a rotating camera), "Family Plot" (without car breaks) and other movies. The lines are great and there is an interesting point when Larry says that every big romance or puzzle has a train. Anne Ramsey is an amazing nasty and abusive dominant mother and the viewer feels sad and understands Owen's madness. Kim Greist is very beautiful and Kate Mulgrew is the perfect female. Billy Cristal fills the obsession with many stupid and unreasonable attitudes but needs a plot. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Jogue a Mam√£e do Trem" ("Throw Mother's Train")
