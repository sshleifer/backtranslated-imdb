Letter to the boys. I tried boys, I really tried! I tried not to watch this movie. I left the room when it was or jumped to the computer when the woman looked at it. This is her second favorite film, where the godfather is the first (which I love). <br /> <br /> I stopped capturing the small bits of this movie and eventually maybe a year later I sat with him. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I loved this movie. Dalton plays great Rhetti and has her own hair flowing. Whalley plays with delightful Scarlett. Come with fire and sulfur and NOT going to stop him. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is when he is abroad (in Ireland?) and the government plans to demolish the peasant's house because they are behind the rent. Scarlett gets all crazy and pays all the debt, making a big name around this small town. <br /> <br /> Everything I say you want to try this movie ... especially if you're a fan of Gone with the Wind. Getting used to new entrants takes a little while, but I think you'll find them refreshing.
