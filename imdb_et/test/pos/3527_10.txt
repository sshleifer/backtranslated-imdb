This completely forgotten slasher flick is one of the best horror movies ever made. Very dark from time to time reminds me of a little known thriller "Deliverance". Director Jeff Lieberman creates a terrible atmosphere of fear and despair.All the participants are decent and the climax is really exciting and memorable.So if you are looking for something horrible, try to find this little treasure. My personal rating: 10 out of 10. It's even colder than Halloween.
