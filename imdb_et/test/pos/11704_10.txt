<br /> <br /> Crackerjack, starring Mick Malloy & Judith Lucy - both part of the Late Show comedy festival of the early 90's, Bill Hunter, Australian movie icon and John Clarke, who still watch Australian TV regularly with Brian Dawe. <br /> <br /> Crackerjack, in no avail, has been around in the early 1930s (Jack Simpson, played by Mick Malloy), who pays his annual memebers' local bowl at the club to get some parking spaces for which he uses himself and rents other cheap urban environments. <br /> <br /> The club falls in difficult times and pulls all the resources and memorials it gets, Jack gets a phone call telling him that he can take the sinks to the next Saturday or lose his membership (and hence his car park). Space) <br /> <br /> I don't break the rest, but the movie is funny, with a light heart and contains all the best aussie movies. <br /> <br /> If you are not Australian, some jokes and humor will doubt you if you are an Aussie - do yourself a favor and sit for yourself at Crackerjack. It is now available on DVD, I already have my copy! <br /> <br /> 10/10 .. Awesome flick! <br /> <br />
