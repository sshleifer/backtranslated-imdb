Cumming is wrongly accused of sabotage and goes to the sheep, looking for a real culprit. The familiar Hitchcock theme of a man accused of crimes is played nicely at this fun price, with elements of "Thirty-nine Steps" and "Northern Fetus", though not as good as either classic. There are some impressive kits, including the Statue of Liberty. The plot is unlikely and convincing and after a terrible start it seems to evaporate. Cummings are pleasant if it's somewhat rigid. Lane is a blonde director of later films, but not cool. Supporting roles are generally well played.
