I looked at this episode many times because I didn't get how Prue died. It happened. Prue, Piper and Phoebe are trying to save their innocent doctor because Shax wants to kill her. Phoebe goes up to see the book of shadows, while Prue and Piper protect their innocents. Shax appears when Phoebe is still up, so Shax throws energy to the doctor, but Prue pushes him out of the way and Prue hits his chest and breaks against the wall, the same with Piper. So Phoebe comes down and says a spell because it was just Phoebe who said it and not three Shaxi forces could only be wounded. Phoebes calls Leo to heal Piper and Prue. So Leo welcomes them. Phoebe went to the underworld to find Cole, meanwhile Prue and Piper were looking for Shax on the streets. Piper and Prue see Shax and Piper use their power to break Shax while the new reporter gets it all on tape. So, for all three of these three powerful sisters, Phoebe knows nothing, because he's still in the underworld. The entire Halliwell house has reposers and people. Then the maniac comes into the house and says, "Can I be part of your cone?" and Prue says, "No, it's our house out of here!" and Prue uses her powers to throw her out. When the maniac comes out of the house crying, saying, "There's the average witches." Maniac gets so mad that he's trying to get Piper out of his stomach. Prue goes to the hospital and trays to go to the hospital, but people won't let her go, so Prue will use her powers to get people out of people, so people want to kill her more. They got to the hospital, but Piper didn't. Meanwhile, Phoebe is in the underworld. Phoebe discovers that they have been in contact so Phoebe asks Cole to ask the source if he can turn the time. The source says he will return only when Phoebe promises to stay in the underworld, so Cole told Phoebe what the source told him. Phoebe says, "What is he doing, I think I would do such a deal?" and then Cole says, "So you can save one of your sisters." Leo goes to the hospital to find out that Piper is actually dead, that he tells Phoebe that this is true. Then Phoebe agrees to stay only when Cole goes back to warn Piper and Prue about Piper's exposure and death. Back to the hospital SWAT has come to Prue, but the second before they take their time, they turn back when they were with the doctor at the mansion, but this time Phoebe was not about to call Leo to heal Prue and Piper, so doctor also throw the wall. The doctor died and also Prue. But that's what I didn't get when Piper resisted the wall, just how Prue died? Why didn't they show Leo healing Piper and Leo trying to heal Prue? If you know the answer, send me an email at angelpuss924@yahoo.com PS. I miss Prue, but I also like Paige and I'm glad the show continued
