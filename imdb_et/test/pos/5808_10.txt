It's a remarkable production! I've seen the play live in Chicago twice and my only problem with the production was that I only had the chance to perceive what was happening. The stage consisted of three giant roofs and platforms, and if the action moved from one stage to the next, you will ever lose what is happening, no matter where you are. As always, this is a thought-provoking sensory overload that has been skillfully captured by a high definition camera! The film has been masterfully edited, which I think was one of the best ever concert DVDs! I hope and want them to release this HD-DVD on Blu-Ray so we can live this extravagant again and again.
