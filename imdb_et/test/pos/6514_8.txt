I love this movie, one of my all-time favorites. Ann Blythe like Sally O'Moyne is sweet and carefree. He believes that praying to Saint Anne solves all the concerns of him and his friends. The sublime of dirty bad people to get the father's property is funny and wise. His brothers are the brothers who are the girls. Also look for "aunt Bee" as your mother, a strong Irish woman who doesn't leave her house, she brought her family in. They don't do them any longer, that's for sure.
