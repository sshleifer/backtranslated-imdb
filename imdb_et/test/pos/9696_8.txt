I've always been a Jackass fan, Viva La Bam and Wildboyz. And if you're a fan of something, your expectations are great, no matter what your "heroes" are. And if there is one thing I've learned a lot to expect from people you just love to watch and listen to, it's never expected to be much, because 99 times 100 times, you'll be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Although, when I heard Jackass 2 coming, I thought, "Don't even push my expectations for this movie," and as a result, I sat today, ready to laugh, but finally ready say, "Well, it was OK, but I'm a little disappointed". How wrong I was! All Jackass team members bring this movie first, showing you one crazy stunt game, making the whole world visible that there's nothing they don't do to try to harm you - and that we love! I cried my eyes smiling from the first minute to the last second place in the movie, sometimes I screamed laughing, couldn't manage myself! Stunt after stunt, prank after prank, and fun comments on the flow - it just can't get any better than this! Amazing from start to finish, ensuring you laugh your ass away. I have two more things to say; VIEW YOU AND PLEASE GIVE YOU TO GET Jackass 3 - they have a lot to offer!
