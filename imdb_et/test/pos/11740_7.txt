After many years of seeing this beautiful story of love, I wondered how half a century ago I would react to a film that made so many girls cry and sigh while I was just a male youth trying to understand women's behavior in a small town in Brazil. <br /> <br /> This time, what attracted the attention of the film was something very different, namely the advice that doctor dr. Han Suyin (Jennifer Jones) makes it clear to journalist Mark Elliott (William Holden) that his special ethical status is Eurasia. In fact, he constantly puts the emphasis on this question in his relationship, repeating that he is willing to accept his love and carry it "randomly", provided that he does not do it in his Chinese side. . It seems to the spectator that Suyin is eager to make a very subtle reconciliation between these two unstable and contradictory aspects, as they will immediately start thinking about conflict in their minimal failures. <br /> <br /> So are Suin's attitudes always poor for Elliot? a confident, brave and extremely practical man? anxious and puzzled, not knowing how important it is to give his words. For him, whose love for him is simple and simple, the situation is quite clear: when we love one another, let's make a couple and start living together right away. "Not so fast", what he seems verbally and non-verbally to answer him all the time. <br /> <br /> In fact, Suiny's Chinese part does not allow him such pragmatism. And if he continues and strengthens this much-directed balance between the two worlds by himself, he often gives him a signal that the very distinctive feature of Chinese culture is deeply rooted in his mind, namely the continuous "raids". invisible beings from the spiritual or non-physical world. Suyin always warns Elliot of how dangerous life is, because of no objective and specific threat (as would the survival of English colonialism or the highlighting of Japanese invasion), but because of the terrible and damaging threat of gods and other mystical and mythical beings to the poor, frightening and vulnerable. people. <br /> <br /> In fact, it seems that a whole host of Chinese deities are constantly on the clock to make people's lives completely unhappy. That is why mothers must dress their precious male children in the clothes of the girls so that they will not be lost by the envious gods; everyone should always be ready for loud noise to send out clouds to avoid covering them with the moon; peasants are advised to shout out loud "Rice is bad! Rice is bad!" to protect your cultures from the theft of deities; At the funeral, it is recommended that the dead family be isolated from other people with curtains, so that the gods do not take advantage of their sorrow and uncertainty. <br /> <br /> In other words, Suyin introduces us to a culture where supernatural reality is supernatural, as the rather disturbing pantheon of malignant and sadistic gods is always at the expense of negative interference that affects the most banal acts of one's daily life. <br /> <br /> Since the story will be in Hong Kong in 1949, it should be clear that China was indeed almost half the feudal society at that time, while the country from which Elliott originated was not yet dominated by the fierce capitalism that the United States by the first oil industry shock launched in 1973, took over the world. So, at least in one aspect, both sides of the Suinian Eurasian personality were much more innocent than they are today. <br /> <br /> Since then, much history has emerged. As far as China is concerned, the main fact is that, after several stages of the Communist regime, the country has finally reached the state of a very aggressive economy over the past two decades, much better described as state capitalism. And what happened to that old spirituality, which in 1949 in Hong Kong so much amazed Suyin and with which he used so much enthusiastic Elliot, under the tree on the hill behind the hospital? It's gone, totally gone! In short, when this story happened today, Elliott does not consider it necessary to go to China to make a proposal to Suyin in the presence of a third uncle and his entire family. In fact, both men would be fairly close to each other because of their enormous pragmatism and business as usual.
