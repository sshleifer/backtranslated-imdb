Anyone who has ever thought about making a movie without a budget should see this documentary. The determination of everyone in this project was very touching for me and should connect with those who have ever participated in any exhibition, be it film, music or writing. I think filmmakers could have done a better job by foreseeing the events that led to this film as a documentary, maybe a narrator; other than that the film comes out as a real example of how the show is not a "show", but rather a "business". <br /> <br /> I hope the actual planned project, "Repo Male II", will see the light of day. I think the filmmakers worked on the little they had to do, and all they had to do to complete it.
