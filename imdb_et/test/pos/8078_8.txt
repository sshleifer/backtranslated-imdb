Being a fan of Bills, I found out originally that it was annoying that they made the bill of bills and the loss of four superbowls. But when I started watching, I felt really connected. It was really nice to see the "bills" win the superbowl, and I have to say that for the TV movie it was very well done. Gil Bellows as QB and Jon Voight as an old school coach did a great job. 8 out of 10
