Unlike many who have posted here, I am not a film literate. I stumbled over this movie randomly (surfing the channel) and couldn't surf. This is a truly incredible film that deserves all the critics of this site and those who have received it. Participants are terrible. Tatiana is beautiful and innocent. His groom, Boris, is sweet and patriotic. The annoyance and sadness of Boris's father cannot be felt when he earns his son with such foolishness as volunteering during the Great War, and fails. <br /> <br /> Others have made the movie so well, so I just mention a couple of scenes that changed me the most. When Boris's brother explains to his family that he has trusted his brother and "has to marry" Tatiana, Tatyana shows her a twisted mouth about her betrayal for her betrayal (although her role in infidelity could have been rape). You are afraid that the rest of the movie may repeat it incorrectly, just by visiting Tatiana and brother's destruction or worse, show that Tatiana is being destroyed due to immoral descent into cigarette smoking. Because it's not "French existential cinema", it won't happen. Luckily! The second scene that tears in your heart is when the unnamed "musician" soldier whom Boris rescued returns to Boris's father from the death of his son. He involuntarily broke the news of Tatiana. I can't describe the sadness of this scene ... However, Tatiana feels that she finds the straw to grab and I hope Boris has come home again. The musician never saw Boris buried. <br /> <br /> I don't mention more scenes, but I would like to point out that the Soviet political correctness does not reduce the film at all. Boris's brother appears as a piano playing an anti-Soviet explosive, so someone who steals his brother's wife must be. There is no doubt that at the end of the movie he will get at least a "tennis"! At the end, when Tatiana finally learns that Boris is dead, she will still be able to complete her joy and hope. You don't even want to imagine the tears and cataracts that had to be wiped out of the theater when the survivors of this war, with their own losses, saw the film first. <br /> <br /> Unbelievable. Look at this.
