Unfairly neglected classic Intruder in the Dust is one of the great films of the 1940s, which has unfortunately slipped into the shadow. The story of William Faulker and his hometown of Oxford, Mississippi, tells the story of "Intruder" about Lucas Beauchamp (played by Juano Hernandez with great dignity), a black man who was wrongly accused of murdering a local white man. and a white boy (Claude Jarman, Jr.) who uses this situation as an opportunity to pay Beauchamp a previous debt. Amazing action, especially for two big character actors, Porter Hall (father of the dead man) and Elizabeth Patterson (known as Mrs Trumbull, "I Love Lucy") as an old woman ready to stand against the city people to see this right . This understandable, intense, and sincere trial of racial testing is worth seeing.
