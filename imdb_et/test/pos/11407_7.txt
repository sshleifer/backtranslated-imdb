If you ever have a babysitter in a house you didn't know, or if you saw the original and enjoyed it, this is a good choice. Ignoring the opinions and posting here I went on and rented this movie because the memories of how the original scared me as a teenager. This film has (of course) changed some of the original stories of today's teenagers, as the babysitter is struggling to switch over to his mobile phone in minutes and has to take the babysitter to pay his bill. However, it remains quite well with the original story line. If you can associate with a babysitter, you do not know the house and it is normal jumping and cracks, it is quite a halt. When the killer is shown, she is very horrible and you find yourself yelling at "STAY HOUSE". If you have never taken a baby and were not in such a situation, you probably cannot associate it with it and don't like it. It's all about understanding his fear.
