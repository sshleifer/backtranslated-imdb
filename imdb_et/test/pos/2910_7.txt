I was glad to watch this movie when I was 10 years old, interested in Egypt. I know that there are fine mistakes in art and costumes, but all this is the best film that is today with the look of the 18th Dynasty. <br /> <br /> The film only aligns Mika Walter's "Egypt" on the plot. A good part of the text never made it a movie, because we have to consider the current length. <br /> <br /> The music by B. Hermann and Alfred Newman is beautiful! The performances are as follows. Late Edmond Purdom gave an excellent result as an orphaned child whose parents had accepted their childhood after years. He maintains that he holds himself, is the best education and puts his face on a relatively emotionally distant person, given his upbringing and high intelligence. <br /> <br /> Jean Simmons is good as a modest tavern worker; Honest loving and sincere. Bella Darvi, people complained about his accent, well he's a babylon. The film does not show why Sinhue has become so obsessed with Nefer Nefer Nefer. Its the right name. In the book, Sinhue enjoys her carnivorous fruits and gets revenge early, leaving Nefer Nefer Nefer's stunned body with "Dead's House" workers. <br /> <br /> Gene Tierney is Baketaten, great. When he tells Sinhue that he is a danger, he will see that he could feed him (his weakness). He's intense, brilliant and cool. <br /> <br /> Michael Wilding is heartily tragic in his mission to bring all people to know one God. I believe we look at Ankhnaten through the A. Weigall lens in Egypt. A look at the time when the Ankhnaten's invitation was known before the Messiah. Did his monotheism affect the Jewish people? Psalms 104 and other generations of pictures added to the Psalms? <br /> <br /> Mr. Peter Ustinov gave you an alter ego. He's a streetman and a cunning survivor. Great action, as always. <br /> <br /> Mature didn't usually think about his own personal behavior, his Horemheb is good as an ambitious "superpatriot" who finally has a Sinhue murder in more than one person in his search for power (Walter I felt the end of Egypt was confusing because Sinhue's personality becomes too easy, he has a living son (Toth dies in the novel), power is given to him more than half of his sister Baketaten, he is now skilled in the world and has international affairs, so he was enlightened? <br /> <br /> But NO! Sinhue gives everything up, everything including his son's future, to get a messy beggar preaching monotheistic love? <br /> <br /> This change was too fast and the main error of the script! <br /> <br /> The film's appearance, color, most of the costumes (the golden dress of Nefer Nefer Nefer was too up when he was richer than the royal family), the music is beautiful. <br /> <br /> I look this movie again <br /> <br /> PS I know you know that Horemheb did not give Ankhnaten direct success, but I couldn't prove it.
