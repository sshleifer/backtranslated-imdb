We hit this show over one Sunday morning at 6:30 am, while turning all the cable TV channels and it turned out to be the best show! It's totally divine. We need such exhibitions for children (and for adults because I am definitely over the years of my childhood.) As another comment, it noted that it shows the benefits of the simplicity of characters and story lines. Dolls are fantastically cute, the backgrounds are colorful, and although they are created from priesthood, foam, color and pure imagination, they remind us of our childhood when we could spend the day in our grandmother's house exploring this world around us. For those who have never been happy that Grandma is as nice as Nana, this show is for you, you lose time! This exhibition is a real inspiration that is full of cleverness and humor, and is just fun for kids and adults alike. In other words, don't forget this example just because you are over three years old! Spend half an hour with Mona, Nana, Mr. Wooka and Russell, they're the friends you expect!
