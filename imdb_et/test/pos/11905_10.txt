I love this movie and I recommend it to anyone. Lady Chapa and Jennifer Tilly played their role perfectly. Diverting was also great. The most creative pictures I've ever seen. stick to the whole movie screen, not one scene was slow. The film also features many action-packed scenes, cars, etc. The film is just the whole masterpiece. If you like a real entertaining movie, look at it because you are at your place all the time. I put this movie on my top ten list because there is never a dull moment in the movie and it's my movie type2 a little up to !!!!!!!!!
