WARNING: I recommend that anyone who has not seen the movie yet read this comment. <br /> <br /> This movie was on the shelf of a movie shop and because I saw a handful of very scary horrors, it had very low expectations. Well, I put it in and almost immediately sucked in. While watching, I got a deeper and deeper story and soon I was excited. This movie is surprisingly remarkable and I loved every second. The story is about boating in Australia. It seems safe enough for their boat to be hidden in some food. When I looked at the back of the case, I thought this film had visual visual effects like Lake Placid 2 and many others, but when I first saw the crocodile, it seemed amazingly real! Don't laugh when I say it because I'm serious, but it's one of the toughest movies I've ever seen. It really knew how to build tension and tension with a nail bite when I think to think about it; Your stuck, the trees, run somewhere, somewhere to hide the hungry predator in the water below. You can't tell me you don't turn a little. Even some of the fridges could be thrown out of me, as when Adam was crouched and Grace and Lee were confused. This is a very attractive film. There was perhaps one or two parts where I found myself lightly interested, but not that I would say that this is my favorite film I saw.
