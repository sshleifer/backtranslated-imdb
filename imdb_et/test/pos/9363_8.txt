RKO Radio Pictures made a real classical class in 1947 and even succeeded in being the Best Picture Academy Award. Functioning, scripts, continuity, etc. are all almost perfect; and the story is worth the viewer for 82 minutes. While the picture softens the true story of life, making homosexual victims of murder, most viewers do not see Jewish homosexuals - such disguises do not work, perhaps not intended. <br /> <br /> I could reset some details, but just for fun. In Washington DC in 1947 there was no night night, and if I wanted to, Robert Mitchum and his palm wouldn't talk through the show. There was no bar where GI could get a pretty blonde. NO! When Robert Ryan wanted to read the last murder he should have bought in Daily News; not the Times-Hearald, the Evening Star, and certainly not unknown to anything in the Washington Post. But these little things don't take anything from this classic. <br /> <br /> The film benefits a lot from the absolute lack of music scores except during credit. I've only seen it in some movies. <br /> <br /> The negative side has been the introduction of TMC since 1995, with some liberal blabs on what the public was prepared for in 1947. blah, blah, blah! Like this stupid is a business that appreciates its contributors. I would say that former GIs in 1947 - the biggest generation - were much smarter - and had better values ​​- than some commentators, film historians or other wise mouths in 1995.
