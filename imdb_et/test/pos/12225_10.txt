I love this example. It is truly unique. I had the impression that he had more seasons. While waiting for series 2, I recently bought Series 1 to review it to update Part 2 on startup. Now that I was following it, I was more exciting and craving, so I came to the site to see the schedule for continuing. I'm really disappointed if I no longer see another series of plans, because I was eager to see more of this story. I think they really dropped that ball. There was a lot of story line to build and many unanswered questions. I'm very unhappy now and I hope they will reconsider their decision and take the story where it left off.
