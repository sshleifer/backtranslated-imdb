Whether he sees him as a career as a plain, or as a brilliant hunting egomaniac, discussions on George Armstrong Custer's life and military career continue to this day. They Died With Their Boots There are some facts about Custer's story and have taken the liberty of others. <br /> <br /> He graduated from his class in West Point and got overnight on the battlefield. Brigadier General. His record led the Michigan regiment under his command was one of the most brilliant. <br /> <br /> It was also true that his marriage to Libby Bacon was one of the 19th century's greatest love games. Libby and George married for 12 years until The Little Big Horn. It is not known to today's audiences that Libby remained until 1933. During this time, he was the guardian of Custer's legend. Because of his iron will and the power of his personality, his late husband became a hero because he did not allow him to remember him in any other way. <br /> <br /> I think Raoul Walsh and Warner Brothers have a good chance Custer's career is being told about feedback. Olivia DeHavilland should have built the way Jeanette MacDonald was in May and spoke of her husband and marriage story in terms of nostalgia and memory. Even then, Custer's legend cracks appeared, but when it was done from Libby's point of view, they could understand and forgive. <br /> <br /> Sydney Greenstreet produced a good result as General Winfield Scott. The only problem was that Scott had nothing to do with Custer, he was retired and replaced George B. McClellan at the end of 1861, while Custer was still in West Point. I'm not sure they ever met. But Greenstreet is characterized by amazing and powerful Winfield Scott. A nice Mexican war story should have been instead of giving Greenstreet his very accurate images of old Fusses and Feathers. <br /> <br /> The film is performed by one big romantic cinema team, Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland. It was the last eight films they did together. The last scene they ever made for cameras was Libby's goodbye to George when he left for his regiment, his last campaign. Their performances, especially Olivia, were a high point in their career at Warner Brothers. We know through history that Custer is driving his destruction, and the fact that it was their last screen gives such a scene a special boy. If your eyes are not moisturized, they are made of marble. <br /> <br /> The history they died with their boots leaves much to be desired. The Western adventure that interferes with romance with action cannot win this movie at all.
