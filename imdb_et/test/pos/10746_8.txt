Dragon Ma (Jackie Chan) is back, taking off the seas of Pirate Lo. There is a police force on the ground where he has to deal with corruption and crime in the local suburbs. Along the way, he has fallen into the fate of several Chinese patriots, trying to provide compassion and support for their revolutionary cause. The Chinese Manchu government is after these revolutionaries and everyone who stands on their way is in trouble, even if they are in the police. After seeing Project A, I had great expectations for this film. But unfortunately I was a little disappointed. Compared to the first film, it is too little. Until the end, there is only one good fight. This fight scene is a "gangsters place" and its good, a lot of people are flying all over the place and the hard kicks and punches are thrown. Jackie Chan and his stunt team don't cheat here. The end is very fun, Jackie Chan shows us why HE is the best stuntman in the world. Really exciting things! The only bad thing about the end is that the fight is too short and forgotten. Conclusion: Many funny moments, good actors and crazy stunts. But there is not enough struggle for top rated.
