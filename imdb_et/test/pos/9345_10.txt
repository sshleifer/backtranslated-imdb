"Triller" is great. It's a long video, but just great. The song itself is ... great ... add Michael JAckson dancing and you have a golden phenomenon. Of all the videos I've ever seen, it's the best. If you haven't seen the video yet, I'll ask you ... <br /> <br /> Special effects are amazing because it's time ... everything from wearwolf change to idea that these horrible zombies slowly lift their graves large. Vicent Price has its own segment of bone shake lines, known simply as "rap" Ola Ray does good as Michael's girl and Michael JAckson herself ... dancing and singing (though not video itself) is unbalanced ... > <br /> 10/10.
