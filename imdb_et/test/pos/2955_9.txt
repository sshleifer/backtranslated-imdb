Surely this is one of the best documentaries I've seen in family relationships and marriage. I saw "Fucking the Fears" a short time ago and I have to admit that I thought it was better. <br /> <br /> The story is not incredibly shocking, but it is a great exploration of trapped personalities and relational cold. War. Block the viewer comprehensively through diaries, family materials, and factual interviews; his interview style is sensitive and sampling and his perceptions are clear and measured. <br /> <br /> The Cascade Street is a personality and a relationship to study the social changes, social decline and potential of over 40 years of age to redeem.
