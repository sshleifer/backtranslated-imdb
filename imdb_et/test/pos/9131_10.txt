you've loved Shawshank Redemption, Pulp Fiction, Vertigo, Oldboy .... And I guarantee you will love this one more. its a brilliant thriller. The story is so simple, but so catchy. it keeps you on the edge of your seat until the end. Slow moving scenes, simple music adds more perfection to the film. it is so genuine. The show is a top-of-the-line sequence ... they're too perfect .. if I could put that top 10 on top. The most fun thriller I've seen for a while ... ***** / ***** My voice helps me get this movie up 250 <br /> <br /> you love it ...
