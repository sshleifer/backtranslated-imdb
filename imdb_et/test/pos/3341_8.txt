This film originally appeared as a soft "X", probably with explicit sex. Later, "producers" "smelled" (smelled of money) and released him again with unexplored scenes (probably only about 3 minutes). I think that since Kristine was aged, she was held against her and her promising career stopped. I think all this is in the timing (witnessed by Pam Anderson's career) - but Ronald Reagan was responsible during the Kristine attack (we had not heard of Nancy Reagan's affairs), Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinski were in full swing during Pami's "coming out". <br /> <br /> Sex is just a cake, both versions match. This naughty music is similar to others that appeared at the same time.
