God blesses Joe D'Amatot ... I love Italian horror, cheese (movie;)), sci-fi, etc. <br /> <br /> It was a bit harder to watch, but another fun BAD movie. <br /> <br /> I like how people make a negative review of "I usually enjoy bad movies, but ..." No, but it was a bad movie for people who love bad movies. This is one of my best bad movies. <br /> <br /> Miles O'Keefe was a poor man Conan, but oh what fun. Who can't have fun with a primitive nuclear bomb, stapler and cheesy rubber monster? It's good to hate this movie if you only want a Hollywood drama like "Titanic" or "Pretty Woman", but if you really do, I mean TRULY love bad movies, check it out anyway. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that are fun to rent for a beer break or if you have a few buddies and are looking for a fun, meaningless fun. <br /> <br /> My Rating 8/10.
