In the early 1960s and early 1970s, Klaus Kinski rose to a large number of western spaghetti; he was mostly under secondary parts like a nasty villain. Kooky Klaus gives himself a juicy leadership role as Crazy Johnny Laster, an unpleasant, wilted and abducted sex maniac who plans to rob a lovely heir to get his remarkable legacy. After the plan goes catastrophically, Johnny and his gang have become involuntary. Writer / director Mario Costa harshly portrays the portraits of a sick and twisted little life: the plot opens at a constant pace, the tone is sharp and serious, and exciting scenes are staged with real skills and brio (shooting in rock quarries is particularly exciting and exciting). Ironically dressed in white, delicate charisma from every rotting pore and jumping into beautiful women every opportunity, Kinski Johnny is thrilling with creepy and monstrous vigor. Kinski is simply admirable as this brilliantly repulsive character; he receives peaceful support from the delicate Gabriella Giorgell as sweet, fiery salon girl Juanitana, Steven Teddina as cheerful Riccardo, Giovanni Pallavicino as a ruthless band member of Machete, Giuliano Raffaella as wise attorney Gary Pinkerton and Paolo Casella Johnny with reasonable partner Glen. Kudos also has the desperate and delightful result of Stelvio Cipriani. Kinski fans are worth a look.
