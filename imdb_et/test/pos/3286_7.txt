Wesley Eure is a young inventor, Brian Foster, who has invented a new crime interrupting security device in the form of a dog, "C.H.O.M.P.S." (It stands for HOMe dog protection system). C.H.O.M.P.S., modeled after Brian's real dog Rascal, can do almost anything; it has higher speed, strength, X-ray and the like. It's just a thing to save your boss Ralph Norton (Conrad Bain) security company. Of course, the slider competitor Gibbs (Jim Backus) wants to reach the edge so he tries to get hold of it. <br /> <br /> This is something that is too hard to resist. It has a lot of strokes (Chuck McCann and Red Buttons playing great pairs of idiots), amazing attitude, tempting cast and good enough laugh to keep one entertained. The energetic disco-style music repeats itself but is undeniably memorable; the story is simple and the dogs themselves are absolutely divine. In one very strange but lateral touch, there is another dog in the movie (called "Monster") whose thoughts we actually hear; both his dialogue and the voice of the speaker are invaluable. In fact, he even uses somewhat weakness and his last words stop the movie from positive intestinal stroke. the material they can collect. In addition, Larry Bishop, Hermione Baddeley, Robert Q. Lewis and Regis Toomey are also participating. "Scooby-Doo", "Smurfs" and so on, "CHOMPS" is a pleasantly silly stuff. I know it was a smile on my face. <br /> <br /> 7/10
