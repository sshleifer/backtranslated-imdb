I saw the movie and I am very happy to see a movie that is so different and characteristic that stupid, major American big productions. This is a film whose background is interesting for young people as well as for all age groups. Unlike some reviews, the audience seems to share my assessment because the film is very successful all over the world. For example, there is a number 3 in the Netherlands. Negative statements must be respected, but it must be assumed that it is guided by facts. If you have the opportunity to watch a movie and enjoy it.
