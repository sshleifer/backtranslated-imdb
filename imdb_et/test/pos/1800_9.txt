This is a good film, which in many ways is defective with low productivity. Martha Coolidge himself said he only had $ 350,000. This is a film I loved to grow in the middle of the west. I remember friends and I have a nostalgia trip on this film 10 years ago. Great things about this movie .... Great hungry actor and hungry director. The bad points of this movie ... For a small budget that requires too much improvisation. If Martha Coolidge had been given more money and time for the film, the results would have been even better. They should have taken the story from the beginning of the 20th century, not the views of the high school aged 15-17. Most of the actors / actresses had tried to play 15-17 years of age in the mid-1920s .... The best scenes of this movie are in Nicolas Cage's characteristic Hollywood club. I gave this movie a high rating of 9/10 for five reasons. Nicholas Cage is an on-site improvisation; The camera's work and corners are excellent because they have a budget and have only one shot from each scene; Sytles, music and lingo are busy perfectly and forever; Again, music is incredible and carries a story from scene to scene; And finally ... Martha Coolidge can turn a weak script, unknown actors and a very small budget, and 20 days of the whole movie for both good and memorable movie shooting is amazing!
