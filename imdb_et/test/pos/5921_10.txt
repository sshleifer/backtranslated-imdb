This is a great story. Although there are some parts of Jimmy Stewart's cornball, it is usually a compelling story of an individual with compelling rides, vision and adventure. The bottom line is that it is one of my favorites that I watch and I've probably done it tens of times - so long as someone stole our bag I was flying on a flight to California. Some have commented on too many setbacks, but I don't know how to consider a longer flight as interesting. For those of us who are actually flying, the flight can be an hour of boredom that is attacked by moments of fear. I wouldn't have wanted the flight to be shortened at all. The need for dreaming and droning and the loneliness surrounding it is part of this story. <br /> <br /> There are many parts I particularly want, including taking off from Long Island and landing in Paris at night (Wow, things have really changed with us and French since then!). The scenes of the airplane building and the record flight from San Diego are interesting, as is the difference between the Atlantic ice (which I do not fully understand but happened on a flight to San Diego). <br /> <br /> One gets the idea that one of Lindbergh's greatest assets is his enlightened supporters and his persistence. <br /> <br /> Some lines that ring with my head, and then "Pull the chocks!" in the start-up and "I hope I don't have to use it" to describe a "periscope" similar to a submarine to a woman who gave her a mirror so she could better see her airy instruments. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for everyone, but it is definitely for me. I hope they will do this on DVD soon so I can replace my stolen version!
