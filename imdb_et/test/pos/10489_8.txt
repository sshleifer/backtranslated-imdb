Tonino Valery "Il Prezzo Del Potere". "Power Price" is a wonderful and appealing West Spaghetti, which reflects Kennedy's murder. The great leadership of Giuliano Gemma and the excellent result of Luis Bacalof are just two of the many reasons to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> In 1881, Texas is divided into those who value the loss of slavery and want to live in peace and those who, after 16 years, still want to re-install the confederation. Despite warnings, President James Garfield, who wants to create a new equality policy, will visit Dallas, where corrupt law enforcement officials are planning their murder. Bill Willer (Giuliano Gemma) and two of his friends, a black man named Jack Donovan (Ray Shaunders) and a criminal, Nick (Manuel Zarzo), have decided to prevent the murder of the president. As James Garfield was not murdered by racists who wanted to re-install the confederacy in Texas, but with the mentally unstable Charles Guiteau in Washington DC, the story of "Power of Power" is of course a historical mess. However, as the film does not require historical precision, but tries to refer to the Kennedy murder in Dallas in 1963, this story is fictitious. <br /> <br /> Giuliano Gemma delivers excellent performance as the protagonist Bill Willer, Benito Stefanelli being a big buggy and corrupt sheriff of Jefferson. Some good performances include Ray Shaunders as Bill's black friend Jack, Warren Wanderers, such as Arthur McDonald, Presidential Adviser, and Fernando Rey, like Rootserton, a wealthy wealthy businessman. The score of Luis Enr√≠quez Bacalov is great, cinematography and locations are great, and (as Valeri's earlier "Anger Day") reminds a lot of Sergio Leone, whom Valery had previously worked on "A Fistful Of Dollars" And "More Dollars More". <br /> <br /> Everyone said that "Il Prezzo Del Potere" is after Anger Day, another great Spaghetti Western that shows both Giuliano Gemma and actor and Tonino Valery's great talent as a director. "The price of power" is essential for the western fans of spaghetti and I recommend it to everyone else. 8/10
