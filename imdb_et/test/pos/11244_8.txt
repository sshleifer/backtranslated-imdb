This is a great example despite many negative user reviews. The purpose of this performance is to attract you to laugh. Two men compete against each other to get a girl's phone number. Easy. Fun at this show is to see how two men are trying to achieve their goal. Some seem to be hateful for a variety of reasons, but I think they understand it as "educational" examples of getting chicks. Well, it's not, it's a comedy show, and it's all about making you laugh, not teaching anything. If you don't like it because it doesn't teach you anything, don't look at it. If you don't like the whole club game, don't look at it. If you don't like communication, don't look at it. This show is a comic show. If you look at other girls to look at, it won't make you laugh, so don't look at it. If you are so disappointed when you look at the exhibition when you knew you didn't "pick up" girls, there is no reason to show hate, just don't look at it!
