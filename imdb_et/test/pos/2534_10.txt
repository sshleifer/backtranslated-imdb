"Pixote" is one of the most powerful, shocking and mobile movies coming from Brazil. The life of the children of Sao Paulo and the streets of Rio de Janeiro and in the middle of it is a ten-year-old boy. The camera monitors them in an almost documentary style, from a juvenile detention center (where most workers are corrupt as police) and back to the streets, and never turns away from the horrors of the city. All young people see prostitution, drug abuse / abuse, corruption and murder; but this is something they are painfully used to. Director Hector Babenco used real street children as actresses, adding a brutal reality to the movies. Although not for everyone, I recommend the movie. An emotionally devastating film. <br /> <br />
