I felt compelled to comment on this movie as it is the fourth lowest rated sci movie listed in the IMDb. WHAT!?!? Of course, this movie is dirty, but it's HILARIOUS! It's not terrible at Ed Wood, it's more surreal and uneven. <br /> <br /> The film has some classic moments. Brain surgery is big and big and even nuttier if you think the movie was rated PG! Gor began his dolly before he began to drain his battery acid on his face - "Go! Gimmee!" Zandor Vorkoff's speech at the beginning of the film - "Before Amiri, Kali was just one weak nation who fought free for centuries of feudalism!" Angelo Rossito also has some great features - "No, Gor! No!" "You want those keys, aren't you, my pretties?" It is totally wrong that this is the fourth lowest rated sci movie in IMDbis because it is pleasant. No matter how bad the film is, if it still manages to be strange, uncomfortable, unpleasant or entertaining, it is worth it and is not worth it to be able to drop and trigger it. I do not protect most of Al Adamson's films, but with Dracula VS. FRANKENSTEIN and HORROR'S NETWORK are fun enough to compensate for their horror.
