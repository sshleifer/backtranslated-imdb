It's really quite simple. The movie's name is the death bed, eat the bed. If you are like me, you already know if you are going to like this movie. I bumped over this day's jewel on the second day of Best Buy and took it to Ten Bucks. I got ten bucks in the title and the box alone. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of the B movie. This is, in my opinion, one of the biggest B-films I've ever seen. It is not for everyone now. <br /> <br /> Simple, not even for most people. In fact, I suspect that there are only a handful of us who really enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> For those who want B-movies, this movie is tough. This is a great prerequisite for bed ... It eats people. It doesn't work, it doesn't move, it doesn't have siren to attract people. It depends a lot on the people who travel and sit on it. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie every inch and I've seen it three times in the weeks. <br /> <br /> As I said, after reading the movie title, you already know if you like it. If you laughed or smiled, give it a go. It's worth it.
