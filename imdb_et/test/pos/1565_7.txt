At first glance, the camera's corners immediately think that it is a low budget movie that takes you to tears or puts you on a stop button. Surprisingly, the story goes on and is played through the screen in the way that is most closely related. I put this movie to 7, but like most, I felt it should be 10 years old, you understand when you watch it, because it's a rare thing that the film would come into contact with people's feelings and how life should be shown on television set. Most of the films try to leave you with extraordinary effects, twists, etc., This film was about a real hand that showed a good movie supported by Alabama-style stories, which most felt a good waste of hours. I wish I was a popcorn maker all well done!
