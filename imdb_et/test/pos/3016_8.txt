I do not want to criticize the film that, in my opinion, is quite extraordinary and bold for a big budget movie. laws of different countries treating their viewers as children. In the database, we find at least 4 different versions of the movie according to working time. But, of course, it is likely that there are many more different cuts. <br /> <br /> The result is complete confusion and you will never be able to talk about the same movie (if you live in Argentina, where the movie runs for 115 minutes, which sounds quite complete). about 110 minutes). <br /> <br /> It would be nice if the studios were thinking not only of the money they made with their films, but also of thinking about their products as a work of art, even if it is a risk of unfavorable ratings, so I don't have to be disappointed and not as a viewer seriously taken not only as a resource for money.
