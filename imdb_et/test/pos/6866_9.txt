This movie sends refrigerators to your spine even if you don't understand German. I first saw it in my German class high school and found it at $ 5 in my local Wal-Mart. I've seen it at least 20 times, because * it's just a couple of years ago * and it's nice to watch a movie night. Plasticized bodies are mostly real, used for body worlds. This movie was fictional. Germany Dr. Many people were against it, and so was the big German horror movie. I personally love this movie and would like it for anyone who likes a thriller movie.
