I had to get this movie because it didn't come where I live. I waited patiently and expected. I loved this movie completely. The chemistry between Walters and Grint was because they also collaborated on Harry Potter's films. A woman who plays her overwhelming, right mother was really convinced how much and how many hypocrites she has, I think she did a great job playing a role. All I want is that we have actually seen a sex cat or more. LOL, but of course we just have to use our imagination how it fell. (Snickers) I thought the movie was welcome and if you wanted to watch a good movie. Rent this movie. I have to say that Rupert did a really good job and it is nice to see that he makes movies outside Harry Potter, even though I love him completely as Ron Weasley. The overwhelming majority did a great job and I hope that Rupert will also work outside Harry Potter to expand his skills!
