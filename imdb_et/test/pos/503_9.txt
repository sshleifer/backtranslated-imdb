For a short moment. The open scene with Traci Lords and the <br /> <br /> techno-bar is incredible. I would probably follow him for my ultimate death! The best vampire movie all the time, but with a twist. Fighting scenes are awesome. Wesley Snipes shows a sport that you don't see every day. And Stephen Dorff is impressive and very credible, as an ambitious new recruiter moves into the hierarchy with any necessary tools. Great flick 9/10. Where is Blade II?
