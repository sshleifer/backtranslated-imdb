did not seem like it was a fantasy movie. The film is dark with dark tones. Music music moves up so that it penetrates the visuals. I'm sure they tried something military, but it just doesn't work. The style in which Astin tries to escape is a great example. Why does it sound like Goonies? No comedy, no brightness !! <br /> <br /> The film's idea is great and the actor is also very good. I enjoyed everyone's performances. It is available in Netflix's network view. <br /> <br /> Be sure to check out but write your own soundtrack !!
