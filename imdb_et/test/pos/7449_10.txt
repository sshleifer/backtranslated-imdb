What is to say about this movie? This movie is just great. A real feast for the eyes. Just as the game set for standard 3D role-playing games 7 years ago, this film sets the standard for future CG movies. Many of you have seen trailers and amazing details in every frame, and let me tell you that this movie doesn't disappoint. You can actually see the mirror layer of the Cloud Sweater. <br /> <br /> Music is also very good. The film contains a number of reorganized stories from a video game that fans will certainly appreciate and appreciate. <br /> <br /> The film's main weakness is its story. It's not a bad story, but this story is only for people who have played a video game. For the first time, viewers may occasionally disappear, or they may not notice the importance of certain events. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone, even if you have never played this game, because what we have here is a special movie. See it and enjoy the beautiful exhibition.
