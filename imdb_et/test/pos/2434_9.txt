Music by award-winning composer George Duning [here for eternity, picnic, world of Suzie Wong], cinematic art of perfect places [including the famous Ambassador Hotel] is all famous TV star Robert Day [Kojak, streets of San Francisco, The Avengers] leads the most pleasing groups of character actors of every darkness made detective film fraud.
