An absolute classic to scare the 80s. It's not like any other because it digs pint-sized, wild, psychotic youngsters who want to kill the city against all adults. Bud JUST ONE GUIDELINES (80s Gold) plays one killer child and is associated with one little girl Jake Blues tries to buy from BLUES BROTHERS. The third blonde is a boy but he disappears from the movie for some reason. Violence is sometimes fun and sometimes surprising. The demonic gang of smiling children, although it is somehow on planetary resources, has little resemblance to the damned droid-ish children who have never thought of using cheaters, shrubs, and shovels to kill their irritating adults. Julie Brown (not Downtown Julie Brown - second) shows her shelf like three times as she dances in her bedroom. This film is rare that I can't believe I was growing up in the 80s. It would have been my absolute favorite movie as a child if I had seen it. Where's the sequel that ends? This movie is simply incredible. Look for it at all costs.
