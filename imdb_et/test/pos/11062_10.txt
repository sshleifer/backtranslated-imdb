I would appreciate this movie in my Ingrid Bergman movie list. Aside from Ingrid's beauty, her talent is visible from the scene. She was sad, average, funny, <br /> <br /> snobbish, flirtatious, joyfully funny, loving, gentle, sad, exhausting, happy, etc. - And so <br /> <br /> convincing. Ingrid plays a notorious woman (Clio) who returns to New <br /> <br /> Orleans and falls on Texas gambler Gary Cooper (Clint). Especially I loved the scene where they sit at the dining table, saying something, just looking at each other. She is an elegant white dress and she has a beautiful white cowboy <br /> <br /> dress sitting there looking at her adorably. What Chemistry! What love!
