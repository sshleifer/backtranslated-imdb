Truly funny British comedy since the mid-1950s in girls' school. Girls are all concerned with anger and chaos by doing bath gin, smoking and gambling. Alastair Sim plays the role of Head Millicent in a brilliant role and also plays Millicent's brother. A female police officer goes to school to see what's going on. This movie is funny, with big eyes and Alastair Sim is great. Just classic Britshi comedy, a lot of fun and not too subtle. Joan Sims ans Sid James, the stars of many Carry On movies, play small roles, but this movie is about girls. It created 3 sequences and recently again. See and enjoy where it all started.
