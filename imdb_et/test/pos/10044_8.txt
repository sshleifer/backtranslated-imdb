George Armstrong Custer is historically known as an unjust general who led his death in a small horn battle. "They died with their boots," painted a different picture of the general Custer. This film depicts him as a Flamboyant soldier whose mistakes and misdemeanors are mostly against his love for adventure. <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn plays George Armstrong's Custer, who will meet for the first time in a super-sensitive recruitment at West Point. Custer distinguishes himself from other cadets quickly, being a poor student who always seems to be in trouble. Somehow it never seems to be disturbing to Custer and it seems to be confusing because he doesn't really know how he gets into such situations. Despite his poor condition, he will be graduating and become a US military officer. Due to a mistake, Custer will be ranked. Before correcting it, he leads the Union regiment in the fight against the Confederacy. His campaign is successful and Custer becomes an unlikely national hero. Custer returns to his hometown, married his loved one Libby, played by Olivia De Havilland. Libby is a very supportive understanding spouse who is permanently staying with her and following her at the border when she takes over the leadership of the Cavalry Seventh Regiment. Custer becomes an honorable man who tries to keep peace with the Indians. To prove his intentions, he concludes a contract with Cio Horse, head of Sioux. If this treaty is threatened by a conspiracy to spread the false golden rumor in Black Hills, Custer will sacrifice both his life and the lives of the men in his hand to prevent the killing of thousands of innocent settlers. /> <br /> Errol Flynn dominates every scene he appears on. She successfully depicts Custer, beautiful, arrogant, romantic and funny, depending on the mood of the scene. The image of Olivia De Havilland about Libby Bacon Custer as the love of her life allows us to see her delicate and tender side. The chemistry between DeHavilland and Flynn, who had been working with many other films, is so smooth and almost makes the viewer look like himself, not Custer and his wife. The other actors represent their characters in the realities of Flynn and De Havilland. Anthony Quinn as a crazy horse, Sidney Greenstreet as General Winfield Scott, Arthur Kennedy as Edward Sharp, among other actors whose roles have made the movie fun. <br /> <br /> The evaluator would appreciate this 4-star movie. Although not historically accurate, it is a lot of fun. The movie has everything. It has adventure, comedy and romance, so it turns to many target audiences. Casting characters is great and actors give credible performances that make you forget that it is largely based on fiction rather than fact. Especially like the natives did not show that they were bad guys, but simply showed that they wanted to protect their sacred land. <br /> <br />
