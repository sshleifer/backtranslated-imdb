Forget about all these delicate romantic movies that include laptops and lip-locked pairs who can look at each other after a more simplified, unrealistic romance. Forget all these shameless "dogs give their lives to save their family" (although I have to admit that I have a soft spot for them). Forget that Ricky Schroeder has already shown his tendency to overestimate his age (now that it was shameless!). <br /> <br /> This TV movie, which unfortunately never appears again, is a master of all time tears, hands down. And a well written and well-functioning story that begins. Ann-Margret took a great opportunity in this task. There is nothing strange or sexy here and this is a monumental achievement in itself. Based on the real story, he plays for Lucile Fray, a sick mother who decides to fight her deadly soul to find good homes for her ten children instead of leaving them to unpredictable government agencies. Frederic Forrest does a good job as his wife, a good-hearted, but unreliable, nutritionist whose debilitating arthritis and personal demons are unable to care for her children. <br /> <br /> The film leads us through Lucile's heartfelt process to question future parents and then see how his children leave home. It also gives us the perspective of a child and a father who is saddening the current tragedy, and that which will surely follow, and is disappointed that he cannot do more. The scene where the youngest child (Steven) is taken to his new home is the most heartbreaking thing I've ever watched. Now I grew up as a "hopeless romantic" and since then I've spent more difficult and cynical. I usually find more than mocking when we are stepping up today in an emotional cinematic trip. But I still like the pearl from the early 1980s. <br /> <br /> I really want someone with a marketing idea to release the DVD version of this drama. Special features include next year's Emmy Awards TV show. A-M applied for this role, but the best dramatic actor was awarded to Barbara Stanwyck for "Thorn Birds". In what has to be one of the greatest moments now in a truly drab-awards show, Stanwyck tears into his acceptance speech and went out, "Ann-Margret, I love you!" <br /> <br /> One final note. The IMDb rating "Who Loves My Children" is 6.4 when it is written. However, over 75% of ratings are in the range of 8-10 (mostly 10). Regardless of which handicapping system this site uses to change the overall rating of the movies listed by IMDb, it will completely disable it. This is the "smart" of all time and a good TV movie.
