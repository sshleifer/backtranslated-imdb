I loved this movie! It has a big heart and big bones. I stumbled upon it randomly, and I had no memory, not even good, about the film about ads or reviews or word of mouth. I remember reading years ago from a journalist who commented on the value of watching a movie without being contaminated by ex-ante evaluations or false shots of ads. And this seems to be the most common source of criticism of the critics for the film: it did not meet the expectations that it was a comedy, or a slice or character of life. I had no hope of a movie and so was the comedian - but I laughed only once or twice - without comedy; it was human, but so special that it was not part of life; it was about a character, but the character was so intelligently optimistic and trusted in his life instinct that it was not a nervous sentimental melodrama that was so typical of the American "serious" film - as I wrote I realized that the writer / director Lisa Krueger managed to have fun in this skeleton do. And very cleverly! And Kreuger was able to hold the extremely sentimental end of the screen when his way, not the prodigal, was returned by his wife with his tails between his legs. Bravo, Mrs Krueger, bravo! (Now I look at this movie again because it gets better and better than I think about it.) <br /> <br /> Graham's performance as Joline is great. I loved it finely, but completely able to portray and convey intelligent awareness of his devoted dedication to his words and deeds - he knew he was keeping his word with his band or friends or with his wife that he made himself ridiculous and / or disappointed in the world that could not fulfill the commitment it could make. But even with that strength, he was fully associated with humankind and had a fully committed heart of their weaknesses and failures. The character of Jolin was amazingly good and I was surprised to find that I had no memory of prizes being awarded. Okay, not as surprised as American awards tend to go to "serious" roles, full of anger and the right nudity that this film didn't have. It was much better, which was the heart of this woman's discovery with the help of new friends and self-evident shaman. <br /> <br /> I admit that I am a bit of a soft touch for eccentric stars who manage their own peculiarities, while remaining honest and honest when moving through a minefield that includes "proper" social behavior and "acceptable" interpersonal discourse. So, if people have to follow the normality in their world, this movie doesn't like it. And that seemed to be one of the common topics of criticism. <br /> <br /> And I'm always good at mammalian words when it comes to questions about human behavior and ethical / philosophical values. Until this film, I did not make an emotional connection between commitment (cause or honesty or anything) and commitment (to a crazy shelter). At what point does a person change his personal truth and way of life into a single ticket for madness? It sounds like a simple question or what is just rhetorical. But is it? And few critics - I think maybe two, commented on this aspect of the film, either directly or indirectly. <br /> <br /> Cute movie. 8/10 <br /> <br />
