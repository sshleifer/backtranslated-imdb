It is a masterpiece of cinematic art, featuring many themes of simmering and occasional cooking in warts and the entire poet's bohemian, self-conscious war years that include London's air bombardment and the peace of the Welsh coastline. - the boundaries of friendship, lust and love, commitment to art and experience, and practical problems, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egoism and heroism and self-sacrifice, and more. Perfect performances are a well-mature, subtle script that highlights and occasionally dramatic focus with perfect tension (except for the strange inappropriate smile that Keira Knightley tends to, though perhaps only when other characters often call it) . But first and foremost, the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with ingenious and elegant close-ups, camera angle and lighting, including dotted faux home film, is a miracle and a pleasure to see. It's as beautiful to look at as Bertolucci, but relationships here are more convincing and narrative more involved than some of this master's work. These days there is a very rare type of film - it keeps the attention and irritates emotions, without giving up artistic integrity and giving up manipulative, superficial shortcuts.
