After some further thinking about this movie, I find it too easy to leave it as a boy's dream. I have actually got some spiritual strength from Northfork ....... personally. Yes, as I wrote earlier, it says so much ...... can't wait to get to heaven ... <br /> <br /> "So sick of all FX and Formula things, I found it film is a real cinema, I can say that it touches me in so many ways that I still sort it out. God gave you the story to follow the brain and heart.I think it may be a little over some heads, but I feel they are the individuals with whom he most importantly speaks. ! <br /> <br /> The industry has to learn this movie to understand that we have it. br /> <br /> Thank you to everyone involved in making this movie.
