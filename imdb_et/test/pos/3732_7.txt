WTF !! Does any of his books / movies end with a happy ending? The laptop was good ... but it was already depressing enough. I said he was writing in real-life situations that people deal with in real life. Understandable ... but sometimes it is nice to see people who have sacrificed their entire life to get only the average miserable time in their lives, to finally find the true meaning of happiness and to live for the rest of the day. Don't we already know what's really going on? Can we - live for a moment (one and a half hours) directly through a film ending with a happy note - give us hope for our future? <br /> <br /> Yes - wah. I know. But, really, I think we have to make films like this with a warning. "Caution: No happy ending."
