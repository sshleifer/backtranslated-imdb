It's really a kung fu classic. This film seems to have influenced martial arts films for decades. Spanish guitar background music, competing schools, impossibly large jumps on roof edges, thrown spear traps, cheating tournaments, secret training for exotic karate techniques, patience and perseverance, and more were copied later. films such as "Karate Kid" (1984), "Hero" (2002), "Kill Bill Volume 2" (2004) and "Kung Fu Hustle" (2004). <br /> <br /> I am lucky to know this movie for the first time in 1972, just after it appeared, just before the kung fu films became mainstream and before Bruce Lee got the household name. I saw it with two of my friends at the San Diego theater, which was visited by sailors, and although the scenes of glowing red hands and butterfly eyes were laughing, the audience was clearly caught up like our small group. It was a very memorable film for me. Decades later I could even recall a particular scene even after I had forgotten the title of the movie. This movie is especially special to me now, because one of the two guys I first saw (sailor Kenneth Lee Hines from Kitty Hawk) has been out of this time, so this film will act the same day as a memo before taking judo and karate lessons in the coming years. <br /> <br /> Compared to Kung fu movies, I would rate this movie as 10/10. But since I have to keep in mind the larger film audience, I appreciate it more objectively than 8/10 because of obvious technical errors. I just suggest that neofit viewers find that these technical errors are proof of their vintage style and its authenticity, and then happily enjoy testosterone-loaded chaos.
