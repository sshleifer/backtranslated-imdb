This is my first Deepa Mehta movie. I saw a movie on my TV in my Hindi version, which was "Nita" for "Sita". I also note that this is Radha, who underwent an allegorical experiment in the film, not Nita / Sita. But what I loved about the film was his scenario by Mrs Mehta, not her direction. The big and small characters were well developed and looked quixotically towards the end - somewhat like the end of Mazurski's "Unmarried Woman". They are brave women surrounded by cardboard men. And one cardboard game (Ashok) seems to be the last shot to see him alive, carrying his invalid mother Biji. He seems to take ultimate responsibility outside of tibibat and adhering to religion. <br /> <br /> Ms. Mehta seems to be directing the director (but she seems to be excellent as compared to most of the mainstream Indian film) because she can't use her script to overcome the microscopic family, except for a Chinese micro-minority glimpse of India's social in a milieu. He even dedicates the film to his mother and daughter (not to his father!). Compare him to Mrinal Sen, Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Muzaffar Ali, and he's in the dwarfs of these giants - giving him his competent Canadian production team and finances! The Mehta film, which consists of two bisexual women in a middle-class household in India, can be a sacred sanctuary for some, but only a middle-class atrophy that does not seem to strive for anything better than its immediate survival in a limited social space. Canadians, Malayalam and Bengal films have touched on parallel issues in India, but they did not have the public around the film, so it has not been seen by the widespread cinematographic segment. <br /> <br /> Mrs Das, Mrs Azmi Mr. Jafri and Mr Kharbanda are reliable, but not outstanding. Ms. Azmi is a talented actor who performed superb performances by good directors (Mrinal So Khandar, Gautam Ghose's "Couple", Benegal's "Anchor"), which was especially lacking in this film. Mrs Das shone rather than the presence of her screen because of her ability to act. All in all, the film's strength remains in the scenario structure, which is above average in international cinema. I am sure that Mrs Mehta will be able to complement her future scenarios with her future scenarios.
