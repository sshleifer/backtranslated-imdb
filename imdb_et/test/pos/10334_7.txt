I haven't seen this movie in 30 years, so I don't know if I'd like it as much as I was when I was 12. If I was then. This is a great "starter chick" for young girls. Be careful, however, at the end. There are tears and harsh emotions. <br /> <br /> Looking back from the 2008 perspective (so much more about the child's psychology, politics, and political correctness), I think it would be interesting to look again. Patty's reckless, abusive father, indifferent mother, and favored nurse contributed to becoming a vulnerable and starving companion. Patty was sad when Anton left. He was killed to death. Later, the rage against him was shocking. After all, he was only 12 years old. <br /> <br /> What I kept the strongest is how this film taught me "enemy" soldiers. Not all German soldiers were hateful Nazis. When I was older, I saw television shows like Hogan heroes and a rat patrol, which also emphasized that "regular" German soldiers were not the same as Gestapo. <br /> <br /> "Regular" soldiers were created. Gestapo was chosen from among volunteers for their special attitude. I believe that one of the privileges of the Nazis was that they had special tasks and therefore did not go into battle. Their specialties were interrogation and torture. Later, during the Cold War, I thought of Russian soldiers and I remember SOMGS. We were taught that the Soviet Union was "evil". But the reality was that Russian soldiers could not destroy America. They had a job. Their government apparently told them that our government was destroying its way of life. What in a sense was true because the US fought to end communism. <br /> <br /> The lesson still applies today. German soldiers were not the same as the Nazis, as Muslims are not the same as Al Qaeda.
