I haven't seen many movies with Holly Hunter, but seeing her on Broadcast News was a pleasant surprise. She is a heavy-minded journalist, Jane Craig, who has dedicated all her TV shows. His colleague Aaron Altman has been carrying his torch for a long time, saying something. The love triangle is filled by Tom Grunnick. He is a somewhat remote former athlete who is a new reporter. Jane symbolizes everything she does not want in news - making it a success story, not a serious business. Much to his surprise, Jane finds her attractive to Tom. <br /> <br /> Holly Hunter is a surprising journalist. But I don't see what he does so charming about his new colleague Tom. It is something with them that prevents us from having a close and personal attitude. Almost as impressive is Albert Brooks, who gives everything to his post, giving more than 100 percent to his job, but not as much in return. In fact, I thought he was from the police academy Steve Guttenberg (1984). He has some funny features and if it were Meg Ryan's picture, they would call it romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> A couple of hours of scenes could have been changed or deleted altogether. e.g. Jane and Aaron's trip to Central America. I am also a happy end to a mammal and preferred a different end than just after these seven seven years of reunification.
