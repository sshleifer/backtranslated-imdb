Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x is not much different from the previous games (except Tony Hawk 3). The new thing in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x is the new choice of levels and roll out graphics. Tony Hawki Pro Skater 2x offers a new career mode and is 2x career. 2x Career is basically a Tony Hawk 1 career because there are only about five challenges at the level. If you missed Tony Hawk 1 and 2, I suggest you buy Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x, but if you have played the first two games, you should try it. All in all, there is really nothing new, but the game is still very fun. Hopefully this review will be useful to your needs. <br /> <br /> Graphics: Of 7 out of 10 Overall, pure visual Tony Hawk Pro Skater is not the main feature. Tony Hawk 1 and 2 have changed the atmosphere a lot and character models are a little better. When you look back at Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 for the old PS1, I thought these old graphics are stupid from your head. In Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x, the graphics are LOT better. Label models are no longer filled with jaggers, textures are smoother, but not the farthest. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x visuals are not comparable to Tony Hawk's 3 graphics, but Activision didn't want to make Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x exceptional graphics. In general, the average graphics score is 7, because they didn't use the full power of the Xbox here. The graphics are nice and clean, that's all I have to say. <br /> <br /> Sound: 8 out of 10 Sound effects don't give the imagination much, but skateboards from the ground sounds good. The main reason I gave the sound factor was that you are not obliged to listen to the average Tony Hawk soundtrack because it has a custom soundtrack feature. Sound effects sound much better than Tony Hawk's 1 and 2 sounds, mainly because it is clearer and just that everything sounds good. One of the main reasons I bought this game is because of the soundtrack. Sound sound effects still look the same as the first two games, just a bit out. One of the main problems with the sound factor is that when the song is over, it won't go to the next track, the song you've just heard will play again. I do not like the sound used in the game, but as I said, you are not obliged to listen to it. <br /> <br /> Control: 10 out of 10 The controls are the best part of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x. The controls are wonderfully comfortable and accustomed. On Playstation Days, people thought the controls were the best, but it seems that 2x has done better work with Xbox control. Surprisingly, the use of control rods to perform tricks is very simple. Activision has done a lot of work with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x controls. They've made the Xbox controller Tony Hawk the best for games. You don't have to be disappointed with the control style and it's a guarantee. <br /> <br /> Game: 10 out of 10 Except that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x is basically Tony Hawk 1 and 2, the game is still incredibly fun. The game factor has changed a bit. This time you get much more air than the first two games and it is much easier to do tricks. In Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x, each character has three career modes consisting of Tony Hawk's 1 quarry, Tony Hawk's 2 quarries and 2x career. The career of Tony Hawk 1 is quite simple, because the first game is NOT air. Tony Hawk 2's career offers just as much difficulty as the playstation version. The only difficulty that applies to 2x career is to find out where all things are, but after you have done it, 2x career is not difficult at all. There are 3 levels in the 2x career and the first two levels consist of finding secret tapes, collecting S-K-A-T-E and changing that particular level. The third level of three is the level of the race where you need to score a number of points to get the gold. The first two levels have secret tapes and the collection of letters S-K-A-T-E. In general, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x retains a former Tony Hawk Pro Skater error. <br /> <br /> Story: - <br /> <br /> Fun factor: 10 out of 10 Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x is far, the most funnest game on the Xbox today. I've played Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1 and 2, and then I didn't like them, but for some reason Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x is a lot of fun. There's not really much to say, except that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x is now the best game for Xbox. One problem is that once you have finished the game, you play it a few more times, but it is repetitive. <br /> <br /> Replay value: 10 out of 10 from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x gives a great deal of playback value. There's a lot of cheat to unlock and lots of characters in videos. In general, Tony Hawki's Pro Skater 2x has a lot of replay values, mainly because it's so fun. <br /> <br /> Best Feature: You are not required to listen to the soundtrack in the game. Worst feature: custom soundtrack is a bit confusing. <br /> <br /> Final Statement: Many people have complained in the past that they don't like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x because there is nothing new, but they should stop filing a complaint because you get a lot of play for $ 50.00. <br /> <br /> Graphics: 7 out of 10. Sound: 8 out of 10. Check out 10 out of 10. Game: 10 out of 10. Story: N / A Fun factor: 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Overall score: 9 out of 10.
