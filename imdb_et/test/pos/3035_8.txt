I saw Conrack at night that I couldn't sleep and I was never so happy I had insomnia! This story of young white teachers who teach poor black children on the island of Carolina is a great ad for teaching and simply helping each other. In the early 1960s, on civil rights issues, Vietnam and all that came in the 1960s, it has been forgotten that the money corps and many young people struck to help hostility. The class that scares power is it. The biggest part was that Jon Voight said they had a 20-year-old reunion and 18 of these children became teachers !! It is enough for you to think that we as humans can have the chance to live ourselves, perhaps hopefully. Watch this movie.
