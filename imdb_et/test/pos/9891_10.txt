I understand that "Checking Out" is likely to be released in US theaters in June 2006 and on DVD in November 2006. My recommendation is to leave "Checking Out" !! This comedy film amuses everyone who is involved with characters, family relationships, and many social problems that are portrayed. "Checking Out" makes you smile quickly, coming with smart humor, built into almost every line, and it can excite you in an amazingly positive sense. The subject of suicide is dealt with in a comic manner, which at the same time can help people who are considering it to understand the impact of this act on their lives and on those who love them. We hope that "Check out Out" can have a positive impact and help prevent the behavior of suicide people, especially in the 16-25 age group with the highest suicide in the US. The script is wonderfully written, perfectly cast and loaded with sync and substantive setbacks over time, the meaning of which is more visible at the end of the film and especially at the end. I believe that the script is worth the Academy Award nomination "Best Scenario to Play a Movie" (Phoenix Film Festival honored "Checking Out" "Best Scenario Award"). <br /> <br /> are loaded with great actors who do themselves, and have a long track record of high performances, nominations for prizes and winnings. I feel that Peter Falk is worthy of the Academy Award nomination in the Checking Out performance and is the most complex and widespread of his career. Laura San Giacomo's performance and chemistry with Peter Falk's father is masterful and recognized at Palm Beach International Film Festival "Best Actor Award". <br /> <br /> Even the teenage characters of the film look and play by young actors Dan Byrd (movies: Cinderalla's Story with Hilary Duff, 3 Young Artist Award Candidates, Won 1) and Mary Elizabeth Winstead (TV: Monster Island, Wolf Lake, Passions , touched by an angel, 2 young Star Candidates). <br /> <br /> Director Jeff Hare and producer Mark Lane are excellently developing the symbols, relationships, and story of this entertaining, enjoyable, yet complex script. <br /> <br /> Movie editing keeps the speed of the movie fast, only slowing down the poignant scene so that the audience doesn't lose interest from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this movie, you can make the whole family look like and everyone will enjoy it.
