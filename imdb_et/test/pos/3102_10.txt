We need such entertainment in our modern world. "Ma and Pa" can be viewed by adults, with their family (children of all ages or with themselves like me. They are gentle, but gentle, children who kill children, terrible war, inappropriate first-class television We don't even get clues where all of them children come in! Give me a modern piping and I'll be happy to have a kettle because humor doesn't require offensive language. Relax, take your shoes off and climb up your lounger with a good old-fashioned glass of lemonade, and just breathe just as you wipe the chicken off the table!
