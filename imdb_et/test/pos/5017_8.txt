What are some of the films that produce such polar opposing reactions? <br /> <br /> Some of the people here have called High Roller "Nasty." Some have called it "extraordinary" (as I am actually). <br /> <br /> Why? I think this is such that such films do not make heroic heroes or glamor degeneration, and some people just can't do it emotionally. They need a hero. I also add that if they are gamblers or poker players, they may feel personally betrayed if their existence is not justified. <br /> <br /> A high roller is not a poker movie. It's a film of people. It's not perfect, but it looks good, well written and wonderfully worked. And best of all, it creates an emotional response and inspires thinking. <br /> <br /> And maybe it makes some people so crazy.
