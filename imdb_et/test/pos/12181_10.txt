I'm completely adjusting Anne Rice's book. While most of the film is filmed here in Australia, it offers a large number of landscapes and a fantastic area to shoot. Lestat (Stuart Townsend) has recently woken up during sleep and has decided to give her vampire vengeance by revealing herself to the band. When he becomes a popular movie icon, they go crazy with their vampires and die of death. Meanwhile, the orphaned member of Jesse (Marguerite Moreau), who has an ancient vampire tree, has become deeply obsessed with Lestat. His superior David (Paul McGann) understands his obsession and affirms his obsession with Vampire Marius (Vincent Perez), an old vampire and a man who also made Lestat a vampire. Jesse is given a Lestat diary and read about his first killing and meeting with the queen of Kadi-Akasha (Aaliyah). When Lestat organizes a concert in the valley of death, she gets news that not only the angry vampires are there. In the meantime, Akasha has other plans. He goes to the vampire, the bar and kills all his way. The tempted king was thrown and the loving care of Akasha was the ancient vampires, consisting of Marius and Jesses aunt Maharet (Lena Olin) against them. Join her or the dead? <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was fantastic, had great fighting scenes, great music and great places. Aaliyah died sadly shortly before the premiere of the films during the air strike, but he looked amazingly at the equipment and kits. <br /> <br /> I gave this film a 10/10 because it was a fantastic movie and I call you to see it!
