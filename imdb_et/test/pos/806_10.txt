This movie deserves 20/10 if I can give it. "HOLLOW" is an excellent novel by Hercules Poirot and at the end most people. I'm glad this movie was completely loyal to the novel. There were no big differences I could mention. The only difference was that Poirot was first introduced to the story in a novel. The show was great and the music, as usual, was amazing! David Suchet is perfect in his role and the rest is perfect in his role. In another movie I've seen so far, Poirot is not so well illustrated! Hats for Manufacturers - They've made a movie that I'll cherish with many others for a long time!
