This zany film rival Ghost and Mr. Chicken as one of Don Knott's best movie shows. Knotts is the accountant of Podunki Town Hall, which is good for robbery of citizens. They shoot "three competent accountants and keep a fool" (Knotts is of course stupid). If his garbage collection cohort accidentally empties the wrong trash bin, Knotts finds the odd trap surrounding him, which the city council assigns to him. The funny moments of the movie are the bowling alley lounge and the cemetery scene is completely fun. Typical Knotts, a nervous ninny act is well used and, as usual, surrounded by many crazy actors from the sixties. Actors like Frank Welker and Pitt Herbert add chaos. As you might expect, Knotts is armed with a big car, a beautiful girl, and there's no real idea what she's doing. Fun for everyone, especially nostalgia, but almost everyone loves it.
