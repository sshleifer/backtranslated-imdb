Then I returned from Morocco, where my father was associated with the German Embassy when the film came out in Europe; took all my girlfriends to see it, show them the beauty of the country where Jimi was playing - and stayed -; where the hippies stopped after Ibiza left and before Goa joined. Sean Combs has just celebrated recently in Marrakech's Friends Restaurant, Djema el Fna was more wild today than it is today; The rocks went past there, Brian recorded in Tangiers; so it's memories and family life and I'm glad my son knows about this movie from North Africa. Candice Bergen looks beautiful and oo7 / Connery is pretty funny; and Teddy Roosevelt, as Brian Keith played quite impressive.
