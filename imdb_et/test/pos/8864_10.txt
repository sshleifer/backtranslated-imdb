This is one of those films that I remember to stay with watching television, scaring myself at a 12-year-old impressive age, and after that I got into the movie obsession. It is a big movie and is a proof that before the CGI there were really realistic effects. <br /> <br /> On the Antarctic-based base, this version is beginning to start with the original version (The Thing from the Second World). American scientists discover a Norwegian base that is a few miles away. Everyone is dead, and only half of the remains of unknown things left outside the compound can provide answers to what may happen. Thing brings back the American base and too late, scientists realize it is alive and deadly. Thing melts out and is off, not only to kill someone or something that crosses its path, but also to swallow it, doing whatever it is and whatever it wants. The film then becomes a great paranoia. Everyone has a doubt, someone can be a thing and no one trusts anybody anymore. Gone is the strength and security that exists when people bands together, despite their differences in the monster. The divisions and the rules of fear of the group take precedence. Who's the matter? <br /> <br /> Gore effects here are absolutely amazing and shamefully realistic. I could have been splitting without a dog head, like a banana cream, but it's just an animal lover who is picky: kill all the people you want, but leave the kids and puppies alone. Healthy and common sense decompose rapidly, one by one taking over the alien. The power of this film lies in its paranoia and although I liked the original version, I prefer it; the real danger is threatening and frightening because it cannot be seen or easily detected. If it is hidden, this anger is enormous and the results are terrible. <br /> <br /> This is one of Carpenters' best movies. All actors give strong, realistic performances and special effects so powerful that they are their main characters. This movie has something for lovers of the Horror genre. Don't miss it.
