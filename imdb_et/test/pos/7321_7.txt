Under the leadership of a younger brother, Leo McCarey, a great director, it is the three Stooges that have been nominated for the Academy Award. Here are doctors called Doctor Howard, Doctor Fine and Doctor Howard. They are not the brightest doctors, but they will benefit from this doubt as they begin to fulfill their responsibilities and humanity. <br /> <br /> I liked it short. It's not one of their best, but a few moments are fun. One joke that is repeated more than once works every time. The part they need to run the hospital's boss is terrible. Say it would ruin some jokes so you have to see it yourself. Just another tiny short of three stories.
