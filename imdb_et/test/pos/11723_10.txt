Although he was great at Boogie Nights, I think it was Burt Reynolds' best result. He is also a great director and has made a harsh, violent film that does not stop (the death of a whore with 12 gauge) and is a great detective story with some great actors (Brian Keith, Bernie Casey, etc.) and an outstanding jazz soundtrack. 10 out of 10
