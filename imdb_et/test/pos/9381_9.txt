George Barry's "Death Bed: Eating a Bed" is the root of a dark fairytale spoken through the horror-film framework. In my opinion, one of the best films of the 1970s, and it's completely criminal, is that the picture has been stolen and distributed without Barry's knowledge (those responsible for the theft must be in bed, ASAP). If you are looking for open gore or rabid activities, "Death Bed: Bed That Eats" is not a flick for you. "Death Bed" is a gentle, cordial wireless image; it plays like a totally strange dream. I would recommend reading Stephen Thrower's "Death Bed" summary of Thrower's FAB press book "Nightmare USA" (he describes the film vibe perfectly). Whether deliberate or not, I have noticed the "death bed" tone in everything from "Phantasm" movies to Michele Soavi's "Cemetery Man" up to the author, such as Kelly Link, magic-realism / slipstream fiction. Barry is an original and in a fair world I am sure he would have followed the "Death Bed" with many fantastic odd movies.
