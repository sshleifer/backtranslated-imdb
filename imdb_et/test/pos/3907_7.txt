I believe this is one of Elizabeth Montgomery's best films, and I've seen most of her movies. I saw it for the first time on television when I was about fourteen times, and I was so scared. Now and then, and I still enjoy it very much. years or so.I love movies that don't show graphic details, let your imagination work for you. The upper limit of this film was cast. Jess Walton, who was a sister, was very good, although his role was rather small. He also played in a fantastic television thriller with the same time you called ever to see with David Hartman. I got the biggest result of Eileen Heckart's performance as a housekeeper. Eileen was as good as a very poor disposition lady.George Maharis, who had played with her husband, was quite effective. This story probably had a lot of mistakes on the plot, but I still love this movie. I recommend this movie to people who love a good thriller without graphic violence. I gave this movie seven voices.
