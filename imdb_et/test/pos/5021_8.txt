Wow, I think the average rating of this movie on this site is incredibly low. There's really no reason for this movie. "Michael" is a simple but quite original and easy to enjoy romantic comedy. The plot includes a group of reporters / experts investigating the mysterious appearance of angel (John Travolta) in the West. The angel turns out to be less sacred and worldly than we would expect, and it makes it fun. His interest in women and the Beatles takes a new spin to the angel. On the romantic side of this movie is Angel Angel, who is trying to get together with Andie MacDowell and William Hurt. These two may not always have the biggest screen chemistry, but they definitely have enough chances to make it work well. Anyone with this movie is so low (5.4?), Come on! The film is not so bad. In fact, I found it quite funny and memorable. Of course, this is not the best thing you'll ever see, but it's still good. This is a film that I feel it is significantly underestimated. It's fun, romantic and recommended by me. <br /> <br /> *** out ****
