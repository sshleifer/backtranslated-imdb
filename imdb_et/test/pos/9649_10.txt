This is indeed a very long film. But this is a pretty beautiful and good example of why cinema can be considered art. Les Amants RÃ©guliersis is not expected to just tell the story, but every scene, every silence here says a lot more than a hundred dialogues. Touching, in different, perfect images and soundtracks, showing why cinema is one of its main features is the biggest innovation in every dramatic representation. Someone who is accustomed to this type of movie, where everything is said, and the action takes place all the time. But it's worth a look to find out other ways to feel the story.
