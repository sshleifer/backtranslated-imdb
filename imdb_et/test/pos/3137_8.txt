In Crystal City, a group of Mormon horses are hired by Travis (Ben Johnson) and Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) as Captains of Wagons to drive their caravan on the San Juan River. During the trip, they will first meet with a broken wagon without being in charge of Dr A. Locksley Hall (Alan Mowbray) and prostitute Denver (Joanne Dru) and Fleuretty Phyffe (Ruth Clifford). Then, the sadistic laws of the Clegg boys decide to join the Mormon caravan to hide their patrol led by the Crystal City Sheriff. When Navajos crosses his path, they are invited to visit their dance party. If the wagon train is close to its destination, Clegg's boys threaten settlers, forcing Sandy and Travis to take a stand. <br /> <br /> "Wagon Master" is another western part of John Ford. Sequences where the wagon train crosses the desert and mountains are impressive. The Mormon group's adventure is funny and very fun and the songs fit well with the plot, even though they are dated. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Caravana dos Bravos" ("Brave Caravan")
