The three names that are most relevant to this film are Burt Reynolds, Mark Wahlberg and Julianne Moore. These three give the strongest performances, but the whole cast is a great job. The film, though on the porn industry, doesn't let itself out of its sexual assumption. On the other hand, there were many scenes involving the use of drugs, and although they are important for understanding the lifestyles of the characters, I think there were some superfluous in this department. Paul Thomas Anderson hasn't done much, but he may have chosen this film on his 1988 work "The Dirk Diggler Story". One thing that was perfectly depicted is the family as the atmosphere between the characters as they work, live and party together. Although they are not a typical family, they seem to care for each other. A great soundtrack will really help you feel the time when the disco was a rage. There are also many discotheques and some other great songs. <br /> <br /> The story is a talented young man, Eddie Adams (Wahlberg), who is invited to the porn industry. She changes her name to Dirk Diggler and becomes an adult movie star for almost a night. Jack Horner (Reynolds) is a director who takes his films very seriously because he believes that his work is not just pornography, but that it is a true art. But Dirk becomes too addicted to drugs and soon drives a dangerous road where he loses everything. Although more attention is paid to the actual Dirk, there are sub-blocks of other characters and experiments in their lives. You will find yourself wishing and hoping that their situation will improve. An all-in-all well made film.
