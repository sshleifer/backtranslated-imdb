With ww2 timing, getting in and out of love, and light-eyed Kira, it's reconciliation. <br /> <br /> This communication story focuses on the main characters who work out the first and fast balance of love in the WW2 home. The poet Dylan Thomas is filming his way between his wife and ex in the dark and smoky Blitz in London and later in the windy Wales. <br /> <br /> The former and the next spark of blood come from each other as the poet and soldier become evaded when girls bind and share. A simple wristwatch that works well in the era of bouncing with a pair of dips. Work well with French subtitles, but I can have too many art houses lately.
