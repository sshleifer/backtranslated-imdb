One of our all-time family favorites. If we need to laugh ... we just put it in and we laugh like it's the first time we saw it. This film has a good, clean family humor. Pauly Shore is great! Crawl (Shore), without Thanksgiving Day, is invited to take a vacation with a conservative coin, Beccaga. Crawl, being a metropolis, must adapt to the farm's life if he wants to fall in love with Becca. But Crawl is not the only one studying new things. Crawl teaches Becca and her parents how to be more open to their feelings and others. It's fun for viewers of all ages.
