Doe-eyed high school student Kathleen Beller is found beaten and <br /> <br /> raped on this television movie's opening scenes. Then the movie <br /> <br /> appears for a few days before the rape, as Beller has harassed the stranger. <br /> <br /> Beller and Scott Colomby and his best friend Robin Mattson and <br /> <br /> Dennis Quaid are twice dating early. Beller's anxiety parents, <br /> <br /> returned Tony Bill and shook Blythe Danner, waiting at home for twisting <br /> <br /> hands and so on. The 1970s give their date right now, because young couples talk about romance and love <br /> <br /> "Three days of Condor." <br /> <br /> Beller, an amateur photographer, starts receiving dangerous notes <br /> <br /> filled with his school locker. Filmmakers wisely give us <br /> <br /> the whole suspect: Beller's new boyfriend, Matton's <br /> <br /> boy, Beller's father, Beller's former boyfriend and how it <br /> > too friendly photo class teacher who wants Beller to be a bit more sexy in his portraits? I knew who was the rapist, because the Worldvision Video Company's video box has an image <br /> <br /> of the back cover attack, destroying all its proportions <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> Without expelling an attacker, Beller will start harassing and eventually rape the phone calls. The movie is directed south when he does as Nancy Drew and secretly sets up a timepiece camera to catch a guy who is pursuing another student. <br /> <br /> Finally, filmmakers hokey the completed storyline from <br /> <br /> Beller's lack of understanding rape victims in this <br /> <br /> day and age. <br /> <br /> This relationship is very real without moving over surprising movie stuff. Beller is very good and watches him and <br /> <br /> Matton's scene in an abandoned theater - both are doing great jobs. <br /> <br /> The film is full of familiar faces, including a small role-playing Ellen Travolta. <br /> <br /> and all are professional. It was done in 1978 and it shows. I am sure nobody understood that it would be seen in 2001 with a critical horror <br /> <br /> movie lover who has to go to bed and be early in the morning, but some attitudes here are embarrassing. A teacher who tells Beller that it's sexy is never explained what he meant. Nowadays, when every high school teacher said it would have been independent for a TV movie. <br /> <br /> After Beller has been raped, the rapist is still part of his life because he is guaranteed blah, blah, blah. There may not be a case there because <br /> <br /> Beller is not a virgin, and can not prove that he was raped, whom he said. Many of these problems have been dealt with in modern technology and police work, but this film probably seemed to have the opportunity to add to the debate on reform. Rape is an act of violence that has not disappeared, but the attackers have been caught today. The problem is that the anti-rape angle seems sticky as it is <br /> <br />. Before that, we have a tight little henchman, who has a true glory to God. After rape, all <br /> <br /> change, in the movie, not better. <br /> <br /> I remember Beller from the 70s and 80s (and who could forget <br /> <br /> his revealing role in The Betsy), but he hasn't done anything for almost a decade. It is a disgrace because he was very good then. <br /> <br /> Then I recommend "Are you alone?" Based on <br /> <br /> acting alone, reluctantly arrows at least two-thirds of the movie <br /> <br />. If you want to re-live in the 1970s TV High School for life, this is your cup tab. <br /> <br /> It's unrated but includes physical violence, some sexual <br /> <br /> violence and some adult situations.
