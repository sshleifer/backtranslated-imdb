I first saw Daisy in Korean. It happened in a simple love story that started well to the end. I saw it three times when I waited for my copy of the director's cut arrival. <br /> <br /> Then I got DC and watched it. Wow! I think this is the first REAL Director's cut I've ever seen. Amazing how detailed editing is in both versions! DC is put up as a hardcore thriller, a love story in the background. It moves more slowly than the Korean version. The variations in both versions are so drastic, it seems that two completely different movies. I thought I'd look at the movie again, harsh it just to find scenes added. It wasn't like that. It really seemed like I was watching a whole new movie. <br /> <br /> Although DC is 20 minutes longer than the Korean version, it's hard to push to specify where or what has been changed. 2 seconds off here. Another added there. The whole scene was added here. The other deleted it. In both versions, the scenes are added, omitted, or split and moved. In some scenes, a number of dialogues were replaced or reorganized, while the scene itself was intact. Even simple sound effects were added from each version - this had a significant impact on the film's mood and sometimes even on the scenes. The Korean version at the moment of offering is sad, yellow in DC. The endings of both versions allow interpretation. As far as I can say, both versions will end up in a lot of LOT and were designed for that. <br /> <br /> I expect most people to get a movie director cut and find the movie pretty decent, but a bit long and boring. If so, look for the Korean version. Same film but different feeling. I think there is a luxurious 3-DVD version that includes both movie pieces - not sure. <br /> <br /> Versions complement each other so well that in pairs I look more often at Daisy than any of my favorite Korean films. Alone, I would say that the Korean version is a nice love story I look at for some time. Director's cut, I may look one or two times, never again, when I find the temple to be boring. But they just go so well together! On what I consider to be the best experience, I would say to look at the Korean version first. Then look at the director's paragraph to help you complete the story you were curious about. <br /> <br /> Editing is the actual star of the movie.
