I recently got into the Hitchcock series. I always rent one of my movies when I'm in Blockbuster or Hollywood. As I said earlier, Hollywood loses this intact unbelievably, I needed to remember that there were terrible movies. Not to mention that I want to be a filmmaker, not a movie buff. Is there a better way to do this than Alfred Hitchcock's movies? A man who knew too much is another great and thrilling thriller who plays Alfred's favorite leader James Stuart and a woman who steals a show at Dorris Day. They play with the husband who goes with his son to rest, but if the spy tells James any information that can arrest another spy, his son is kidnapped and kept for ransom. James just seems suspicious of Dorri and his ability to get the ideas back to his sons, but he makes a big comeback and almost reaches the flick hero. <br /> <br /> Again, I would say Dorris was the one who was cast. James did a great job of working together to make these two sit down and never over the film. I loved the little comedy at the end that Alfred added. You see what I mean. I always recommend this movie, although it is not the best Hitchcock movie, it is still a treasure. <br /> <br /> 9/10
