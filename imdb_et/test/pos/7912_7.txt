An understandably targeted and sliding imaging psychological mystery thriller with exceptional leadership by Donald Sutherland, and strong Donald Pleasence and David Hemming support. The material decides to keep it all and moves from the investigation period to the victim's background. The rare and rather empty nature of the investigation pulled me in, but when he rebounded on the victim's side, where he showed his last days, he was not as convincing and somewhat stagnant and stocky. Although the script is highly detailed and to some extent difficult to move around, the ultimate and surprising revelation should have been more bone-jarring, and it was not helped by its sloppy execution. The score on Howard Blake's music has an emotional sting that just strikes, and director Claude Chabrol's ability to handle (well, most of the time) has a strong stylistic and close-knit way that best suits mood and flexible pain. The young face of Lisa Langlois and Aude Landry are also doing a great job.
