Is it a bad, dirty, predictable, sticky, scented soap opera? "The best of everything" is just such an innocent pleasure for me in the valley of the dolls. I mean, "the best" is everything. Someone gets out of marriage (when the last time you heard that phrase?), There are things everywhere, drinking, upside down, jealousy and even tragic, but not completely unexpected death. <br /> <br /> Caroline Bender (Hope Lange) and Mike Rice (delicious Stephen Boyd) are the focal points of the season. Their chemistry is immediate and it is the glue that keeps the film too fragmented. <br /> <br /> Suzy Parker, an off-the-chart gorgeous ex-fashion model, will appear in Gregg Adams, an aspiring director, a role that, according to her never read biography, was probably not great. But Parker is doing a surprisingly reliable job here, not just for his pair of scenes against Louis Jourdan, who plays David Savage. Probably Jourdan took the money and special screen credit for this money because he was clearly on the road to aging. <br /> <br /> Diane Baker is a nice naive, gentle April Morrison, Martha Hyer Barbara Lemont has a very juicy story and the film legend Joan Crawford is looking at her usual role as Amanda Farrow, like Jourdani Savage Crawford would probably have taken the reward. <br /> <br /> There are obviously some dated dialogue and plot devices (this IS 1959) and the predictability of the soap opera genre. But if you like a good soap then "Best of all" is more than you.
