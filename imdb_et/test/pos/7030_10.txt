It's never the best movie, but that's my opinion. Some say it's cheesy, but I think it's a really beautiful movie. Chemistry between Jennifer Gray and Patrick Swayze is like no other I've ever seen, and it makes the film so perfect. I don't always know what the film would have been if these two actors never existed, because not only one of them did it for me, they both did. If you have never seen this movie, you will understand what I mean. Dirty Dancing looks like it is made from the heart and for some reason seems as real as magic and soundtrack LOVE IT. In addition to the two leading players, the soundtrack of the film changes what it is. As you can say, I am in love with this movie and I know you are.
