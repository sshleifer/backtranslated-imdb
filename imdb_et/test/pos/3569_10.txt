Hallelujah !!!! Finally, a true Colombian film crosses the border (s) to show how Bogotá and Colombia really are! I am an American from Colombia and France, who is sick and tired of seeing Colombia so embarrassingly and unknowingly what Hollywood and others represent. <br /> <br /> How many of you are aware that Colombia is the world's second oldest and uninterrupted world of democracy (after the US) or that it has a living film and television industry (not anything from Ugly Betty) to its capital, Bogota (Pop. 9 million), is the 'capital of the world book', or is this beautiful city the world's largest international festival festival? I hope that Doug Liman, Simon Kinberg (-Mr. And Mrs. Smith), Robert Zemeck, Diane Thomas (Romancing the Stone) will visit Bogota one day to see how wonderful it really is and to focus on Bogotá's cultural vitality and diversity. Instead of myopathic films, such as Maria Full of Grace, which Joshua Marston greatly benefited from (for this great film), without having to think about ontological damage, her film would help Colombia's "unfairly faded image". /> <br /> -Whatever you enjoy at least Bluff! -Oh, and thanks to IMDb for your invaluable / excellent work!
