Dr Ben McKenna (James Stewart) and Jo McKenna (Doris Day) travel to Morocco for a vacation where they meet a mysterious man named Louis Bernard (Daniel GÃ©lin) on the bus. The next day this man is killed, but before he dies he tells Ben a secret; murder takes place in London. The crystals kidnap a couple of sons of Hank (Christopher Olsen), ensuring Ben does not release his plan to anyone. Alfred Hitchcock's man who knew too much (1956) is a very intense thriller. is great because it is always in Hitchcock movies. James Stewart is wonderful.Doris Day is a delightful person and actor and he can also show his singing opportunities. Song Que Sera, Sera is an important part of the film. is a movie about many classic scenes. In the last scene in Albert Hall, without dialogue, you can barely blink into your eyes. This movie is fifty years old. Time has in no way reduced its power.
