I liked this movie, it reminds me of my high school day. The soundtrack is fantastic. I'm a huge nic cage fan and this is my favorite movie he's. I love the storyline, this is the whole love story, contrary to the contradictory things. I think everyone who finished the 1980s (1980-1984) should see the movie. This brought me back to high school memories.
