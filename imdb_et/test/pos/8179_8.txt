This film is not for those who are looking for extravagance in martial arts. As for historical accuracy, I leave this question to those who are better informed about this issue. I thought the performances were wonderful. Gong Li never loses the ingenious and (originally) loyal counselor of the Qin King. Fengyi Zhang showed a lot of flexibility, which was a ruler of madness. He chose "Hannibal Lector" for the route, not for the beaching. The best result for me was Zhiwen Wang as the supersmooth Marquis. The character came in very oily, but fine "Sir Humphrey Appleby" - yes Minister, some way. <br /> <br /> Film is a special feature of this movie. The scene where the Marquis and his men penetrated the palace were breathtaking. There are also several wonderful battle scenes. Therefore, this movie is recommended on a very large screen.
