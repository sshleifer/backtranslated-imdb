I loved it. It starts as a fairly ordinary, slightly somewhat French art film, and then suddenly, it is turned on with its head. This part is brilliant when you realize that you haven't watched 2 plots. Unfortunately, there is little point in the end, which is a great shame. Oh yeah, and it's filmed perfectly.
