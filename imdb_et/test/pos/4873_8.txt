Remember, a college friend who always demanded that you rent the strangest movie? This is the film he would have done if he had a chance. <br /> <br /> I would like to tell you exactly what the sea of ​​dust was. It pretends to be the story of a doctor who breastfeeds the "black forest" with strange events. He goes there to help but reaches between two young women, both of whom seem to be. But it's just scratching the surface. It's a movie where things happen randomly ... and not a nice thing. People are constantly foaming and peeling. There are a couple of horrible little girls who look out of The Shining. Tom Savini is an imaginary religious figure who decides he no longer wants imagination. He has a plan to take over the world by sharing Jesus with suffering. <br /> <br /> This is a sex film at some level. It is one without nudity, which was disappointing, but it is not wrong. On the second level, it's a stone paradise. Unexpected things happen so often that it stops unexpectedly. By the time your doctor passes through his girlfriend's birth canal to restore, you can just crawl it crazy. Some points are over and over again at home. If you look at it with rocky friends, it may be useful.
