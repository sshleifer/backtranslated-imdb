This is the first American film I've seen this year and I think it's the biggest feeling. As a teenage singer in America, Aaron is not as pop as before, most Americans I met said his song was fake and he didn't even know how to rap. But attention, everyone, he is a child, how many people can understand him. The pop fan is complicated and the pop star is harder. I think this time Aaron (JD) has shown us something real. And I think people should understand each other. On the other hand, I like a lot of music in the movie. I remember the first song "Saturday Night" appeared on the film and it also includes Aaron's real live show, the second is "one better", so I think you enjoy this movie, maybe you are a pop fan. Finally, I hope you have a great time ^ ^ Voice Chinese boy.
