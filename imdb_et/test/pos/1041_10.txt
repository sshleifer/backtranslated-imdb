This is the best job I've ever seen on television. The story is convincing - the more that it is true. Writers did their homework - the accuracy of the events is well documented. Operation is great. This must be the best role Sam has ever played with Waterston. And black and white cinematography was exceptional. My only regret is that it can't be bought. A few years ago, I contacted a person involved in production (either with PBS or in England) and was told that they did not plan to release it at that time (at that time). It was BBC production and ran an American playhouse in the United States. Such an interest is to see - just hard to believe that no one can do it.
