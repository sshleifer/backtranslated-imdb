The violent death of Fernando Ramos Da Silva only eight years after the film was completed only adds to the vigor of BAbenco's powerful message. The film is divided into two halves - the first in the Reformer, where violent law enforcement agencies and guardians are attacked and violated by young people in the group. The second background is the city, where they are confined to their activities and morals, which involve the looting, pimping and killing of various signs entering the biota. <br /> <br /> Different sex and sexual roles in a film allow you to constantly change characters when communicating with other people. Of particular interest is the transvestite Lalica, who is a mother and a lover of some children. His reaction to the arrival of Sueli, a prostitute, is both toxic and tragic. <br /> <br /> This story is not a happy ending, and I advise you to watch it carefully, because there are some very uncomfortable scenes that you can look at when opening for twenty minutes. But when you look at it, it's important to remember that it's not just a fancy story. Participants are not trained professionals but boys from the streets of Sao Paulo. They actually lived the life depicted so vividly both on the screen and in da Silva, died by the police, so brutally depicted. Documentary? Fiction. It's bounded by both, but it definitely makes a heartbreaking material and is a movie that actually leaves you breathtaking and thinking long after you've watched it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
