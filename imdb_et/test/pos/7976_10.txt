If you like the Baltic Sea, it's the keeper. I thought this movie was fun to watch and see people I haven't seen for a while. I'm not an expert, but I liked it to work. The city and props, etc. seemed like a suitable period and type of city that you would know at the border. It is not an A-West country, not enough people and a budget. Costumes and firearms were right by then! I look forward to the future of young actors in the film. Rachel, Chance, Rebekah and Kirby were great. The members of the Single Action Shooting Society (SASS) who contributed to this effort were quite tough. Hope to see more.
