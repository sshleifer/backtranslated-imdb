It is definitely a cult classic! <br /> <br /> From time to time it is difficult to follow, but then there is a movie like Jacobs Ladder or even the Fight Club. If you want a regular fare, I think I can rent a Care Bears movie or maybe an old Disney classic. But if you want to "look at the world differently", I would say that I will open myself against Enigma and the film that sets out what we see and think. <br /> <br /> For me it is important that the film was original and interviewed. So when I've seen some complaints, I'd say I'll take a movie about what it is and enjoy it.
