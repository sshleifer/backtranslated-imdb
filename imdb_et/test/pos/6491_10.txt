Freely, from one scene to another, from one story to another, like walking, from a shady road to an open place, like leaves, wind, wood to another, how many different sounds? Just like traveling, people meet and talk about their stories and then share forever who knows? And as well as those times that are full of lost expectations from another time, the human thickness of the world takes away the soul. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie with my friends, not all of them liked it, maybe they were used to scenario-based and ready to tide, I don't know. So this movie is for the fools who love watching the sun on the sea, walking in the mountains hurriedly or through small villages, listening to the growing grass that talks about the stories under them, six feet below, in the warm summer in the summer.
