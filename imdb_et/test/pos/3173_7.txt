I'm surprised that not all of the reviews I see seem to have noticed the main points of this movie or at least how I saw it. It seems like one big homosexual fantasy, camp dressing, praised nude Ferdinand, a firm sexual tension between Ariel and Prospero, and the last top score, dense sailors are perfect for hornpipe dancing. This whole approach, if you are used to it, offers you all kinds of fantastic scenes and pictures. Seeing innocent Ariel to draw nasty nude Sycorax to perform "his reputation and abhorr commands" is one of the darkest I ever have in Shakespeare's film. But at the end of the movie I grew tired of the style and the final hornpipe dance was just too much. In general, this is an interesting interpretation.
