The worst movie ever? ALL !!! This is one of the best animation films I've ever seen! It has performances from all the big characters of the animated TV series Rainbow Brite. Very safe for toddlers and colors grab their attention like no other! There's an evil princess trying to steal a diamond on the planet Spectra, which in turn would cause all life on Earth. It tells how Rainbow Brite and his new friend Krys can stop the princess's evil plot and restore life and color back to Earth. It's a proof that kids can make a difference! Rainbow Brite lives forever.
