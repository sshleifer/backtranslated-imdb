It's a kind of unknown and forgotten movie that dreams of watching old videos. It is an excellent comic book with a wonderfully funny lettering placed in a marvelous array of characters, a wonderfully invented and funny musical score and a funny, light direction by Montgomery itself. This is one that you look more and more. Montgomery is a little partial actor who finds himself in the division of his military reserve to get into the home of young debutants to discover his former beau, a suspect gem of power. Although the assumption is rather unpleasant, the results are fun. Montgomery is an invaded plant, Ann Blyth is admiring, like a romantic obsession, a terribly serious debut and a comic book parade from veteran director Jane Cow, as a lawyer for her mother Lillian Randolph's keychain - all is fabulous. <br /> Strangely enough, it only earned the Oscar nomination sound when it deserves the direction, the scenario, and the top of the musical score. <br /> <br /> DON'T take it - this is one of Hollywood's best.
