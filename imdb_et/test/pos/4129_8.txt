The film has taken little pictures to play fast and rid of the facts. But it puts you close in time and in a place that no longer exists when you get the * feeling *. <br /> <br /> As Keith Richards noted Paul McCartney in the movie Holly, almost Buddy Holly almost all the stone has been made since his day. The tragedy that took her is treated gently and the rest of the film restores an excellent musical career and a joyful music body. <br /> <br /> Gary Busey presents a remarkable, energetic image of Holly, and her performances suggest she really gets into music. Like a long time Holly fan and rock, so do me.
