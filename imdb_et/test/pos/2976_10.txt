I saw this movie when it was first released and enjoyed it thoroughly. What a movie. I am now in my 40s and I have 2 teenage children and I would like them to see this movie. I recommend it to anyone who loves romance movie or older Elton John music. <br /> <br /> I've been looking for most of the stores that sell both new and old movies, but haven't been in touch. <br /> <br /> I bought some old movies in Hong Kong, such as "Melody", who had a pretty old movie collection, but they didn't. <br /> <br /> I look at the sequel, Paul & Michelle. <br /> <br /> Can anyone tell me how to get a copy of VHS or DVD or VCD. <br /> <br /> I really appreciate it. <br /> <br /> Thank you very much.
