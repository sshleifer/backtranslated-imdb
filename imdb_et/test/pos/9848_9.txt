I mention that there may be a spoiler here to be careful because I am not saying that I give something important. Not all "surprises" are the success of this movie or the viewer's ability to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Although it does not contain very minor mistakes, it is a beautiful and very moving film about friendship, time, insecurity and the choices people make about their lives. At the same time, it is also a very humorous film with small, mostly underestimated comedies that have been knit together. For the majority of the film, it is moving at a relatively peaceful pace, but it doesn't seem to be slow at all, because the film draws one and its characters into life, and in the beginning it's mostly quite light. Some have commented that much of the film seems to be slow, but a wonderful depiction of the life of such a sympathetic character can be almost endlessly viewed. During advancement, the film becomes more emotional and moves to the end, and progress is treated wonderfully. Finally, some characters decide to rob the bank and, although it may be somewhat difficult to believe, it is next to the point. This is a great addition to emphasize the love that these friends have for each other, while emphasizing humor and adding a little more irony to the film. And though barely original, to get a lot of old men, robbing banks, context and details are quite original and do it perfectly, making it really funny, such as when Ism (if I remember correctly) moves his aggressiveness to "hide" she's old. <br /> <br /> As I said, most of the second comedy is quite low-key but still very humorous, so I had to laugh constantly. <br /> <br /> Participants are probably the real key to this movie. They carry symbols with deep personality and compassion, and represent them very carefully and warmly. Character personalities that are pulled out smoothly and beautifully have some minor changes or small details. Of course, the film speaks about the characters of these great characters and how they communicate and interact with one another. It works so well, because if fewer players had roles the film could have failed. <br /> <br /> Gule Gule is not without sorrow, it just offers all the emotions and gives you a more powerful experience. In fact, the film is so moving and full of love for such rich characters that it is finally a very warm, satisfying and even happy film, despite its sadness. I can watch it over and over again.
