I have to say that some of the other readings of this movie that I read show very little or in the original TV series. His father's army was sitcom and therefore he had humor and so he smiled in an awful situation. At the same time, the series was accompanied by a lot of serious messages, such as the "Branded" episode of confessions and ignorance associated with conscientious objections. The film was loyal to the series and just like an extended episode. So I'm afraid the reviewer, who claimed that Columbia had improved humor, was pretty wrong, and let's face it - all that came out of America was BBC sitcoms of that time. Comments on propaganda were also not mentioned. Homeguard were people who were considered to be the forerunners who wanted to serve. They were very brave men who knew they were sentenced to death as soon as they were registered, when Hitler announced that anyone who did it would be executed when Britain had invaded. Thank you for allowing me to set a record high because it is always good to actually talk and comment on what you have seen, rather than build it when you go.
