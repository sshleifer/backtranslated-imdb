"L'Auberge Espagnole" collected the audience wherever it was shown. It gathered awards from many film festivals around the world. And it's not strange. We have the ability to look at joyful and amazing art. And of course it's smart. "L'Auberge Espagnole" is a very funny comedy about youth and growing. But most importantly, it is about lights and shadows living in the European Union. <br /> <br /> The main character of the film is French economist Xavier. For his future carrier, he will be sent to Barcelona for one year. In Spain it turns out that lectures are given in Catalan. This is unlikely to help increase knowledge. But it helps to strengthen the relationship with the foreign exchange student group. Especially when they rent with a large apartment. There are 3 girls: English, Belgian and Spanish, and three boys: German, Danish and Italian. Our French man gets there. The year is a very long time. Enough to get close and make friends. And look at some of Europe's stereotypes, trying to separate them. <br /> <br /> Klapisch treats this special case with the process of European unification with humor and without pecky didactism. He comes out of the idea that young people are the same everywhere. They love jokes. They want to make irresponsible relationships. But they will not forget their aspirations. The most interesting is the amount of experience of this small community. They live with everyday tasks that fight the surrounding reality. They are full of unusual ideas for life. Young Europeans come back to their countries to start an adult life. These are the hopes of Europe to fight the many problems of the Union. For example, a scary management system. Finally, they prove that they can not only communicate or make friends despite many differences. But now they also live a full life. And they do not allow this life to be filled.
