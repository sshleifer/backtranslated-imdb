Forwarding news {dir. James L. Brooks, 1987} <br /> <br /> **** / **** <br /> <br /> Although it has no emotional message about Brooks's debut feature, it is the ultimate movie with exceptional performances from all from three blanks and a script that looks like a true and well-researched as a powerful news report. Be it known, it is a characteristic film and especially satire. In my opinion, it will succeed on both levels on its own terms. Movie characters are surprising in depth and dimension, while satire remains bunny and never bitter. Network comparisons are unnecessary because films have two completely different goals and attitudes. Although it is also a great movie, the network is cynical and tired of work; in other words, the state of this mad hell and television. The satire style of the network feels more extreme and guerrilla. On the other hand, the characters that spread the news rooms love and live for their work (sometimes to the detriment of their love life). They will be delighted with the stress and satisfaction of presenting news, as the audience will be able to enjoy this sweet and romanticly realistic masterpiece.
