Finally, I saw LAURE and I have to say I enjoyed it equally and it was terrible. What's nice is the atmosphere, music, location, cinema and beautiful cast. The story isn't sure, but it's not really important with these movies. The speed and speed of settings are exotic. The film has that much. Unfortunately, it also has some things against it. The first thing is that proud Annie Belle and beautiful Al Cliver are not at all chemistry. Since both play a pair and are almost on the screen in the length of the movie, the lack of these two chemistry is a definite responsibility. According to IMDb, Al and Annie were real couples in filming the film. They definitely keep their attractiveness to each other on the screen. <br /> <br /> Another problem with LAURE is that some sexual scenes are simply ineffective or even ridiculous. There is one sex scene that stands out as the most striking thing I've seen with any soft porn movie: our young blonde couple picks up a helicopter pilot who happens to be a cross fabric! The pilot flies over the city to make his girlfriend (!) Hurry up and the atmosphere in the helicopter is in the air. And Al Cliver is filming everything with his 16mm camera! I'm not doing you. It's ridiculous. Later we saw that 16 mm footage was edited with moviol. Although the footage rolls, Al and Annie start out. This scene is really good, but the images on the screen behind them were sometimes too much. Watching the helicopter from the pilot chamber, the helicopter slipped almost to the floor. Should it be erotic or credible in any way? The last thing I want to see is a woman who enjoys a drag-and-drop, definitely when a drag-out man makes such a ugly woman by copying a helicopter, not less. Al and Annie, who got it, were cool, just like all the music. I just want the footage on the editing screen not to be so stupid. <br /> <br /> Talking about dragging, there is another dull plot point in LAURE that really pulls the movie to crawl. Guerrini and her two women. Married Threesomes are an interesting idea, but hardly any record of hot and interesting. Two women are sorta dumb and we rarely see three sexes. In fact, Orso keeps almost the whole movie, even if he is with Annie Bell. This is another small complaint about LAURE: there is nudity, but it is not as much as other movies of the same era. He just needed more skin to pull it up. <br /> <br /> Except for these small complaints and pulling queens, LAURE is really very observable. I love these soft porn movies dating back to the 1970s, when the focus was on mood and atmosphere, not on the raw materials we see today. <br /> <br /> ps: Make sure you look at Emanuelle in Egypt, which stands for Annie & Al, but also for another famous screen pair, Laura Gemser and Gabriele Tinti. Music in this movie is also great.
