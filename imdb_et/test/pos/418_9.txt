It is not your mill's police story, where characters were only secondary to arms battles and cars. So far, episodes are more realistic and intelligent. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something that has a lot of upside down Rambo-style police, you won't find it here. <br /> <br /> I gave her 9. I want this series to live long. Morse is great!
