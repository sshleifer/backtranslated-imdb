My initial title for this review was: "Stop Scams, Film Triumphs." But I was thinking about home. It is not a fairy tale for most of these films, it takes turns that are different and although its ending is disappointing, it sucks slowly and hits the core with a satisfying tone. <br /> <br /> The plot is followed by James Aaron (Curb Your Enthusiasm Jeff Garlin, who also wrote and directed) in an actor who lives in Chicago with his mother and deals with both his obesity and his inability to find someone to love. <br /> <br Yes, it sounds like a runny nose, but it tests elements that make it somewhat unpredictable, and actually makes you want longer. Finally came a sudden and I had to say, "This is!?" But when it starts to cost it, it will make you smile. <br /> <br /> He has many serious shades, but he is not afraid because it is also very funny. Some scenes offer a tremendous laugh, and those who have seen Jeff Garlin's stand-up ride know the pair (first and foremost when he speaks to his niece's kindergarten class and bombs on a career day). It starts with a somewhat serious remark that you don't expect, but the following is very funny, fun, and quite amazing. This is the kind of movie you watch and always enjoy. And as I said earlier, if the beginning may seem absurd at first, when you think about time, it is a real joy.
