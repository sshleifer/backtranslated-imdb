This is not my favorite movie with Hitchcock, although I have to admit that it is still pretty good. Among the things I really liked was the existence of Jimmy Stewart (he always fixes the most mediocre material) and the incredibly frightening assassin (who looks like a skeleton with only a thin skin layer). Although it cost a lot of money to the studio, I didn't particularly care about Doris Day's movie - she seemed to be crying a lot and waving "Que Sera" as inflatable. Yes, I know he had to sing this way, but it hates me forever. Sorry. <br /> <br /> Another complaint, albeit small, was that it was a bit "too polished" and "Hollywood-esque". The original version (also made by Hitchcock) just seemed a lot of grittier and seedier - and it added a scary atmosphere.
