This is the best film I've seen in the last 5 years. Certainly it is in the same line of masterpieces such as The Platoon, Apocalypse Now, Doors, The Dog's Heart. Really, the game of the boy and his parents is so good that you can't even say they're playing. No, they live as if they were with them. Note the smile where the main hero agrees to go with them. Hate and love in one piece. And the last scene! It is very difficult, even impossible, to combine humor and tragedy, but if you succeed (and Frederikson did), the effect would be twice as strong. <br /> <br /> I compared it to "ONE FLEW". . I like this movie (and the novel itself is good), but after Frederick's movie it seems easy. (the same difference I noticed after watching "American History X" and "ROMPER STOMPER" - the latter is deeper). I mean only Milos Forman's unique perspective. You look at it, you say yes, it's a good movie, I like it, I don't like it and that's it. But "Angels" leave you with a broad base. There are no bad and good guys in the movie. Because everyone has the right to behave as they do. Like a single patient girlfriend. Of course, she is young and pregnant, and it is a problem for her that her husband is in a clinic, but her friend's feelings and emotional experience are even stronger (her result is suicide). Why ask him what he has done? Are you not crazy to ask? Why not support him, help him, understand him? Finally, it is even funny when these people talk to each other. They say genius things! I would like to say a lot about this movie, but I'm not so good at English. But I'm sure those who have watched the movie will understand me. <br /> <br /> Good luck! <br /> <br />
