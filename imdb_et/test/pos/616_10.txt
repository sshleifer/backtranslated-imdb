I'm just gonna explore the wonderful world of Ozoni so far. I have only seen 4 movies so far, and with the last line, I was struck by the fact that everyone was actually lonely women and their actions. None of the non-lonely female characters from 12 and all of them bring a strong influence on the surrounding environment. <br /> <br /> This movie is probably the only one (four) where this effect is good. g /> <br /> The gay theme is almost a standard part of Ozon's movie background, so it doesn't speak accent (although characters can be seen). Observe the feelings, not their objects. <br /> <br /> Very nice and short, really like a summer romance, and while relaxing with thought and thought, it gives the soul some food.
