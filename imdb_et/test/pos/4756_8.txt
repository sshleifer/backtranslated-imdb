The harsh rogue team at the New York police, led by the harsh, nasty Buddy Manucci (always playing great Roy Scheider), goes into the attack ring after an attack, if one of them kills them. Philip D'Antoni, the director of "Bullet" and "French Connection", vigorously builds a strong, sharp, harshly immoral tone of nonsense, retains a steady pace and engages in operational robustness with considerable robbery. Don Ellis's despicable string result continues to pump crude oil intensity, while large Apple locations and Urs Furr's rough, grainy cinematography both dramatically increase overall grungy realism. Moreover, the fine line that distinguishes police officers from criminals becomes chilled in this picture: the title group uses harsh, brutal, and morally suspicious strong hand tactics as a means to put an end to the law enforcement and there are certainly no offenders and thieves who settle in the coveted coveted beauty of this movie suburban. Tony Lo Bianco's nice supportive performances as a worm, a slip-on Vito Lucia, Richard Lynch as a malicious psychotic hoodlum Moon, Bill Hickman as a partner with equal cold blood Bo, Jerry Leon's funky flatfoot Mingo and Joe Spinell parking. An exceptionally wild and fascinating longing for heart-throat is a highlighted car ride. Climatic shootout also offers distracting goods. A real bang-up little winner.
