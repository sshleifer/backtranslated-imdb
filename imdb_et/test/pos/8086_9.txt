Klatret © ªsen (Catch That Girl) is really a great movie! This is a "happy" movie. I watched this movie at the Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival (PiFan) on July 12, 2003. There's Action + Adventure + Comedy + Thrill + Happy + Romance (Cute Children's Triangle Love!). You have to watch this movie. :)
