This short, animated cartoon featuring Pepe Le Pew touches a cat who thinks she's solving all her problems, pretending she's a skunk. The problem is that he pulls honestly and genuinely the skunk (our hero, Pepe, entering the left) with the most unwanted attention, being decisively attentive, say, if Cat wants. Every big plan has its drawbacks, but it's a cleaner! I don't know if Jack Warner got Hays Office's call for Pepe and his adoration to be both men. After all, Betty Boop was partly responsible for the existence of a production code. The subsequent "conquests" were clearly and definitely women. A very good comic, but Pepe is a sign that works as a focal point rather than supporting. Worth a look. Recommended.
