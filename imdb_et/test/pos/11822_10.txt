Incredibly close to the real-life feelings and emotions that Joseph Mazzello has captured by the AIDS and his new neighbor's haemophilic child, Brad Renfro is the perfect full-length toy coat. While the story may seem a bit far-reaching (two boys are trying to reach the raft a few miles to find a doctor who claims to have AIDS treatment), the emotions, activities, and interactions with real life of all involved characters are tragically close. Being a "big brother" for a boy in a similar situation who died a few years after the release, I recommend this picture to anyone who has ever thought about what will happen to AIDS in a child's life. Peter Horton's great direction creates a perfect mood and place for every scene and draws the viewer into the different emotions that are affected by friendship, illness, prejudice and the victory of two friends who have struggled to overcome difficulties.
