I don't understand why everyone hates Barney. If you hate the show so much, don't look at it! Her stupid, how everyone changes "I love you" son "I hate you." If you don't like it, good. No matter, it's your opinion. But there is no point in lowering the example if it is not so bad. OK, so it's bright, and yes, it has its drawbacks, but it's a child. Children do not want to be sad and unhappy, they want to be happy. And Barney helps. And even at the exhibition, there are moments of sadness and anger, and so on. And yes, Barney uses magic. But the kids see Barney's imagination. Children need to get out to escape to express themselves. The world is an unhappy and difficult place. We all need to express ourselves and be happier. Barney does it to us. This show is great. I looked at Barney younger. Yes, some people find it stupid. But I looked at it and I'm at the top of my class. It may not necessarily make you smarter, but that is not the case. I believe Barney's idea is to provide children with children and to express the spirit of childhood. Where the imagination lives. So many teenagers are now unimaginable and are afraid to express themselves. Barney helps to encourage it. Barney helped me not to be afraid and just show myself for who I am. I'm a high school high school student, an AP student with a 4.0-year-old dramatist who loves theater and art, and a new baby cousin who loves Barney. I watch it with him and enjoy it and sing with it. Yes, its filthy and stupid and whatever, but it's great for kids. Who wants to be an adult with no time to have fun? I'm a child of heart and I love Barney. It's great for kids and for those who are kids in the heart. <br /> <br /> This is a great show for babies and toddlers. So stop hating. Say you don't like it, but stop it with "Dumbest show ever" or "Barneys bull with shell" or whatever. Keep it yourself. Take a cold color or whatever. Here's something: I didn't like Sesame Street. But you don't see me go, "Grover is a bullshit load" or "Cookie Monster should die" or whatever. I hate all BULLSS ** T people say about books or movies like Barney or Twilight. If you hate it, OK. No one cares. Don't say hate, cuz you can just offend someone.
