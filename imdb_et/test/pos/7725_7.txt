This is a nice movie with superb productions by Paz Vega and Leonardo Sbaraglia. Of course, Vicente Aranda's legend in Spanish cinema and certainly one of the biggest cinemas in Spain, but I don't think it's one of her biggest films, even if it's good. The scenario plays with the introduction of Merime√© as a character, a nice touch, but it is incredible. Music by Jose Nieto, Spanish Spanish Film Award. I mean, this movie is very good in all technical aspects. There are very good actors like Antonio Dechent, Maria Botto and others. I give it to 7 out of 10 because I think it could be a better movie, but it's not boring at all.
