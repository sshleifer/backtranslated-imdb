It was a very funny, fast paced movie. I looked at it more than once and kept my rent to show others. I would like to take this opportunity to ask somebody to know how HK manufacturers choose their subtitle translators? I'm the most curious. Please direct me. <br /> <br /> Again, to look again, this is a really hanging movie with lots of content, subtle classics, but full of gaze. Reminds me of the comedy of Cantinflas, Mexico. <br /> <br /> The film does not speak to the director's fans who have noticed that he clearly chooses Chinese subjects, rarely trying to find the qualities to be studied. The entire director's collection is a way to look at the appearance of culture. <br /> <br /> And I can't see how her funny girl could be a Chinese party.
