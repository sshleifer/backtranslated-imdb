I wanted to see this for a while: I didn't think I'd watch it in the wet Trafalgar Square, in London, where there were 15,000 people and all the new Pet Shop Boys score. <br /> <br /> Quickly, this experience is specific. The new departure from PSB seemed to be the same problem as the miniaturist Hugo Wolf had his own opera writing at Der Corregidor: the long structure was short, ie the chain of songs. PSB gave a more efficient, integrated score, although it was quite static under its conditions. They were also unable to resist the song: setting up the subtitled text worked in this respect during the massacre of Odessa steps in free-standing operation during this sequence itself, I go so far as to say it would be harmful. All in all, however, it was very exciting, which Eisenstein was certainly trying to achieve. <br /> <br /> This is a very exciting movie, the editing of which is passionate, a place for tension or action. In fact, the film breathes, although it has been beautifully shot and passionate (it has a silent movie melodrama, but not superfluous to the Hollywood comic style), carefully editing the specific frames that perceive the speed the audience takes and there are also many perspectives; whether it had many cameras or a series of ports and the cost of the steps was very high. <br /> <br /> A super movie that can be judged regardless of the sound, because the final product would have been conceived. 8/10
