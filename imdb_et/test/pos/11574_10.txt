When I first saw "Before the Night Waterfall", Javier Bardem was just a candidate for an academic award. I thought he had it! He didn't. I watched "Mar Adentro" last night. Please give him this time ... It's an actor. Convincing, touching, emotional, brilliant. See also "Los Lunes al Sol" and you understand what I'm talking about. She's an absolute chameleon and I swear it's not just a make-up job. This movie is so beautiful, so well done, the characters are so real. Congratulations to Alejandro Amen√°bar (how best would a director be appointed?). I also have to mention make-up artists. I can't think of another word, but great. I hope this film gets the recognition it deserves. I think it's already ...
