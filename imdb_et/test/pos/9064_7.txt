This film was original in a unigenous way. Although many films have dealt with suicide and mental institution issues, it was always a cure for patients and better for them because of their medical care, but in this movie we follow a depressed man who falls in love with a suicide girl and does not have anything to make him happy even though he doesn't care about the accident , he just wants to die. It was a very interesting lovely romance comedy that was nothing more than enjoyable. It's fun to see if you have the opportunity to get you open to the material. In general I give it to 6.4, I just voted 9 to get a rating higher :)
