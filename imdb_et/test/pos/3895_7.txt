I can't say that this movie was fun, but I have to have a smile all the time. I like this darker comedy; "very bad things", "8 heads in a duffel bag" or "cold blood" <br /> <br /> How the protagonist tries to get around the murderer is a great fun to watch. For me it was no surprise what the end would be, but the way it ended. Another thing that stays out is how they've got the audience involved. The way Terry looks at us is fun, you can almost pretend you're an accomplice.
