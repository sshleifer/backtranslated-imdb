Much of my childhood was spent listening to wireless, listening to Horne or Hancock for half an hour or watching Carry On movies. Probably the most famous line in the comedy "Infamy! Infamy! They're all infamous!" still makes me laugh. <br /> <br /> This is a rare understanding of the man behind the comic book, and the whole production is a logical tragedy and comedy mix until the final coronary citation is quoted by the fourth Michael Sheen. He was great in his role. Most of the other members of the Carry On team were so and their Kenneth Horne was very good, but Michael Sheen made the show and should be given some sort of prize. <br /> <br /> It left me feeling "wow". By quoting Kenneth Williams to a claw who says "life is a joke", the only answer can be "Yes, well, let's do it good."
