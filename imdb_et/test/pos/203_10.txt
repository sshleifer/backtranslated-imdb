It is not surprising that this short (91 minutes) B / W film, made 50 years ago in the Soviet Union over a short period called "gameplay" or "thaw", has achieved so much love and admiration. movie lovers around the world. It is sublime and beautifully filmed. Some scenes feel that they have been doing their time. Sergei Urusevski's camera work and creative discoveries were included in textbooks and widely imitated. The film talks about moving and timeless destruction of love, destroyed by a ruthless war, but forever in the memory of a young man. It is also a film of loyalty, of memories, of the ability to live when it seems that there is nothing to live; it is forgiveness and hope.

After leaving her loved one who went ahead, the disappearance of her family on a bombing trip and a marriage with a man she never loved and never wanted her to be, she turned to shelter, she became dead. His long journey to redeem, the ultimate acceptance of his loved one's death, and learning to live with it are exciting and heartbreaking, and simply leave no viewer indifferent. <br /> <br /> For me, the film is very personal and expensive because I was born and raised in a city where his characters lived and were so happy at first. I went across the same streets, squares and bridges across the Moscow River. Every family in the former Soviet Union had lost at least one, but often more than one family member in a fight, concentration camp or ghetto or hunger, cold, and illnesses during World War II, and my family is no exception. My mother and grandmother knew the horrors of war and never improved their losses not only from movies and books. "Cranes are flying" tell me clearly and honestly and touch me very deeply. It's a masterpiece of making a movie, but it's part of my life - my background, my memory, and my past.
