Although not "perfect", it's close. Love Barbara Stanwyck, SZ Sakall, Sidney Greenstreet, Dennis Morgan, Robert Shayne (Superman Police Chief), housekeeper, waiter in Felix restaurant, and judge ...... I can go on and on. This movie has been part of my family's holiday tradition because I was young and my kids grew up with it! "Baby's Swallowing Clock" was always my son's favorite line. <br /> <br /> Sexy Barbara Stanwyck in Trousers and Bathrobes stole the exhibition with a beautiful, funny S. Z. Sakall. Dennis Morgan also has some great songs. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie and suggest you skip the blah.
