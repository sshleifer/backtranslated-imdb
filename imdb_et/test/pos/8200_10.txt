I have read some sense of duty. These people betray their ignorance. This production just went to an amazing length to restore all the aspects of the era when the story was made. Fair behavior is something that few people see outside the court. While acting may seem very stylized, the behavior of individuals in their particular stations is actually as close as the director could create. The actor's facial expressions are admiration, especially the duplicating Marquis Changxin and the king's mother. <br /> <br /> Of course, the king, his parents and his relationship with him are both a Greek and a Shakespeare tragedy. love. The king's displacement from good to bad and the assassin from bad goodness gives much room for thinking about the evolution of the human being. This film would give a lot of thought to the Humanities College course. At the same time, it slides almost all the time, even in the slowest scenes that move toward unsuccessful pronunciation. One suspects the involvement of large parts in the troop movements that were quite awesome. This will make the Lord of the Rings scenarios darker. Few directors have the ability to literally thousands of people on the battlefield just for the sake of art. I remember one scene where at least 30,000 soldiers can be seen on a huge plain. Logistics of such shooting would have been amazing. <br /> <br /> I can continue ... but just can't recommend this movie enough.
