Everyone is enlightened Young Jewish-Americans are looking for a woman who helped her grandfather escape during Nazi persecution when he started a pan-European tour with some unlikely companions. <br /> <br /> Liev Schreiber makes his director's debut with playful angst in his acting ethos. When successful actors decide to sit under the direction of the director, we usually get a biographical look at the hinges under the working mask - Check. We usually get the wrong genre - Check. But what we usually don't get is an insightful original film that is reliable, intelligent, and touching. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood plays with a curious young man Jonathan, who collects a piece of life. She is on a mission to find a woman on a photo. The sepia image carries his grandfather (similar to him) and the woman. To assist him, he is assisted by travel guides consisting of Hip-Hop's loving dancer, Alex (Eugene Hutz), his apathetic and perma-vexed grandfather (Boris Leskin) and his dog - Sammy Davis Junior Jr. What is essentially comedy. Voice transfers are simply introduced as patronizing. Alex is especially funny because he teaches his younger brother in 1969, proving how popular he is with chicks and gambling, setting him up as Jonathan. <br /> <br /> Schreiber begins to break the characters as they progress and comedy is a deliberate veil to the story of the three people involved in the Holocaust who do not know themselves. All three are holding the film with tenderness and authenticity, which Schreiber is probably not mistaken and fascinating and fantastic when the film is, horrors that can break, ie the past is presented with almost delicate tones (casual music, cinematic art) that make them even more unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Because the unlikely group finally finds the city they are looking for, they learn to know the real fearful factors and find out who they really are. <br /> <br /> Elijah's wood is as authentic as normal, bringing the screen to its usual innocence and strength. Formally, he lives in a good friend of the Lord of the Rings and lives in the evil Sin City, where he plays Jonatan with a bomb as he is bombarded with cultural shocks and search for truth. Boris Leskin, as a grandfather, also gives his humble and disappointing young people a great sense of humor and conviction because his past is open. However, Eugene Hutz is Alex, who makes the show. A director who used this misunderstanding of old trade interpretation to create and maintain humor that is actually funny and not unpleasant. Schreiber has given an enchanting debut that has both heart and soul. Continuous score and beautiful photography create the story of identity, truth and family around the fairy tale. When filing a complaint, the speed of changing the direction of the film would be; although it might have been deliberate, it may not all fit well. However, it is a fine piece that gives a great comedy and a bond between an unlikely group, while the horrors of another world war are completely fresh. <br /> <br /> -Chi & Ojo
