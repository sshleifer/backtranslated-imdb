For a feature film, the plot closely follows the history - or at least historical rumors. But then, China, who will see this story very well, if it represents it again and again, will not tolerate it otherwise. Attention to detail is wonderful, especially for anyone who has read a Sima Qian account in a historian record. Jing Ke, according to Sima Qian, actually tried to try Qin Shi Huang's life before joining the Yani Crown Prince. Sima Qian explicitly mentions both General Fan and the card game rolled plug, as well as the toe column taker. Although Jing Ke is not a stranger to the sword competition, he is barely an invincible warrior without the imagination of Chen Kaige. Jing Ke is really the weakest link in this movie. In reality (again, according to Sima Qian), she was a heavy drinker and continued her visit to Qin as long as possible, spending a lot of time with Yani's ladies before the crown prince finally ordered him. In short, he was a man and he did not expect death, although he was willing to accept it. Chen Kaige Jing Ke fears death but not her own. He is a classic ruthless killer who made a disappointed pacifist. His love (or maybe just affection) for the woman and regret that Zheng lived in the grave (not even twenty years as claimed by hostile Confucian historians, Qin Shi Huang did, though it is a legend that he buried 460 Confucians in their neck and then theirs) peeling) is enough to kill this former assassin. Melodram is not convincing and the character is just pure. Acting here is not dirty, though because of its nature it is not very interesting. As for Lady Zhou, all the stories I have heard about Qin Shi Huang have never come. Anyway, Gong Li is famous enough for the Americans to have heard of him (thanks to Zhang Yimoule) and there was a need to have a love interest, so here he is. It's unfortunate that his performance is almost as pure as Jing Ke's character. He has done much better results (such as Qiu Ju) to be subtle; here he just bothered to attend. But all this is trivial compared to Li Xuejia as Zheng's extraordinary activity. Qin Shi Huang is, for China, what Milton's devil has approved for us: it has been adopted as a cable, but superb. Qin Shi Huang's achievements radiate astonishment over the past two thousand years into the present, and Li captures his scary will without damaging his humanity. Li's performance is sufficient, but the film's scope is great, although photography is deliberately drab. She feels old. The result is sufficient, hardly moving, although it is suitable for the action. Although I have only seen it once, I believe Chen Kaige should be given more credits to work with the camera than other reviewers have promised. Opening credits are inspiring. When five stars are absolutely average, I gave Li Xuejia's actor and Chen Kaige three more actors, writers and directors.
