The VHS cover says everything: "Undoubtedly, the most powerful film is from Texas Chainsaw Massacre". I'm a big fan of 70s and 80s slashers and I have to say I'm 100% willing. The characters are plausible, the actors have a great charm (especially George Kennedy as a forest ranger). There is a twisted atmosphere that only TCM has an amazing sound that reflects the emotions and shooting places that are the most beautiful in the horror history. It must be one of the most beautiful hits ever! Jeff Lieberman is the director and superb director of this 1981 low budget film, and with his other works (Blue Sunshine, Wrong Turn) he must be one of the underrated directors of film production today.
