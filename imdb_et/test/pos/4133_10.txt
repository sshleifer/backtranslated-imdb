Gary Busey did a great job playing rock-n-roll legend Buddy Holly (1936-59). He has a spit on the man. In the 50s, the garage class is definitely different from today's. The three groups are usually easy these days. I bet Buddy Holly (Busey) was a much better musician than most of what I heard. As he lived in Lubbock, Texas, it was just a quiet town. His parents were Christians, although his mother was a strong supporter of his son's work. That's one of the reasons he didn't act like Elvis. He stuck with his more solid ways. It makes her good! When he went to Tennessee, he saw how bad the producers were. They hated the rock-n-role that changed Holly for a long time. Wearing a different atmosphere was a challenge for Holly and her friends. She could bring Sam Cooke, went to the famous Apollos, which was accepted by all-African-American audiences, and I liked it! And Sam Cooke made Holly and his band a certain service. That's what I call tolerance. It is sad that Ritchie Valens and J.P. "The Big Bopper" Richardson in 1959 had a short music lesson because of a crash, at least their memories live in our hearts. I don't know what the inaccuracies in the movie were, I care that Buddy Holly won at this time music and politics obstacles and the music is almost perfect. For Gary Busey, he was perfect and also made music. GOD bless you out! 5 Stars!
