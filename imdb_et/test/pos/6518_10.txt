Wonderful family film that should be the main one at Christmas. It's a mystery to me why it's not. The real lost movie I first encountered in the old 19-inch black and white RCA when the Million Dollar Movie was still in fashion on New York 9th Channel. This Rudolph Mate-staged fantasy should be hidden under the Christmas tree of everyone But it is never published in the home video, too bad. I believe I saw it in the AMC some years ago before they cut a lot of their older movies from rotation. Easter or Christmas Eve Every movie Santa, aunt Bee, hostess Cupcake Lady and an actor whose first name is King, can't be bad, Ann Blyth as "Sally" is the energy package. He attacks the chapel to ask St. Ann would help and guide her mixed and financially strapped family, so she would stop in her bedroom in St. Anni's shape. At one point, the entire O'Moyne residence will move to another address between a neighbour's dispute between O'Moyne and a neighboring dirty man. Blyth is a button like cute. Edmund Gwen is able to play the grandfather of sleep. All in one, it's a satisfying movie experience.
