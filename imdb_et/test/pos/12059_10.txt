I have not seen this funny show fox for a long time and waiting was worth it. The children of the exhibition have something I get for every episode and even my father is sitting and watching it. This is an exhibition that is not meant for children of all ages. It's like still, but to the next level. Everything everyone says is what everyone says and what everyone does. It says things we all think, but in a well-rounded way. For the first time I saw an exhibition that I couldn't believe it was a fox, and that he was allowed to stay in the air after some episode, from Hilary's boyfriend's choice to Kenny's boyfriend, is worth it.
