The 1970s is often considered the golden age of British television comedy, which saw so many classic sitcome as well as schematic exhibitions, such as "Monty Python's Flying Circus". However, the period was not the golden age of British film comedy, and what worked well on television rarely exceeded the big screen. The most triumphant exceptions to this rule were the Pythons, but their best films ("Monty Python and Holy Grail" and "Brian Life") were very different in their TV shows. <br /> <br /> The main problem with home theater is that the BBC's 30-minute slots (25 minutes in ITV, which must find space for ads) do not always work well if they are expanded to three or four times. Few people remember saying "Up to Pompeii!" or "Steptoe and Son" with the same affection as television versions. For many of the classic TV shows ("Some Mothers Make" Ave "Em", "Yes, Minister", "Fawlty Towers", "The Goodies"), they were not trying to film them at all, for which we are grateful. Characters such as Michael Crawford's Frank Spencer or John Cleese Basil Fawlty can be half an hour of fun, but I doubt they will be so funny in two hours. One comedy program (although the drama of the comic novel, not in the normal sense of the sitcom) that might have worked in the cinema, was "the fall and rise of Reginald Perrin," but any hopes of the film were tragically interrupted by the death of his star Leonard Rossiter. "Father's Army" was one of the few TVs in the period that became a decent film. (Only the rest I think was "Porridge"). This was probably because it had an unusually large number of well-known characters and was derived from the interaction between most humorous people. The original sitcom ran between 1968 and 1977 and talked about the wrong places of the Home Guard attack in the small seaside town of Walmington-on-Sea. (The home guard, originally known as local defense volunteers, was an auxiliary service during the Second World War, which was mostly men who were too old to serve on regular forces). The movie version is a triple drama. Law I deals with the formation of a group and the recruitment of its members. In Law II they destroy destruction during the training of the army. In Law III, they succeed in catching a group of Nazi airliners whose plane has been shot down. <br /> <br /> The three main players in this drama are the group leader, Captain George Mainwaring (Arthur Lowe) and his two subordinates, Arthur Wilson (John Le Mesurier) and Corporal Jack Jones (Clive Dunn). Mainwaring, who is the head of a local bank in civilian life, is a terrible little person who picks the world through a pair of thick glasses. This is the one who starts with setting up a home security unit and who calls himself a commander. He is pompous, passionate, exaggerated with his own importance and his leadership ability, a man of the kind who does not suffer with fools. (And in George Mainwaring's worldview, the term "fool" covers most of the rest of the human race). However, it has good qualities. He is motivated by true patriotic idealism and is capable of the great physical courage shown in his meeting with the Germans. <br /> <br /> Wilson is Deputy Prime Minister of the Bank. Two men are very different in nature, which is emphasized by appearance, Wilson is long and thin, while Mainwaring is short and stout. He is both more intelligent and better educated than his boss. (His accent shows that he may be a former public schoolboy). Nevertheless, he has been able to play another violin in both civil and military life, probably because he has a sort of passive personality that leads to pessimism and defeatism and inability to take anything seriously. Jones is an old soldier who is now running a local butcher shop. (His promotion to the corps is mainly due to his ability to bribe black sausages). His enthusiasm for his new role is only suited to his incompetence and the ability to cause chaos. Although his vocabulary is "Don't panic!" he has a tendency to panic at every opportunity. <br /> <br /> Several other members of the group are highlighted. The Scottish private company Fraser is even more pessimistic than Wilson. (Catchphrase: "We are doomed, man, DOOMED!"). Private Godfrey is a gentle old man whose main concern is the location of the nearest toilet. Private Walker is a sharp Cockney Spiv and Private Pike (another bank employee) spoiled mummy boy. (Pike's mother is Wilson's mistress, though Wilson tries to keep that contact from the illegal Mainwaring). Two important outsiders are the light-deformed Vicar and the ARP guard, the mainwaring arrested enemy, and quite his equal to the splendor and authority. <br /> <br /> There are sometimes twin participants in the quarrel ("Hold your hands on my private" - Mainwaring probably refers to those soldiers who hold that rank), more than on television, which was surprisingly free from the innocent. (Its creators, David Croft and Jimmy Perry, later began to create comedy events like "Have you earned?" And "Hi-de-hi", which were known for their notorious humor, but still retain a lot of gentle spirit, nostalgia and sharp character a mix that made the TV series so successful
