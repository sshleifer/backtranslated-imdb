One of the biggest films of the 1980s, Dirty Dancing, was a low-budget movie with a big budget. The soundtrack that makes you rise and dance, the story of love we all want us to live in (at least if you are a woman) is the movie you want to watch over and over again. <br /> <br /> The music that is filming is booming and flowing well with the emotions drawn from the viewer. Classical 60's hits such as Otis Redding's "Love Man" and Frankie Vall's "Big Girls Don't Cry" make pure 80's hits like Eric Carmen's "Hungry Eyes" and Frank Zappacosta "Overload" on Dirty Dancing. Fun and sensual, which shows that the young girl has turned from a shy teen to a flourishing female woman, just from the beautiful background of summer romance that we all hope and want. </p> <p> </p> Dirty Dancing must not be forgotten. Cynthia Rhodes stands out as Penny as a dancer, who could also challenge the most fluid and inferior gymnasts. Patrick Swayze is doing more than a fantastic job and showing more and more skills, not only an actor, but also a dancer and a singer, and Jennifer Gray looks like a baby, while her transformation in dance also represents a change in her status. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, Dirty Dancing is one of the best films of all time and it is worth looking at at least It is doubtful that Ronette's "Be My Baby" first hits in the opening title will not turn your attention or pull you into the magical world of sensual dance and musical enchantment.
