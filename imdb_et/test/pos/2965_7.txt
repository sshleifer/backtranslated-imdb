To summarize this story in a few sentences: Teenager (Amy) uses her hot body and "supposed" virginity to attract a young troubled man (Matt) with a possible football scholarship to give him a "full ride" out of town. Come to find out that he has a good reputation and has slept with many footballers in the hope that they will offer him the same deal. Both children have come from troubling and disturbing homes. Matt's mothers as an alcoholic who repeatedly shamed him before his friends and Amy's mother had a bad reputation and became pregnant with Amy at a young age. Matt loves Amy and tries to straighten her life for her. Very predictable end. An actress playing "Amy" is actually 33 years old, trying to play a teenager!
