Foolishly beautiful. This film represents the genre of the film "so bad is good". <br /> <br /> Only two talents are Richard Boone and Joan van Ark and only Boone is good. It's a little sad that a man who rose to fame as Paladin should end up with this ugly celluloid splint. Though she turns to fantastic performance, I couldn't feel that she was all her colleagues so broad that she shouldn't even have been there. ridiculous but fun. The idea that the dinosaur is buried on the cave wall and unexpectedly alive is the gold of the B-film. When the triceratops are killed, see how it falls. It is clear that the costume performer's costume is the best time. He falls to the ground before the dinosaur's back follows the suit. <br /> <br /> Speaking of "suits," there is nothing good to say about this purple tyrant. It seems to have some sort of stealth technology, because Bunta (known as the world's best observer) does not notice it twice before it is in his bite range. I don't know how all the prints are, but in my own version, Tyranno's roar contains the trademark of Godzilla. I love these and especially the bad monster movies, so I think it's the pearl of my collection. If bad movies are your thing, be sure to get it.
