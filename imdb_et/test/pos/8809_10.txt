If you "have been there" and "done it", you love this movie. I have "there" and I mean underground clubs and house events where it is much less common to find people who are just drunk when looking for people side by side, speed or LSD. <br /> <br /> "This" means dancing and sweating like mad for eight hours or so, even with a brake, followed by a road for a long morning where you can't forget and almost want to die, followed by a week to wait for it next weekend to do all this again. <br /> <br /> So while this movie is now one of my absolute favorites, I can definitely understand why some people, or most people, wouldn't even like it.
