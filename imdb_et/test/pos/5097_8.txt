"Goodbye, Mr. Chips" is a musical version of the classic 1939 film that is perfectly written and photographed. In addition to Peter O'Toole's superbly controlled and undervalued game as a pedantic schoolmaster who finds love and has changed with it, the film contains hundreds of stunning visions, ranging from Greek ruins to London's side streets to a wider landscape. Leslie Bricusse's music and lyrics have been criticized as dull or non-par-par for film music, but are used to improve the story rather than say it. Many songs have been used to emphasize assemblies or scenes; those few who have not been calculated for "show biz" numbers. In this way, the songs don't let this delicate story, but raise what the characters think or feel. "Where's my childhood going?", "Walking the World" and "You and Me" are especially effective. A absorbing, brilliant, directed and written film.
