I like this movie from everyone else. It's "multilayered"; is so much to see and appreciate. Each viewing will give you a new track, plot and character recognition. When you take the time to view and evaluate it, it worked flawlessly and extremely enjoyably. I love interaction between players; subtle relationships; period atmosphere. Ralph Fiennes is a perfectly cast lover and Geoffrey, whom the accused spouse is beautifully under Colin Firth. The scene of a sand storm, where Catherine & El-masy talks about different types of sand forms, is one of the highlights of the film and where things really start. Another relationship between Hanna & El-masy is another "layer" of the film that is completely enchanting (and heart-shaped). Winner of so many awards.
