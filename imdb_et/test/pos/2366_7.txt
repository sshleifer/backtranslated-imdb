This movie is great! As a fan of "Comic Strip Presents ..." I just knew I loved this movie. And love it I do. Finally, I got a copy of this movie early this year. But I was annoyed that it was cut! So I look at the original version of the original car sales. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is about Dennis Carter (Adrian Edmondson) who is trying to impress his girlfriend (Dawn French), claiming to be a drug dealer. But Dennis has heard a high night in the pub and nicked! So Dennis turns into a superhero, but the trouble is that he knows nothing and starts to lie and dig himself into a deeper hole! The irony of all this irony is that there is a drug smuggling in Devon. <br /> <br /> This movie is not as funny as I expected, but it is still a really good movie with some good laughs and a great soundtrack. It's also the best scene in the British movie (Robbie Coltrane's Walk across Pieri, which is Frankie Goes To Hollywood's Two Tribes. <br /> <br /> So if you're the fan of The Comic Strip Presents. .. ", any cast member or British comedy fan, look at this ASAP!
