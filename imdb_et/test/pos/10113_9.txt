This movie was great, great and overall was a great story. Ive had the real experience of a boy like "Radio". Every year, my town's football program had a boy with a mental challenge to train, ride and have fun with the football team. This movie is really true and I can identify with it 100%. A boy like "Radio" just has to feel they belong to something; they must feel that their lives are worthwhile. The way the "radio" feels and why this type of program is created in my high school. This is a very touching film that is very happy when it has been put on the big screen. My dad and I loved it, and I always remember it for a movie that tells a damn story about a person's goodness and goodness!
