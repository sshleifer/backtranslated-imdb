Charlie Wilson's war, based on a real story, speaks of a Texas congressman and CIA agent trying to provide financial support for Mujaheddin's hidden support in the 1980s in Afghanistan after the USSR invasion of the country. This conflict played an important role in the recent years of the Cold War between the US and the USSR. <br /> <br /> In making a movie, Charlie Wilson's war is a winner. It is well written, well-functioning and well photographed. Although most attention has been given to Tom Hanks with another great performance, I was even more impressed by Philip Seymour's Hoffman's move as CIA's operational Gust Avrakoto. The scenes of the Soviet attacks against armed villages and refugee camps are drawn into the heart. The film also provides a good scene to see what Congressmen Wilson has to ensure the funding they want. <br /> <br /> There are, however, two complaints about the film. The first is that there is a sub-block that includes a scandal study that is not well-developed and as such only has a low attention line. The second argument is that the film lacks a war context. The film makes innocent victims of Mujaheddin, and although they suffered great civilian casualties, Mujaheddin was actually a rebel who tried to overthrow the Afghan government. The government, completely ignored in the film, was not surprised to suppress the rebellion, later calling on the Soviet Union to support their efforts. The film also ignores the fact that the US was helping Mujaheddin before sending the Soviet Union to Afghanistan. The film hints at the unwanted consequences of our hidden activities - the consequences we are feeling today - but it seems that scriptwriter Aaron Sorkin and director Mike Nichols are willing to sacrifice a single narrative in a single historical context. (I haven't read the book, I don't know if George Crile made the same compromise.) Nevertheless, I enjoyed Charlie Wilson's war and recommend it. I would have preferred a film that would more accurately reflect the complexity of the situation, as Stephen Gaghan did in Syria, but the audiences were more involved with the unified narrative of Charlie Wilson's war than the ambiguities in Syria.
