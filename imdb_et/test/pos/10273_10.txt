It's just my favorite movie. The tragic romance that is intertwined with a complex mystery whose threads are all invisible until they all end at the end of a fantastic speed. Gentle shine. <br /> <br /> I would like to see more of Gilles Mimoun's work, but at least imdb hasn't done anything else. Has the high quality of this work caused another too frightening task? Has he moved (back) to some other creative activity? I certainly hope this is not his last feature, but I can't really blame him for deciding to stop his only contribution to the world of feature films.
