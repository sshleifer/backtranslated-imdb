RODANTHE night brings back two talented actors Diane Lane and Richard Geres just a nice story about a man and a woman who are hungry to have something more in their lives than they are today. Chemistry between Lane and Gere is a magical movie from the first scene until the last one is accepted. Locations, the beauty of their attractiveness to each other when they first come into contact, and the next story, and when they get to know each other with a fascinated attraction, are the real romance that is predicted by the audience. James Franco is just the right cast in another micropoll, and Lane's elegance with the beach house is a real Fall 2008 movie that will be remembered forever, like NOTEBOOK.
