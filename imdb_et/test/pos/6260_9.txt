"Shadow Magic" recovers the joy and amazement of the first movie audience. It also shows the film's ability to bring its world closer, to overcome cultural barriers and to preserve itself for future generations. Everyone who really loves the art of the film certainly enjoys this movie. Writer / director Ann Hu is a great first effort, hopefully with many movies to follow.
