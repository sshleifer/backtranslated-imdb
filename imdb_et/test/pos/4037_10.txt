Snowqueen is one of the best love stories I've ever seen: much better and deeper than Luhrman's Romeo & Julia or Spielberg's Titanic. Gerda love impresses every time his search, his battle is exceptional. Gerda becomes a strong, loving woman throughout the film. Kay is the poisoner of blind forces: temptation. This story encourages me to fight against Gerda ONLY, for love in my life, for the sake of Mr Right. Patience is one of the keywords in this movie. I cry every time I understand all the suffering of Gerda and Kay. And I wish it would end soon ... Snowqueen says, although in my life, I am deeply involved in the story and characters. At least Hans Christian Anderson and Director.
