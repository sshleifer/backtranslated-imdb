People who are reluctant to gore can find some scenes, but The Thing is far from a horror classic. The fact that extraordinary special effects are against the most modern CGI is only a small part of why this movie is rightly considered to be a masterpiece. Technically brilliant camera work and editing, great scripting and acting, one of the best openings, one of the best end, tension and paranoia that has stayed all over (countless views), great soundtrack and open for multiple reading and analogy. it is simply not enough to judge this movie in super-comparisons. Great viewing.
