There's a hell to pay for when you cross Nami Matsushima (Meiko Kaji), a female Scorpion and a dangerous robber group (.. with their sadistic boss and his equally disgusting lady) who use the prostitution ring with the iron fist, just do it. Hell is not a rage like Scorpion, and a confident detective Gondo (Mikio Narita), who is looking for revenge to hold his hand, does everything he takes (... and involves anyone who can find out his whereabouts), to catch Nami. Yumm (Yayoi Watanabe), who gives her temporary shelter, finds the yummy. Yuk has a slowed brother who suffered brain damage during work and has to take care of him (.. in annoying revelation, in connection with an incest, he also gives his sexual needs!) .. he actually keeps him in the street while working in the room! While he finds his place, Nami finds a ridiculous neighbor (.. he works as a sewer) and threatens to turn him into a public authority (.. Nami had escaped a convict who escaped from the subway to the police) when he did not give him a sexual advantage. Her husband digs a teapot with boiling water all over her face and body, resulting in death, and a prostitute clan is looking for Nami, who pays a debt that loses a very important member of her organization. This is when Katsu (Reisen Lee), a pimp lover and trustee, understands that the person responsible for the loss of their loyal member is his former prisoner, Scorpion. Feeling aggravated by injecting liquid medicine, placing it on a bird tree (!), Katsu adorns in captivity. What ultimately heats Nami's rage is looking at the death of a prostitute outside his cell, forced to be the victim of a late abortion, who is left dead. Finding a stapled scalpel (.. operating room), Nami breaks for each member of the clan who is responsible for the death of the cage and the catch. Skalpell's murders give Gondo the chance to catch Nami and he catches him in the underground sewers below town, but can he catch him or kill him? Especially when Yuki gets her help? <br /> <br /> Trust me when I say there are no affiliated directors of Shunya Ito or his filmmaking team, because FEMALE PRISONER SCORPION: BEAST STABLE is another perverse, spoiled and highly violent entry into a very fun series. Equipped with fine production values ​​and a visually stylistic talent to capture all the madness in imaginative ways, Ito pulls you right (.. or he made me) a twisted drama that always exists when Nami Matsushima is on the screen. If you have a long-term opening procedure where your anti-hero flees through crowded city streets, when the man is in his hand, the viewer needs to know what they are! The incisive subset is just odd (.. and it has fired with a soft core, with a slowed brother tending to his numbness, a cold sister with dead eyes that looked ahead!) And the entire sequence of abortion is quite difficult to sit down. However, the angle of abortion that disturbs, as it is, gives Nami the motivation to revenge. In spite of Nami's imperfect ways and his criminal nature, you would rather see him take out these cretins than vice versa. An interesting corner is Detective Gondoga. Gondo is ready to break the rules, and he will become the force of nature for anyone who stands by the capture of his mortal enemy. His fate at the end, visiting one of Nami's enemies, in an isolated cell when he looks, fits perfectly, making these movies so ridiculous, but so fun. Skalpell's murders are the assembly of slippers in various places, the protruding grains of muscle, where Nami leaves the scenes of crime very temporarily to wipe out the entire clan as a victim of bad situations. Although the film is essentially a comic book, sadness is a sadness and some signs come out without mistakes. I think many will depart from it as unrealistic as FEMALE PRISONER SCORPION: BEAST STABLE (how Nami is able to escape over and over again, achieving his revenge goals, paying back anyone who has violated him), but I looked at it as a violent act , like the 80's movies, and enjoyed it for what it was. As always, this film also includes some beautiful Asian actors and some colorful pictures. Meiko Kaji, almost always reserved / quiet, but cumbersome, bothering his enemies with violent intent, is in fine form (.. more than one), and Reisen Lee, like his crossfire, reluctant opponent, runs away from the picture as a completely disobediently abusive malicious enemy deserves psychological torture (if both are in jail, yummy torture is sweet). My favorite scene has nothing to do with the plot, but it's so wonderful that it has a dog that finds Gondo's rotten hashed hand, walking through the street, finally finding a resting place to chew it!
