Lifeforce (1985) was a Cannon-funded film directed by Tobe Hooper. This is a very interesting movie about the vampires of a couple of rooms, randomly re-used on earth during the last space shuttle mission. Steve Railsback is the only survivor of the tragedy. But really people in the film are just an exhibition of Mathilda May for nature. He's one of the hot numbers for smoking. The director was a big female vampire fan (eroticism). Miss May restores Lina Romay's title The film is beautifully photographed and directed. There are many gorefections to keep fans of genres happy. <br /> <br /> I have to give this movie a very high rating. Tobe Hooper was a man. During this time he made three interesting films for Cannon (Texas Chainsaw Massacre II and Mars invaders). If you like science fiction / horror movies, Tobe Hooper movies or Mathilda, is this movie just your alley. <br /> <br /> The Biggest Recommendation! <br /> <br /> Did I mention Mathilda May's smoking hot?
