In such a successful film it is difficult to point out any factor. All departments work in a perfect union to create the most mobile human films ever put on film. <br /> <br /> Production is a tribute to the efforts of writers, manufacturers, cast and team ensembles. Hugo Friedhofer's excellent score is just a little-known admiration, Greg Toland's exquisite but striking photography and William Wyler's incredibly effective direction, with the perfect pain to create American classics. <br /> <br /> A DVD version is a special care. What a joy to see that "the best years of our lives" have been so beautifully maintained for generations.
