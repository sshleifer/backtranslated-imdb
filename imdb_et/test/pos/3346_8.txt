This version of ALICE IN WONDERLAND is truly original. Equal porn, fairy tale and musical-comedy - this movie is definitely a strange story of adult film. <br /> <br /> Alice is a sexually naive librarian who comes after the rabbit "Wonderland". where he meets all kinds of "experienced" strangers like Mad-Hatter (who wants to pull his dong whenever possible), Humpty Dumpty (who broke his bear with his shell), Tweedledee and Tweedledum (brother / siblings -cooked) duo) and bi-sexual queen - among others. <br /> <br /> This version of ALICE IN WONDERLAND is indeed quite annoying by the standards of that time - a time when many pornos meant moody and disgusting (as noted by the "rough" sub-genre) - it is actually quite funny and strangely pleasing. This is the kind of thing you would show to your children - if not for the graphic sex. Slowly getting into "good things" ... but really fun. Oh - and some musical numbers are completely fun. If you're drinking - you have little if you're a smoker - roll a couple and give it one. 8/10
