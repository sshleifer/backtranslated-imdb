The creative team who brought us the police team and the nude weapon from it said in an interview that their network contact was told that after the first episode came, the show was canceled. In principle, there was never a chance. Typical Hollywood. The contact apparently showed the team that it was a problem with the show that the performance would be funny, the viewer would actually have to watch it; most exhibitions have been shown on television with the idea that the viewer had to go for a few minutes while enjoying food, in the bathroom, etc. <br /> <br /> The humor of the exhibition is very dry (he doesn't use laughter), and the universe where the characters live is where something can happen, regardless of logic, if it was absolutely unbelievable; so, for example, in one episode, the surgeon must blame the informant on the street for a hint of heart surgery. <br /> <br /> Those who know the Naked Gun movies must be warned that there are a number of interesting deviations between the show and the movies. Nielsen has developed a specific approach in films - that is, faced with unexpected faces. It does not happen at an exhibition where Nielsen Drebin is the center around which the whole universe rotates - nothing unexpected to him. There is also no romance or MTV parodies at the exhibition. Finally, the exhibition takes some of the risks that film avoids; In the first episode, Drebin, the "Crime Reintegration" team of murder detectives has shot one another at a number of different angles - a difficult road from ballistics. It is actually a risky sense of humor because we have to accept that police officers are perfectly normal in investigating a crime, but not for any other reason than testing. Such a thing rarely happens in movies. <br /> <br /> When viewed individually, each episode is actually more fun than any of the Naked Gun movies, as they are both more compact (more happening in less time) -frames), but still have a more peaceful pace (there's no acceleration on the stroke, as in the movies sometimes happens). There are some contradictions in the film (primarily "2" and "3") that never occur in a shorter time. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is no doubt that Naked Gun (the first film) is one of the great comedies of the theater cinema. And if you watch an episode of a TV show after an episode of a session, the dry quality of humor can prevent your tolerance. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it would be useful to have DVDs and see an episode within a couple of weeks - if laughter is, as some claim, a therapeutic value, looking at this example is good for health.
