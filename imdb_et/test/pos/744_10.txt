"Don't look in the basement" is so easy to knock, but the truth is that Brownrigg is one of Horror's actual underground letters and IMHO is considerably late. "Dont" is her undisputed masterpiece. This scummy psychodrama takes the viewer instantly into a world of such strange, divergent, claustrophobic sweating madness where you have no real idea of ​​what hell is going on. It feels strangely dirty, just dirty, because the Brownrigge world is this crazy, unwashed, buggy prison with wrinkles, obsession and all the tones of mental illness. And he uses the palette of his small budget palette to wrap his green memory around him. The whole fucking thing is just that weird. In a word, classic .... Even if you look at 'Don't' first, you have a crazy psychodrama style that stands for Brownrigg's other movies. All in all, they're not really esoteric any more - well, actually they're doing, watching Brownriggi's 'Keep My Grave Open'. Hull genius. Attach a substitute.
