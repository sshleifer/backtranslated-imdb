I lived in Romania, I was almost shocked by the very realistic layout of the scenes and the great care given by the driver to the local details. Anthony Queen's presentation is absolutely great and the rest gives her excellent work. The film does not have enough knowledge of the Eastern European context to fully enjoy it, but it is otherwise memorable with some memorable lines. the end is perhaps a bit too melodic, but in fact it is how people in this part of the world are, I believe the scenario is great because it presents the 2nd horror of WW in the most original way - neither blood nor battlefields. Still, life is broken and the smiles you get now and then throughout the movie will quickly kill the characters.
