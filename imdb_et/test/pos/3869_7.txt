Bart Genius Although not the first Simpson episode, Bart he Genius is more or less the first typical episode. There is no trick or topic that is just your typical Simpson episode setup. It always seems to me that this is a growing episode for you. There are certain elements that I don't care about, mostly blinded animation that can be forgiven. But over time I love this uniqueness story. <br /> <br /> For example, it would be very difficult for different episodes of this episode to show a variety of different episodes of real-time sit-com for a regular budget, the computer will leave Ms. Melon's class, opera and so on. My idea is that Simpsons will realize one of the greatest strengths of animation. Absence of visual limitations compared to live operations. <br /> <br /> It is also very intelligent and fresh to write. The concept is quite unique and particularly problematic. Instead of being at risk of an accident, the job was just a social isolation of Bart from his classmates who failed him (although an exploding experiment might be different ... what I think, End seems a bit unoriginal, largely because Bart, who was naked in their room to avoid Homer, there were already short pants, but Marge and Lisa for a short backwards are funny if nothing else. /> <br /> Ultimately, this is a very good episode with lots of interesting new items in the series , though not exactly perfect. <br /> <br /> Oh, and now the iconic name Kwijybo was of course released from the world.
