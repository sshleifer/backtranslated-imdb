If you are a fan of science literature and you have only seen this movie once, please PLEASE and meet yourself with another view. I just did, and I was AMAZED, how good I thought the movie was when I first saw it three years ago. For the first time, I definitely surrounded the astronomical views we deal with in this film, but generally I didn't think much of the film as a whole. It was an alien's rip-off, and I thought the description of the monster was really a case of bad science. Because they were allergic to light, I was particularly ridiculous. Based on my first review, I recently rated this movie 5. <br /> <br /> But now, as the sequel to Riddick's chronicle is on the road and the movie poster for this seems amazing, I thought I'd have to get used to Pitch Black again, so that I borrowed a video from a friend. I'm so glad I did. There's so much I thought I remembered from the first look that turned out to be wildly inaccurate. I thought most of the symbols died in the movie very early. It wasn't like that. I thought Claudia Black's character was the first to die. It wasn't like that. I thought Riddick was the only survivor. It wasn't like that. <br /> <br /> I see now that the movie works * very well. Monsters are not excessive, tiring. It's much more human drama. The main characters are tempting and capable of acting convincingly. And there are so many little details that make the Pitch Black universe united and credible, such as the lack of oxygen in the planet's atmosphere they are exposed to, and the fact that monsters have eaten everything on the planet and so they turn to each other. <br /> <br /> And I have to mention astronomical views again. I mean, we see a spacecraft passing through the tail of the comets, and spacing between the bodies. Then we come to a planet with three suns. Just as people who have lost a ship think it will become dark, the blue sun rises on the opposite horizon and everything is glowing in the blue glow. As we approach the escape, we see that the heavens are huge, the adjacent ring gas giant and in the last scene of the film we see that the ship is moving tightly over one such ring. These scenes are created with beauty, wonder and detail, and I don't think I would have seen any other SF movie that would really turn off that point. I hope we will see much more in the aftermath. <br /> <br /> Pitch Black is now rated 9 out of 10 by me. You wish!!
