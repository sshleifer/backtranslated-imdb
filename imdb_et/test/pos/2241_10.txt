This is one of the best episodes of a doctor whoever. We have cyber-men, cyber-transducer units (can scare small children) and the doctor does one of his best deeds. Bravo David Tennant. A good scene, like this movie, an exciting scene on some streets, an invasion of the Cyberman base, and the departure of the world from ours, basically a 45-minute movie. <br /> <br /> Being a part of cyber-men, it would never be disappointing. It has great power for the final. <br /> <br /> The doctor and the evil enemy (Daleks, Cybermen, Master, Sontarans, Davros, Autons or even Macra) are fighting deaths, just be careful with little kids watching it.
