I have to admit that I liked this movie and didn't find it all. It could be subtitled, three ways to view LiV Tyler. Three different men become obsessed with the same woman and tell their stories to a very different character, one man (John Goodman) telling his story about the priest (very funny Richard Jenkins). In the work of Goodman, Liv Tyler's character is the second coming of Holy, his saintly wife, Theresa. The character of Paul Riesers (who tells the story of shrinking (a great, underestimated play by Reba Mcintire) is the subject of Liv Tyler simply as a sexual fantasy. Finally, Matt Dillons speaks of twilight when he talks about his story of a foolish man played by Micheal Douglas. All three of them obsessed with narrative at the same time and all are fun, finally the movie ends up in a funny funny climax that I don't give away.
