This film pulls the previous incarnation by a mile, taking everything to the next level. As always, JackAss boys are incredibly unbelievable and I laughed at this theater harder for a long time. Like the first JackAss, it is not a film or a string of eighty minutes of tricks and worship. It is pure circus entertainment that is taken at the highest level. Basically, these guys are clowns who entertain themselves for others. And its great. Shenanigans are so small, outrageous and often disgusting that they cross the form of higher entertainment. <br /> <br /> You can't rate it with other movies in your class. And it looks like. Go and enjoy it for the pure spectrum that it is.
