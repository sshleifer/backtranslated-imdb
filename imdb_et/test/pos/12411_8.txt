This "TFTD" episode of the first title of the season, which is ironically called "Answer Me", is a pretty well made and memorable episode that ends up with a shocking twist. You have Jean Marsh, who is over the hill and washed up by actress L.A, who moved to New York to listen and lives in an old friend's apartment. Strangely, every night, the clock with the clock in the neighboring clock wakes awake, but strangely enough, the dwelling where the phone rings is free because the guests have died for years. Finally, he has to give only what he should have followed and did not answer the phone at home because it is bad to turn on the phone! Generally, a good episode is strange, although supernatural phones are still tense and it ends well.
