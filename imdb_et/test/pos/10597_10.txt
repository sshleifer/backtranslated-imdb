Haggard does not even have to categorize, as it is never intended to be categorized as Oscar-winning films and was never intended to win the (apparently) Oscar. when you look at some of the things Bam and Bran tried, like fast-moving shots, it comes as a movie that is more than just cky or jackass (though they're cool). For the sake of pure enjoyment I will definitely give this film 10; almost every scene made me laugh until my parties were injured, like the falcone track movie. If you haven't seen it, look at it and then buy it. Personally, my favorite brandon (falcone) is just as smooth and natural and casual that his fun, free styles are great (with action forms) and make more fun diamond mountain bikes? Haggard is definitely a film that rivals only in general humor by the anarchy and the Napoleon dynamite.
