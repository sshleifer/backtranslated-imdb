Thing is a milestone in film making and remains one of my favorite films of all time. Despite the roots of the film in the scientific literature, it is ultimately a horror film that balances the splatter of psychological trauma. Today, more than twenty-five years after its publication, the special effects are an example only of the brilliance and effects that a person Rob Bottin suffers for his art. It would be impossible to do the same movie today if the studio would definitely demand a female or Paul-Walker type casting. <br /> <br /> The American men's team in Antarctica is thrown into confusion when a stranger is able to absorb and imitate other life forms, penetrating their camp. Their confidence in each other is continually crumbling as they become more and more uncertain who is real and who is imitation, and this “body-snatcher” scenario sees their number constantly shrinking one by one, they fall victim to Thing. If it is at an angle, it becomes a different horrible creature, metamorphosis is always terrible and convincing. The despair of desperation, isolation and claustrophobia, who are unable to get out of their situation, and in no way aid in reaching them, are expertly sustainable. The long hours of darkness and the snowfall of the installation provide a dark background to the terror that arises. Director John Carpenter carefully selected a team of spectacular actors, and each team member fits perfectly into what they play, be it a young and a street player, an elderly and a clever doctor or a bitter and cynical helicopter pilot. The thing is that nobody here comes to more than American bad superheroes who have blonde locks and six packs and the true strength of the movie is not due to this harsh realism. The people on the screen are recognizable in our daily lives. <br /> <br /> Thing remains a constant enjoyment and also affects after repeated viewing. I've seen the movie on more than twenty separate occasions and my astonishment with quality, acting and special effects is steadfast. My girlfriend prefers the film's high school spin-off - a faculty that is good and secure entertainment, but which is much lighter and poorer. He still loves and recognizes Thing's shine and thanks for that ... because I couldn't stay with that person who didn't love that movie. <br /> <br /> Classic and some.
