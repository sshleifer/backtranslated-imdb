I put it in bed, shaking through the channels ... and boy I have channels ... 500 of them. With more than 70 movie channels, I'm likely to watch cable, movie once or twice a month ... DVD has attracted me. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I slip through and I came to this movie and because I see Natilie Portman. 110 minutes later I am still interested. How was that? When I saw this movie in the theater, I remember it. I've never thought I'd look at it ... nevermind like this. <br /> <br /> The story is based on a book and you can say it. The film is very episodic, the gift does not like when the film has a large plot, it sucks you in. Maybe his performances that do it. I'm pretty sure it must have been. <br /> <br /> This movie wasn't good for any reason ... <br /> <br /> Peter's movie rating (10): 7
