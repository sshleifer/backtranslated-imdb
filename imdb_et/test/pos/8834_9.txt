Obviously, the answers given here have been written many years after the release of the film and cannot be taken in context. In 1980, after the workforce in England, this film was funny. We were happy to laugh and Rising Damp, whose sympathetic look at the full social layer, was one of the best British ages, if ever. It hit the chord in almost every real and true British way, laughing at Rigsby. There was no such humor in America because self-harm was not fun for our overseas relatives. Leonard Rossiter was one of England's best actors on stage, on television and in movies. His dedication and professionalism were second. Richard Beckinsale, though young, is a perfect comic strip for Rossiter and should be considered to be great at all times. If he were not so young, then I am sure he would be the British greatest comedy actor now. Frances De la Tour found her best television moment with Rising Dampis, and for me she didn't definitely have the ability to do additional roles. If you didn't see the movie when you released the movie, you don't have the right to comment, just because you don't understand why it was funny, the humor of the moment.
