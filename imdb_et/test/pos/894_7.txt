You know you're watching soft porn, how bad dubbing is bothering you. I am well damn with lips synchronization, but the mixing of sound is really too. Every time someone says something, it sounds like a narrator. In both cases, it is quite pure between French professionalism and Heavenly Camp Joe D'Amato, which carries cannibalism and what is not. Don't do it wrong, there's a fair dose, but there's always more room. Laura Gemser's stars and it's good because she's hot. It is a little pointless when you sometimes see the structure of his skeleton, but he still controls his white colleague. You can also make a cool drinking game how often it takes your set. Often. Every reason is good. Every person is good. Every location is good. One scene even includes the whole hockey team, no matter what they do in Africa. Sometimes the plot goes on and the support form is made up of some really insecure search terms, but all is enough for Laura Gemser.
