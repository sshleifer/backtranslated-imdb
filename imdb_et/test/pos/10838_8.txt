This drama apparently caused some mixing six years ago when he debuted on television - he didn't take much TV news, it went under the radar; but after I saw it, I'm not surprised that it caused confusion. Not because of its content (although it is a bit more common than regular TV feeds) - it is more related to the reactive media of that country. Anyway, this three-part series is based on the Sarah Waters book and focuses mainly on lesbians - although there is room for exploring other dark sides of sexuality. Our main character is an oyster called Nan (short Nancy) from Winchester. For her, she has an astonishing male pulling performer, Kitty Butler, after she showed her at the show and is about to take part in all of her performances - finally trying to get the performer on her eye and becoming her dresser. Kitty is offered the opportunity to play in major stages in London and after receiving good friends with Nan, she is inviting her to ride. This action gets bigger when Nan also goes on stage and the couple gets a podium ... but Kitty breaks into the heart of Nani, bringing her to London with a horrible undertones. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that my DVD collection does not contain incomplete and intelligent movies, so there was nothing in it that would have been enough to shock me. Despite being quite hugged, I have to say that I am still surprised by anyone who says this film went too far; of course there is lesbian sex and other things, but it is never exploitative or over-exploited and the film couldn't do it. The focus is always on the story; and the story is really well done. The film is about three hours in total, but if nothing is long enough to get everything over. Sarah Waters is obviously an inventive writer and the film is interesting for its duration. Action is for sure, as you would expect, but I have to admit that I found the leader actor Rachael Stirling was uncomfortable at first and hard to go on; though it will grow its role well when the movie is progressing. Fulfillment is a bit of a problem and director Geoffrey Sax is too unpleasant for me. The story also gets a little fun, which is a shame, because this film is the strongest during the dark moments (episode 2 is the three-point highest point for me). The movie doesn't really have a point - or at least not what I saw. This is not, in my opinion, important. but like Tipping Velvet tells a good story and more than surpassed my expectations. It is worth looking at people who like this stuff.
