For me, the best and most memorable films are often those that do not know anything at first sight. The American film is an excellent example of such a pearl. Looking at the TV one night, I noticed one and only good overview of the dross - luckily I went to the actual treatment. The American film is an unforgettable documentary by Mark Borchard (I believe it is a "orchard"), an extremely expressive and charismatic boy of Wisconson, who is trying to write, manage and produce "MidWestern", a sharp, low budget horror film he has been working for for years. In Mark, we discover a young man full of contrast. Her look is the classic trailer-trash stereotype - skinny, bunny-fluffy mustache, 80's heavy metal style, bubble hair, etc. But for the camera, Mark reveals an amazing spirit and understanding as he philosophies life, love, movies and the American way. When the film opens, it is unfortunately clear that the lack of Mark's discipline and vigorous drinking sabotages its creative efforts. The American film is a charming watch full of fun moments and vivid characters. Among them is Mark's lovable friend Mike Schank, a soft-spoken reformed stoner who, depending on the dependence of the scratch cards, now depends on soda pop. I really loved the American movie. It creates real empathy between the viewer and the main characters and offers fun without exploitation. I would love it to everyone.
