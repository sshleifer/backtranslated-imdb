Personally, I don't like many b / w movies, but there is something magical about this movie. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck). "Liz" writes a column on how it is "Martha Stewart" in Connecticut. Of course, he's lying. It becomes a problem when her publisher, Yardley, asks her to play a NAVY sailor at Christmas. In addition, Yardley, who is going to be alone for Christmas, calls for a Christmas party. From there, things just get crazy. <br /> <br /> As the film is placed on a New England farm, the film has a warm holiday feeling. In addition, the characters are fun. Mr. Yardley always shouts and Liz's friend Felix always punishes a catastrophe! when things go wrong. Finally, the movie ends with how the Christmas movie should end; Fun fatty man laughs and shouts: "What Christmas!" In short, no matter what age you are, you love this movie.
