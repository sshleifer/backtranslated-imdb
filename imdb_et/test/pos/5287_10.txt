Few claim that master animation director Hayao Miyazaki is one of the few who keeps this ability. <br /> <br /> (No. Too much has been focused on John Lassiter's "amazing" ability to steal other film plots. Real dolls and then praised as a genius ... but I ground.) <br /> <br /> Miyazaki has given us a movie after a movie that deals with important mature issues (usually ecologically) and has a smart script that even the most worshiped viewer, who would usually despise any animated movie, could enjoy it as much as possible. However, Miyazaki (almost) never forgets who in the public of these films is undoubtedly - children. <br /> <br /> I said I was sorry to think of this ability for another filmmaker. Where else is a movie where the three-year-old (my nephew Link) is still sitting all the time, enthusiastic, 7 years old (my niece Amber), who loves it all (and can appreciate the stars) Frankie Jonas and Noah Cyrus, 12 -year-old (my nephew Aaron) who had reviewed "of course it was good! Everything that Miyazaki-san does is good!" management and proud animation (er, this would be me) and a 58-year-old woman (mother) who could combine mother's characters (and I put myself in the older horns) and love the "brightness" of the child This is what I respect most Miyazaki -san, and he seems to speak to his audience in a completely different way than a regular filmmaker. A simple story about a little fish-girl who gets the taste of the human world and wants to join it and the friend she's doing there, the little boy's names are so ske (somewhat like "Little Mermaid"), but here's the whole level in the game. Indeed, Miyazaki's film with intense strong female characters Ponyo's mother, Soske's mother, older women in a nursing home are all real characters who have their own and very strong wills. <br /> <br /> The girl is Ponyo herself. If he decides that he likes the human world, he simply uses his will to achieve his dreams. His father tries to keep his innocent and keeps him a magical fish, but the young Ponyo knows what he wants and becomes human just by his decision. <br /> <br /> When he is with his friend Soske, whom he loves very much (though not as much as ham). Soske is asked to be the man of the house (five years old) when his mother Lisa decides that she must help the rest of the home where she works during the typhoon that Ponyo has inadvertently caused to become a human being. Frankie Jonas (yes. She's related to Jonas brothers. Can we just get past that please?) Gives perhaps the best movie as young Soske (which is good because she has the most lines). His character is also a strong will, but also very respectful and friendly character traits that you probably will not find in the child's character on this Pacific side. <br /> <br /> Finally, Ponyo's father, Fujimoto, has to cope with his daughter's decision and want to allow his stranger wife to be a human being. He hopes that Ponyo and Soske will "remember him tenderly." And again, Miyazaki BACK to allow a character to become a stereotyped "bad". Although Miyazaki has (for some reason) criticized for this, frankly, what makes her films magical and still relative. No one in real life is a bad person. All people have different gray tones. And that's what Miyazaki does to his characters. <br /> <br /> And then the animation itself. At a time when CGI would definitely have helped in making a lot of effects in this movie, especially in water, Miyazaki has decided to include NO CGI. Certainly, hand-drawn animation was digitally painted, but each of these films was hand-drawn and on the one hand I was very grateful for it. The animation of the characters was extremely fluid and there was even some lips synchronization (quite unusual for anime film). The backgrounds seemed to be painted with a pencil and had an impact on the audience. This is what animation looks like and what it should look like. <br /> <br /> Finally, I found Ponyo very enjoyable. Definitely not the best of Miyazaki (I think it is an honor for all delivery), but still a 10-star fun movie for the ENTIRE family.
