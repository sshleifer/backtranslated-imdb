probably the best way to horror movie for 5 years .. there are flat remakes, trying to get you scared (if all they do you have to walk out of the theater) and movies that just shouldn't have. but it is worth it. the only reason I didn't give it to 10 is that Paris Hilton is in it (but his death scene makes it, believe me) .. <br /> <br /> here they are. all death scenes spoilers. <br /> <br /> 1. My favorite death scene ever - Paris Hilton! Paige starts running when she finds her boyfriend Blake, who was a knife in the neck. Well, speed walking is more venerable. he thinks it's a garage with all those cars. then (one) killer cuts his ankle from below (it's all the time he has a huge metal stud) so he falls and runs and hides behind the car. The killer pulls it up and looks through the window and throws it through the window and it hits the forehead. I've never been as big as it is in my life. <br /> <br /> 2. Paige's boyfriend Blake gets a knife that is stuck on his neck, and then kills the killer (when he's on the ground) and steps toward it, pushing it beyond his throat ... then he dies. <br /> <br /> 3. Elisha cuthbert (carly) (one of the hottest chicks EVER) doesn't die for PHEW, but she can't glue her lips, hit her face and get some of her finger cut off (yes, I felt she was) 4. Carly's the twin brother also lives, but not without beating his ass and wounding his leg. <br /> <br /> 5. The best friend of Dalton falls down the stairs and then it is removed. his body is pulled out and we see his eyes flashing .. then he's covered with wax. <br /> <br /> 6. Wade (Carly's Boyfriend) gets the Achilles tendon that is hit by huge scissors and then attacked by the same scissors. he does not die, but he is covered with wax, and 2 times his skin is accidentally removed, exposing his nasty bloody meat. YUMMY. <br /> <br /> There is. Certainly, YOUR MONEY MAY.
