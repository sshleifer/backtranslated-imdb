The review includes MILD SPOILERS, but not enough to spoil the story ... <br /> <br /> I watched Nihon Chinbotsu (Japanese or Japanese drowning, depending on where you live) recently around the same name as the 1970 film was based on Sakyo Komatsu's best selling novel. This film is a pearl of Japanese film art. It seems that Japan is drowning due to the fall of the tectonic plate to the west. The Americans predict that this will happen in 40 years, but according to Dr. Tadokoro (apparently "crazy" scientist), it will happen in less than a year. The Japanese government is unconvinced, but creates a disaster evacuation plan and a new D1 team to cope with the crisis. Having traveled to China to negotiate evacuation plans, the Japanese Prime Minister was killed and sent to the panic of the Cabinet. The D1 team remains in charge of most issues and is led by the newly elected Minister of Crisis Management, Saoro Takamori (former spouse of dr. Tadokoro). He turns to Dr.Tadokoro for advice, and he plans to break astronomically huge holes under Japan. <br /> <br /> Japan should soon negotiate with different countries and persuade them to receive Japanese refugees. Soon, it seems that many countries are no longer willing to accept Japan's sudden influx in their country and the subsequent chaos (when it happens, wood, I hope that Ito Misaki is safe). he can always stay ... hee hee). The evacuation scenes are really well done, showing destructive, suffering and desperate civilians in such catastrophic times. And for many people's surface, arrogance, selfishness, bribe, bravery, cowardice ... <br /> <br /> This is a really well made film. storytelling is a solid, enthralling story and a wonderful actor. Dr.Tadokoro (played by Toyokawa Etsushi) was really doing well, depicting a divorced and often mad scientist who strikes and puts things on. His disappointment and worries were very visible and it is really good. Reiko (played by gorgeous Shibasaki Kou) was also played fairly well and has the most memorable line in the film (see it to find out) and I think he has a nice acting voice. He plays the love of Toshio Onodera (played by SMAP Tsuyoshi Kusanagi). Oh, I almost forgot that he has really long hair ~ And there is a subtle but background story of love that is well written and if there is something the Japanese really do, it's a love story ... <br /> One The thing that makes this movie interesting is the technical explanation of the events and if you are interested in geography, you really have a good time (I know I did ... hehe). I see that they went very far to make this film's theory credible and the first few graphical displays and explanations were done quite well (although you must apologize to the famous "Engrish" of Japan. <br /> <br /> OK, now about the effects (that's all) after watching the pure fear of the film, I have to say that this film has some Hollywood parameters (even better) volcanic eruptions ... massive earthquakes ... destruction ... tsunamis ... explosions ... everything done great , there is so cool at the opening, the first earthquake catches you by surprise, the mountains fall, the destruction due to the volcanic eruptions makes you light up ... to actually look at the Fuji mountain is admiration ... then you see Shibuya fall to the ground ... it's so sad! I felt like one of the best scenes was a giant tsunami scene that says rescue operations fail and people are not going to run or hope to stick to ... the scene is worth mentioning ... wonderful stuff. If you like the effects, then you love this movie. <br /> <br /> Oh ... all good movies are behind this song. Seriously cute and divine, SunMin sang seriously the addictive "Keep Holding U" is a duet with Kubota and it's just cute. I feel it really works well for the film and it shows that no matter what disasters we hit, our love and strength keep us busy. Disaster scenes are dealt with by the orchestra's music and sometimes by silence (Japanese specialty) and really give chaos a sense of destruction on the screen. Oh, and did I mention that it really is a really wide screen? Okla, this movie. Yes, I loved it and hoped to look again ... This has a lot of holes in the plot, but it's all excusable because it was just a wonderful popcorn movie. Not perfect, but really well done. I'd give this to 10 out of 10. I'm glad to say that the most expensive film in Japanese history is one of their best. If you haven't watched it, you should really be today ... it's NEEDED!
