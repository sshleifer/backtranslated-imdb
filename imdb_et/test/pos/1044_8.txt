I adore this movie from a very large household magazine, which offers its daily work, which contains detailed information about its excellent home life as a woman and mother in the beautiful home of Connecticut. The problem arises when the owner of his monthly edition requests him and the WW2 hero as guests during the Christmas holidays. Why is he worried? Because she lives in a small New York apartment, not married and has no baby - and can't eat at all! Fun (and romance) occurs when he tries to make an incredible effort to save the face / keep the magazine owner fired (played by Sydney Greenstreet). This is a delightful comedy; one that I highly recommend to classical film students !!
