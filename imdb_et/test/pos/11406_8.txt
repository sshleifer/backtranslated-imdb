People say this movie is a "typical teen horror movie" ... and it's a horror movie with a teenage girl. What are you waiting for! This is a good movie, I counted 3 real shouts in the audience when the film was and it was a very scary movie. I wasn't bored at some point in the movie and I was even at the edge of my place. The only thing that was a little bad was that it was a bit slow when it came to the real story, but it all led to why it was, where it was and why it happened. The action was good, the terrain was good and the story was good too, I hope to see "How foreign strangers 2" in a few months! Good movie!
