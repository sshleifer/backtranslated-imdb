I loved the movie. I liked Timothy Dalton and Joanne Whaley. There were many different locations in the film. I really liked Ann Hampton realizing she couldn't love Rhett. And when Scarlett and Ann, together with Ann, apologize for taking Rhett and Scarlett, he just said he wouldn't worry about taking him back. It had a great story he was talking about. You just can't compare it to GWTW. It's just so many great scenes. I love both SCARLETT AND GWTW! Of course, do not forget that you are comfortable at hand.
