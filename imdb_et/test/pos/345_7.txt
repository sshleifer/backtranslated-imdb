Reanhauer (Bill Roy) is the leader of a cult living in the desert, trying to rise to one of his people, only a heart attack! He dies on the operating table and for the sake of revenge his spirit takes on the character of the title (Jill Jacobson), who then goes on to hacking and bursting until his sisters' nurses learn what to do to trigger the demon. <br /> <br /> Although I know enough about directors' filmography to find out that it consists mainly of direct scripts, "sister Sherri" isn't really that bad. Of course, it is clear that it was a very low budget, but all I egregious about this cheese was visual effects. Operation is not as bad as one would expect. <br /> <br /> The DVD has two different versions. A lot more sexual version, which contains a lot of R&D, is the original paragraph, so such funny foolish vignettes as the victim and the interests of his love share his "strange sex" moments, including one that involves college during the lecture <! then the film is cut for the theatrical version, where horrible elements were more strongly emphasized. Some scenes are covered by adding new ones (with Stevens, the role of J.C. Wells, extended). The film's most memorable sequence in this section is the scene in the work of pain and it works quite well. This film cutting is generally more interesting; I recommend the viewer to see both of them and compare them. <br /> <br /> Both versions hit their third-quarter progress and will benefit from Bill Stage's stunning staging performance as a mad Reanhauer and a crazy climax set in the cemetery (although in fact, was filmed in Adamson's backyard!). Marilyn Joi is also worth noting, because the lovely sister who has attracted the football player turned to the patient Marcus Washington (Prentiss Molden), who has lost eyes on the car accident and who, by the way, is the key to solving the story with his knowledge of voodoo rituals. The film changes the fun of using the music of the personal collection of the composer Harry Lubins, including compositions of television series such as "One Step Beyond" and "The Outer Limits". <br /> <br /> "Nurse Sherri" (known for more alternative titles (including "Beyond the Living" and "Terror Hospital") than any other Adamson movie) is actually a fairly low-priced low-cost fare. I looked at this time. <br /> <br /> 7/10
