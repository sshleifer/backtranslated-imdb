I'm a fan of Rupert Grind who rented this movie a few months ago. I thought it was a very well written film with a great number of actors. It was fun and showed that Rupert Grint could play more than his best-known Ron Weasley character. His exquisite imagination of Ben and all the other great actors made this movie very pleasant. <br /> <br /> Ben, a very shy boy with an extremely religious and sensitive mother, is looking for a job. He finds one and gets, I think, you could call Evie, who is a retired actress. At first it is just a way to make money. But after a while, he and Evie seem to develop friendship. Evie helps Ben get out of his shell a little and he can be fun and be happy with himself and eventually both seem to need each other. <br /> <br /> Whether you're a fan of Rupert Grind or not, this movie is really fun and some very cute and moments. I recommend it to anyone who wants to see a big movie with big and talented participants.
