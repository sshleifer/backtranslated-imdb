I enjoyed the movie's wooden camera very much. I think it is a bit affected by the Brazilian film "The City of God", but maybe it is a parallel between two tracks that can be traced (crime and art) in the social neighborhood. <br /> <br /> I think Madiba's movies are really beautiful. I do not think it is unrealistic to have such good movies because there are many artists who have no education and can be truly genius. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the soundtrack very much. It is customized for images. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie ... it's good to show you how life can be in a social neighborhood.
