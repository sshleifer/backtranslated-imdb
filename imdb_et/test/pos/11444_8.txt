I first saw the "demons night 2" before I saw the "demons night". Unfortunately, my old Blockbuster thought the sequel was a good idea, but not the first. Looney, right? Now, I think all the horror fans need this movie. It's like McDonald's, you know it's bad for you and you want cheese cheeses (or any preferred restaurant), but you can't help but just want cheap stuff. <br /> <br /> The night of demons is all: your innocent, sexy, the rules chicka-dee, your symbolic black boy, that is surprisingly not killed. You're a slutty girl, you're a lousy man, you're a dark girl or boy, buggy, shimmering house shimmering settings, bad behavior, and lots of unnecessary nudity. Isn't that the thing? I know I feel deeply deep in the movies that it was pretty bad, but it was good for the movie. Horror fans should enjoy and dig! <br /> <br /> 8/10
