It is basically a goofball comedy that has a somewhat strange momentum because of some dramatic elements. For Michael J. Fox and Paul Reuben, it was their first film (Fox had previously been in a short TV series and TV movie). <br /> <br /> As the film is basically a racing / robbery type movie, like "Cannonball Run", "It's a mad mad mad world" or recently "Rat Race", there are no major signs. Instead, there are groups of characters that divide the time on the screen and allow tons of thumbnails. Typically, such films are the way to put the maximum number of stars (or half-stars) on the film onto the film. <br /> <br /> It has teams, one of which is the main team to which Fox belongs, who are the only characters to develop. Their plot is a more stereotyped Disney affiar, a college boy who doesn't pay attention to his younger brother, whom he thinks like a lazy punk. Because they are forced into a team together with their older brother's girlfriend, they are forced to work together. Since it is the main plot, it gets the most screen time. <br /> <br /> Some other stupid plots stand out. The blue team is about an overweight rich boy whose father wants him and his innocent friends to get out of the house. Finally, they arrive in a cool, customized car with a computer on board (1980) to instantly solve puzzles and play video games with the recorded time! One member, Stephen Furst, played dr. Axelrodi's "St. Elsewhere", and later was "Babylon 5". I also admit that I still laugh when Barf, trying to loosen the word a'la Scrabble, appears, "Fagabefe?" It's much more fun than Bart Simpson's "Qwyjibo", in my opinion. <br /> <br /> The other three teams have plots that are somewhat related. The Green Team is a bunch of boys with mostly beer jokes running into one division when the yacht leads to Pabst Blue Ribbon Brewery. They have the opportunity to harass the red team, with two feminists and two fun loving twins. The team of white nerds is led by Eddie Deezen, who was previously "Grease" but played a critical computer game in "Wargames" and later in Tim Conway's communications clip in some "Dorfi" series. <br /> When you grew up in the 80s, the film has some classic moments that bring back memories. The early video game that was back when they were cool is always in my opinion a plus. Look for Paul Reubens and his quarter-firearms. There is also a miniature golf course and a roulette disco. <br /> <br /> Film is really a family movie just because contempt is almost non-existent and little sexual humor is completely innocent. The strange pace of the yellow team cheesy's dramatic moments puts the parents to sleep while their children can walk through the giant melons in Fat Burger (oh, they have a special melon plate? It must be, right?)
