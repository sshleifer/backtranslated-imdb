My impression of seeing this documentary is that Nathaniel Kahn got more questions than he was before making the film. <br /> <br /> He took five years to do that, love and longing. I can only imagine the confusion of the change process to leave what to take out. His father, a renowned architect Louis Kahn, comes over when a man is too selfish and self-absorbing to be emotionally available even to one woman who is not alone. But like many men of his character, he pulled the women who were extremely distant and creative. One of his mistresses said he was "accessible", but it has never been studied. The same fate is for others who knew him well. Damage. <br /> <br /> There also seems to be tension between the three half-brothers who are in the home of Louis. Unexpected hovers over chat. The only stories his father left were in the buildings he left behind, some big, some not so big. <br /> <br /> I liked the music ship and the Salk Institute. Unfortunately, there are babies that they have constantly grabbed, which he never showed when he told the director's mother when he was told about pregnancy - "not again!" <br /> <br /> 8 of 10, beautifully filmed, genuine. <br /> <br /> It seems that at least in this case the son is not the father of a man.
