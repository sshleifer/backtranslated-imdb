The secret of the 1930s comedy about the "curved circle", which was a hooded tomb band who tried to understand some people who swore to resist them. A nice, but really unobtrusive little movie, just because Zazu Pitt and James Gleason (both later joined by a couple of Hildegarde Withers movie Edna Mae Oliver's show) was supported and supported by the great actors and actors you know, but may not known (i am not a name). A strange hour-long romp, the film doesn't make much of a sense of mistaken identity, secret passages, ghostly music and people who don't seem to. This is the ideal thing for a dark and stormy night or late night when one is nostalgic for late late show.
