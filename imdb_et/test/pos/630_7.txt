This is undoubtedly one of my favorite horror films! I really can't believe that it didn't get much more popular than it appeared, especially when the main candidates at that time were the usual Wes Craven sequel and copycat horrors. Hitchcock / DePalma film with a very sharp black comedy and a large plot. It never permits more than a good popcorn-and-hot-dog movie, but it's hard not to just enjoy the movie for what it is. <br /> <br /> The center of the plot is Billie Hughes, a mute girl who works in a set of horror films made in a Russian factory. With a series of events, he finds that he has been accidentally locked and hits a shot of a snuff movie. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about the film is the lack of shouting that seems to be a film ever made in every horror. Since the protagonist is silent, he cannot make noise - something that is a blessing at some stage of the film, and a curse in others. <br /> <br /> The director seems to have learned his Hitchcock very well, even the opening place is the language-in-cheek, which carries both Hitchcock's "Psycho" and quite general movie scenes. <br /> <br /> Although the actor may be hammy at times, the whole movie will stick with it not only by throwing a couple of great scenes that will put you right on the edge of your seat, but some clean little questions about how the movie ends. <br /> <br /> Overall, an enormously overlooked, amazing and action-packed psycho-thriller, which I would recommend to every jazz viewer looking for something different from the usual Freddy / Jason / Scream / Michael Myers / Damien regurgitation in hallowe .
