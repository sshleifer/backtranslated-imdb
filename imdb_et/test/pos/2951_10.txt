This is really a great movie! It's going to make you think of your parents. How do we all have fragile relationships with them unless we really try to find out who they are. And just as importantly, we should remember to open and show them our true explanation, not just who we think they want us to be. Be sure to watch this documentary! IMDb makes me more text before they post my comment as weird. Usually online comments should be short and here I will be asked to write more! Well, I went to watch a movie with my parents, later thought they wanted to talk about their parents, but my dad wanted to talk about myself and things in his life when he feels he's been twisted, which was unusual, my father is not a modest man, but I was surprised that he wanted to talk about the mistakes he thinks. Mike and Kitty came to the movie to make Q&A, and after my father spoke to Mike, again was a fun moment, while my mother told Kitty! Really just ignore my last phrases to comment and just remember '51 Birch Street ', go see it!
