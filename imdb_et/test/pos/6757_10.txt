An excellent animated piece that was far from its time, and certainly far from what was unleashed in mass production at the same time in history. The impact of this work on Tim Burton's "Nightmare before Christmas" appears clearly. One can only imagine how Starewicz slid over every beautifully detailed frame of this masterpiece. <br /> <br /> There have been very few animated films with this caliber. Unfortunately, more people have not seen this jewel. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the IMdB now requires comments at least ten lines, so it's the tenth line. It must be something new - but I have nothing to say!
