You don't watch James Bond movies, rate them, rate them according to their expectations. There are certain things to expect, even the demand for a Bond movie and every individual effort either. So here are ten elements that make the Bond movie a Bond movie. And although Nothing has been technically part of the official Bond filmography, making Sean Connery 007 more than just a series of honorary members. Anyway, here's how it sets on a scale of 1 to 10: <br /> <br /> Title: NEVER NEED TO NEED: Wise title has no obvious link to the actual line, but is a funny reference to Sean Connery promise never to play OO7 -d again after attracting DIAMONDS once. In any case, this is a memorable title. Pre-Credit Teaser: Maybe trying to avoid the obvious parallels with the official EON series Bond movies, there is no Teaser; opening scenes are just behind credits. And even this is a disappointment: another "oh-no, Bond is killed" fakeout. 4 points. <br /> <br /> Opening Credits: Except for the tiny 007 full screen, they didn't even want to try credit on jazz graphics or shared screens or interesting camera corners. 1 point. <br /> <br /> Theme song: As Michel LeGrand has written and "Never Say Never Again" sung by Lani Hall, it would be a very nice part of a very long elevator. As a bond issue, it's just fine. 6 points. <br /> <br /> "Bond, James Bond": Properly, as this movie sees Connery reckoning back to Bond after ten years, the story begins with 007, which is whether Bond / Connery is still work. Fortunately, Connery more than proves himself ready to Bondage again. Although he is a bit gray, a bit more complicated with sports and a bit more explicit, he seems to have no problem slipping back. All in all, this is one of Connery's best and most relaxing signs. 9 points. <br /> <br /> Bond Babes: Even in the best bond movies, there are not many female characters; they exist to a large extent as necessary requisites for using Bond. The future Oscar winner Kim Basinger will be given much freedom in creating the character of Domino Petachi and the film will benefit from it. She does a nice job - and she's not too bad. 8 points. Bond Villain: Reports of his death are obviously exaggerated, Blofeld is back - at least for now - shows he has more lives than his precious bag. One-time Jesus depicts a re-stereotyped offender, Max von Sydow is not given much work in this role, but there is still a silent presence. But she is overshadowed by the wonderful performance of Maximilian Largo by Klaus Maria Brandauer. After Banal Bond's stools, Brandauer is so refreshing that it is so subtle but colorful. Funny without being a campy, mercilessly without a seemingly caricature; his Largo is up there with Auric Goldfinger, one of Bond's best villains. 10 points. <br /> <br /> Bonds: Fatima Blush! What can I say? Barbara Carrera sucks through a movie that plays a particularly stunning drag queen in a bold style, showing herself amused with a blend of more than pure psychotic madness. Bond has crossed the road with various femmes fatales, most of which have been so easily eliminated that they existed more than amusing eye candies as characters. However, few did not dare to show such burning for a dramatic or such acute determination. Even his premature death is prominent even according to Bondia standards. 10 points. The countries of the world do not pay multiple Kazillion ransom. But at least Kevin McClory was lucky enough to find one of the weakest bonds he was forced to. By comparison, this effort blows out THUNDERBALL water. And despite the lack of many Bondia brands, the film itself succeeds. 9 points. <br /> <br /> Production Values: The movie begins with a nasty style, such as a TV movie that tries to be more than possible. But as the story progresses, the film gets momentum and expediency, making it a great adventure. 8 points. <br /> <br /> Bonus points: There are a number of odd changes that make this Bond movie an official series. Miss Moneypenny is hardly recognized; as Edward Fox played, "M" is a tough old man without respect for Double Os. and "Q" is a sudden summary accent and it is all friend-friend Bond. Throughout the film, there is a curious nostalgia feeling, such as replacing Bondi Astin-Martin with a vintage packard and a tango dance number that is wisely added. And the great salvation near the end is a horse, a tribute to LOST ARK RAIDERS, who himself was honored with the Bond films. 5 points. <br /> <br /> SUMMARY: NEVER NEVER Mixed Bag. In fact, in key areas, it's more than having a hero Connery, a villain Brandauer, an assassin Carrera and a girl, Basinger. But the devil is in detail; as seemingly irrelevant, as open credits, the theme song and such seem to be absent due to their absence. It all comes as an artificial Bond film; a very good substitute, but it does replace it. <br /> <br /> Bond-o-meter rating: 78 out of 100 points.
