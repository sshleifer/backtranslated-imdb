Dark Harbor is a spirited little sightseeing tour of deep deep emotional water. Basically, this is a 3-digit piece that always contains a superb Rickman's subtle appearance, Polly Walker and Norman Reedus (also great), which make up the other two sides of this strange triangle. The perfect late night cable movie, with a surprise ending with the boot.
