I feel very much that this film was like waiting to breathe out white women in the 1950s. As Exha waited, all female characters were mixed with men who were married or not. The only difference was that there wasn't much humor in this movie. I would even say it was tragic. Only one male character seemed kind and sincere (boy of Hope Lange), but even then there was a conflict. <br /> <br /> There were about three young women sharing the apartment together and hoping for success. Unfortunately, romance didn't seem easy, although they were young, intelligent, and attractive. This film can be called a tear, the saddest part of which is the character of Suzy Parker and the tragedy of a former boyfriend. <br /> <br /> It's black.
