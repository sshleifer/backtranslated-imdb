I probably saw it like most people in my age (55) in the 1960s. I understand the dissatisfaction of both families with the final product. But this is a great movie, it was a great Opera; but if the film is wonderful. This movie should be released at least in video, other generations will appreciate the great music and story. Some of the biggest black actors were cast, most of them now dead; only Sidney P. is still with us. Please do not wait until it has disappeared and the film as an old film becomes unusable in time. Again, this is a big movie that is something you don't see very often today.
