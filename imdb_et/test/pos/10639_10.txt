Some users are confused about the identity of armed men traveling in the "Odessa staircase" queue. These men are not cossacks, but regular military forces. <br /> <br /> Cossacks arrive at the scene a little later and they are the men who sabers the horses on the horses. <br /> <br /> Russian History Experts: Fix me when I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> But there are a couple of lines in the movie that probably haven't been commented on by anyone. After taking Potemkin, someone says on the shore of the crowd: "Kill the Jews!" It's only on the screen for a few seconds, but it does. <br /> <br /> How cruel the typical history, not only in Russia, but in so many other countries, is blaming the Jews immediately, senselessly and instinctively for everyone Home problems! <br /> <br /> Other parts of the film may not be historically factual, but the fear of the Jews is too real. Comments, anyone? <br /> <br /> Also, English-speaking people can't speak "Potemkin" instead of "Potyomkin"? In Russian it is necessary to distinguish between "e" two possible pronunciations: either "you" or "yo". Sometimes two points are used to distinguish between these two pronouncements, but the difference is usually simply remembered.
