I didn't hear from Mishima before I watched the movie and although some of it is a bit annoying, I still find myself looking at it when it is repeated. At the beginning of the film, we are told that the Japanese writer behaves like a madman and publicly blows the wolf. As the film progresses, you will be gently inserted into Mishima's twisted logic. His life stages are presented in four chapters. Each chapter is a mixture of two contrasting narratives, the first of which continues the story of Mishima's life scenes and is black and white. Another narrative is customizing novel scenes and staged as games and filmed in vivid colors. Each chapter has a different novel. Between each chapter, the narrative returns to the present when Mishima continues its possible ritual suicide. This means that drama and tension are maintained until the end. <br /> <br /> I think many people find this movie a boring pretentious and art house. I respect that this is not a film for people who want to act and have a strong story. On the other hand, if you are the kind of person who enjoys the opportunity to enter the mind of a strange man while watching his life story in a collage of beautiful images on Philips glass, then you will love it. I loved it. <br /> <br />
