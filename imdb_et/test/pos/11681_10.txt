The series of decline is amazing and the director PS doesn't get enough movies to make these films. I'm a little surprised that not many people have seen it or two of them, but their worth is worthy if you want a punk from the late 1970s and early eighties. The film begins with a collection of blisters played with X-band music. Many interviews with bands and bunkers that provide an enlightening perspective on what survival was like in the low tide of mainstream ladders. In this genre there is no internet connection, insecure job and hostility. For new children who have not heard of these ensembles or who start their own, this film is a real lesson on how to rock. All of the band's performances (and there are a lot) are fantastic, especially fears that won't let me surprise. This and the second installment are amazing time caps that offer those who care about a rare glimpse of the lives of these mad people. It is a real punk, like in an interview with Darby Crashi's girlfriend, when reminding a painter who mysteriously / suddenly died outside her house and took a week or so to figure it out, they take the guy off the picture and everyone, including EMT, had it was crying, and the interviewer asked a real girlfriend whether she was sad or upset that this man had died during the painting of her house, the answer "I don't hate painters". How to Black Flag rent your apartment / test room for $ 16 a month! My jaw almost at the moment I see that I am renting ten ten lockers to practice 400. Looking at this and Deadwood, I feel I was born in the wrong time period. old way. The people and bands involved in the film paved the way for what today's harder music is, and they did it in a unique way. Brilliant movie, ten stars, see part 2, as well as the same awesome part 3, but I don't know what to say.
