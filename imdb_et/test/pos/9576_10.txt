This is the only Christopher guest film that competes with Spinal Tap and Princess Bride to achieve entertainment value, but it never goes close to recognition. The plot is surrounded by competitors - dogs - and their owners when they participate in a competing dog world ... OK, that's about the show. Owners are really characters, because one must be attached to their dogs. It's really all there is, but it makes enough fun. <br /> <br /> You would never be able to convince me that the look of dog shows would be funny before the fun scene where Levy and O'hara visit Larry Miller's house on television ... but that's really all to transform any suspicious. Spinal Tap was a non-stop fun, joke after jokes, while the Best in Show was still some lull (and that's what I mean to say 3 minutes MOST where something strikingly funny doesn't happen), but the big laughs are even bigger. <br /> <br /> This casting is great and even customary where movies in general Parker Posey do a good job. In fact, Ed Begley Jr. and the pet shop owner have been thrown out of a raft of apparently more fun running gags. <br /> <br /> What's impressive about this movie is how the writers somehow managed to knit a plot around the big jokes that was easy, so he felt he was heading. I think there is freedom on such a minimal plot. Here the role of everyone is pretty well designed and the characters are rarely up. The reality of what pathetic it seems to an outside participant is what makes it more fun than Mighty Wind or uneven Guffman. In fact, I meet as I am now. If you like guest stuff, you should definitely own it.
