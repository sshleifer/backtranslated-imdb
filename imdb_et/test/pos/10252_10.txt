Cooley High was actually a comedy moments drama. This reflected the high school life back. I attended Coolidge High in Washington, D.C. from 1976 to 1979, and much of what was in Cooley High was Coolidge every day. In fact, after the film appeared, everyone started calling Coolidge "Cooley High". High, shooting dice, searching girls, basement parties and struggles that bring together high school life for many D.C. back in the day. I do not forget Motown because Motown's music started and ended in the 70s many days ago. Blows had to come. But Cooley High adds a layer of madness to humanity, because when everything was said and done just like in Cooley High, my classmates and I had a lot of love for each other. And like the Cooley High characters, life was after high school, but something didn't like waking up every morning and experiencing the best from home to seventh day every day. Thirty years later, we are ready to celebrate these good times. Cooley High is definitely a periodic piece that improves over time as it is the only thing that has been left out of these days, memories, some good and some bad.
