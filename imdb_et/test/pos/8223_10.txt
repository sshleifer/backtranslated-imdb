Flight and Clown Bagatelles tickets, made by Bill Irwin, are some of the funniest (both physical comedy and verbal and visual gags) I've ever seen. My father recorded this special when he first appeared in the 80's and my family has loved it ever since. We are quoting it quite constantly. It is a crying shame that copies are not readily available for purchase. I have a bad copy of VHS that I acquired a few years ago from a specialist distributor, but Mr. Irwin's power deserves decent DVD treatment by restoring the original performance and interviewing performers / producers, and more examples of contemporary Bill Irwin's talent deserve more exposure to mainstream audiences than it is had been limited to her limited-spread performances. I often share with my friends the "Flight Ticket" and although I am always welcomed with a little skepticism, when I mention that it is a clowning and vaudeville mix, it is not necessary for anyone to see it without loving it. If the powers that ever appear in the IMDb list, consider releasing this and other Bill Irwin's work.
