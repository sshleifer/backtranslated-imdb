I went to see Glenn McQuaid "I Sold Dead" in his North American premiere at the Toronto After Dark Film Festival. Seeing this is another show all over the world, I didn't really know what to expect from this movie, especially when I didn't see this short film that inspired this big screen adjustment. <br /> <br /> I'll start with a slightly more complicated plot summary without spoilers. <br /> <br /> This film is about Arthur Blake, how he became a grave planner and interesting and supernatural discoveries discovered by him and his mentor. > <br /> The costume and design of this movie was great. I was surprised that the whole movie was filmed in New York and its surroundings. The costumes were very precise by that time, bringing the mindset of the era into the observer. This film works just as well as a periodic piece, as it does horror comedy. <br /> <br /> The communication between the two interfaces was very fluid. They played each other easily. The dialogue between the two was very well written, because Glenn added his comic touch even in tense situations. <br /> <br /> The story is very wide and the ball will start running from the start. I'd compare it to the sadness of the visual page, always thinking about what happens next. Characteristic features are all very vivid and unique, adding different emotional layers to the film itself. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I recommend this movie to anyone who has a nice dark humor. in. <br /> <br /> 9/10
