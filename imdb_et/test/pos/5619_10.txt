For many years, Samuel Goldwin tried to bring his friend to the Jascha Heifetz screen. One evening, when Goldwyn and his wife Frances had dinner with Heifetz and his wife, the silent screen star of Florence Vidor, Goldwyn suggested that Heifetz star be in the film. After some persuasion, Heifetz agreed that his conduct was minimal. Originally the film "Music School" was born. <br /> <br /> The story itself is a reserve: a boy in the street (Gene Reynolds, the best known as "M * A * S * manufacturer"). H "), going away from home and financially leading a restless music school headed by Professor Lawson (Walter Brennan), trying to raise money for the school, the boy and some other children at Heifetz at Carnegie Hall, and after much respect, Heifetz goes to school school for concert and school. <br /> <br /> The story that is predictable is surprisingly well written, although the film has several small gaffs where different scenes were put together, the most obvious being a young cellist who is sent out of orchestra. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising how good it works. Like in the studio, the studio was surrounded by an inexperienced star with the talents of veterans: Brennan, Joel McCrea, Andrea Leeds, Porter Hall, Marjorie Main (Later Ma and Pa Kettle fame) ), Arthur Hohl, Paul Harvey and who is the character of the actors, actor Diana Lynn and the singer / actress Kaye Connor made the debut of this movie, as did the longtime Nelson Eddy song partner G ale Sherwood (Jacqueline Nash). Also featured are children's veteran actors Reynolds, Walter Tetley and Terry Kilburn. <br /> <br /> Goldwyn hired Peter Meremblum's Symphony, a highly respected youth orchestra from the Los Angeles region. Most orchestra children were not actors, but they were great musicians, both good and professional (many of whom later became). Many of the orchestra's children went to a remarkable career: Kaye Connor and Diana Lynn played in the theater as well as in the movies, Richard Berres was the director and director, Mitchell Lurie founded the well-known music suppliers, Elliott Rapaport went on Be an outstanding cardiologist, Lewis Elias was the band leader Thomas Facey who was conductor of various symphonies, Channing Robbins, prominent instructor at Julliard School, instructor of his sister Joyce Robbins SUNY Stonybrook, and many orchestra children made musical music career with large symphony orchestras. <br /> <br /> Although Heifetz's actor was minimal, his salary was not. He ordered $ 70,000 for seven weeks. When some scenes had to be photographed later, he still received $ 50,000 for another four weeks. Fortunately, his musical output was not minimal. The composer was Alfred Neumann (who was once the conductor of Meremble Orchestra). Heifetz performs Camille Saint-Saen's "Introduction and Rondo Capriccio", his own placement with Manuel Ponce's "Estrellita" (with the accompanying Teddy Saidenberg), Dinicu's malevolent "Hora Staccatot" (from Vitaphone's recording with Emanuel) on Piano, extract from Tchaikovsky's Melody ", an extract from a violin solo from Tchaikovsky's well-known" Adante Cantabile ", his opus of 11 string quartets (played at the beginning of the film at the beginning of the credit); Felix Mendelssohn-Barthody's E Minor Violin Concerto final movement. During all these performances there are many Heifetz presentations, including some very close pictures of their finger and worship, something that would be worthy of the violinists who want to learn their technique. <br /> <br /> The Meremlum orchestra also shines here, presenting Verdi's scents "Caro Nome" and Bellini's "Casta Diva" (both with Sherwood singing), Rossini's "Sevilla Hairdresser" opening game, a short excerpt from Mozart's "Eine Kleine Nachtmusik" " and the aforementioned Mendelssohn concert (with Heifetz) Diana Lynni can be heard in the background of one scene, playing a part of Chopin Nocturne in a B-apartment Minor and five-year-old Mary Ruth performing with the popular "Minute" in Chopin. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a great movie, and AMC showed it regularly until the beginning of 1992. I haven't seen it on television in recent years, but it's not hard to get copies.
