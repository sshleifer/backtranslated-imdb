If you are never "Tromatized" then this is the first Troma movie. Amazingly acting, supercharged soundtrack and bust-a-gut humor are perfect for Troma's unique storytelling and special effect. Despite the fact that the word for the repetition of the words of Rome and Juliet was abandoned, the fact that it remains in the iambic pentameter gives you a strange feeling that it is closer to Shakespeare than that which transcends music video with DiCaprio and the Danes. I assumed I saw the ultimate Shakespeare comedy when Moonlighting's cast overhaul was renewed, but nothing is near Tromeo and Julia. I strongly recommend the DVD version, which includes the second track with director Lloyd Kaufman, which is as fun as the main track.
