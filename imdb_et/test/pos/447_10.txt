The "Silver Screen" is a freshly polished film of this beautiful film that shows happy aging and enjoys the life of an umbrella. This silver screen has a lot of silver hair, but the film's namesake is more than 85 years old with -25, with its energy, humor and lust for life. The story of the entertainer's special Uncle Frank, his dedicated wife Aunt Tillie, and the lively inhabitants of local nursing homes inspire us to "live every day as if it were your last" and bring them hope for the often frightened golden years. Great movie for young and old audiences!
