Love Jones depicts young African-American men and women intelligently, positively, realistically. I feel that all the actors and actors were excellent and really good at capturing the mood. Nia Long and Larenz Tate worked well together and I hope to see more work with these two works. In fact, all the actors / actors did such a good job that it would be nice to see another romantic comedy. This movie can be compared to most well-written romantic comedies. If you haven't already seen this movie, I suggest you do it, it can definitely give you a new perspective on life and love.
