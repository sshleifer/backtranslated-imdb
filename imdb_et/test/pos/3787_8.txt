SPOILERS BELGIUM <br /> <br /> "Dog life" was a remarkable comic timing. Charlie Chaplin's second film in 1918 focuses on the silent film genius on a completely different sense of humor. His war comedy specializes in surreal, exaggerated pieces in which Chaplin demonstrates unprecedented creativity and mastery of composition. When a soldier bunker is flooded, the water level reaches just the right height so Chaplin can successfully complete his gags. In a later scene, a soldier dresses like a tree, a disguise that confirms Chaplin's much greater ingenuity and stupidity. Of course, when the enemy discovers its ruse, the soldier darts directly into the forest. The chase resulting from this is visual admiration: Chaplin not only hides German soldiers, but also uses the forest to hide the soldier from the audience, so that the combed soldier is locked in the middle of the frame, but somehow remains invisible. All the time we thought our little hero pulled the German army fast. our joy is also a joke for us. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8
