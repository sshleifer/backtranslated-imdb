This is the one that you can watch over and over and laugh as much every time. We've been here at Keaton Festival after buying our films. In this, Buster has gone astray with a fugitive murderer and has a lot of chasing and crazy scenes, but also what's best about Buster - his creativity. Open scene is really funny and it goes on from there.
