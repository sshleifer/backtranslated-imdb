After watching Desperate Living, I was on John Waters movies. I heard Pink Flamingo and I had to watch it and the boy was worth it! Believe what you hear, it's a trash! It's full of dirty, which is actually the main plot of this movie. It includes: Incest, cannibalism, rape, chicken, nudity (as you have never seen a child's birthday for entertainers), poo eating, firing, trailer trash, perversion, transsexuality, egg fettish, cross-dressing ... ... you get the picture . Above all, it's a sure black! Just beware of the birthday party and the divine who think about the park!
