Hollywood has transformed the mafia into a production line that extends from banal to superb and despite some good action and a sensible script (much of which is - for change - true!). This "home entertainment" effort will hit the middle of the strike. <br /> <br /> The script is not only obvious (all checklist boxes are labeled), but they spend a lot of time trying to create the best of the best other people. . The godfather is most obvious, but there are other references. I don't want to name them. However, this is a good taste for the borrower! It looks like the producer sets a shock and murder quota (at least once every twenty minutes?) And the end is weak and "so?" I am told that there are different versions of this production that may have been the version I've seen. <br /> <br /> Gangsters don't make the money they take. Usually fear. Some seem to be more than money for murder and chaos in entrepreneurship. They were the first ones (in real life and here). "You can't make money with your hand," says Charlie "Lucky" at one stage of Luciano. One of the smarter gangsters, though everything is relative. He was an experienced white slave trader and drug dealer before he returned home to Italy. break a straight jacket with the power of Italy / Sicily (rarely operates outside of itself). The young Turks knew that they had to be joined by other groups (especially the "Jews" who knew how to fund the money), and that it is at least referenced and recognized. It's not so clear that most immigrant groups had their own mafia - but most of them earned money and went right. And why not? Who wants to die in prison? <br /> <br /> Joseph Bonanno was a ruthless person who was ready to kill, if necessary, but not unfair or stupid. His story was tragic that he could have made money around the world and he showed a special skill to avoid killing. A bit of luck, of course. <br /> <br /> Despite the respectful names and the role of three players (Bruce Ramsay, Martin Landau and Tony Nardi), charisma and talent do not bring us in and feel anything. We are - simply - passive observers in life where we are not in the lead. The people shown here were born to a cruel world, but their only sign was to make it more cruel. <br /> <br /> If you don't get enough of a gangster genre that is better than viewing godfather 1 and 2 for the tenth time, and it's even better - than entertainment - than a terrible attack that was a godfather 3.
