Paul Naschy as a ghostly security guard is more terrible than most of his fur and shoe polishing werewolves. The story is not familiar, a bunch of children going to an abandoned school. The thing is that one of these parents did the same thing years ago, but he is now dead, and the last group of children seems to have been born 23 years ago. For this type of film, it's pretty well done and what's happening is air, because probably what happened to the children before is somewhat mystery and maybe the truth hasn't come out. So not, not just your normal slice and dice. It moves with a pretty good clip and doesn't let you lose interest, like many movies, and the odd story is convincing enough to interest you, and there's a bit of a relationship that's not these days. . The end is quite steep and I think it is mostly your imagination, but it no longer loses its greeting. 7 out of 10, check it out.
