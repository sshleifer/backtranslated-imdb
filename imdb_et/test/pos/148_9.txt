"Oldboy" director Park Chun-wook returns with the most important and at the same time the most serious vampire clips in film history. <br /> <br /> By trusting the latest Hollywood fad, vampires today should be more violent, asexual, love-proud chevaliers, than reasonable manipulators of evil hostile sexual blood sucking. This is the movie you want to see if you want to remember past sticky thrills ... well, at least on the other side. <br /> <br /> 'Thirst' begins with the exposition of long characters ending in a slightly different story of love. The transformation of the priest's vampires has long gone from the romantic and sexual aspects of the story, making it somewhat uncomfortable. But the last 40 minutes are surprisingly in good shape. Well, maybe not as surprising as you know "Oldboy" and "I'm a Cyborg, but it's OK", but I think it's fair to say that "Thirst" wins Park's earlier films for his face violence. First of all, you should be warned that this is not a cinema or a horror show. It can be too disgusting for many and too enjoyable. "January" is original, fun, and fortunately a bit less strange than the previous efforts of Park Chun-wook.
