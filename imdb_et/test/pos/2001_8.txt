Here is one of the most amazing elements of the 70's blaxploitation grindhouse; it is a thoughtful low-rent pimp opus, similar to the "Mack" sleazier version. John Daniels, the ridiculous hairdresser hero Jonathan's immortal "Black Shampoo", gives a superb sharp image of a baron, a merciless, business addict, an ever-omnipotent forceful cutter who is much frustrated by his bitter, brutal Italian rivals reign over the Sunset Strip. If the horns are not locked up with criminal associates or do their best to avoid the interruption of the local vice-president, Daniels will lead his usual gardening suburban guy (with a caring wife and loving children) sweetly to the average existence! ) in a typical California small town. <br /> <br /> The absurd assumption alone allows for the richness of the top class B sculpture (George Theakos deserves praise for the ridiculous script). Matt Cimber's laudably tactful and tasteless direction gives junk spiders junk, making this film a very enjoyable celluloid coffee. Among the mixed squalid joys to be enjoyed here is abundant free woman nudity, coarse dialogue, beautifully gaudy We decade threads (dice tops, felt hats, sparkling day-glo jewelry, loud seersucker suits), intensely funky R&B score smoke, some hopelessly pathetic behavior (a small old woman living in the neighborhood of Daniels) is a memorable nasty, sadistic goon by Patrick Wright, a couple of cool activities (climatic slow motion bar massacre), more Sunset strips are a real travel material if you can shake feather birds (supposedly it contains "Hollywood Sunset Strip's actual whore and blades "), effectively Ken Gibb's filmmaker, some sick sexual fetish tableaux, some raw explicit violence (prostitute has one of her breasts cut off!), And familiar schlock's fun-supporting performances are the perennial Richard Kennedy and George" Buck "flowers racist, corrupt and attacking police detet as a pair of seals. Of course, this movie is not an art, but it is definitely artless to qualify deliciously in strange film art.
