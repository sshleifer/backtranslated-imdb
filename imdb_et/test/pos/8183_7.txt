Much of the director who talks about the ambitious plan of the Qin Emperor to unite all the kingdoms of China. Some great characters, sets, costumes and scenes. But the film did not catch the ability of the actors (which was most enjoyed by the Marquis) or its appearance (though massaging the troops was extremely impressive when it was a real man with lots of extras!). <br /> <br /> I've seen Li Gong in other movies and he's always great. The piece of the good period I think, but not one who decides its true historical accuracy. Good movie and found that 2 1/2 + hours is not a problem. <br /> <br /> Rating from 7 out of 10.
