Like all good arts, this film can be different for different people. For me, this means that leaving your charter open to others can rob you of happiness and leave you with an empty life. The comfort of selfishness is like junk food: it looks good, but you may end up being sick. <br /> <br /> Almost everything I see in the United States is commercial mass production, low drama and stupid comedies, and this sensitive, deep and poetic film touched me. Thank you, Nuri Bilge Ceylan (and all others cast)! <br /> <br /> Ivan Yanachkov
