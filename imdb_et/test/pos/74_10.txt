Darling Lili is fantastic! This is one of my favorite films! It certainly does not deserve the bad comments he received. Julie Andrews, playing the role of Lili Smith (Schmidt), is the best part of the film. He is attractive and remarkable! Like Julie Andrews, my most favorite actor and singer, I was not surprised at how wonderful it was. This movie is just ... very good (I'm wrong with adjectives!), It's great, wonderful, amazing, funny, terribly romantic, sad and just all-out excitement and all thanks to Dame Julie Andrews! Spouse, directed by Blake Edwards. Oh, yes, Rock Hudson was okay :) <br /> <br /> Julie Andrews is a beautiful and beloved singer, Lili Smith. Rock Hudson depicts Major Larabee, who falls quickly to Lili and to him. But their thing was not accidental. The German government planned a meeting (I'm not sure if it's exactly what you call them, but you get that point) because warm, happy singer entertainer Lili is actually a German spy. Lily is told to attract Major LArabee to get information about the new Top Secret Opertaion (later known as "Crepe Suzette"). Although Lili is on a solemn mission, she falls in love with Bill (Major Larabee), making her original endeavor difficult. But Lili pulls up and performs the task when she discovers something that isn't really about Bill. The final will not be reported to me because it is perfectly positioned. If anything, you will enjoy this movie thoroughly, surely I did it !!!!!!!! <br /> <br />
