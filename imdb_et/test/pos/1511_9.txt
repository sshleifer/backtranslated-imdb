"Cat In The Brain" is a series of extremely violent sequences that are knit with a plot that is more familiar with the film, describing director Lucio Fulci's most famous film making years. The film can also be seen as blind comedies that effectively speak different claims that violent cinema causes violence in real life. Fulci goes beyond that, he casts himself a star, the central man of the film, thus showing the audience behind the cinematic gore. "Cat in the brain" does not mean a clear story and its adherence. Instead, he entertains some clichés that have been around the Horror genre for years. <br /> <br /> Lucio Fulci plays as a horrorist who tries to keep his humanity intact. Years of violent films have finally reached him. It starts slowly, steaks and flesh in general start to gnaw her, her colleagues confirm to Fulc that everything she needs is rest. But it will not help, and soon the grotesque idea of ​​his films will overcome his daily thoughts. In an effort to find a cure for his dangerously crazy mental state, Lucio starts to go to a local psychiatrist. Unfortunately, it does more wrong than good, and Fulci is thrown into even greater confusion as the psychiatrist turns out to be a psychopath who mimics the murder of Fulci films in real life. <br /> <br /> The film retains all of the Italian splatter movie brands, good or bad, all here. Thus, there are no significant comments on the quality of the film or the technical aspects and budget constraints on the quality of the film. It's a visual experience, there's no doubt about it. Fulci throws an incredible amount of violence that goes far beyond what he has done. These are just a few of the many grotesque acts of "Cat In The Brain" that have been shot by the chainsaw limbs, cannibalism, child murder, decapitation. Some of them are obviously recycled from some of the director's less-profile movies, but they do not stand out from the context and feel at home here. As I mentioned earlier, the film is better than satire of the genre, not a serious piece. The way in which some violence is presented helps to identify this idea. Such sequences shortly after the climax have been rejected because of the reality of the film because they have shown that they are actually inside the film that Fulci's character directs. This "movie in film" presentation somewhat reduces the gore effect. But that doesn't just make it a movie. Oh, it is not far and the gore level and gorehounds found above the mainstream horror are undoubtedly unhappy with it. <br /> <br /> Lucio Fulci was a very polarized figure. People hate their work or love it. The "cat in the brain" does not convince any Fulci fraudster, but it is an interesting part of his filmography. One that fans should really look out for.
