Jack Palance, (John Witting), was usually a bad guy in most of his films and movies, he showed his great actors beyond their expectations and beyond. John Witting unexpectedly returns to his son's farm after years of leaving. It is difficult for Christopher Walken (Jacob) to accept his father's appearance after spending the night in the family. Jacob's son and younger daughter greet their new grandfather and accept him as he is, a very old man at the end of his rope. Glenn Close, (Sarah Witting), blames John Witting's character and begins to prove the truth about what happened to him in years of absence. It is a very warm and loving underground film about the real events that most families have for generations to come and go.
