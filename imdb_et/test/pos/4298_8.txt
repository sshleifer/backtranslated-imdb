ERI LIES is such an elegant, intelligent and provocative film and I could have looked at Tom Wilkinson forever. England's rural areas, wonderful London locations, interiors, smart wardrobes, and of course the other LIES made in the dialogue are an exciting adventure. <br /> <br /> With this word, and perhaps just from an American point of view, since the British are so much more complicated when dealing with sexual imprisonment, I found it hard to see how Tom Wilkinson is just standing, because his wife is happily on his way to sexual journey, which really brings him very little joy, creates a lot of despair with his wife, where it is Rupert Everett. Yes, I saw Wilkinson's character deficiencies - the goal of perfection, a desire everywhere, but Emily Watson would have had to look deeper into her true character and strong goodness to understand what she had thrown away. br /> <br /> Tom Wilkinson makes EQUIPMENT LIES a powerful film by watching him experience the pain, embarrassment and despair of his screen when his wife goes down with another man. And he himself makes a trip to independent LIES, realizing his mistakes, including his wife, despite everything that has gone on and bringing him back to London. Bravo, Tom!
