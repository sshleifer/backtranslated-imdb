I first saw this movie when I was about 12 years old. It's been one of my favorites because ... It's so perfect that it's all in glory with a fantastic soundtrack, cheesy dialogue, and it was so fun and terribly sad. The first movie I actually had was in the end ... I'm not destroying it for you, but the boy is this tear ... I just remember I was so sad that Gary! What kind of cool characters in this movie are genius !!! They are all so big, that Gary does not like fun ... (she had a nice little body). I can't believe all the girls go to Rick because he's such a butterfly ball tied to his neck! Ha ha ha ... Looking at this movie, (almost) sexy sexually transmitted diseases are ready. But the story of love in the heart of the real problems of uncertainty in life, changing the decisions that make you think and feel the real sadness for false sense. I love this movie !!! If you like Valley Girl's second classic, then too!
