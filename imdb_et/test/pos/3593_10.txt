David Attenborough brings his exciting nature, this time underwater creatures, to this extraordinary 8-episode for all sea animals! <br /> <br /> Cinematic art is amazing, bringing the breathtaking movie of these whales to the screen! The best thing, but seeing every episode is how they did it! Whether they are creature models or impressive shots of whales, they will explain to you in about 10 minutes how they did it! <br /> <br /> In 2001, there were big TV shows on our screen. But contrary to this documentary heritage, they make them pretty flat! But to even boast this documentary as the best 2001 TV series, this series of high-quality entertainment does not take a lot! <br /> <br /> Generally, this 2001 best TV series has no competition, and perhaps the best TV series of the 2000s!
