A new and innovative exhibition with great pain that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Bell Bell is wonderful .. it's bad that his second show "Miss Match" was canceled. I'm just glad he came back to "the surface." I can't wait for the "Surface" to return. This exhibition is really something unique to look at. What a terrible underwater world like Jurassic Park, this show will show you what's next. The name is divine even when it gets bigger and worse. There are so many generic examples that show the same old themes around. If something like "Surface," just say "TODAY!".
