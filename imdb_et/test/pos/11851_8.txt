Well, the film turned out to be much better than I expected. It's not boring and it's not unoriginal. It's not really a silly romantic comedy. The situations that the characters put in are very unusual, of course we are still talking about the movie, but the main characters are really plausible. Of course, Donald is an exaggeration, but he is just a filmmaker, which means he has to prove something. The end is not one of those ridiculously happy, always the same, moral pieces that you can usually see in the genre films. I really liked it and I find it very difficult for the genre of this movie. Worth a look. Besides, it is better than other movies, the story is always up, the characters themselves rise. And they do not experience this marvelous change, and they are not exposed to love like the artefact of holly god, yada, yada. At the end of it all you actually see yourself going through all that movie you feel about, you can even learn something or two. This is not the usual hope-producing, tissue moisturizing idiot. It's a good movie, not a comforting prize for tears for women around the world.
