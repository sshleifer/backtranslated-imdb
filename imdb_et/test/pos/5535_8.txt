I'm surprised by the number of negative comments on this movie. If you don't like this movie, what it is - silly, overwhelming, the mob's story - then you just read it too much. This movie is a classic story of a mob woman trying to escape from "life" and the worries she has followed. Michelle Pfeiffer is a terrible 80-year-old jersey who is an insecure, uncomfortable mob woman, while Matthew Modine is an anal retentive-like mob tracking cop who falls for her. The plot is mostly predictable and cutesy, and Mercedes Ruel steals the exhibition as a Mob wife queen. If you are not looking for something too dynamic and complicated, this film is a lot of fun and a classic of the 80's. When you start, you can't stop viewing.
