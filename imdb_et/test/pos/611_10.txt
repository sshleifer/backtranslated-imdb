For me, the "late Chrysanthemums" were interesting not only because it was my first film of Naruto, but because it was technically as modern and innovative as the work of his 30s. This does not mean innovative editing in a way Godard introduced in 1959 to "Breathless" but quite the opposite. <br /> <br /> Editing was as smooth as the 30's Hollywood movies. In the 40's, but at the same time incredibly, it was the way he told his story. Unlike them, it has never purposefully emphasized or attempted to make itself "invisible", but with cinema I felt that I was driving gently in the stream, constantly feeling the waves underneath me, such as the gentle hand stroke or the cradle almost almost unnoticed. In this sense, the film was comparable to the work of Ozu and Mizoguch, but somewhat finer. <br /> <br /> What was so modern was that editing seemed almost like a remarkable camera. work in Dreyer Ordet (1954) or Vredens Dag (1943), which shows us a deeper understanding of the film and its characters, rather than just showing them to us. <br /> <br /> I feel Naruto editing and cinematography are the most interesting aspects of his films, making stories more important than obvious. Also, we should not forget the wonderful sets and settings! I found this story quite normal. <br /> <br /> The narrative and its characters were introduced in a very interesting way, and I thought that the first part of the film was a delicate spectrum of emotions and relationships. Unfortunately, the other side of the film and its resolution were more didactic and formal than created (though it would have been perfectly suited to any other less complex film). Somehow I felt that he didn't try a little clothes he woven. Maybe he should have touched them. This criticism may seem a bit tougher for the film viewer, especially since the procedure again resembles how Ozu deals with the plot in his films. Unfortunately, I still do not feel that Narus was able to raise the story and its symbols in the conclusions of his films in a similar way from above. The best efforts I've seen so far - Floating Clouds / 1955 and Midaregumo (Scattered Clouds / 1967) - supported the energy he built up throughout the narrative, while providing a cozy and resonant ending. <br /> <br /> It's more than most of the director's ability, and I think it's the basis for the true craftsmanship of cinematographic films. In this regard, and considering the last two movie resonances he has seen, he may already be one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> The only problem I have now is where I see more of my movies on the big screen.
