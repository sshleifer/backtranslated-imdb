This film has some of the best dialogues ever written. Really good lines have been given to George C. Scott, a man who knew what to do with a fruity dialogue. I saw this movie again for the first time in 20 years and the dialogue is as good as ever. The odd move in the hospital is so imaginative to dazzle you. They often involve such wonderful poetic justice as to be close to genius characters. I love this movie !!
