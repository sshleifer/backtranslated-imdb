This film shows that the free enterprise system and the pursuit of almighty overcome all racial and ethnic barriers. Ultimately, the market determines the message sent to the public. This movie dramatizes this point. A conservative white-collar advertising company takes over a group of African Americans, led by a meaningless black man who wants to make a boxer and believes he can sell products by telling the truth. But the film shows that no matter how hard he tries to do anything else, the market and the political system require him to respond by making him different from his predecessors. Interesting, amazing movie.
