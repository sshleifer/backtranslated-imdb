I liked the movie, I thought it was both fun and dramatic. But I had a question about music that is a movie. I have been unable to find any soundtrack (if it is one). And specifically, did I think anyone could tell me the name of the song that plays when the boys go to the river to New Orleans? I thought it was something like "My Great Escape", but I was searching on the internet for books, pretty much everything I could try, and I just can't find it anywhere. If someone could help, it would be very welcome. Thank you.
