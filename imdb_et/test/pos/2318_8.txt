I really enjoyed this movie. I've probably watched it twenty times or more and still enjoy it. Being an old navy boy, I still interfere with the challenging rendition of Anchors! I also love the McHales Navy pirates atmosphere. I could have done without a female diving officer, but I just think old-fashioned. She was still good to look, lol, especially after the team did their laundry. The film was made by cook, sonarman and electrician. I also liked the salty old engineer and his first grade PO. And Grammer did a very commendable job to be a mismanaged officer. I loved the driving scene because they went to the harbor on the golf course, lol. Pure Navy! And I swear I had an XO that was just such a little guy ... I'm so glad it's a DVD, about a bloody time. : 0)
