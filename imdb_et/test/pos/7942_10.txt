Alexander Nevsky (1938) is an excellent cinema propaganda. The Russian people are threatened by two main enemies, the Mongols and the German Knights of the Holy Roman Empire. When accusing warlike rival princes to unite in Russia, Nevsky takes and fights less than two evils (The Teutonics). This influential film was copied several times and is still up to this day. The soundtrack of the composer Prokiev and Eisentstein is a vision and a sound to see. Many years later, John Milius used many movie scenes, pieces and costumes for this movie and added them to Conan. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite lines from Conan was this movie. "It is not the strength of iron, but the strength of the person who uses it." Comparisons are misleading. The weapon that James Earl Jones and the Teutonic Knight leader carry is virtually identical. A true tribute paid from one director to another. <br /> <br /> I give Alexander Nevsky one of my highest recommendations. The film plays like Richard III's Final Act. Prince Alexander is really amazing on the screen.
