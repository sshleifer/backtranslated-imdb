This movie is great about the reality of sexual abuse. Daughters excellently express their opposing emotions of affection and betrayal. The landscape on the ground is wonderfully authentic and the sound is unobtrusively moving. This film is a graduate-level course that is too little recognized in American society. Personally, I am nervous with the names of the characters - The character of Lange is Ginny Cook Smith - my name is Connie Cook Smith and my mother is Genny Cook. The youngest daughter is Caroline Cook, which is my sister's name, and my father is Larry Cook, my cousin's name. But sexual abuse was not our close relatives.
