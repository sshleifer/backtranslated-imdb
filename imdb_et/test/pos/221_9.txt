Police Team! (1982) was a funny show that ended too early. But I think it had run before it was too repetitive and uncomfortable as many American TV shows. The funny geniuses of this show were the team of Zucker, Abraham and Zucker. Leslie Nielsen has found a new career as a comedian because her straightforward behavior in comedy hit AIRPLANE! In this short term t.v. In the series, he once again had the opportunity to play a straight man in cunning comedy. For each episode, the bizarre titles ended. But Mrs Drebrin (Leslie Nielsen) came across so many strange cases that they have to believe. <br /> <br /> Too bad that they do this D.V.D. If the exhibition needs to be released again, it should be like that. The whole new generation is waiting for this show! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended!
