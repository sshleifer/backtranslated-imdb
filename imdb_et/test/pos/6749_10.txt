This is a great B-movie horror film that borders on horror and comedy. It is a genetically corrupted scorpion in space. Can it become unrealistic? It is a hybrid between "Alien" and "Chain Saw Massacre". The film was beaten in Stockholm with the American and Swedish mixed pain who communicate beautifully. Director Martin Munthe is doing an excellent job of finding the comic highlight of this script and can make some good laugh out of the audience. The movie was little or no shot and it is inspiring to see what can be done with limited resources. Stinger has all the features of the B-movie horror movies. It is at the same time comical and scary and cast and the team is committed to their cause. It's nice to see that such movies can still be done! I would recommend seeing it if you like this type of movie.
