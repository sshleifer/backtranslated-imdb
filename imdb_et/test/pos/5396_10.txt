Some may think Imaginary Heroes is a movie just like "Igby Goes Down," but that's not. In Imaginary Heroes, the director gives us the opportunity to feel the Travis family and the people around them. <br /> <br /> The film itself is excellent and the actor is very well done. The acting of Weaver and Hirsch is plausible and helps to make the film. Actors, director / writer Dan Harris has made a film that many people should see. Don't think it's just a teenage movie, it's a movie about family and their problems. <br /> <br /> I gave this film a 10/10 because I believe it is not the best movie that no movie can have, but its closest is perfect.
