I really enjoyed this movie, it will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat. It was very well targeted. I think it was important that they showed a couple of lives as Terry and Bobbys as well as emotional people. Because this movie was needed to show Bobby as a cold and revenge person. <br /> <br /> I agree with another review that it was a sick love, not a true love. He did not have to kill to kill his wife. He should have been honest with him and told him he was sterile and decided to take the child. Some say that he was naive, I think he was at the time of adoption, but the best actors were all around. Great movie to watch!
