I remember this comic for over 50 years - what it is! It was funny and creative; I wish my children and grandchildren had seen it. This is a better place with Winky Dink - another favorite. I was glad to know that one of the creators later worked in Rocky and Bullwinkle. For these early examples, there was much for them that there are no cartoons for today's children. Today's cartoons seem to strive for the idea that any special, magical formula or talent is needed to be able to resist evil or dangerous. When the early cartoons didn't deal with much evil - it was a much softer and safer time - they allowed us to develop our talents and character.
