My friends and we spent most of the Saturday afternoon watching a selection of "bad" movies. The strongest candidate (the price of a bad film) was among Jack-O amongst the watch he was looking at. It is ridiculous that films such as "Gigli", "Glitter" and "You Got Served" are listed at the bottom of IMDBs 100. Although they are definitely bad movies, they do not belong to the bottom 100. They kidnap "Jack-O" and "Keeper of Time", etc., from Bad Movie Greatness, which they deserve so much. <br /> <br /> What makes Jack-O so big (for bad movies)? To begin with, Steve Latshaw, director, decided to put his son Ryan Latshaw in the role of Sean Kelly. Unfortunately, for Steve, Ryan Latshaw was dangerously close to wood blocking. A child, seriously, has no ability to emulate. The end result: inadvertent comic gold. The child can listen to the jokes, or just moments away when he broke his head, and his expression is rocky "emotionlessness". <br /> <br /> Another aspect of the movie we found was fantastic. number of "double dream" sequences. What is a Double Dream? Well, this is when the character wakes up from a nightmare, and then something happens equally horrible and then wakes up again. Basically: they wake up after awakening to awaken from the awakening. Smart device, no? I believe that Sean Kelly's character experienced at least 3 double-dreaming sequences. <br /> <br /> Let's see what else? Oh yes! This movie is really thousands. It's really stunning to see how many roles the film is talking about. Best of all: almost no character has any story. Jack-O kills them, or they're in no way. <br /> <br /> Jack-O himself was pretty sweet. Like most other B-movie monsters, Jack-O has an amazing ability to teleport over seemingly in distant places. It always hangs in the background whenever you are dealing with a great character. What is amazing, however, is that when he actually pursues someone, he is moving at a speed of astonishment / stumbling and is still able to keep up with people who are sprint. <br /> <br /> It's all right now. Final remarks: If you are looking for an inadvertently fun bad movie, you can't rent this beast. <br /> <br /> Bad Movie Score: 7/10 Good Movie Score: 3.5 / 10
