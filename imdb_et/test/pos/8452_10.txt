I enjoyed this movie thoroughly when it was first released, and every time I have seen it. Political drama is effective if not new or inspired. Decades of film release have shown that willingness to reduce costs at the expense of public security is certainly not something that the scriptwriter suggests. <br /> <br /> But I think the most impressive feature of this movie is Jack Lemmon's performance. It's amazing to look at her at work. He has a gift to communicate so much, sometimes without saying a word. The next time you watch this movie, look at Jack's face while he's not talking. She doesn't have to talk (or worse, it would be expensive) to let you know what's going on in her mind. <br /> <br /> I call it a spoiler, because I got the impression when I first saw the movie: In the last movie of Lemmon, when he is on the floor, he feels a slight vibration. Fear in her eyes is one of the most frightening images I've ever seen in every movie. This is perfect action because it instantly threatens what is happening - if Jack's character is so frightened, there is definitely something terrible. And that is.
