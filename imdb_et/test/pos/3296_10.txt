This twisted comedy is well behaved and directed. Very funny and the quality of production is outstanding. It's easy to see why this short film has been accepted by so many festivals and has won awards. <br /> <br /> Everyone can find that Calvin has a bad day, a bad week, a bad life. Travis Davis plays a great role! Richard Moll as Tim brings darkness and prophecy, which gives the film the right twist. Old man adds humor to the story. And who doesn't love suicidal goldfish! <br /> <br /> This short brings a lot of laughter. And don't miss the credit when they play at the end!
