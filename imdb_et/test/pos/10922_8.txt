Some movies want to think of us, some want to excite us, some want to encourage us. But sometimes the film only wants to laugh at us and "In & Out" is definitely successful in this department. <br /> <br /> Indiana High School Teacher Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) goes to Emily Montgomery (Joan Cusack) with his wife in three days, but the whole city is more excited about the Oscar nominee from former Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon). But when Cameron won an Oscar playing a gay soldier, he thanked his gay teacher Howard for his inspiration. Here's Howard denying it in a fun set of seals in a truly screw-in way. <br /> <br /> Kevin Kline is great for expressing gay stereotypes. Joan Cusack really has a screwdriver antics. Debbie Reynolds is completely as fun as Howard's mother. And Bob Newhart is also a philophobic principle. <br /> <br /> Gay scriptwriter Paul Rudnick is getting a delicate balance here. He knows stereotypes and uses them in a way that is generally acceptable to Conservative Midwesterners and is mostly unattractive to homosexual audiences. It's not exactly progressive, but it's funny and unpleasant and definitely a step back from last year's The Birdcage.
