Having seen it only five times (I've been watching BBC Two repetitions), I haven't really had too much experience with the League, but a small fan and a big fan of British comedy. I can say that this movie is fun. Looking at Herr Lippi (whom I never saw before), Briss and Geoff had a great comedy experience on the big screen. While on the screen, there is something that the League is making full use of, the head bounces up (it's a surprise who it is) and terrible murders with casual medieval style battles. <br /> <br /> Geoff is the funny character of the three main characters in this movie because he has the best liners and overall behavior, just like the series. One of my only disappointments with the film did not hear that Geoff shouted, "Well now I have this weapon" even once (although it has been built in one part of the film). to use the phrase everyone else, Pythonesque and it resembles very much movies like "Brian Life". Tubbs and Edward's performances were welcome, but Papa Lazarou's "Hello Daves" line broke me more than anything they said (Lazarou is probably my favorite Vassy and Tubbs and Edward). the character is killed and I can only hope it is not the last Vasey project on the screen. When Gatiss mentions the possibility of a second series or film, I am very excited now. This is a movie that I see again, partly because the projector died to the end, leaving out a 10-minute movie, but mainly because it is inventive and fun. I'm not really bothered if it's not as good as the TV series because I loved it. One thing, but if you have never seen the League, you still love it, but Dave knows what you mean to the people who do this thing. As Tubbs or Edward can do this, this local film is for local people and it is a valuable thing. <br /> <br /> **** out ***** (4/5)
