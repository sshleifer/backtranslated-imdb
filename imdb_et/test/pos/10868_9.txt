I found it charming! Someone else but Kiarostam can't do so much and so much more. You might think I'm strange, but I was so charming that I couldn't talk during the movie. I comment a lot on other movies. A short film made for Lumiere et Companie with eggs that one is fascinating in my heart, but it's also great. I liked it better than ten. Kiarostami is perhaps the best director in my opinion because she sees things! She doesn't have to use a lot of home stuff to illustrate her pictures, just grabs the camera. Maybe I don't know a lot about movies, but I don't care about things, everyone has to do it, touch my soul. Kiarostami does.
