His music, especially what we hear here, is very slow. Since Bach's death, composers have developed ways to make music slower and slower: more than a century later, Wagner and then Mahler wrote pieces that are about as slow as they can get music. - Of course, you can cheat by writing 4/4 March and then refining the half quota = 1 pace, but this pace would not be the right pace. Wagner and Mahler write music that PROPERLY played at a snail's pace. Given that slowness in some way sounds too slow, the snail's pace is the wrong expression. The critic wrote of the famous Wagner conductor: "He won't take time, he will win eternity." I know it was meant to be a compliment. <br /> <br /> I feel that in the early 1970s, directors worked out how to make the slowest films: "Death Venice" and there is "Solyaris". I prefer the first one. First, "Solyaris" crosses a line or a line and becomes complicated; "Death in Venice" grabs from beginning to end. Not much happens, but it all happens in the right order, at the right pace, photography can disappear. Not really fast. Such music sounds slow, but it is really just musical, as many movies feel slow because they have no rhythm and form. "Death in Venice" is not one of them. Beautiful in every sense, it reminds you of timelessness and the unconventional quality. You do not need theoretical knowledge to respond to Visconti's mastery as you do to respond to the incompetence of a smaller director. It's a great job.
