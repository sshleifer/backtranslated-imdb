I bought this movie from my local blocking game for 99p, which has been in my video bookcase for at least a year. Then I decided to see it tonight, the film was quite different from what I had been waiting for, and I didn't find any humor that I saw, that it was a gloomy look at people dealing with love and sexual orientation and I didn't do it In fact, the psycho killer plot does not really see the point except to add tension to the end of the movie. I felt that the person playing the lesbian woman did a great job. I watched her emotions and what happened around her. Some people would probably have seen some things he was doing funny, but I could really put myself in love, but they rejected you every step of the way, no matter how hard you tried. I thought it was a very moving movie and I dealt well with all the different sexualities. I was expecting something from Bound & Gagged: the story of love, but this is a very different film. Not bigotti.
