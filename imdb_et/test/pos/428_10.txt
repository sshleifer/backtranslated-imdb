"Hey, I didn't order a cab!" "Yes, you have one ..." What can I say about Hack ... what a man among men. He was a cheerful ex-policeman who changed the cab driver with a gold heart. If you were able (and fortunately American viewers ... one person a week) to penetrate the cold, hard surface of the outside of Hack, you need to see a caring man who is committed to justice. The show was great, I laughed, shouted, smiled ... all in the same episode. My hands shattered in goosebumps when our dear friend Hack came out of his cab to another dark alley ... nothing more than his fists ... ready for a lie civilian. The smile broke my face as the screen showed me an offender in a dark alley of facial expressions when the head-taxi headlamps were illuminated on his face. A week after the week, I canceled my duties as president of the Klingon Association for warming Hack's brightness. I've never seen a better show, and I find the loss of one of America's greatest wealth when the show was canceled. In other Hack-related news, I would like to inform the world that my wife and I expect Hack Koen to reach the world in about three weeks.
