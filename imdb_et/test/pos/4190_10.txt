The 60s cinema was as much a revolution as politics and music. The filmmakers had the courage to make avant-garde films that only discussed taboo topics before using the films. Starting with "Breathless" as well as underground American cinema (like Kenneth Anger), the movies became more experimental. All of this gathered when Hollywood realized they had a massive commercial complaint with "Easy Rider". One of the best (and most surprising) outputs of this era was originally the least successful. "Good" was done when The Monkees career was seriously falling, which is one of the best psychedelic films ever made. <br /> <br /> Plot? Well, there really isn't one, as many have said. This includes monkeys moving from one surrealistic scenario to the next. However, these sequences are obviously LSD-wrong and basically ridicule how the monkeys were ill because they were limited to their mild pre-fab reputation. It's a shame that the movie didn't find the audience. Teeny boppers who loved them had moved to a new fashionable fashion as they always do. The Psychedelic / Haight-Ashbury crowd to whom the film was collected would never have died on the Monkees movie. Its all the losses. This film may be less of a plot, but it is certainly not meaningless and is very intelligently put together. The team later did both "Easy Rider" and "Five Easy Pieces". The film was revived in 1973 in Raybert's retrospective, and it received a very positive response, which gave it a long-standing cult. Ironically, the monkeys would be the same commercial victim they protested in their 80s reunion in this film. (10/10)
