In the history of cinema, every major filmmaker had to create the first film. In many cases, when they have been seen, a light bulb goes in our heads. The connection is made and we see a strong base from which they started. So this is HORSES ON MARS. Fine humor is woven around a seemingly straightforward narrative that tells a great story, but allows you to enjoy the visuals at the same time. In the pictures I found a lot of attention to detail and product patience, which is rare on any student film. <br /> <br /> A young filmmaker must always make corrections. But when Mr Anderson continues on this path, I think we will look back at this movie as a great career. <br /> <br /> You should definitely watch this movie. Nothing will let the size of the big screen.
