David Cronenberg 'eXistenZ' is a well-designed reflection of the existentialism philosophy. It deals with the challenges of a culture connected to technology that it can no longer distinguish between fantasy and reality, or between organic and mechanical. The film captures the replacement of mechanical technology by organic metabolism. In this context, technology can be part of the human body. After playing the virtual reality game 'eXistenZ', the real world seems to be a game, and as a result, the behavior of a person to apply violent gaming weapons even when the game is over. EXistenZis technology from advanced machines to biological organisms that directly connect the human nervous system; an idea that reflects Marshall McLuhan's belief in a well-known media scientist that computers are extensions of human consciousness. Like the phone, the extension of the ear, the television is an extension of the eye, the telegram is the extension of the central nervous system. High-tech virtual reality is the extension of human consciousness. EXistenZis is a biological and therefore more human of technology than our world. But when technology becomes organic, people become more mechanical and thus less free because they can't resist their gaming attacks. eXistenZ is a virtual real estate simulation of human existence. Jean Baudrillard describes a mediated society in his Simulacra and Simulation book, which has become a way of doing everything. The world has come to a pure simulation. In EXistenZ it is obvious to see Baudrillard mediated society on body intrusion, loss of control and self-transformation. replaces with another identity, your role in a game that reflects the real life of each person in the subconscious. If you take a step-by-step control of your hyperreal life, your aura of real life will disappear. For Baudrillard, ".simulations or simulacra" has become hyperreal, more than real. Our hyperreality, like the Cronenberg computer simulation world, "now feels and for all purposes and purposes is more real than in the real world." (Baudrillard) The goal of the game, which can be called "experience" in principle, is quite metaphorical. Because you can't even know what an experience is if you didn't experience it. Since existentialists say that without an exact explanation life is absurd, the eXistenZ game is absurd. Cronenberg ironically reflects the absurdity of our lives. For example, other roles will only play if you do not ask them a pre-programmed question. And if you put your pointless funny state of vision in our life representation, then absurdity is really displayed. <br /> <br /> The game's theme is to understand what it is? This latent metaphorical question creates anxiety for people playing eXistenZ. They have no doubt about their existence, but they do not know the reason for their existence. Nature. <br /> <br /> Existentialists have found that humans have no definite nature or nature, like other animals and plants; each person makes choices that create his or her own nature. The wording of the 20th century French philosopher Jean Paul Sartre is pre-existent. â€œThus, the choice exists for human existence and is inevitable; even refusing to choose is an option. Freedom of choice means commitment and responsibility. As individuals are free to choose their own way, existentialists have argued that they must accept the risk and responsibility for their duty, regardless of where it occurs. Maybe I should mention that eXistenZ also deals with the concept of freedom of choice. You will achieve your final role in the game by making the right decisions. If you don't, the game becomes uneven and boring. So, you start listening to the game, rather your existence than your being. You suddenly turn into a game forever and realize your position outside the game. Like the last word, eXistenZ is a well-designed reverse simulation in life, thus existentialism. <br /> <br />
