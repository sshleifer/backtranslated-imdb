Richard Abernethie, a very wealthy man, is dead and his relatives have gathered at his funeral. The funeral part includes Abernathie's youngest sister, Cora Galaccio. Although no family has seen Corat for at least 20 years, they all agree that Cora was always a bit different. So when Cora says that Abemethie is murdered, it laughs most than Cora's eccentricity. But someone takes Corat seriously. The next day it was found that Coras had died in his bed when he was violently beaten. Is there a connection between the two deaths? Herkules Poirot must find a killer. <br /> <br /> After the funeral, the Poirot series is one of the best-assembled episodes. I've always been a fan of this particular book by Agatha Christie, and what I remember is a movie that is as reliable as Christie's source material as any Poirot contribution. The secret is the upper limit, with lots of clues, suspects and red herring. And as I have written before, I always enjoy Christie's story where Hercule Poirot brings everyone together in the salon for final exposure. It may be old-fashioned, but I like it. Overcoming the plot, technically and artistically After the funeral is the winner. Sets, editing, direction and cinematography are as good as one of these films. The actor is just as impressive. I've been waiting for David Suchet's delightful results with Poirot and he's not disappointing here. The rest is as strong as Monica Dolan, which gives a particularly remarkable performance. Other than small carts with the quick fires that the characters have introduced, I have no real complaint. It's a good show all the way around.
