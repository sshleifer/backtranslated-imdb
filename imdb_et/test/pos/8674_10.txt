I think it's the best Norwegian film I've ever seen. It's about 40-year-old Andreas, hit by a subway train, and suddenly finds himself in a strange city, but everything here is ready for him. She has a job, a house and clothes. At first, this city seems to be perfect, no death, no pain, no problem. There are gray suits everywhere that cleanse and improve everything that doesn't fit into their perfect definition. But Andreas is not really fit and will go back to his old world for a long time and try to get all kinds of resources back. <br /> <br /> What I am most impressed with in this film is how they made the city so surreal, even though I've seen many of these places in real life. Another thing that greatly contributes to the performance of actors. Trond Fausa The Auragag is just the perfect man to play confused and annoying Andreas. And all the other characters are doing a good job playing apathetic (sounds like hard work, isn't it?). The strong difference between Andreas and others also leads to a very amusing situation. All in all, this is a fabulous movie. The plot may be a bit confusing, but the film has such a great atmosphere that I would recommend that everyone go see it. <br /> <br /> And I wouldn't recommend listening to "ccscd212" because he seems to have seen too many commercial American movies and seems too accustomed to just earning morale on a silver plate. The way I see it is not much in this film that tries to tell us whether suicide is right or wrong. I find it more of a warning that our society sees. But be sure everyone can see the movie in their own way.
