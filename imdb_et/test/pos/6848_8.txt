Thirty silver and fortunately a kiss. It was another completely unexpected pearl. Normally I am not even a temporary / thriller fan. This 100 minute has more turns than the boardwalk on the sidewalk. It has a titrating erotic romance that resembles "Body Heat" more than one; he has police and crime; political intrigue and just a dash of daily soap. This is just the right kind of disability violence that must be used by any professional "minor number" crime. Emma Thompson, (FBI AIC), fulfills her role with grace and humor and gets her voice against Limey's best southern accent. Alan Rickman (local policeman), who always seems to steal the show, is great, but not overflowing. They work well in pairs. Lots of misdirection of a plot that will never get out of control and get cohesive at the end of the movie. And who is this awesome woman, Carla Gugino? I want him to carry my kids. Carla, if you're there, let's have lunch
