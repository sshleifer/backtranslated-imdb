I think Vanessa Marc has cast the best actor. He makes Sami the best sign of the show. James Cann is also pretty good. I love being worried about Delinda. One of my favorite scenes when Ed and Delinda beat off some store. It was funny. Nikki Cox is also good and has great chemistry with Josh Duhamel. Lara Flynn Boyle was fantastic in his role as a guest. I wish they didn't kill him. There is a lot of pain in the show without bad actors, which is often not seen on TV. I still think Vanessa Marc is the best. He should have Emmy in my opinion. This is a shame when the show was canceled
