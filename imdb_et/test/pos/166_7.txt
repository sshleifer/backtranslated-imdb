The story of three Eclipse (maybe even Indigo, ha) who start their murder. Oh, and the people who are "hot" on their journey. <br /> <br /> Bloody Birthday, a pretty mediocre title for a movie, was a nice lil surprise. I did not expect in any way a film about bleeding psychopathic children. And I can say that this is also one of the best flicks I have with children like villains. At the end of the film, I seriously wanted these children to die in terrible fashion. <br /> <br /> This is really a sure glow of 80's fears, but how these kids get away from all this chaos and murders. you can't think. Even the smallest bit of research would easily discover those lil sh! But it seems that there are only a few police in town, finally it is just one, and he seemed nervous, so I think they could have got it. Haha, yeah, and I'm a Chinese jet pilot. <br /> <br /> However, this movie has given some evil children who were more than entertaining, a lot of premature sex and a decent amount. No kiddin! If you have left less than the letter title, strike it out of your mind and give it a flick to the picture. This is a highly recommended and undervalued 80's fears.
