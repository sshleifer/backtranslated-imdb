I found this movie to be quite enjoyable and quite fun. Good characters, good actors and enough tension to keep your interest in the best interests. The plot's twist can be a bit much, but generally a decent thriller. If you liked this movie, I would recommend a Spanish prison, a game house and a non-road.
