Beautiful .... that one word takes all this movie. All about cinematography, leadership, actor ..... brilliant. At any point in the movie, you can stop it and you will undoubtedly look at something like a mosaic or "artsy fartsy", as some people say. I assure you that, after one viewing, "Bobbycrush" will stick with your head. I know from the first experiences. Even the soundtrack is great. It goes well with the film's tone and pace. Be grateful that Cam Archer exists in this world. We need more people like him to make films that show love and shame in a totally real (and surreal) design.
