Another fabulous movie from Catherine Breillat, this time about how hard it is to shoot sex. Using Comedy? a new genre for Breillat? we see filmmaking views, but in documentary style. In a letter that plays as a film director based on Breillat, this sex element has been taken from her earlier film "A Ma Soeur", as is a teenage actor. But the film, like all Breillat's work, is not just entertainment. It has philosophical observations about the nature of sexuality, as well as a commitment to purity (as opposed to pornography), which is the cornerstone of Breillat's work and a commitment to true emotion. We see that the director's character designs the young lead actor and actor to bring the best out, hypnotizing them into the parts they need to play, pointing out what the director sees in them, but they can't see themselves until they have the heights of their behavior what he calls. He makes meaningful films, not titration, but shows what work is needed to create it, and gives us an overview (decisively French) of the film making process as well as the psychology of men? female sexuality.
