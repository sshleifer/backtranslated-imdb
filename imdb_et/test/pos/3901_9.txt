It was a riveting film that really pulled me in. I'm a big fan of William H. Macy and he's doing great. His great pleasure with the way his character breaks into the fourth wall gave me a sense of familiarity with his actions. I found myself unexpectedly that the whole house of cards would come down around him (and for himself, his trustee and the silent witness). After the movie ended, it took me several minutes to shut it down. <br /> <br /> Well, not just with Macy, there are good results. Arkin was pretty good, like Cromwell (he was surprisingly tough). In short, I recommend this to Macy and / or the mystery of murder. But you may want to get a little guilty.
