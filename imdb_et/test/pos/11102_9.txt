This film is an excellent job of bringing us all the way through espionage from the beginning of the dark tunnel to the final counting. The effect of the film is even deeper in understanding that it is based on a real story. Timothy Hutton offers us high quality, undervalued work, and Sean Penn shows why he is one of America's best living actors. As with "Midnight Express", this movie should make us all think about doing something we shouldn't do in a foreign country.
