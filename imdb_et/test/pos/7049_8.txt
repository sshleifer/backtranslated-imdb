I know it was a funny movie, but I enjoyed it enormously. This is one experience that makes me smile when someone says "Bill Murray." I almost always like movies with a sister, and this film has more underdogs than you think. This is a generic kind of movie - some adults are not tightly packed, but laughter is more like brutal than so many teen movies. Rich kids across the lake are beating, but someone I don't know at all. I never went to camp, but I did some things that were somewhat parallel and most of the bits and tricks ran true. They were even underestimated at times, but I am sure it was an accident. Casted well, Bill Murray shows tips on what he would get. It is neither Groundhog Day nor Broken Flowers, but hey, a good joke laugh should be evaluated today, but then ... it's not important ................. ...... ........
