I found this movie to find an intriguing assumption and comments while reading and being an Angel fan. It's sexy and original and quite fun. David Boreanaz is Keith. He is a hunky married man, staying at home with his father, and he feels a bit inadequate in his marriage. She makes a mistake when she penetrates the teenage girls who are fascinated by the idea of ​​doing it with an older man. They do something to enter their bed, including begging, lying and extortion, but they usually try to push their buttons. The knee that arises, sends Keith rolling and pushes friendships. David Boreanaz shows some skin in this skin - and he looks hot. Yeah, he's playing buggy but he shows enough vulnerability and tenderness to whore teens that you will eventually entertain him. Another thing, if somebody's runny "oh yeah, oh..oh..YEAH!", It's hard to see them as a victim of rape.
