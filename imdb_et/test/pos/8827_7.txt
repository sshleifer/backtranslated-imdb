My main criticism is simply that it is not long enough or detailed enough. I would have loved seeing more of everything: shipbuilding, engineering, training, first lifting, preparing for departure, Venus orbital injection, everything. I would have liked to see more of the first leg of Venus on Earth instead of nip like a n Â° 10 bus. In fact, I would have liked to see a series made on this Earth Story scale, devoted to every planet for an hour, and maybe another around the sun. As it was, I stayed hungry. On the other hand, I understand the budgets and the attention of viewers. <br /> <br /> Re science: let's be honest about the delay in the speed of light: they mentioned in the beginning that there was a delay in the conversation, but they let it evaporate when they got into the outer plans. Observers had to be interviewed and we must assume that the delay was changed for the sake of delicacy; so there are no complaints there. But zero is noisy spacecraft. The only film in which the spacecraft did not sound was Kubrick's 2001, and even then he ended up using the noise of a breathing crew in his helmet, which * was * quite effective. I want Space Odyssey makers to realize how shameful it is to see the sight of big rocket engines exploding in absolute silence, but unfortunately Pegasus gives much of the same roaring as every other cardboard spacecraft in every other cardboard sci-fi movie. But the rest of the science was great. There are no complaints there, in fact, they did as well as they did to develop the radiation problems. I just hope that making this movie doesn't really allow the BBC to make a detailed version, but I think it's not next week or next year.
