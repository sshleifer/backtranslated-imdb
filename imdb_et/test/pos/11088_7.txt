"The Falcon and Snowman" is a story of two young men, CIA workers and drug dealers who are tortured by US foreign policy and sell state secrets to the Soviet Union. Movie events are based on a real story. <br /> <br /> Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn are convincing in the traction elements and are developing interesting testimonials. Supporting pain relief works well, especially when David Suchet introduces the fame of Hercules Poirot as a Soviet representative. <br /> <br /> The film is generally effective in presenting and developing its assumptions, and in giving it two boys tried something they didn't understand. But it seems too long and cumbersome on the middle points. However, the end is tense, stunning and effective. Music is accompanied by memorable rock songs, but unfortunately there is a repetitive soft synthesizer that is not suited to spy. There are other spy films that are worth more than "The Falcon and Snowman", but it is still a decent film.
