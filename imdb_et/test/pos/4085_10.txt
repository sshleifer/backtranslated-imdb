I don't usually like such a movie, but I worked at home and wanted to see something halfway. I got so invaded that I quit the job just to sit down and stop watching the last half hour uninterrupted. And I'm not sure that this exhibition usually doesn't break, but I cried at the end. Much emotional nuance. Great functioning and good south feeling. John Corbett is one of the most talented actors out there and the man who played Luke was also very good. Highly recommended.
