Everyone told me that this movie wasn't really good and sick, so I finally rented it and I was surprised. I thought torture was much worse, but it was a shocking end, but it was. I wouldn't call it a horror movie, maybe a mystery or something under the sheer silence category and / or a kiss for girls. Sometimes it became a fool, but the rest of the film left me on the edge of my place. 7/10 <br /> <br /> R R - Strong Torture, Violence, Language and Sexuality
