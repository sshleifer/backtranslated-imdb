This film is probably Hal Hartley's best. An exceptionally original theme is (it is common with Hal Hartley) with great humor. This feature is not the only quality of the film at all: crafty frame composition (all parallel, up to the smallest detail), shooting angles, lighting that gives them supernatural dimensions for those vague images (Jesus didn't come down) t to be filmed in the usual way) there are false "poser" functional features that change the Bible's re-reading in the form of apocalyptic delirium.
