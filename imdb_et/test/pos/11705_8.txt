It's the first Australian comedian Mick Molloy's feature film. Mick wrote the film with his brother Richard, with the help of John Clark, another comedian and actor. Mick & John also has several other Australian actors - Bill Hunter, Frank Wilson and others. The main prerequisite for the film is that Jacky Simpson (Mick Molloy) has become a member of Lawn Bowls Club just to get free parking next to his job. The club is terribly calm and calls Jack up. John Clarke plays in the club arch nemesis - he tries to take over the club and turn it into a "Poker Machine Slum" Jack and other club members into a band to try and save the club with many funny twists and final redemptions of Jacks. This is a pretty smart little movie. It is well above Mick Molloys' usual rust. It's pretty well written and worked well. Older Aussie actors are brilliant (Bill Hunter, Frank Wilson Monica Maughan and ors) The film tends to break at the pace of the neck, but adds the charm of the film. There's a low coarse tongue.
