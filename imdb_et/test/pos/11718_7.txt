I think this is one of Burst's top five films with Deliverance, Smokey and Bandit, Boogie Nights and City Heat. He also led it, so he also had the talent for his friend Clint Eastwood. I wish he made more movies or even a sequel to Sharkys Machine than Stroker Ace or Cannonball Run II. It's a tough, sharp policeman Triller with Reynolds at the top of his game. Thorn Bird's famous Rachel Ward celebrity also contributed. Henry Silva is a bad guy and he always does a good job. The film is also a great soundtrack. I highly recommend this, I would like it to be on a DVD in the UK, as well as a good comment from Reynolds. *** 7/10 ***
