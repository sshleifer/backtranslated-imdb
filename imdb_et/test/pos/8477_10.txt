Brilliant Biographical FILM ?????? .. <br /> <br /> Well this certainly is one of my very interesting. Biographical film. This movie came to me as a surprise. I had avoided this movie for a very long time. Now, because I'm not a fan of Jamie Foxx. I'm still not his big fan. But I'm sure I'm now FAN. Well He Served All That Oscar Bit. His performance is one of the best performances I've seen for a long time. He's really sensational! <br /> <br /> Well, narration or story flow is great for Biographical Film. I'm a DRAMA fan so I wasn't bored at all. <br /> <br /> I was too surprised that the movie likes so much that I didn't see any mistakes in the movie. I think there is no mistake in the movie. Maybe some bugs in the events, but hey, who cares? <br /> <br /> The performance of the woman who plays the ray mother was also very good. And well, Kerry Washington? he has so much potential ... if he's got the right role, he can just be the next Oscar winner. Well, their story movie was so EMOTIONAL, so TOUCHING .. I cried out? I cried very badly ???? <br /> <br /> Can't I fucking fucking crazy if things were cuz or not? And that's a lot for me! <br /> <br /> The whole SUPERB FILM ???? One of the best parameters of this century! <br /> <br /> 10/10
