Gloria Swanson (like Leila Porter) is a reasonably boring woman. Work-sensitive husband Elliott Dexter (like James Denby Porter) has lost his romance at his waist; he also smokes a cigar in bed, eats onions and snores. He can hardly remember his anniversary - where Caddy Lew Cody (Schuyler Van Sutphen) is involved; The younger man sees Mrs. Swanson's wonderful figure and flabby unimaginably. Soon Swanson will be pulled out of Mr Codyni. Then Mr Dexter decides to try and get back. Who wins? <br /> <br /> These three principals are good, Swanson is the most impressive turn in the central role of a woman. Julia Faye grabs Cody for other interests, "Toodles"; beside the screen, he persecuted director Cecil B. DeMille. DeMille's touch is obvious; especially in the imaginary order where Cody promises to Swanson ... "Pleasure Wealth? Love ??" <br /> <br /> ******* Don't change your spouse (1/26/19) Cecil B. DeMille ~ Gloria Swanson, Elliott Dexter, Lew Cody
