I think it's the first time I've seen Roscoe's 'Fatty' Arbuckle movie. I really liked his (title) role as a meat worker boy. The way he moves is, in my opinion, very funny, for example, how he starts handling his knife and how he rolls a cigarette. I think he is a good actor; his facial expressions really fit his role, for example, how he finally stands out for the audience. But it may be added that it was probably not too difficult. Anyway, I think he would have served a longer career. As you probably know, those greedy journalists who made money by printing the wrong accusations, saying that he was involved in a scandal, were destroyed. <br /> <br /> Plot is not very important. In the first half of the year, Fatty and Alum are employees and competitors of Almondine. After a heavy food struggle, Almondine sends her father, the shop owner, to the girls' school. (This is the beginning of the second half). Both Fatty and Alum enter school, and the fight for Almondine continues. (Some of the names of the characters are in different versions I've seen. For some reason, they seem to have replaced the original title cards with new ones.) <br /> <br /> Food struggles and exercises, but I think they're well done. And there are some gags that I really liked, like how do they make a pepper mill (or is it a coffee maker?) Or a scene when Fatty dons coat, though it's not obviously needed, or when Miss Teachem, a girl's school head, she determines fat and she shifts her back. <br /> <br /> Buster Keaton is also funny, his first film; good addition to the majority. In the first half of the year, he is a customer of the store, while in the second half he is supporting Alumit for fighting Almondine. I liked her acrobatics, for example, when Fatty pulls her from one room to another, she doesn't show a simple exercise, but lands on her hands and over and makes a small pirouette. Look at one scene in the food struggle: Alum throws a flour bag at him, but stays between the shop owner instead. This makes Buster ridiculous, which must be rare, as he usually always shows a neutral expression (which - as you probably already know - got his nickname "Big Stone Face"). (One more note: Al St. John, who plays Alum, was the "Fatty" brother of Arbuckle and later became famous for the role of "Fuzzy" he played in many parts of the West.) <br /> <br /> I don't like as much as I like, such as "One Week" and "The Balloonatic" (movies that Buster later did without Fatty). And it didn't make me laugh often, but it made me smile so I gave him eight points.
