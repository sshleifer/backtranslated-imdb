Gary Cooper is the cool driver. I always liked his simple level to be controlled by characters. As some others have commented, there are some wonderful things in the script, such as the US Marshall, who got his job and can't even help with the gun. A hobur who has about thirty hands but is unable to prevent his herd. <br /> <br /> But there's a lot of quick thinking, right at Cooper, to keep you entertained. <br /> <br /> This film was made in 1950. People in their 20s and 30s are struggling to understand these movies for entertainment, not Oscare. <br /> <br /> We look forward to the Oscar material unfair. It's about good guys to find a way to round up the bad guys. <br /> <br /> So rent, borrow or buy this movie, pop some corn and enjoy Coop once more.
