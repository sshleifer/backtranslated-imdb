This anime reminiscent of the story of the Mamodo King Battle. Every 1000 years, 100 Mamado children are sent to the Earth to determine who their next king is (in the original Japanese, the creatures are Mamono, which literally means a magical / evil object). Every Mamado is connected to a human partner and is given a magical spelling book. Man can use this book to unleash the incredible abilities of Mamodo, and when Mamodo is defeated, their spelling is under fire (alternately, Mamdodo can catch and burn the book directly). After that, Mamodo returns to the world of Mamodo. <br /> <br /> A typical character is Zatch (Gash in Japan), a 6-year-old mamodo with an electric current. He is associated with Kiyomaru Takami and a 14-year-old genius. Zatch is initially reluctant to fight, but the doctrine that some Mamodos are evil and the king of the battle for the battle is wrong, he decided to fight to become a "kind king." <br /> <br /> Zatch Bell has been compared to Pokemon, but the better comparison is with Digimon. Like Digimon, Mamodol and Man have one symbiotic relationship. Unlike Pokemon, both displays have a real plot. <br /> <br /> Zatch Bell has character growth and evolving relationships and some relatively adult story (like love vs racism, slavery; mind control, etc.). He even has some decent land and secrets.
