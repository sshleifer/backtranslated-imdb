I've just come back from Santa Fe. NM. I visited the Loretto chapel. When I looked around this building, which was acquired by a private owner, I reinstated the movie version of the staircase. It is the overwhelming mystic that occupies this building. This is what can happen if you really have faith. The bookstore has a narrative on this subject, which is the story of stairs. I read the whole narrative. I was surrounded by the surrounding ambiance. It was like we were a completely closed time thread, all with the same thoughts and awe. When we went, the huss were overwhelming. Everyone should visit the Loretto Chapel in Santa Fe. NM.
