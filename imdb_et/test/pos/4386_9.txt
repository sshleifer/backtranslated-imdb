I've seen almost all of Cenen's brothers movies and I have to say it's one of their best films. I wouldn't dare say it's better than "The Big Lebowski", but it was very good in your law. <br /> <br /> I thought this story was very interesting and fun. I loved all the characters, especially Tim Blake Nelson (Delmar) and John Turturro (Pete). <br /> <br /> There's really nothing to say about this movie, but this movie isn't for everyone. It may be safe to say that if you liked other Coen brothers, then hopefully it will also like it. And if you liked what the trailer saw, I think you like the movie, but don't hold me on it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I hope you like the movie as much as I do. Thank you for reading, <br /> <br /> Crisis
