One of the two best films of the year. Well-filmed, well-written, well-assembled film with outstanding pain. Lau Ching Wan and his friends (Dayo Wong Chi Wa, Anthony Wong Chau Sun, Francis Ng Chun Yu, Jordan Chan Siu Chun, Cheung Man Tat) were great chemistry before the movie and their friendship shows. Theresa Lee plays well in her comedy role (although similar to Michael Wong's female version, it seems her gag looks like a Chinese born abroad, surrounded by local HKers.) And I found myself delighted by the innovative explosives I haven't made since the first fan boys took alt.asian movies and 2. John woo's hardboiled. Certainly the end was awaited, but I feel better at the police than the members of the young gangs. Very enjoyable.
