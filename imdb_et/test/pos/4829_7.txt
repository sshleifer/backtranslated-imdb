"Wicked Little Things" really separates from other zombie films. First of all, all the zombies on the film will not bite you and tear your flesh with your bare hands. and eat you after the congregations. Second, they can't die. In most zombie films you can shoot a zombie and kill, but they just don't die. Third, what is the biggest reason why this film separates itself, all zombies are children. How did they die exactly to get zombies? They worked in the coal mine when they were all killed during the collapse. Now they migrate to a forest that carries its picnics and shovels, waiting for someone to come to kill them and eat them. at night, only at night. This makes the movie even more fun if it came out in the morning. Despite all the violent and enjoyable disturbances of this movie, Wicked Little Things is a great choice if you are looking for a movie about zombie children. Don't expect anything big like "dead Dawn" or "dead land", but don't expect much gore and violence that makes this movie a real zombie stranger. Give Scout Taylor-Compton a big hand from Rob Zombie's Halloween, which gives you great performance like what he did on 'Halloween'.
