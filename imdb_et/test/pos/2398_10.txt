I was just looking at Eddie Monroe and I was very impressed. The story was easy to keep pace when the plot unleashed. The screen was filled with warming performances, activities, humor and drama. Some talented Long Islanders are working on top level. Great script. This is the best film Fred Carpenter has done so far, he should be very proud of this work. Doug Brown's score is on the mark. Craig Morris is the next Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt. It's hard to believe it's a small budget, an independent film. Imagine what Carpenter can do with a Hollywood budget. Paul Regina's last movie and he's all very much left and loved. He was a great, successful, talented actor and a great person. He is following us all and we will never forget our dynamic smile and spirit. Great work for everyone who participated in this movie. Some spiritual scenes that steal and humorous came to break down the serious content. You enjoy this movie, watch it!
