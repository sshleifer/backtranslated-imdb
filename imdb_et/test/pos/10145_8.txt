This is another fun and fun Hitchcock movie. James Stewart and Doris Day are incredible in this movie. Bernard Herrmann appears near his climax. <br /> <br /> Landscapes and locations are great except for one scene where the background was obviously fake, which makes no sense for me since the scenes before and after were in the same place and they were real location shots. I've heard that Hitchcock sometimes did it for a purpose. <br /> <br /> Reviews of this movie seem to be confusing. I think it's better than the average Hitchcock movie. Very fun and at the end it's very light comic. <br /> <br /> I rated this movie from 8 out of 10. <br /> <br />
