Otto Preminger was one of the biggest film directors. Like John Huston, he was one of his films, like Mr Huston, he was a wonderful ham who slipped in and out randomly, but his final result was unmistakably his own. With some exceptions, movies are now being made by companies, not by individuals, so they are usually very polished "packages", the product is much the same as golf ball, tin dog food or car is people's participation in the process is almost random. , with shiny, superficially entertaining, but ultimately empty movies that are flooding numerous TV channels and movies For a person like Mr Preminger, there is no time to stand a little "product" and craft alongside a personal work of art. Of course, there has always been the art of "art for the sake of art - money for Christ", but now "Ars Gratia Artis" has sent the history of cutting the whole name, but not the name. Today, Otto Preminger would have managed to get a pizza job in Hollywood. Half a century ago, having been very influential, "Laura", "Where the pavement ends" and "The moon is blue", she filmed Nelson Algren's controversial novel "Man with Golden Hand" in his eccentric and individualistic way Instead of taking his camera off the streets he stayed in the studio and used stylized almost expressionistic sets, peculiar castings (Mr. Frank Sinatra - hot from his progress "From here to eternity", young, inexperienced but breathtakingly beautiful Miss Kim Novak and Arnold Stang, the man whose strangeness was for his own heart , and a remarkable era - Elmer Bernstein's West Coast jazz men's cream set. Otto Preminger's film was always an all-encompassing experience, not considered to work, direction, photographer. What appeared on the screen was Preming's vision, his creation and his interpretation The Algrenian novel, not the Algrenian novel, one of the twenty competent Hollywood cages. The first Hi-Hat competition, which comes with the title, is pulling Preminger's modern Life, which is indeed a hustlers, junkies, police, drug dealers, rock-hardened area. jazz musicians, their wives and hangers - the "Life" lines are blurred, and this dog eats a dog. Residents circulate each other like sharks, looking for a sign of weakness to be exploited.Frankie Machine (Mr Sinatra) professional card dealer, former junkie and ambitious jazz is born a victim.If things are tough, he goes back to the needle. there is absolutely no guarantee that he will not go straight back with a straight line. Mr. Sinatra depicts dependence on the angle of withdrawal from critics, but the fact is that, even fifty years later, most of us have probably never seen such a thing in real life, so we do not know how accurate it was when I first saw the film in the late 50s, I was very impressed published by watching it recently on the video, it seemed uncomfortable, hammy.Perhaps, as a victim of his own success, so many participants who later "make" a cold turkey have over the years taken their report and refined it somewhat. Arnold Stang is Sparrow, a prominent machine beam, a performance he has only "It's crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy world". Try it out on the big screen and watch it as a true vision of the movie's vision, the giant modern-day Pygmies - Otto Preminger.
