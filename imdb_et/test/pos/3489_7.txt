Alter Egos will not be more fun than the creation of Sacha Baron Cohen Ali G. His erroneous and inexistent misconception of the suburbs of the Middle East, which his social background consists of. He continues living the Los Angeles Gansta style. Still living with Graniga, in London's suburb of Staines, he controls his tight control over Posse, West Staines' Massiv. <br /> <br /> Spending time with my Julie, her girlfriend, Posse and teaching local eight-year-old scouts "Keep it truly (advanced)" in the government-funded John Nike Leisure Center. <br /> <br /> This is where the story begins, saying that government funding is over, Ali G will continue to pursue one man's "Fighting Human Rights, which I am willing to live like Martin Luther Van Dross". Being his response to the local media team when he interviewed him about a hunger strike linked to a fence. <br /> <br /> Charles Dance is here with David Carlton, an evil and evil deputy prime minister who is "even more eviller than Skeletor." Using Ali G, the prime minister loses 18,000 votes three weeks before the general election. G is a bumblebee idiot, he's a plan for a setback. Ali G suddenly gets overnight and a lifeguard, working directly with the prime minister. This story becomes ever more unhappy and fun. <br /> <br /> Ali G Indahouse is a great British film brings very talented written attributes along with acting and acting with Dan Mazer, Sacha Baron Cohen, Charles Dance and Michael Gambon, like PM to play their parts very seriously between gags and fun, Ali G. <br /> <br /> Ironically, Seeing the parodies that play their parts in the world that are truly real and constantly proclaiming "Keep this real" from their little world, which is West Staines, "Massiv" is a true comic paradox. <br /> <br /> Directed by Mark Mylod, his first feature-length feature, he has directed some television, such as Shameless, Shooting Stars, The Fast Show, and Reev and Mortimer. <br /> <br /> Very real and very funny.
