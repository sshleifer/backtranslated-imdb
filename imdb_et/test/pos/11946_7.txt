I adore this movie as much as someone adores watching what they saw when they were young. it was one of the movies that Home Box Office showed every other day throughout their youth. this movie is forever in my brain. Someone who has not grown around this movie may have become corrupted in the ADD cycle that has been running since the mid-1990s, and it may be harder to gauge this jewel. yes it is because my inside was doping "better dead" before i saw it (what I raped and loved) - and no one, NO, can deny acceptance of uncomfortable teenage humor in the American cinema in the 80s - it gave birth to everything we have found Tired of teen comedies because of all the slow mo, current soundtrack, new technology. I don't know if the cinema goes to their roots ... It's a teen comedy ... YES!
