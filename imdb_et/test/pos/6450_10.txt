I'm so glad Zac was "the life of the Zack and Cody suites" because it's my favorite show and he's my favorite actor. It's really a funny episode and a funny show! I love everything about the show and the characters. All the performers are great. Continue on with Zac, and I'm so happy that almost all of my favorite actors (including High School Musical) are at this stage. Zac Efron is so "hot" and I have an autographed picture of him! It's not a photocopy, and it came from all over America to Australia, and it didn't reach almost Christmas. I also got a High School Musical Mug with this name. (Scarlett 8)
