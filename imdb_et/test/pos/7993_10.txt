I have enjoyed this movie since my child and I still do. I liked Batman forever, but the real difference is that this movie wasn't the day I grew up. I noticed a few scenes in this movie that didn't make any sense, like: 'Hhmm ... the crowd is angry. Hey! Where did they get these tomatoes? Then I thought, "Who cares?" This movie is not 100% serious anyway! "<br /> <br /> The original Tim Burton Batman was also great, but in some parts it was a bit cheesy and I didn't like all the actors. This film improved in almost every aspect with great pain, more Gothic and Prince's absence. Today, many of Christopher Nolan's films do not like Burton, arguing that Nolan's films are more serious and therefore more loyal to comics. I don't think this is absolutely true: - Batman's original concept has never been adapted, which was a terrible criminal with a weapon. -Batman has, over the years, taken on many forms that, in his 60s (and a little bit with Batman & Robin), are watching his stupidity. The director has the freedom to choose which Batman he is, if it is good. <br /> <br /> My opinion: Batman doesn't have to be serious. This is a man with a rubber suit, with sharp ears. Burton managed to create a perfect balance between stupidity and the darkness surrounding the whole idea. <br /> <br /> I recently watched Nolan movies and I love them too (especially The Dark Knight). There's just something in this movie that interests me more. Nolan's goal was to give the character much deeper, and in doing so he was looking for an explanation for almost every aspect of Batman. It's a bit too much for me, I'm a bigger fan of Batman's more abstract version. Burton's movies are more in the theater and in the middle of the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> My conclusion is that you should not compare Nolan with Burton movies. They are just different and you decide which one you like. My respect is for both directors.
