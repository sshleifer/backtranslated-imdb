No idea what I'm experiencing in 1940 when watching this old movie. I always enjoy watching Laraine's Day (Katie Lattimer), who plays the role of Jean Muir (Helen Lattimer) and their mother's younger sister. Billie Burke, (Mrs. Julia Lattimer). I thought I had a boring story about two sisters and mothers who had defended her daughters too long until they met Robert Cummings (Ridley Crane), known as a millionaire playboy, who has a lot of gals and is a heavy drinker who's always half. One night Helen meets Lattimer Ridley and she's going to bomb her and just can't drive her car. This is the movie at the moment when it becomes a drama and changes the full direction of this movie, which will definitely keep your attention right until the end of the movie.
