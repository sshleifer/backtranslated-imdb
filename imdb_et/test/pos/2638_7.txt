_ Wild Life_ is obviously similar to _Fast Times Ridgemont High_ and _The Wild Life_ is short. <br /> <br /> ------------ <br /> <br /> In another, the above commented. Of course there is no Wild Life Ridgemont. Ridgemont is the 80's flint. But Wild Life is enjoyable if you do not want to consider meaningless movies to be foolish movies (especially if you know that it should be a nonsense movie first). The little Latino Scarface is in this movie and he is directly disrespectful ("I have Visa ... Masterrrrr Charrrrge !!") The Colonel also appears ("Case ..."). RIP Colonel 1931-1997. <br /> <br /> This movie is no worse than 6 compared to other genres, btw. It is no worse than 7 for 80's teenage teenagers. This is a great film about Cameron Crowe. Only staniels gave it 5.
