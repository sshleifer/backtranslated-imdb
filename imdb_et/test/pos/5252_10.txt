The exhaustion of Amalia Rodriques's music and the almost intolerable melancholy goes into the soul, where only music can interfere. In her voice and magical presence, Fado's exquisite torment lies in the art form I didn't know until that movie. <br /> <br /> For me, the success of this beautifully and lovingly designed documentary is due to the fact that the filmmaker opposes the temptation to edit and simply allows us to share the magnetism and elegant passion of that icon. There seems to be an inevitable corrosion between the Portuguese Fado and the American blues. <br /> <br /> Creating documentaries best brings us to an unknown reality. and we have been redesigned to allow this glimpse. <br /> <br /> Abrigado, Sr.de Almeida
