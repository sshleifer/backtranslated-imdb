E. Elias Merhige's existentialist experiment is definitely one of the boring bells. It's like something that Alexander de Large was forced to look at "Clock Orange". But despite the fact that this film is really invisible, it is a success. <br /> <br /> If you read it and haven't seen the movie, it's too late. For me, at least the reward (after 3 different views with a lot of difference in mind) saw the characters * after the story was spoken. Then a simple message hit home. But I don't know if Merhige could have said a 5-minute story about 30, not 78. is already out of the bag and you will only appreciate this movie if you appreciate making an existentialist film of the early 20th century. Even then, maybe you can.
