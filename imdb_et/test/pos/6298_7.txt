I have read that Paolo Sorrintino's inspiration for the consequences of Love was simply due to the fact that he was watching a businessman in a Brazilian hotel and speculating on what he could do there. The film opens up like us. We see the presence of Titta, who has lived alone in a Swiss hotel for 8 years. He is secret and avoids friendship. His life dominates regularly and regularly. Gradually we find out the truth about his existence, until finally his world begins to disintegrate. <br /> <br /> Titta's secret is at the heart of the consequences of love, and it works very much thanks to Toni Servillo's great performance. His character becomes even more intriguing when little details come to light - that he injects heroin once a week to have no imagination. While some here are criticizing a dialogue that is not naturalistic, this is not, in my opinion, important - it is not such a film, and I think the script is great. Camera work is also great. <br /> <br /> If you need to criticize, the film will lose its way in later scenes because the secret of Titta's existence has been revealed to us and her world is starting to fall. But the tragic latest scenes are all as good as the previous architecture.
