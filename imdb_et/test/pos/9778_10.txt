It must be one of Australia's best productions. I do not agree with RamiNour101 comments. <br /> <br /> This series shows the depth and length of Australia's friendship they used to help each other. Episode Five 'Eddies' Birthday is an excellent example of this and it really strikes the Australian spirit. <br /> <br /> The music used in the series only emphasized the situation where men are facing, their longing for home and their loved ones. The numerous fun transitions of The Road to Gundagai reflect the spirit of men and the fact that they did not forget their home, and that they were few elements like singing a song that took them home for a short time. <br /> As for the comment that this is racist towards the Japanese people, the only thing to say is that you can't change what happened. The Japanese were badly treated and represented by the Australian Changi, otherwise it would be very misleading. The comment about the exact scenario is also wrong. The seven stories that are spoken in the series consist of real P.O.W experiences. <br /> <br /> The actors were great; the best is in my opinion Matthew Newton. His performance in David in the first episode was intestinal. Being a cousin, being an unfamiliar face to his strangers. We see him dramatically changing in his first episode because of his violent attack in the jungle, and in further episodes we see how one event has changed him, he is more aware of what is actually happening and is always one of the first. to help the secret members of the other nine. <br /> <br /> Stephen Curry also deserves mention. Her performance on Eddie's birthday is an amazing group of larrikine, sickness, weakness and self-care. The male exhibitions in this episode touch you on an emotional level and give you the pride of being an Australian. it includes the true spirit that he was supposed to be an Australian soldier. <br /> <br /> Well done to John Doyle to capture Chang's spirit.
