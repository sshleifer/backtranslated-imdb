When I first heard that this movie was going to be done, I was very pleased to see it. The ideas for making a caliber movie, as good as it was, must have been very difficult. I wasn't quite sure if anyone could cover all the amazing features of the Pope in the movie, but the film made his memory fair. In my opinion, the most important task was to expose the people who started the Pope. His films in Poland until the last day in the Vatican followed this film for every aspect of his life. Thomas Kretschmann, a man who played the pope in his adulthood and did so, did a great job in achieving emotions. In general, this film was educational, but also very fun.
