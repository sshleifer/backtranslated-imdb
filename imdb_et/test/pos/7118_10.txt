I don't play video games at all, but my kids do it. <br /> <br /> I got a big kick from this. Would like to see more of this type of movie. "very cool" as my youngest would say. <br /> <br /> Interesting characters and the whole story were interesting. As I said, I don't play video games, but I think my kids would enjoy it. It wasn't full of bad language and it's a pleasant change. This visual concept was different, which caught my eye. In addition, the sound track was pretty good. You can even try some of the games my son plays with this movie. Who knows, maybe I've ever been a player.
