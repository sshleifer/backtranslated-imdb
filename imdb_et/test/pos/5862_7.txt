Barbet Schroeder's "Numbers of Murts by", starring Sandra Bullock, is a solid job, though not particularly convincing. I'm a big fan of Sandra Bullock, and she is here an effective forensic detective, Cassie Mayweather, who is not a very pleasant and also a broken person. Nevertheless, the story is inseparable from the structure. It's about a perfect murder by two spoiled socias, Richard (Ryan Gusling), who is cool and Justin (Michael Pitt) who is a sympathetic geek. Basically, Richard and Justin kill a young woman because they have nothing better on school day. They are very intelligent and arrogant, which is usually not bad, but it just doesn't work. Tony Gayton's manuscript is an excellent job of describing in detail the investigation of a mysterious murder, and it is truly numbered. We have those two punk children who suffer from their superiority, and we just want them to fall. <br /> <br /> This is not a big exploration on the dark side, like Schr√∂der's Fortune of Fortune on Claus von Bulow. "Numbers" are interesting turns. The film is not so much a thriller, but rather a typical study by Cassie. Sandra Bullock balances Cassie's bravot, her fear of allowing people to come in with her and her secret past. Bullock brings courage and strength to patience. His partner and kind of love interests, Sam (played by Ben Chaplin), are more plot unconcealing than the actual character. Though Chaplin makes an astonishing thing very admirable. Another nice touch is Richard and Justin associated with strange sexual attraction. The most interesting thing about "Numbers" is Pitt and Gusling. <br /> <br /> The movie has many entertaining turns. Everything is very competent. I saw the movie about a week ago and backwards I like it a little more than I saw. But it's not just inspired work. Sandra Bullock and Barbet Schroeder deserve much better and so are we.
