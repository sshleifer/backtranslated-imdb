The film transcends all expectations, an excellent view of the human condition. What drives Milat to color her ass. What could make a person so far away that there is the only way to escape, to be repeatedly painted by strangers. <br /> <br /> This movie is not afraid of stair steps in front of a professional picture. Just breathtaking. Roll the sequel or whatever is the next genius who did it.
