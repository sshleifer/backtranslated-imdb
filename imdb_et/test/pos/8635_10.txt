I've loved this movie because I was a little child. I remember the evening my mother brought me to this movie. I loved it and I still do. I think it's very funny and original. There are also very memorable stories in this movie. Lou is also a surprisingly good singer. Actors representing Prince Arthur and Princess Eloise are also fine, but Abbott and Costello are the best. Former heavyweight boxing buddy Buddy Baer, ​​as well as the former heavyweight champion Max Baer's brother, is good in this movie as a policeman and giant. He's a better actor than a boxer. He had a natural talent. The beginning of this movie is fun, as Lou Costello runs into a car and is in trouble with Buddy Baer. The house is very good. I especially like comedy in a giant castle. My favorite items are; part was Lou climb beanstalk and they all sing as goodbye. Jack sings back to them to return. Lou Costello is a very good singing. My second favorite is when Jack fights the giant. I like Jack making explosive eggs and trying to explode a giant omelet. Abbott and Costello are fun and the greatest comedians of all time. This is just one of their great films I love and love. Reviews of this movie aren't very good and I don't understand why. This is a very good Abbott and Costello movie. I also love how Lou Costello finally returns to reality and thinks he's dreaming when Bud hits him. He sings his song and leaves in an attitude like no one is going to push me. Very good movie.
