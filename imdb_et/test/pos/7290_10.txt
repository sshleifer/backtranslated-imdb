"Here on Earth" is a surprisingly beautiful romantic story about Samantha, who has both boys' problems and health problems. As her love for her current boyfriend Jasper disappears, she loves Kelley's flowering as a new spring flower. <br /> <br /> I found this movie very moving, very warm, very romantic and touching. I enjoyed this movie a bit ... and it's quite rare! I recommend this movie to all film students! This is one movie you don't want to miss !!! : D <br /> <br /> By the way ... if you are a very sentimental person who just cries easily while watching movies, TYPES !!! On the other hand it was a really good movie !!! Very romantic ... and surprisingly good !!! : D <br /> <br />
