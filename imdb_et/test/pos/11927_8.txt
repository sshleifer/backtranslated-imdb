It was a big surprise for me. I had never heard of this movie the first time I saw it, and the title really drove something other than a great terrorist / hostage situation in high school. Game soldiers have been the best since the beginning of the 1990s, when action films were light and very enjoyable. The action is good, the plot is interesting and up, a bad boy is a one-dimensional angry douchebag (which is great), Louis Gossett Jr is in it, it's just a good self-conscious movie that I enjoyed thoroughly. <br /> <br /> You can't go wrong with it if you want to act. I'll give her a solid rating of 8/10.
