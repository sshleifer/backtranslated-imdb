Start by first saying that I've been the most punk punk fan of my life. I've always been respectful of the LA scene of the early 1980s, which, with the exception of the X and Black flags, is more of a New York and English punk boy than the decline of Western civilization documents. After that movie, totally changed, I saw. The people shown may look like idiotic, kids who think they can do something outside of Cree through their lifestyle, but this is a great show for hedonism, at best with a fun, loud rock n role. One of the best scenes and, in fact, the most understandable is the interview with the Catholic discipline Claude Bessy or "Kick-Boy" because he was known to the readers of the Slash magazine. Originally from France, he comes from the punk as a dirty old Frenchman and watches on the viewpoints of many punk or DIY aspects, music, politics and life in general. Darby Crash of Germs comes most of the time as a complete idiot, but the performance of the Manimal pigs is pretty decent, with the young Pat Smear. Black flag performance with a Chavo Pederast vocal (filmed a few years before Henry Rollins joined the band) is decent, and X and FEAR give the best performances. Watch interviews with young punk kids. You'll hear some of the funniest things you've ever heard in a documentary. Highly recommended.
