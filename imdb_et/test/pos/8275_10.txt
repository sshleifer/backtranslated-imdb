SHOW SCREEN: Dave Seville, Chipmunk's brother Alvin, Simon & Theodore's grandfather and manager, has gone on a business trip to Europe, leaving boys home as an observer to Miss Miller, much to attract Alvin. who wanted to go to Europe. Playing with her female colleague Brittany, Chipett's leader, consisted of her younger sisters Jeanette (Simon's female colleague) and Eleanor (Theodore's female colleague) in a 30-day Around the World arcade game. they are trying to pay attention to the two evil foreign countries that need money and diamond smuggling around the world, but need this opportunity that does not attract the attention of their archaic Yamal. Two evil siblings, Claudia & Klaus, heard of the divorce between Alvin and Brittany and decided to use them as looting boys and girls (more Claudia's ideas than Klaus's, the last feeling that it is too dangerous for children). Two sister-brothers offer boys and girls - flying balloons to 12 points to leave kids-like dolls containing diamonds and / or money to show their arrival, promising whoever wins the win will get an uncomfortable amount of money. But if the two siblings of the different animals being spoken make their rounds, they are led by Yamal's minions - but who is Jamal? Is he a friend or an enemy? <br /> <br /> GENERAL: An enjoyable, light-weighted farce based on the 1980s Alvin & Chipmunks TV series. Beautiful animation is highlighted, there is no raw humor that keeps today's family movies and interesting songs (Boys & Girls of Rock & Roll special). Eagle eyed fans will probably notice that the Bretagne character's design has been cut from the animated series, giving it a less rounded face, adding a seemingly persistent blush to the cheeks (also displayed by Jeanette & Eleanor). <br /> <br /> For Bart Simpson's voice for Nancy Cartwright.
