This movie is one of the best 1986 creepy but intriguing performances by Crispin Glover and Dennis Hopper! The years of the Reagan were quite blind to many people, not just teenagers, but this flick really hit despair and despair. Well-targeted with a large script (probably based on a real story), I don't see any drawbacks in this regard. Keanu Reeves was a decent change and Miss Skye was on the right track. In the same year, Hopper had three more major performances (Blue Velvet, Texas Chainsaw II and Hoosiers). I imagine it has a cult and I don't know how that image would be free. Super things!
