Johnny Knoxville has gone crazy. <br /> <br /> In the first Jackass, did he enjoy more practical jokes than physical things? his opening car rental and the later bit, which included a golf field horn, were more like some type of extreme camera? but Jackass: number two, he's really out of his rock. <br /> <br /> Starting from the sequence in which he lives through a bull, or later when he is driving a rocket (a stunt that almost cost him) his life thanks to an unexpected explosion on the rocket side) and especially when he deliberately stands in front of a defensive mechanism and taking the nozzle on the stomach, Knoxville is crazy. In the first film, Bam Margera and Steve-O ?? Infamous Party Animals? were bold, but you know it's pretty bad when you see Knoxville as tempting to do the tricks. <br /> <br /> This is basically a number of test players that testosterone-consuming boys are constantly trying against each other. Eventually it ends with the death of one cast member? Jackass 2 Steve-O loses his arm almost by foot, Knoxville (as mentioned above) has been blasted with a rocket explosion and so on and so on. Jackass 3 has already been confirmed thanks to 2 successes and, frankly, I can't imagine that stunt that fills a running bull at the opening point of this movie? this is an incredible material. It's almost unbelievable and I was wondering if it was fake, but apparently it was 100% genuine. (What is really frightening.) And in extreme terms, Jackass 2 exceeds his predecessor? it also seems to be more cinematic than the first film, with less cheese headlines that were previously famous in MTV TV show. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, boys got too much freedom and a good number of gage are just flat exercises for crudity? I can enjoy the occasional poop gag, but looking at the man to get rid of a miniature toilet, or look at the Steve-O beer beer (yes, honestly), the grid will come in a while. Even frat-boys attended the observation? who were enthusiastic when the Wee Man took the card at the back and got hit by a rigged chair? some of the scenes in this movie were disgusting. Isn't this a question as much as possible? it's a question to say, "Is it even fun or funny?" Unfortunately, this is not really great. But with every flat stunt that includes stool and human face, there are some great hidden camera bits. Wacky's director Spike Jonze ("Adaptation") dresses like an old woman and hits naked, streets breasts and shame. And my personal favorite skit comes with Knoxville as an irresponsible old man who, together with his granddaughter, allowed him to drink alcohol and smoke and swear and offend people. This is a classic comedy that was brought to the new extremes with R-rating freedoms. Is it a shame that they had to destroy all the great things? including the final segment that includes a complex terrorist footprint? This film has the spirit and madness to look at, and it is indeed the newest height of the cinema concept.
