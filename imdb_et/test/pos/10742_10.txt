"Kramer vs Kramer" is a terrible drama about an unhappy woman walking to her husband and young son. The man must now be responsible for taking care of the boy. As he does, they can get to know each other better. But then the mother and the woman will return and she wants custody of the boy. "Kramer vs Kramer" is a lot of drama that has some great comedies thrown for good action. Dustin Hoffman won his first best actor for his excellent Oscar performance. Most people say in their performance "Rainman", which won his second Oscar, is his best. He was great in this movie, but I disagree with the best. In my opinion, the best force in Hoffman's career is in this film. The scene after the scene shows us why Hoffman is today one of the best American actors. He's funny at times. Meryl Streep is also a terrible performer who was not as well-known when he made this film as he is today. Streep, like Hoffman, also won his first Oscar (best supporting actress) for his work in Kramer vs Kramer as a woman and mother trying to find her family after a break. Just 8-year-old Justin Henry, who came out of the movie, is great as Hoffman and Streep's son. He won the Oscar nomination for his role and is still the youngest performer to be nominated for the Oscar nomination (best supporting actor). Jane Alexander is also a good family friend. He also received an Oscar nomination (supporting actress where he lost Streep's star). "Kramer vs Kramer" is a great movie from start to finish. Writer-director Robert Benton has made a film that is completely unforgettable. <br /> <br /> **** (Four)
