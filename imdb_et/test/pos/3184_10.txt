there is only so much that I can take Filipino movies, especially nowadays, where the trend is sex, action and hate comedy (what I hate). the fact that Nasan also made me think and put down during the film was a big plus. It has good cinematic scenes, and editing was great, especially cinematography. I think Claudine deserves the best actor instead of getting in Milan. the fact that there are only so few Filipino movies that I really like. I think Cholo Laurel did this great job in this movie. really loved this movie, technically and character development; The plot was complicated and it made it terrible.
