This is undoubtedly the most exciting and satisfying film I've seen for years! The printed vision is almost banal - the ship has three suns on the desert, the ships have to adapt to the landscape and to each other, the darkness falls and the monsters appear. Pilot Fry, after somewhat cowardice during the descent of the atmosphere, when he was almost occupied by the occupants, receives the group and frees the convicted murderer, Riddicki, to lead them in the darkness of the escape ship - he is surgically one. Enhanced eyes that can be seen in the dark. But it's not that simple - every sign is complicated, three-dimensional, with contradictory features, so you never know who's good and who's bad. <br /> <br /> The performances are equally excellent - Radha Mitchell shows Fry's sharpening in control, overcoming her fears and trying to avoid further bloodshed, while Cole Hauser, like a man who takes Riddick in custody, shows that she has her own agenda and your idiosynthetic standards. But the movie belongs to Vin Diesel as Riddick - he has the most magnetic screen I've seen for years. Much of the film is in the shadow of his face and he doesn't really say much, but he draws your attention to the same. Sometimes he drives your attention, not to mention - or doesn't move. And Diesel does not characterize it as easy to do, giving it a "golden heart" - Riddick is still one of the central and cruel men when they go to the ship. Take care of yourself, who takes care of others. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is very good. Light effects are excellent at both ends of the spectrum - over-exposed triple sunlight and pitch darkness. The special effects that show both Riddick's and the monsters' points of view add to the tension, as well as the sound effects of flying and ultrasound monsters for "seeing" (monsters themselves are anatomically credible and aptly intimidating). Editing is so tight that it is occasionally dirty - in this movie, there is literally no cushioning, no loss, no time to redirect. Keep your thoughts about you. For each scene, dialogue with each line, each camera image is important. See it three times to understand it. <br /> <br /> My only warning is related to science - the solar system shown on the model is impossible (planets rotate in the sun, not vice versa). But this does not affect a person's story, so I haven't scored points for that.
