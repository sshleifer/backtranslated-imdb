Recall: Based on the true story of the American Congress, Charlie Wilson, who (according to this film) was an important US covert war against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. <br /> <br /> Comments: Quite funny movie not so funny things, especially since they were real. But focusing on the film, Hanks fills a very poor female conflict with a heartfelt champion in Afghanistan with a good heart. Hanks and the whole film Philip Seymor Hoffman has a rather humorous tone. So much so that adding comedy to the genre would be appropriate. But the story he says and perhaps the most ending is really serious. <br /> <br /> A story about what happened to some of the questions that might have been. So the movie works as a comedy if you want it, and much more serious than you want it to be. Anything for everyone? 7/10
