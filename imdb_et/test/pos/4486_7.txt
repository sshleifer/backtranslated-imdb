I think when I saw this episode, I had seen enough Twilight zones to have developed over time. Such an odd set of characters that get to the bottom of the cylinder. They're fine until a arrogant cute soldier appears in their midst. His main directive is to escape and so he gives strength and makes them work to reach the top of the cylinder. There is a lot of discussion about purpose and cause and speculation in their past, but nobody remembers anything. They represent different jobs: piper, ballerina, clown, dirty hat. Why are they there? It will lead to an adventure and finally be resolved, but I think I had a pretty good idea before it all happened.
