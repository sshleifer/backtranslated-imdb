Let's face it. <br /> <br /> This movie is an incredibly clich√©, as do Korean romantic films and movies. First of all, there are a few long-lost siblings, one of whom falls in love with others. Second, there is a not so popular girl and two proud, popular men who fall and fight over her. Third, one of these characters suffers from a tragic disease that eventually takes their lives. <br /> <br /> However, I like this movie. <br /> <br /> Without the right participants, this movie would probably be disappointed by the novel fans. But because the actors are perfect roles, the film is appealing - honestly I couldn't watch. Kang Dong Won, despite his beautiful face, gives a fantastic, cordial presentation, not to mention Lee Chung Ah and Jo Han Sun and all the supporters. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie to everyone.
