I like the show! As part of Greek life, I can say that some things are too exaggerated, but in general it is still pretty funny. <br /> <br /> Rusty is a pleasant token, his roommate is HILARIOUS and the whole cast is entertaining. I like the fact that it focuses on individual situations as well as interpersonal relationships with organizations. <br /> <br /> This exhibition includes all this, and they do it without passion or something else that is bad (how else could it be in the ABC) Family?). <br /> <br /> My favorites are Cappie (of course), Rusty roommate and pretty much Kappa Tau. This exhibition is an excellent launcher for them and I'm excited to see which doors will open. <br /> <br /> Please update this exhibition next summer, ABC Family. As I said, love love love it!
