Somebody definitely has a Wind for this and I can't believe what I saw on the screen has a lot to do. This is a better and stronger film than most of the independent people I watch all year round. Cinema has a real master of love and mastery, and the casting was just good. I would like to see more of these people, especially Zeke Rippy. <br /> <br /> As for the story and script, I'm not so sure that the negative comments that precede this post are written for information. someone else about the movie. The long, picking nipple bashing posts that have to keep up with the lesson and the only comments that the observer has ever left on this site are obvious scam artists targeted at film producers. I don't know the inner story, but it would probably be a good movie. What I know is that this is a biz, that the productions that try to be happy are usually terrible, and if the filmmaker has guts, rides and common sense to "kill the children", someone always gets into sick feelings. It is also part of the business and one of the best educational tools available to those who are really committed to film business. Of course, there is nothing better about failing to sit at home and write on the internet in the form of a false inspection than those who blamed them (read: they were honest and honest with them). And this is my best guess to explain nasty, nasty comments. As far as everything is the blade of truth, there is an idea that needs to be done, but these blade exaggerations are so upright that they will probably become fictitious. <br /> <br /> This is not a sliding blood bath, if it is what you are looking for, it is a more psychological temporary thriller that is not usually known by the lowest common denominators. The best way to see this movie is to try to figure out all the predefined concepts, pop it in and let it open - seriously, the characters are defined by their actions and words, and when you see what these people do and what they say, I think you one cannot come to the conclusion that these signs were badly developed. Maybe you misunderstood. <br /> <br /> Overall, I agree that this is a nicely done, convincing film. Maybe I wouldn't have given it to 9 under normal conditions, but the serious negative comments made me really into the picture (I have secret love for a very bad cinema). For me, ratings under 5 years of age should be reserved for short, incorrect, ill-acted and foolishly written films. None of these apply here - this is a high quality film that has true talent there. I gave her nine that we were back in the right direction. Watch the movie and tell me I'm wrong.
