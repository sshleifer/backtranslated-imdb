I love this movie. At first I didn't expect much of this movie because I didn't hear anyone talking about it and it seemed that it went to the video shortly after it was just in theaters. I didn't think David and Minnie would do a good pair of screens. (I've been waiting for a lot of screen pairs because I saw Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan "You've got Mail" and "Sleepless in Seattle." Personally, I think Joely Richardson should have played the Minnie part and vice versa. I just think Joely should have been with David for a longer time in the movie. They seemed to be perfect for each other. But it just thinks the girl in the movie is always a dude.) (Like "While you slept"), I was still very wrong. This movie was fantastic !!! Everything was great. Bonnie Hunt did a great job. The lines were perfect with smart cracks everywhere. <br /> <br /> *** WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD !!! *** <br /> <br /> I love how everything is intertwined. For example, Elizabeth and Bob first spoke about going to Italy, and finally Bob meets Grace in Italy. An example is Sydney (ape), who makes Grace's hand as he did with Elizabeth. <br /> <br /> *** NOTE: SPOILERS END NOW !!! *** <br /> <br One thing I didn't like about the film was that it was a bit unreal. Well, I just don't think one man would get his wife over the year if he was the only woman he'd ever had with all his life. You think he would have isolated himself from the world for years before he starts talking to someone. Instead, he turns dark in a year and immediately falls * in love with a woman he has not seen in his life, but feels attached. <br /> <br /> First of all, it was a great movie. It was two or three times me crying and I had to laugh countless times (the scene in a restaurant where Bob had picked up bottled water was fun!). It's definitely there with great romantic comedies like "You've Got Letter", "Sliding Door", and "While You Slept". <br /> <br /> SHIP YOUR DAY!
