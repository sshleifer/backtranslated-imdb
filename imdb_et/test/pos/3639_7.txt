I know Gerrit. He currently lives in the USA. This film is based on the life events of both Gerrit and Celeste Wolfard. This is a remarkable story. It inspired me to read "Cry, Beloved State". The film is well produced. The music is beautiful. <br /> <br /> The story is said to be in rebounds. You are learning white stories of racist South Africa (Gerrit) and black South Africa (Moses). Their lives intersect violently. The end is not typical of Hollywood - it is unusually realistic and ends with a note that encourages you to think about characters and themes. <br /> <br /> Be sure to watch credit - see Gerrit material in real life.
