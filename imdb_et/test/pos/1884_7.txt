It was a funny movie. Just seen Evil Dead's trilogy not a week ago (and I missed more), I got as many Bruce Campbell movies as I could, including really bad. It's funny without being extraordinary, but as sure as the original hell. <br /> <br /> I think you have crazy scientists, supernatural hats, half-brain freaks, gypsies, ex-KGB cabins, jealousy, murder passion, love, romance, sex, action and more, all with the same 6 participants :) <br /> <br /> You have to see it and enjoy it, I can't explain it in the text box. I think it's not as much a cult film as Evil Dead, but it certainly is that Bruce Campbell touches I love. Ted Raimi lends a hand, Tamara Gorski looks as beautiful as interesting (she has gone a long way from whore on Friday 13th) and Vladimir Kolev also shows a lot of promise, although he is probably secondary in Hollywood films throughout his career. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: funny movie. If you liked Evil Dead, you like it.
