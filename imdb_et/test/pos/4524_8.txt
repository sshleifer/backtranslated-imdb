considering Chan's films that follow, it's not bad. A lot of stereotypes that start with a black man at first and when the police captain orders that "every price in town" be rounded up. The parade of stereotypical characters enters the scene, including the Three Stooges Shemp. Charlie seems to be moving fast around the city, located in Sutton Plist. W. Visit Flash. The end is silly. An obvious toy plane is used when it climbs through the sky and then the nose dives. Ed Wood couldn't do it better. The final scene is absurd, because the murderer obviously accuses himself of trying to silence the person who knows his identity. Generally worth a look.
