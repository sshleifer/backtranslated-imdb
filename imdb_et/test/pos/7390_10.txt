"It's funny that your worst nightmare always seems so far away!" <br /> <br /> Dark Habour characters, married couple (Alan Rickman & Polly Hunter) and vagabond (Norman Reedus) slip into a hidden game of sexual energy and treason. By now and then, tantalizing breaks increase tension and provide plenty of room for interpretation. A good act and story that, if not using the brain, will confuse you. You have to look at it at least twice. The strength alone is its unusualness and, of course, Alan Rickman. Those who love him love this movie. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: It's not a typical first-rate film, it's well done!
