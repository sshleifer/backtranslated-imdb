I have reason to love the great users of the camera; Fluid Direction allows for a fast-developed adventure and comedy narrative; but such skill in King Vidor or Anthony Mann can also be used at the idea level. This is Paul Wendkos' masterpiece. This story can be retailed in one sentence. General Hector Cordoba establishes a Caesar close to northern Mexico and steals a solid cannon from General Blackjack Pershing. he sends his crack mission unit, shared, scary, but decisive, led by George Peppard to get the cannon back and bring back Cordoba in life to end the riot. Charismatic Raf Vallone plays in Cordoba; the girl is Giovanna Rally and Francine York; with a team including Nico Minardos, Peter Deuel and Don Gordon. Other classrooms are John Larch and John Russell. Even the fantastically dangerous operation of the morning is Miss Rally and stubborn Mexican Teniente (Gabriela Tinti) whose regiment was betrayed when Cordoba founded himself. The threat is multiplied when Gordon's brother is caught in advance as a spy and tortured when he has to look ... and he decides he must kill Peppard. An attack on a girl when Peppard's orders are not followed by a regular army type is one of the electrifying visuals and productions in the history of cinematography; The ability to win - or almost win - the Cordoba Fortress's penetration, the revelations and the mission team that can be opened there will be flawlessly presented. This is a beautiful colorful adventure film with exceptionally strong costumes, actors, lighting, artistic directions and Elmer Bernstein's music. Stephen Kandel's script is probably his best feature. This is probably the most underestimated main west now, but I have always valued my heroes as a workforce. But as Peppard reminds his group of home, "The problem of" hero "- is in the morning". To find out why he says this, you have to see "Cannon For Cordoba".
