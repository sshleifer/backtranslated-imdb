Come on, I love you! I couldn't come to a better conclusion when you made this movie and about ending it. My family hasn't seen this movie yet, but I know them too well; they hate it. But this time I looked at it alone and found that it really affected me. Although the length of the movie is long, I was involved in the story and surprised by the end. At first I thought it was strange how it just disappeared, but on some levels it makes sense. But, as has been said, this film does not give reality. Instead, it challenges this and the viewer to think strongly about what the word "normal" means. It also gives you an insight to think about what the end is, and I can say I loved how it came out and lucky for Mith.
