I recently rented this movie as part of a nostalgic stage. I was born in 1980 and so from the mid-80s to the mid-90s, I have been playing a very important role in my film. <br /> <br /> This particular movie was one of my favorites, so I was glad to have it available in the UK. It's not getting worse over time, it's still a very fun movie, with excitement in its own way. Of course, this is in the shadow of major major budget films, but don't let you enjoy it. <br /> <br /> It is worth renting or even buying at low prices. for.
