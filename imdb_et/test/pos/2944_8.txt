This movie was so fun and thoughtful. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to move and challenge. Great functioning, management - and Canada is on the go! This is a movie that families can enjoy and serious film students. The ontario locations caused this nostalgia for the era. Selling so much garbage and superfluous leaps these days is nice to see someone back on an independent flick. For every family that has risen to overcome a challenge or an obstacle - be it financial or illness - this film hits an astonishing chord! It approaches the successor's idea in a modern way - without being cheaper than all "gohst" and supernatural issues that have changed in Hollywood and TV networks.
