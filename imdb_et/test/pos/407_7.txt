Red Skelton plays a radio detective called "The Fox" in "The Whistling in the Dark", as well as Ann Rutherford, Conrad Veidt, Eve Arden, Virgina Gray and Rags Ragland. Wally Benton, also known as "Fox", believes that he is going to marry his fiancé Carol (Rutherford), who has been spoiled when he has been kidnapped by a dim driver (Veidt). Joseph Jones (Weaver) has just learned that his cult, The Silver Haven, does not receive a permissive legacy because the old woman's nephew exists who lives in interest. He wants Wally to plan a plot of perfect murder so that he can kill him by plane to meet his lawyer. To make backups and because he is not sure which one of them is Wally's fiancé, Jones Carol and also the daughter of the radio sponsor (Gray) rob. <br /> <br /> That's right for me anyway, it's a better movie for the second record in this series, "Whistling in Dixie." The plot is better, the cast is better, there are fewer beats and less fun. Skelton, if he doesn't see the faces or run his eyes, is quite friendly and Rutherford is very good. The face was always played perfectly by the evil ones. Eve Arden is a Wally representative who arranges a date for her and Gray to secure her contract renewal. I had seen Gray only in films from the 1950s. She was always a good looking woman, but who knew she was in the 30s and 40s? It's a fun movie of pure pain.
