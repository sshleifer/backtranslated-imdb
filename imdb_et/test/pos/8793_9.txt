Well, I should say, "the only movie related to club / dj / electronic music and rage ... that robbing respect". <br /> <br /> Seriously now. It is a brilliantly fun, fast paced and pretty accurate picture of a robber night. Although it is in the club, in Wales and its somewhat dated. The film omits some elements of the club's sketcher but does not leave them completely. It is an idyllic but serious image of the characters' life and downhill. <br /> <br /> The centerpiece of the movie and the best element of Justin Kerrigan's script are characters, eccentric, unique, but fully understandable and accessible. This simple movie doesn't work and would be endlessly less fun than Jip, Koop, Nina, Moff and Lulu. Spectators may deny the political and social consequences of the sub-text of human traffic as narcotics, trainspotting wannabe, important pegs of 90-year-old British youth culture, but .... they cannot deny that they are characters. <Br>> <br /> It is frantic, its brutally honest, it's amazing, it's up, but it's a great comedy. <br /> <br /> Treatments are complex things, and the drugs that are taken at these events are the people you meet. But somebody who has gone to the party has got in and is still ... Human traffic is the best overview of the moment that subculture could be taken. Just whatever you do, hold "Groove" as opposed to everything that is good for human traffic.
