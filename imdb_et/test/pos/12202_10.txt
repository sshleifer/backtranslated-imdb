I thought it was a very good TV show and I would like to see it. Ultimately, it was interesting there and I really want to see where it goes from there. Sometimes we want to kill the series quickly without giving it a chance. I think it needs a chance to go ahead and I look forward to it. The ocean is one of the places that a person knows so little about and I think it is a mystery in itself. What awaits us under the water of the world. It is even said that a person can climb into the water somewhat back or drop into the water. Is this a new evolution? Are we moving down the food chain or fighting for our position?
