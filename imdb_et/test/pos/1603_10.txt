Personally, I can only agree with Stephen-12: allow. There's no point in trying to hit this movie. I like movies where nothing happens. Herzog 'Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes' has got the same thing, even though this film is less convincing, because the tops are rather at the beginning of the story, so Herzog had to focus on nature versus Kinski. However, Morte Venezia is completely different because it has several vertices, turns, etc. In fact, since the disappearance of Aschenbach's luggage, the film is "filming" on its finale (its final sand grains begin to run through the hourglass after bliss, where it fantasies about warning the Polish family and fascinating Tadzio's hair.) <br /> <br /> You can, if you want, look for real hints / symbols (he is trying to leave) behind his luggage from the moment he arrives, pointing at the end of Tadzio, to the fact that the entire content and form of the movie is completely sinc), but there is no point in doing it: it doesn't make a movie better or worse because its power lies in the whole price of the storyline, which is never explicitly stated. History, a disintegrating Europe, the end of a "romantic era", as we know what has only been the beginning of it (individual emotions and expression are now more important than ever). But wait, I'm starting to develop a small (small) mistake in the movie: "Let's talk about the parts of art". Now there's one more thing. I myself believe it could have been expressed in other ways. Moreover, I believe this is already very clear in the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> I don't like clear movies. I can read books so I don't want a story that only tells my logic. I prefer movies that you can't explain in words, but only on film (Lynch's lost highway, Weir's Picknick at Hanging Rock and Roegi's man who fell on Earth, and this is the reason why there is a movie and not just a book . So what about Thomas Mann's short story? I've never read it, but forget about it! The film gives a different view: it says things that the book can never say. He uses film-art to make you feel through the image and music that Mann knew you using text. Similarly, the worlds are brilliant but different.
