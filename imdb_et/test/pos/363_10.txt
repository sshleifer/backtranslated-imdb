This movie was amazing. This is definitely the 5 best movies. Controls and camera images are almost flawless (apart from the dog scene, when the boys are licking their hands, clearly slow). The plot is well written and realistic. It was very believable that an innocent person could get into this trap. Robert Walker plays a very incredible maniac. He did not exceed that part that made it credible (as much as perkins did not know their share). In general it is a great movie, the absolute must see all kinds of fans. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
