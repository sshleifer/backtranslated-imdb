I've seen a lot of documentaries that showed the law was on the wrong side of the fence - Thin Blue Line and Paradise Lost come to mind first and foremost. But this is the first movie that was angry with me after I saw it. It seems clear to me that the evidence in this film shows that what happened in Waco was at least an unprofessional and sloppy confusion and at the worst murder of the FBI and the AFI. Like most people, when Waco's siege appeared, I assumed that David Koresh was a totally evil crazy man who led a violent cult. Having seen this, I think that Koresh was probably a somewhat unbalanced and confused man who inadvertently tried to draw attention to the US through eccentric acts. Of course, there were a lot of weapons at Branch branch. But none of them was illegal. It was absolutely heartbreaking to see the video footage of people inside the compound, all seem to be very nice and harmless. And it was angry to see the harsh testimonies of men in charge of government forces on Waco's website, Janet Reno's shameful testimonies, and defense of the attack on Waco, guided by some Commission Democrats. . In my opinion, NY was the most representative and the current US Senator NY Charles Schumer. I voted for this man when I lived in a NY country - I'm a democrat, to the left. Having seen your actions in this committee, I would like to go back and vote instead for D'Amato! For anyone interested in government, this is a very important film to be seen. I even think it should be shown in classes - that's so important.
