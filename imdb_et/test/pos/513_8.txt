If you like horror or action, check out this movie ASAP. If the opening scene doesn't pump your adrenaline, someone should check your pulse. Excellent action, excellent casting and top liner. This is the only movie I saw in the cinema, where the crowd praised every piece, kick & punch. Not perfection, but caring when movies are so fun. This is a pure dark comic book. 9/10
