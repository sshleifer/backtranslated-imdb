This is the only Pauly Shore movie you should ever see. O.K, this is the only one I've ever seen, and I think I've made good choices. I usually find Shore shticky tired, but she's very funny in this movie. In fact, the script is not really funny and Shore doesn't hit other participants ... what do you call it? Tomfoolery? Anyway, it's funny if ultimately a forgotten movie. --Frink-3
