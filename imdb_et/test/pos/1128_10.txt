When I first sat in Greek, I wasn't expecting an exhibition with intricate characters, intriguing plot lines and impeccable writing ... but that's what I got. <br /> <br /> Greek is the next several college students in the Greek system at Rhodes University in Cyprus. Rusty Cartwright enters Cyprus as Rhodes as a polymer scientist who wants to be in brotherhood. His older sister Casey (President of the exhibition center and Prime Minister Zeta Beta Zeta, University's most prestigious corporation) does not exactly support her plans. In fact, none of his friends knew he had a brother until he walked in the college area! In addition to dealing with his dorky younger brother being forced to return to his life, Casey's boyfriend Evan Chambers (early president of the university brotherhood, Omega Chi) is deceiving him with a new ZBZ (Rebecca Logan), the devilish ZBZ president Frannie presses him to stay with him and he still has feelings of slipping out of ex-boyfriend Cappie (party house president Kappa Tau). These symbols are joined by Calvin Owens (athletic, intelligent friend of Rusty who is gay), Dale Kettlewell (Rusty's hard Christian and "possible racist" roommate and best friend) and Ashleigh (Casey's exotic best friend and trustee)). <br /> <br /> Two Greek seasons (or four chapters) often remind viewers that college life is not black and white, but "gray tones out". Each character shares a fair share of errors, but each has a redeemable feature. Casey and Cappie are complex but beautiful throughout the series. The friendship between Rusty, Dale and Calvin is not always perfect, but they manage to survive every obstacle they face. Even Frannie, Rebecca and Evan (exhibition "villains") are shown every time every person. <br /> <br /> Greece shows college students at their best, worst, and intermediate. This is an exhibition that shows the college what it really is: a four-year adventure that has tested, threatened, and sometimes even changed morals, beliefs and willpower. <br /> <br /> In Greek, at least one season has left, if not more, before its end. I can't wait to see where the characters come next. Greece is not your typical ABC family. If you want to tune an exhibition that shows the truth behind a person's motivation, the Greek will show you.
