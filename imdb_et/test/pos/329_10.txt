Hello everyone! I went to this movie without any hopes, even though I knew Maniratnam would have made a great movie! I was stunned! The background is the struggle between the Tamil and the government in Sri Lanka. The story is how a young girl, Amudha, who lives with her older parents in Chennai, India is leaving Sri Lanka for her true mother. The high points of the film are the performance of every actor and actress, as well as cinematography, editing and all other technical details. Complete characters cast and team. I have to mention cinematography because it brings the war out of the way you feel there. Great work! Although the warfare reminded me of Saving Private Ryan, such work has never been tried on the Indian screen. Overall, the movie is great! And hats for Mr.Maniratnam. <br /> <br /> Mani Ratnam has once again proved to be a director who can capture Indian high heels! I'd like to watch this movie over and over again. Great movie and black.
