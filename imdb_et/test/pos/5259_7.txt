Rich woman Mary Haines (Meg Ryan) discovers that her husband is cheating on her younger wife (Eva Mendes). She doesn't know what to do and her friends Sylvia Fowler (Annette Bening), Edie Cohen (Debra Messing) and Alex Fisher (Jad Pinkett Smith) are trying to help. <br /> <br /> OK - there is no reason to restore the 1939 film. It is a real classic and does not need to be upgraded and upgraded. Of course it was done. It's got some of the worst ratings I've ever seen for the movie. I love the original and I've seen it a lot of times - I compared it all the time. It's not classic now, but it's not that bad. <br /> <br /> MINOR SPOILERS !!! ** First, bad - the story is old and (badly) updated. Really - a man who deceives his wife is not shocking today. Meg Ryan (wonderful actor) is very terrible here. His face can't change the expression! I couldn't believe how bad part of his scenes came. Eva Mendes is also bad - but it's not entirely her fault. His role is poorly written and he must compete with Joan Crawford's original. Smith's character (harsh lesbian) goes into pieces in the operating room. It's funny ... but it shows that when an emergency occurs, a strong woman goes instantly. The script also adds some clumsy parts where Ryan speaks to his daughter about himself. At these moments, it looks more like a lifetime movie than anything else. <br /> <br /> It's good now - this movie keeps the originals' decision to NOT show the man on the screen. This movie is for women - men are not necessary (BTW - I'm a man). Bening is just as great as Fowler - when he's on the screen, the movie makes a big leap. Also, Smith is just wonderful - he doesn't (or start) too much of his lesbian character. Brass is also good, but it is not so much. Bette Midler is just hysterical in a small role, and Cloris Leachman pulls out the role of janitor. The direction is also good - especially during the fashion show. I heard the director Diane English claim to have a lot of difficulty in directing his first full-length movie, but it doesn't appear in the final product. There are also some clever references to the original (mostly certain lines) that were entered without noise. <br /> <br /> I saw this women full of audiences (some guys but not many) and they loved it. The film ends with the sequence of the operating room, which had all the wedges. So it wasn't necessary, but people in the disaster do not say it. Also - people say we don't need a movie with all women. Well - why not? I see a lot of movies with all the boy and no one is talking about it! Ignore complaints and bad comments and see it. With a better result, Ryan could have given it 8 or 9, but as I am, I can only give it 7.
