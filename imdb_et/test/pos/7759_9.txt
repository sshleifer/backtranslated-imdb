Good animation, nice character design and light-hearted story make Suzumiya Haruhi enjoyable on Yuuts. <br /> <br /> After my first look, I thought this anime was pretty good, but much better for the second clock. <br /> <br /> This is because it takes place in chronological order, and if you look at it in the right order, you will notice connections that you have never seen before. (Or you may see an event that you never noticed before, another meaning) You may read Tanigawa Nagaru's original novels (not manga) before / after. Anime is very good to visualize all the details in the stories shown. <br /> <br /> However, the book has some short stories that are not animated but referenced. Episode 14) In general, this anime is very good after a short analysis of the plot (reading the book also improves it). This is a nice break from the shounen-jump anime that seems to have taken over.
