The title suggests that this movie is a "American werewolf in London" order. None of the characters in the previous movie come and are not even mentioned in the movie by name. So, if the sequel continues, the AAwiP fails, would say. <br /> <br /> Dare to say the opposite. It's one of the best werewolf movies I've seen for a long time. And I've seen quite a part of it, such as the American werewolf in London, The Howling, Wolfen, Wolfman and the Underworld trilogy. <br /> <br /> The story is about three Americans visiting Paris on vacation. At the top of the Eifel tower, one of them saves a woman trying to commit suicide. When the romantic relationship begins to slowly turn into horror when the blind secrets of the city appear ... <br /> <br /> I really loved this movie. Two movie stars in particular: a woman who tried to commit suicide, and a man who rescues her. They have good chemistry together. But the other two Americans play their role well. I found nothing annoying about the annoying, so a little bit of it! <br /> <br /> Effects on werewolves are good. It doesn't seem to me too cheap or fake. Of course, opinions are shared on this issue. But let's just say I wasn't disappointed. <br /> <br /> This movie also has good humor. There are some really funny scenes that you probably remember for a long time. <br /> <br /> All in all, the American werewolf in Paris may not be a direct sequel to its predecessor, but it is still an enjoyable movie. Ideal for werewolves fans! 7 out of 10 stars!
