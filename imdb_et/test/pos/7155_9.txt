In this story of a closely wounded Christian family with three of the four "born again" after a car-induced car accident, which really stands out, it is grounded by the majority of those who have so many opportunities to go over and how most actors have really inspired them. If most of the moments of the film, especially its sincere and "innocent" discussions about sexuality after the guilt of four family members and shame have been removed, it is fun, it is also thought-provoking and the characters remain with you. <Br>> <br /> How often, for example, does the comedy symbol go from a caricature to a full-fledged emotional creature in one scene? How often do we see the cast that can be pulled in the middle of showboating to show a bit of humanity under the skin? Even many of the "bad guys" on this film have strange honest moments, even if much of what they do can be totally ridiculous and terrible. Behind the most questionable acts of this film is truth and history, which is a difficult task in satire. <br /> <br /> How refreshing it is to see a dark comedy that can be bold to be humanistic. How nice to see the actors who are so fully committed to the character that they dare to let them be ridiculous and sublime. <br /> <br /> And as a gay person, I don't think heterosexual has ever been so nice. Sex event like I was at the first sexual meeting of the parents of this family after the accident. <br /> <br /> Bravo. Bravo. One of my favorites is Outfest this year.
