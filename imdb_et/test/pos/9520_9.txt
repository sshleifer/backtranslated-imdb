Or at least you feel quite high after this movie. This is the kind of film that the word "rolling" can really do, even though it rolls in this completely random, intelligent, and open mindset that belongs to French. <br /> <br /> No, Catherine Deneuve doesn't spend the whole movie big (sorry to disappoint any sort of puritan on the agenda) .. but one scene I refer to covers all the wedding party members - AND that's a musical number! Anyway, everything fits smoothly and the unusual, bright, colorful family (Deneuve's mother is a lesbian, Deneuve's girl) alternately entertained and irritates us as real families. br /> <br /> Don't want to say too much, but Deneuve marries a man about twenty years younger. This is quite plausible when we see that the relationship has evolved over time and when these two are naturally closer and closer. The end is happy; and like the rest of the film, satisfactorily original and also perfect.
