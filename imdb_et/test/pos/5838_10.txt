I've been watching a lot of television for 51 years, but I've never had as much fun a week as I was watching Oz. The whole cast act was great. Writing was simply perfect, with each character being consistent throughout the six-year period. I also liked chaos and violence. It may seem strange, but it was sometimes comical to find out how one of these characters would eventually die. I really liked the real romance and love between Beecher and Keller. These two men knew how to throw everything away. I really hope that HBO will continue with this great exhibition FOREVER! I've been watching each episode at least 4 times, but I'm still waiting on Tuesday and Thursday evening at 11.00. for this fun and very entertaining episode.
