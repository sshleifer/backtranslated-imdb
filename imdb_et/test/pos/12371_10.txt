Victor Sjostrom's silent movie masterpiece, Phantom Carriage, has recently been released on a new KTL recorded DVD. The duo, composed by American guitarist Stephen O'Malley and Austrian laptop artist Peter Rehberg, has highlighted the extraordinary sound of engaging and highlighting the original 1921 film. and the feedback eebs and flows when the gloomy drama emerges. <br /> <br /> As the new sound is as impressive, the movie will remain a real star with timeless rendition of a dark and dystopian fairy tale. According to this story, the last person who dies before midnight at night in the evening of the new year is condemned to spend one year behind a name-named phantom cart, collecting the souls of the dead. This is the fate of David Holm, the hero of the film, who is moving his painful control of his life after his premature death and subsequent contact with the transport driver. <br /> <br /> This film is often called the horror film, and although it is the right bridge, the real horror is not under supernatural elements, but rather as portraying people's suffering in others. Sjostrom gives remarkable performance to Holm, alive, drunk, tempting, and threatening, and sad, scared Holm, who looks back at the dead and shrinks from his earlier actions. <br /> <br /> A striking picture of all Phantom Carriage and more than compensating inevitably for limited dialogue. The appearance of midnight symptoms is strongly illustrated by a clock-face image that is alone in the dark night sky as the second month. Equally impressively, the dead are depicted by pioneering semi-transparent images, and the scenes of the phantom trolley flying on the ground and at sea remain cool to watch. <br /> <br /> The Sjostrom film deserves its place as one of the most disrespectful films of all time and the new soundtrack of KTL is a great emphasis on its themes. It's a must-have.
