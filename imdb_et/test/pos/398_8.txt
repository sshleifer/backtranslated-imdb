<br /> <br /> "The Last Frontier" is a higher western country that overcomes a number of drawbacks associated with knitting by Jed (Victor Mature), Gus (James Whitmore) and Mongo (Pat Hogan) and their relationship army Riordon (Guy Madison), Colonel Marston (Robert Preston) and Colonel Corrina Marston (Anne Bancroft). After losing the Indian supplies, Jed, Gus and Mungo were recruited as scouts to live the "last border" of the "civilized" life. Jed, raised by Gus, inspires and sees "elder" Gus and Mung, and has a particularly hard time dealing with civilization. His real problems begin after he has a strong interest in the colonel's wife, Corrin. Colonel Marston is a reckless person who threatens all his dreams against a ruthless victory against any opponent. Corrina, a woman repressed by her station and sense of responsibility, loves her husband for what she might be and Jed for what she is. Captain Riordon caught in the middle, a brave and pleasant person who has broken his military mission, his strong friendship with Jedi and his fear of the consequences of colonial negligence. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so interesting (as well as entertaining) is that in most cases the weaknesses and strengths of The Last Frontier are exactly the same elements (forget the bright title and dated music)) < br /> <br /> First, the scenario. Almost all sub-blocks (especially the reckless colonel) are better done elsewhere, but rarely have such eccentricity been put together. Just when you think you know what's going on, it's going in a different direction. POSSIBLE SPOILER: The Last Frontier is a Production Code movie (back in the day when the word "virgin" was taboo), it is very surprising that adultery was treated in such a mature, tolerant manner. I was expecting either Jedi or Colonel's husband to punish somewhat for their sin. I was surprised and somewhat disappointed that the film did not use this expectation to create a less predictable end. Mature is at least ten years too old to play the Jedi part of the wild-eyed wild eye. James Whitmore, who plays Gust, is the guy who brought Jedi, actually five years younger than mature. Nevertheless, Mature is very loving, playing a character who is innocent of civilization but not in any way stupid. Although there were several actors who could play a role at this time (especially Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas), no one could play Jedi better. Preston (also richer younger) plays Colonel Marston, missing what to expect from this man. Preston excels in the honor someone has to see in Marston to promote such a reckless fool with the rank of Colonel. Bancroft is a particularly sharp choice like Corrina. Bancroft's dark hair is dead blonde and it has the same effect as Winona Ryder ("Edward Scissorhands") and Christina Ricc ("Sleepy Hollow"). This means that I felt a conflict with the character without knowing exactly why; I believe that the answer is that blondes and brunettes have significantly different skin tones and eye tones. In addition, Bancroft has always predicted the hardness of hardness (this will also soften the hair a bit). This allows 24-year-old Bancroft to reach the toe with 40-year-old Mature and 37-year-old Preston; Yes, he could be a colonel family woman. Madison walks carefully to balance Riordan, dealing with a complex role and sometimes a painstaking dialogue. Playing a role like John Wayne in 'Fort Apache' in Madison makes it more skilful. <br /> <br /> The film has a "Silverado" -type man. That alone is worth noting. It also has memorable performances, a beautiful scenerary and great action and direction. I just hope that a version of the mailbox is available (many are lost) because this movie uses this form completely.
