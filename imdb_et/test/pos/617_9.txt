This is one of the films that must be viewed openly. It is known that it is going to silence, you can expect or fear many feelings. Well, forget about it. The film starts with a little black humor and then starts. Since then, you are heading to Moscow's dark centers for an increasingly scary journey. All right, it must be said: unexpected turns are expected and the resin is mainly used as a plot tool or as a builder of fear. But this movie won't let you go. <br /> <br /> It's like old gangster movies, but then without any glamor and in Russia. And this is one of the most important aspects of this film: it is in Russia. This has a big impact on the film, which in my opinion makes it better. Everything becomes simple and basic, life is meaningless. It can have great potential for more movies in the future, gangster movies about the Russian mafia. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful and terrible movie. It is horror, but you can't feel it, but compassion for a little silence. One last tip: don't look at it too late in the evening if you want to sleep well.
