Send them to the freezer. This is the solution that two butchers find when they discover the popularity of human meat sales. An incredible story of humor and potential allegories that make it much more than a horror movie. Complex characters violate the superficial classification and make this story intriguing and valuable - if you can stand it. Definitely a dark film, but also a little redeeming.
