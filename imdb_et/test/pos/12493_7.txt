Quai des Orfevres goes too long because Clouzot is so behind that he has almost forgotten the story. But when he does, it is Clouzot his best. Bertrand Blier (Bertrand Blier's father and his Buffet Froid stars) is a world-famous pianist who married her own and plans to kill a mogul of a seedy studio with her wife's design to find someone has beaten her. Not only that, but his carefully planned but cumbersome alibi falls into pieces, especially when the thief steals his car at the crime scene ?? <br /> <br /> The film really makes life with the arrival of Luis Jouvet. police inspector, a pretty wonderful side of the creation Alistair Sim in the green threat and half-tired of Maigret with better dialogue. In a regular running hand, his research is constantly at the top of his voice against chaos and noise, be it the noisy typewriters of the police station, or choose a sample. The police station itself is a wonderfully realistic creation, abundant chaotic, and talks of small details that make Steve Bocchco ever a revolutionary exhibition of 80's US police events, such as outdated museum parts. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> When Suzy Delair is a pretty convincing femme fatale, the supportive majority will compensate, beautiful Simone Renant, who is a long-loved lesbian photographer for her, and she was constantly mistaken for a Blier lover. by Delair and other interested parties (only Jouvet, like unhappy women, understands and truly understands). With Armand Thirard's superb black-and-white photography, this is a terrible little thriller with a nice twist and a lovely scene where the cab ride is reluctantly driven by the Renant police station. (Trivia note: Pierre Larquey, who played playfully philosophical Dr. Vorzet at Le Corbeau, is a leader in both small and Quai and Les Espions booths.) <br /> <br /> Critical DVD is great - great picture quality and an enlightening excerpt from a French TV show that includes interviews with Clouzot, Blier and Renant.
