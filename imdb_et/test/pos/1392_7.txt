Claude (Claudio Cassinelli) and several prisoners from his sunken ship wash on the land owned by Edmond Rackham (Richard Johnson). Because of some accidental prison deaths, Rackham Claude and his two others are imprisoned. Fortunately, Barbara Bach is just on the island! Fortunately, there are some crazy fishermen who want to kill people. <br /> <br /> This Italian exploiter seems to be all - a bit of CREATURE OF BLACK LAGOON mixed with DR. MOREAU with WHITE ZOMBIE voodoo and Atlantis stuff. Despite some delightful fishermen's costumes, the film has some beautiful location for photography and a nice twist about halfway through. All actors are good and Joseph Cotton even appears as an old biologist. Directed by Sergio Martino, he is doing quite well, as the 10-minute action is so. It cannot be said of his late follow-up on FISHING AND THEIR KING (1995), which is easily one of the most striking and most off-base queues from HIGHLANDER II.
