I was waiting for a good movie. I got a better movie. Chemistry between James and Smith is simply incredible. Glad to see him once on a big movie! <br /> <br /> The film works because the actors play their parts perfectly. Will Smith is fantastic for his endless charm; Kevin James is fun and Eva Mendes ... well, let's say he plays this female / sweet / annoying role in his best way. <br /> <br /> What I loved about the movie was that Smith didn't even have to love. He just was !! "The doctor of the day" had all the right moves, said everything in the most perfect and ever gone. <br /> <br /> Funny parts are fun ... and the cute, romantic part is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie completely. And no, it's not a chick flick.
