I watched this movement 5th or 6th and I'm still in love. It still makes me cry and sing and worry and celebrate. <br /> <br /> I almost wrote a letter to Bonnie Hunt to tell him how much I love it. David Duchovny grief is so flippin real! Minnie Driver is so natural and honest. My favorite line is when Duchovny says, "I miss Elizabeth, but I eat Grace." Oh man! I just cry to think. Also ... Bonnie Hunt and Jim Belushi are sooooooooooooo perfect Chicago area couple !! I know them, I swear! I'm connected with them I'm sure. <br /> <br /> This movie is rotating three times a year !!! I would look at it once a week, but I'm afraid I would get too used to it !!! I always want to make it a special day when I watch it!
