Film for Adult, Educated Audience ... <br /> <br /> I saw "Random Hearts" early before the release of North America. This romantic drama was quite terrible. I'm sure this story might not be everyone's teapot, especially considering the dark rebound of the movie. However, the picture has some very strong strengths. <br /> <br /> The Office of All Time draws Harrison Ford ("Star Wars", "Lost Ship Raiders", "Fugitive", "Air") Force One, "Patriot Games", at the top of his game, like harried and desperate official, Dutchman. Ford's very weak, nuanced performance shows a fairly large range of choices that it can achieve with class and determination to bring the world of its loss and betrayal. It is a perfect complicated role and a very different film for Harrison Ford to show the screen between blockers of his actions. Next year, Harrison Ford first returns to director Robert Zemeckis ("Forrest Gump", "Back to the Future") in the summer of 2000 in the thriller "What Lies Beneath" and allegedly later in the year to customize Tom's movie. Clancy is "the sum of all fears." "Fears" is Harrison Ford's third trip to CIA's operational Jack Ryan. <br /> <br /> Director Sydney Pollack ("Out of Africa", "Firm", "Tootsie") has a supporting role in this function. Scott-Thomas Congressional Political Advisor. This is a very sharp and energetic image for Pollack. Sydney Pollack is a talented director, and is one of the most trusted, natural and charming actors (see also "Eyes Wide Shut"). <br /> <br /> Kristin Scott-Thomas ("English") Patient, "" The Horse Whisperer "shows that you don't necessarily have to be an eccentric or a reputation to be considered sexually explicit. a super-crafted and softened performance that works well with Ford's silent man's fortitude. <br /> <br /> The subroutines work great, especially the sub-block of Ford's character investigation of police corruption. Look for "Heat" actor Dennis Haysbert who plays Detective George Beaufort, an obstacle to Dutch investigation of police corruption. </p> </p> <p> </p> pleasure. Charles S. Dutton (whose leading role has long been late) shows he is one of the best character actors, and Bonnie Hunt, who, in my opinion, is extremely strong in this production, steals most of his scenes with this wonderful, charming smile like Wendy Judd. <br /> <br /> The technical side of Pollack thriller is at the top. Dave Grusini (Pollacki "The Firm") from a completely surreal jazz score, sharp photography by Philippe Rousselot ("A River Runs Through It"), for sharp editing that keeps the film fresh, despite the regrettable premise of the film. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys good mystery, good pace, characteristic stories and romance. This is a terrible story of betrayal and forgiveness. It also has one of the most surprising but astonishing and definitely contradictory ends of Harrison Ford's film in recent times. "Random Hearts" is definitely one of the best films of the year. <br /> <br /> (*** 1/2 out ****) or (8.5 out of 10.0)
