One of the most charming and at least the most powerful elements for Anthony Minghella's charming best-image winner "English Patient" is that, in the mid-1990s, when Hollywood was in the early stages of nerve loss, New New Projects, a film was created that brought traces to the tracks? Very powerful traces? "English Patient" contains a lot of what made these films so powerful. It has the ultimate feeling of stretched running time that hardly seems long, and exciting characters from the past and the stories. <br /> <br /> An "English patient" based on Michael Ondaat's novel of the same name is like "The Godfather: Part II" (1974) in the way it was built. It is a mix of two stories: the past and the present, and it all revolves around the nominal character: English after the Second World War. Ralph Fiennes plays an English patient who has been intimidated by an accident in life and is cared for by a single sister, Juliette Binoche, admiring one sister. In addition to linking with his fatty voice, a disrupted patient has to learn Binoche's past when a stranger arrives (Willem Dafoe) and two men seem to know each other. <br /> <br /> This is just one of the two beautifully designed stories that shape this movie. The other thing that was said upside down is the patient's past before he was in love and died in bed. The current story mixed with the patient's past and his love relationship that tragically changed his life forever. blends perfectly. What I really wondered about the love story of Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas was how passionate, as obsessive, how enchanting it appeared on the screen. In love stories, such as Minghella's later "Cold Mountain" (2003), romantic elements seem much more pleasant than obsessive. Some scenes of love contain elements that may be more related to fun than love, but still, as it is so well developed and not rushed and not used proportionally, we can believe that it is true, true love these signs. It reminded me a lot of "Vertigo" (1958) about how well the filmmakers and performers convinced us that they are two real people who really loved each other. <br /> <br /> Performances everywhere were great. I had a particularly amazing performance by Juliette Binoche, who won the Oscar for next year's results. I also liked Willem Dafoe, who plays such a cynical, questionable character that he always plays playing. And, of course, I can't omit the portrayal of Fiennes and Scott Thomas and their very passionate love. <br /> <br /> Despite my enormous enthusiasm for this epic, I would be dishonest if I described it as a perfect film. There are two drawbacks that I can't see. The first, it's a little too long, and this is because of my second complaint, are some unnecessary subplots. I was not enchanted or particularly interested in another love story between Binoche and a bomb specialist played by Naveen Andrews. My research has led me to assume that this plot element comes from the original book, and I'm sure it worked well there, but in the movie it just seems annoying and the two-character relationship wasn't fascinating to me. I was much more interested in the character of Fiennes and his relationship with two leading actors. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, these two drawbacks are easily forgiven even when they slowly do things. Those who have set aside, "English patient" is an extraordinary achievement of making a film. For me it was like "Casablanca" (1942) and "Arab Lawrence" (1962), two remarkable and better films, confusing confusion, and this effective mixture turned out to be the value of my time. It is a real shame that Anthony Minghella has left us. Because he was a truly talented filmmaker. This is all the evidence someone needs.
