CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE <br /> <br /> There are some movies I could watch and never get tired of all my life, and this nostalgic favorite is one of them. CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE was the 1987 attempt to bring old favorites back to the animation front, this time on a big screen. The age when Disney dominated the film industry in terms of animation quality and box office is THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE, one of the best animated films that Disney did not produce in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> The story is simple and basic, with Alvin, Simon & Theodore competing with Chipetts (Janette, Eleanor and Brittany) around the world. However, since the chipmakers are exposed to exotic threats, they are not aware that they are pawns from large diamond attacks. <br /> <br /> CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE has never been, and never is, a movie that grows thanks to a complex plot. And for people who did not like it as a child, the film is probably no longer an enjoyable but forgotten animation. But for me it is always a little-known masterpiece. Nothing about the film just clicks on a few movies. <br /> <br /> Every song is fun, spooky, and harmless. The top points are Chipettes, which is an Arabic dance for a gentle serpent. There is also a very sweet song where Chipmunks sing about the world travel and we see them on the main landmarks of the world. One thing about the Chipmunk characters is that, despite the potentially annoying vocals, the songwriters were always able to write songs that were memorable without ever being grated. This movie is no exception - it really boasts of the 80's best animated film soundtrack when you ask me. <br /> <br /> Every joke is cute, sincere and fun. Bits between bad boys and a pampered puppy are very entertaining. And also the chips show that the emperor of the child is almost forced to marry. Comedy is always a success for children, so they don't leave anything behind, but everything remains charming for adults who have enough nostalgia to keep them entertained. <br /> <br /> It's really just a fun journey that is totally humble in its ambitions. CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE never wants to be more than that, harmless fun. I am the first to admit that this is a biased review because I have such a nostalgic affection that I can never give it a bad overview ... but it fills me with such childish satisfaction by looking at it. Everyone has a casual favorite from childhood, no one knows, and for me this is the film. And all the movies I can watch over and over, whether I'm 5, 12, 23, or older, are a big movie in my eyes. <br /> <br /> ... A- ...
