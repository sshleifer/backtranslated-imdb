This is the first time I remember where the adaptation is just like the book ... In fact, the story was just added to the fun rather than the content that was mixed or removed! <br /> <br /> Like the Egyptian slave Cellular, who had trouble communicating, communicating, LOL! Or, when Tidivinnus was played as a quasi-sith lord and became annoying when the Roman Empire was struck by a stroke, the general commanded the empire ..? Ah, watch the movie people! <br /> <br /> I can easily believe that this picture was one of the most expensive of the French cinema history and, for its part, it was worth it, Depardieux was great like the bash of Rome and the Obelix boar. Klavier, who plays a little indifferent Gaul, was perfect and far from his day when Jean Reno's "Just Visiting" worshiper. see that the Matrix theme was not borrowed to despise the otherwise perfect battle! <br /> <br /> Pirate and his team almost shot, starting their ship as an Otis engine (Edif's assistant) The invention that was used to the end. <br /> <br /> I know there are Asterix and Olympic Games with many of the same team, Toutatis, I'm going to watch it!
