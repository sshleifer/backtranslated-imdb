Often Argento's last "big" movie, this entry into giallo canon is arguably better than any Argento movie that has followed it (although I haven't seen the "Tears Mother" yet), but to call it the last "big" movie can stretch it a bit . <br /> <br /> Directorial and stylistic booming - The hallmark of all Argento movie - is indeed there, some of its sequences in the Intermediate Ranking with its best (the "Doorbell" sequence is especially memorable) and Ronnie Taylor's cinematography is prominent (Fluorescent Light is beautiful). <br /> <br /> But here's a story about all Argento movies. Indeed, there is a strong mystery and intrigue, but the plot includes what is essentially a series of murders, one followed by another, leaving real time to fully solve the right, focused mystery. All this brings to the top that ... well ... anti-climate, because the film did not invest enough interest to really take care of us. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the fact that it is simply suggested by a masterful direction and beautiful images that Argento recalls. I would not recommend this as a starting point for Argento movies (I would recommend "Deep Red" or "Suspiria"), but if you liked them or even some giallo, then this is a great addition to your viewing repertoire.
