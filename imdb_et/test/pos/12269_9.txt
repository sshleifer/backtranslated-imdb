For me, this film wears the wonderful clips of repeatedly pleasing views. It's about the life of about three very different people. Holly Hunter is an obsessive-working manufacturer. Albert Brookes plays a failed but brilliant journalist. William Hurt is a gentle but stupid new boy, an anchor of news. <br /> <br /> The classic Triangle of Love is created with an amazingly witty and self-conscious Brookes who loves Hunter, but he is of course interested in Hurt. <br /> <br /> This movie works on multiple levels. At least this is a brilliant comedy that is just as thick and fast that every viewing carries a new harvest that you haven't used the last time. It is also a movie of attraction and unfulfilled romance. <br /> <br /> But perhaps the most important thing in the film is to look at the modern obsession with physical appearance and its ultimate victory over intellect as a valuable human attribute. It is characterized by a meteoric career of Hurt's character, as opposed to Brookes's relative decline. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the film is fifteen years old, the film has some originally relevant messages about the continued decline of modern news values ​​and press standards. <br /> <br /> This film is classic in every sense and it's hard to see why it is so neglected
