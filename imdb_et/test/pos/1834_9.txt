There are so many positive comments back to me that my opinion is not necessary to watch this movie. However, I feel the need to express my admiration for this unique film. Bonnie Hunt has proved that she is not only an extraordinary actor, but also a wonderful director and script writer. This movie is everything and is full of humanity, affection, sense of humor ... Don't miss it, don't wait anymore. And don't pay attention to poor ratings. Some viewers forget that this type of film has to be followed by the heart, not just the eyes. If some viewers prefer Notting Hill or you have Mail, they are in error. For me, the return to me is a real gem, an unforgettable movie.
