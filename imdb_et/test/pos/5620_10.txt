The film is a splicing of shootings made for 11 weeks and leaves many of the fun holes that an observer can find for himself. <br /> <br /> However, the film's figs have been long. by their music and exhibition. There are a lot of music with classical works by Heifetz and Meremblum, one of the leading youth symphonies of the day. It would be worth it to look at the picture itself.

Children of the orchestra, most of whom were little or no, must be led by Archie Mayo crazy, looking into the camera, moving their parts and overestimating the instructions given to them. But the spontaneity that results from their absence gives the image an interesting charm. Veteran actors were admiring the material they had to work with. Walter Brennan was in his role, which he emulated in real life. Joel McCrea and Andrea Leeds were perfect for their parts. And the supportive actor was real Who are the characters of the character: Marjorie Main, Arthur Hohl, Paul Harvey, Charles Coleman, Perry Ivins and Porter Hall in his difficult role - everything is perfectly cast. And a bit of players: Jessie Arnold, John Hamilton, Marjorie Wood, Jimmy Flavin, Dulcie Day, Gravel-shaped Lee Phelps in their usual role as police and many others.
