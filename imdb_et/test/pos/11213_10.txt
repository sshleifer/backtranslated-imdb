People need to learn to look at what's on the screen. It is an excellent film based on the slow and careful collection of details that help to create the personalities of these two men. The passivity of Yusuf (Emin Toprak), the cousin of the country, is well described by his fear of talking to women. He has at least three ways to start a conversation with a young woman and lose everything. She has undergone several decades of undergraduate studies and perhaps unemployment. <br /> <br /> A container is another case. He got out of the small town, working very hard (we imagine it), and his resentment, such as Yusuf, is striking (he leaves flakes on the expensive carpet - slobile!). We are shown a group of friends talking about Tarkovsky, and we notice that Mahmut regrets, but only a little regret that his work has become commercial over the years. The gap between relatives becomes wider and wider. The subject of the trap of the mouse is wonderful, it brings out Yusuf's compassion and confusion and solving the problems of Mahmut's cold blood. <br /> <br /> I was reminded of two classic men's movies that travel each other: Chabroli Les Cousins ​​(a rich Hitler-challenged boy, played by Brialy, is always in my mind) and Spider Woman Kiss (William Hurt can't understand) why everyone thinks so). Nuri Bilge Ceylan takes his place among ten top leaders. I hope that in the future, instead of directing, writing and taking pictures of his films, he will rely on collaboration partners.
