Undoubtedly, I have the most impressive gay-oriented movie I've seen. C. Jay Cox hit the head with this nail. How he dealt with issues of faith, family, and sexuality was very well done. Casting was perfect. Wes Ramsey did a fantastic job of pulling out Christian's character and Steve Sandvoss knocking your socks in Aaron's role. Both brought an amazing amount of reality to the impact and impact of these problems on young men. Like a homosexual man who grew up in a very religious environment (though not Mormon), for me, Aaronic character identification was phenomenal. We strongly recommend this movie to anyone, loyal or not, who is interested in how young gay men often interact with family and friends in an unfriendly world. By the way, the music in this movie stones! Another great work by C. Jay Cox.
