First of all, I have to admit that I have doubts about the director. He has made some films (with Jarkovsky) about the recent "Czech = East" history, or more specifically about families (individuals), how they lived some historical moments. But it was always like oven steaks food. This movie was completely different. It was pure, showing the bones of life, it shows variations of human nature. This movie is a great work of art (story, actor, picture, music), but it shows you the life around you in a much brighter light that we don't want to see. By the way, I've seen it on a DVD (with English subtitles), but I'm afraid I can't get it in the US.
