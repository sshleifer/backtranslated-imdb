"Radio Flyer" is one of my most loved American films. <br /> <br /> Two boys, Joe Mazzello and Elija Wood, really do a great job (despite T.Hanks's terrible result at the beginning and end) ...) with an excellent DMEwan script and powerful and emotional control by R.Donner and H Zimmer's absolutely unbelievably peerless music spot enabled the "radio flyer" to win one of the first places in my family's movie rating. br /> <br /> It is so unfortunate that some very important films are underestimated by some film critics. <br /> <br /> I can't just help the DVD to see it.
