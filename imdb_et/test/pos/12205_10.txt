I'm sorry that SURFACE hasn't been lifted in the NBC 2006-2007 season. I think the market demand for a failed game and reality shows on television, reflecting the feeling of our culture, has conquered a good story. I hope and pray that some networks will take it up so that it continues like STARGATE and its spin-off. <br /> <br /> I also hope that manufacturers will find a place where they can produce a level of post production in a TV Guide interviewed. Currently, Sci-Fi, marathons have to work. I would like to see that story goes after the tsunami that ended with Episode 15. \ t I would like to know what is the main blending of the real identity of the beings in effective efforts. <br /> <br /> FYC Morningbear
