Craig Brewer is now officially a writer / director for whom I see no movie, no matter how bad it may seem. His debut, Hustle and Flow, was one of my favorites this year with my emotionally charged story and realistic, faulty characters. I wasn't quite sure what I was thinking after seeing this second-degree effort. The cast seemed great, the trailer used music efficiently, but it seemed that there was a good chance that it would go beyond absurdity and speed. Fortunately, Black Snake Moan hits all his brands dead. The action is amazing, writing excellent and editing style, as well as side-by-side music that rips all the way. Brewer seems to be a captain to get his signs that they have the right combination of compassion and malice when they push on their way. <br /> </p> Shortened credit sequence at the beginning. As with Hustle and Flow, Brewer puts music over widescreen frames perfectly in a static form. The 70's aesthetics were welcome and helped to show that it would be another great character that was in vain in the best decade of the cinema. So far, we continued with the short fragments of both Lazarus and Rae, with each vignette reflecting you when they traveled to a fatal moment when their paths finally crossed. Editing between them was rather liquid and appropriate than a sharp cut before the scene ended its goal. Rae's boy leaves for service and Laz's wife leaves her with her brother. Everyone knows loneliness and returns to what they know in this situation? Rae for sex and Laz bottle. Only when Rae is left dead by the road and her rescuer arrives from her farm to take her, will the rationale for their activities finally become clear. <br /> <br /> Samuel L. Jackson is fantastic as an older bluesman farmer who tries to reconcile his life with God and the flesh and pain he has brought. There are moments of stoic stubbornness and kindness with his imprisonment / patient. You never see the setting as comical or unreal because it sells what it does. Also, Rae's character is not a very long chain, regardless of what the trailers would have believed. The situation starts a bit uncomfortable until we see that chaining was his own and used only in one or two days. As for this chained girl, Christina Ricci really looks like. I never saw her special, but this role is a real breakthrough for her. This girl is so concerned that her earlier sexual abuse has been very intimidating to her. Every time he is away from his love, he begins to see the flashing of the person who took the innocence of his childhood and itchy so that every person could leave that picture. His nymphomania is not a joy, but rather a survival of haunting nightmares that always hide behind the eyelids. Ricci is full of this role and shows emotional trauma to great influences and realism. Justin Timberlake should also be mentioned, again showing some real talent. When this guy came, I have no clue, but hopefully he will continue to make more films and lead away from the mostly outgoing music he casts out. <br /> <br /> Although not as sure and consistent as Hustle and Flow, Moan is still, in my mind, because, when it is turned on, it is remarkable. After all, we have a truly tempting sequence where "This Little Light of Light" sings out, and previously the interaction between the chain and the master, when the chain is first introduced, is some cutting-edge work. But the truly magical moment is when Jackson sings (yes, it's all over, like it was Terrence Howard in Hustle) when the thunder rushed and the lights blink. If I don't look more beautiful all year round, I'm not surprised. What these two people do for each other is wonderful and shows what humanity is capable of. One thing I think I really enjoy about Brewer's work is that he doesn't show sinners who receive redeemed heroes. Instead, he shows us that no matter how bad you have been or how bad your life has been, everyone can try to redeem and be better people. We don't have a holiday here, but the wrong people who want to improve their ship. If the course stays true or if it falls into the darkness, no one really knows, but at least they can say they tried as hard as possible.
