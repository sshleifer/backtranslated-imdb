"Chucky Bride" is one of the best horror films that has come out in the last ten years and could be one of the best horror films of the 90s. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Chucky girlfriend, Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) manages to find her crap after being sucked into the fan at the end of part 3 and bringing her to the trailer park . His neighbor Jessie (Nick Stabile) and his girlfriend Jade (Katherine Heigl) are being tortured by his uncle. (John Ritter) Tiffany disturbs Chucky when he refuses to marry him so he buys a doll for him to play. Chucky kills Tiffany and then carries the soul of his soul that he got. To put them back in the human bodies, they have to travel to New Jersey to do so. Jessie sees it as an opportunity to escape from Ritter, and they are on their way, but before Ritter is killed by Chucky and Tiffany. Occasionally, some strange cases force you to stop at bed and breakfast. When several people are killed, they invite their best friend (Gordon Woolvett) to straighten the situation. They persuade him and none of them are killers because the police have begun to deal with crimes. He finds Ritter's body in the trunk of the back of the bathtub. Thinking he's built up, he's standing against them. Chucky and Tiffany then in turn prove that they did what would get Woolvett's death. The group steals the car home and arrives at the cemetery. Jessie and Jade get Chucky and Tiffany to turn on each other, giving them enough escape. Chucky restores Jade and forces her to get an amulet. Chucky and Tiffany start their work, giving Jessi and Jade enough time to kill both when the police arrive and cleanse these crimes. <br /> <br /> Good news: I have to give the most amount of props to the FX department, like Chucky and Tiffany, when the dolls are absolutely convincing. The scenes that accompany them are the main highlights of the movies, including a fun conversation, where Tiffany suggests to Chucky how to get serial numbers in the 90s. That said, the number of individual liners in this movie that is actually funny is incredible. Chucky gets the most of them, but Tiffany also cracks some gems. It's actually funnier than what Hollywood calls these days. Gore is a lot and shockingly realistic. Many deaths in this film are actually original and creative. Converting Ritter to Pinhead's new form was a completely brilliant scene. The honeymooning couple also had a nice death scene. Stabile and Heigl work perfectly for teenage love. They have a great chemistry and they act like a normal couple. I also have to admit that for the first time I saw this movie, jumped during certain scenes and it shows what incredible work organizer Yu did. He probably learned quite the same as "Freddy vs Jason." He knows how to staged productions and payouts, and here he shows great skills with the look and style of Hong Kong. He could be the next great fearsman if he continues his re-launch with films like these two. Also amazing sound like "Freddy vs Jason." <br /> Bad news: For fans of Cheesy movies, it's great. However, this film has a high cheese factor that can prevent a serious horror fan from enjoying this movie. The film knows that it is a chewing film and rejoices in it, making it a serious fan off because of things like single layer. It's not all that bad for a movie, but it's to be remembered that this is a cheesy movie and that the joy of certain scenes adds to the movie, not to take it away. Remove yourself from this spiritual state and you can find the enjoyment of this movie. <br /> <br /> Final decision: Cheesy movie fans and other "Childrens Games" will find a lot of fun about this movie. For serious fear fans, check this out, but keep in mind that this is not a serious movie and that joy is expected to exist and you may like it. <br /> <br /> R rated Graphic violence, graphic language, short nudity doll, shady doll girl, some drug use and numerous drugs.
