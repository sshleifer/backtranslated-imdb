This is the first movie I've seen in Singapore and it's great. If you don't know much about Asia, its languages ​​and culture, this film can be a little confusing for uninformed people. As an Asian-American who has two Asian languages ​​(one of Mandarin) twice as big and has taken some Asian-American studies, it was easier for me to understand this film, but even without it I believe this movie is until you You must remember that this is an era-type film. The film is definitely worth taking to see what issues Singapore's young teenage boys are fighting and dealing with. It's a fantastic movie of the era, but filmed and shown in a more artistic and original way. Participants are outstanding.
