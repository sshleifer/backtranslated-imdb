I was lucky enough to watch this movie at a recent international film festival here. I was actually able to watch another South Korean film (The Kangwon Province power), but in August I got more attention for Christmas. The story is simple enough, an ordinary boy meets a girl (or say a girl-boy?). What made me special was how it was done. We can say that the movie was quiet and cute. We have no terrible and viable romance here, but two ordinary beings whom their friendship and unpublished love are wonderful. I also liked how the film used films as an expression of both past and present relations. I wanted it to be shown here as a regular movie. I'm sure it would call a bigger audience.
