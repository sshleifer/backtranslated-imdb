I love it! I love Pauly Shore. Some people seem to disagree. It's humor and it's not like everyone else. The film is great. I love the story line and most people in the movie. It's funny when he first meets at school. I like to choose her home back home. I like Tiffan's Theissan not finally a bad girl. All secrets are issued. In the end, only the people you want to see remain. (except for those who don't like Pauly Shore.) Even if you don't like it, there are funny parts and his family tortures him through most of the film. She is a country girl who has gone to nature and needs to be heard. He will do it in the end. It is just the right amount of love and romance. I'll give him 8 out of 10.
