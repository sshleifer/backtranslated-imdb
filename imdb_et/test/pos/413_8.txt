The legendary hammy and arrogant horror movie star Conrad Radzoff (perfectly played by Ferdy Mayne's evil sardonic aplomb) dies of a heart attack. A number of drama school students steal the body of Radzoff from their crypt and lead it to a degraded mansion so that they can participate in it. Radzoff comes back to life and chooses rude youngsters to kill the grave. Writer / director Norman Thaddeus Vane prepares a fresh, original and even pretty stylish spin at a regular body census, offers good Hollywood milieu, and does a tough job to maintain a pleasantly foggy and spooky booga-ambience. Destruction kits offer terrible goods if the gal is a fire, a juicy snippet (a crushed head rolls down the stairs and attached to a lawn, so the cliff can hit it!) When a gentle coffin rating is a definite terrible pressure. Kudos also has to have the familiar B-flick face stars: Mayne has a distinguished prominent prominent ball, Leon Askin helps as an amusing director when bitterly directed by Wolfgang, Nita Talbot adds some class of Psychological media to Mrs. Rohmer, plus there There are beautiful moves by Luca Bercovici jerky drama student circle Saint, Jennifer Starrett as sweet Meg, Jeffrey Combs as geeky Stu and Scott Thomson as nerdy Bobo. The fine bits are Chuck "Porky" Mitchell Detective, Patrick Wright in one of his usual police sections and Tallie Cochrane as the dead body. Joel King's polished cinematography gives the film an attractive glossy look. Jerry Mosely's desperate hit is also hit by the trembling place. Fun little fear.
