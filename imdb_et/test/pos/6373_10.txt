I am glad that I am not the only one who is very good at this series. This is the best series for young women! I have such a strange taste of comedies and I find it so hard to please your intelligence and I'm so happy that their humor is just what I need. Love the gang of actors! If somebody knows this or just a similar movie, I'll tell you, please write back because I'm leaving this series. have all grown now, I think! <br /> <br /> Good morning / day / evening / night! (because I don't know the exact time when you read this post)
