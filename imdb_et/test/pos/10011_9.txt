I have to say that every time I see this movie, I am deeply touched not only during the most painful four years of Hongsheng's life, but also how his family deals with his drug addiction. It is also true that getting into something addictive, such as drugs, alcohol or pornography, can not only hurt you but also hurt your most important people in the world: your family. Since the family is the first priority of Asian culture, it takes courage to gather and show one person how much the family loves her. this is actually the first Chinese film I really enjoy, not for fun, but the surrounding elements (excellent exhibitions, story, great direction) make it worth watching. The most striking thing is that Hongsheng and his family act on their own instead of trying to imitate a real person. This shows the authenticity of the film.
