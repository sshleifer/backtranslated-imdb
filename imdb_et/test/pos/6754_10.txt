I still can't believe that starevich made this movie in 1934. animation is just perfect and it is amazing, all modern advanced technologies are little animation studios capable of producing such a small pearl. it has everything: a great story, beautiful writers (though it is in some cases a sick beauty), special effects ... well, it is definitely not a child's movie, but it is a must-see for anyone who is seriously interested in animation.
