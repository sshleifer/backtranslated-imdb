STORY The Chinese Tall Story tells the story of the right monk Tripitaka, who, along with his custodians Monkey, Sandy and Pigsy, make their way west to restore the ancient Sutras, eventually reaching Shache City until the end of their journey. It is not as it seems when the demons of the evil tree attack the city. Monkey is trying its best to fight but is overwhelmed, knowing that his lord is in serious danger, using his trustworthy golden staff to push Tripitaka safe. <br /> <br /> Munker ends when he lands and when he wakes up, he finds himself a young lizard named Maiyan, who takes our young hero quite shining, after many verbal misunderstandings, Maiyan is convinced that Tripitaka loves her so when a monk monk decides that he must rescue Monkey and others, he will require him to accompany him. So the inappropriate couple will start their adventure together. <br /> <br /> OVERVIEW Okay, so, this is another journey to the West, which is not a bad thing for me because I love this story and related signs, so I was a little excited to get to the DVD hands. So I think I'll start with a story that is all over the place, at first it was your usual fantasy movie, it became a ridiculous comedy, then suddenly became full of sci-fi when director Jeff Lau experimented with mixing genres, he did this is a scatological work on this film. I think this is a very unique approach when the story is beyond the infamous Monkey King, especially when you take a character like pacifist as Tripitaka, and then put it into what is in his heart. So at all, I liked it. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors are solid, with Nicholas Tse and Charlene Choi performing some very good performances, though Ah Char spends most of his time on the ugly. The supportive majority is nicely assembled, it includes all the usual EEG main stops, so Boy'Z and Isabella Leong perform, one of the actors I would like to mention is Wilson Chen, who plays Monkey King, did a good job on the Restricted Material He Seemed Monkey King's version, which was modest but arrogant, I felt like he was predicting Twins Effect II territory, but luckily that's not the case. I hope he can follow up on this central role, because the film will not leave itself open next. <br /> <br /> Okay, so let's go to the management, which is once again the whole place, Lau gives too much time to Stephen Chow-esquire's nonsense comedy that includes a scene where Tripitaka tightens himself, dresses like Spider-Man What I assume is that it will lead to the scratching of many as the film is meant to be placed in Old China. He creates two real and delicate moments between the two leaders and casts into a delicate area, but this reviewer is sometimes somewhat juice, so it didn't bother me the least. <br /> <br /> Right Now for CGI, which is mostly tolerable, there are many moments that are likely to belong to PS2, as many other reviews have said, but there are some cool moments, especially the scene where Monkey rides with a flying minion. A lot of CG gags are offered in the form of golden staff, which is becoming a variety of things ranging from huge flight exchanges to mech suits directly from the Matrix revolutions. So yes, it sounds crazy, but I think you should believe it. <br /> <br /> Right, so closing the Chinese Tall Story is not a movie without its drawbacks, but it keeps itself long enough to be entertained and generally a pleasant movie. If all of the above does not allow you to see it, then how is it, then it is much better than the twins effect II.
