Jarl and Moodysson are part of the dead political filmmakers. The people of Sweden should understand that they are trying to discover the truth when the government and media actively distort and cover events related to the EU meeting in Gothenburg. It is absolutely heartbreaking to see how the Swedish police have abused and convicted these innocent children and convicted political trials for sending text messages and other acts of revenge. The only regrettable thing about this film is that it does not reach the masses of Sweden because it is only shown in theaters and is not published on video or on television. <br /> <br /> Political film is important because it can bring new perspectives and insights into complex issues and has a role to play as a mass teacher.
