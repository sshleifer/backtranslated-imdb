It is completely different, if the burden is undervalued and black comedy, this is the film that some see, but those who do it remember it. This film creates its own universe and is exciting in every sense. What is this? I believe that rating. Probably up to the viewer, but I found this film trying to say something about the coldness and void of designer furniture and the perfect facades. Don't know if I'm right. But this movie really came to my hands. Look at this. I really hope that the team behind this film will make more movies and continue with their own, some strange style. And I forgot that this is great when Trond Fausa Aurv√•g is a perfect as a tedious guy who doesn't understand where he is, what he does and why. Failure to understand the purpose of life (in the city) is what makes him annoying. All others do, as they have said, and pretend (?) To be happy. This film is a good and humorous commentary on life in 2006.
