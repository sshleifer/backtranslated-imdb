I watched this movie quite regularly during most of my life and it never gets old. For all sniffing and insults (mostly David Spade), "Tommy Boy" is a giant heart. And it keeps this movie funny after all these years. <br /> <br /> Tommy Callahan (Chris Farley) is the son of Big Tom Callahan (Brian Dennehy), a car spare parts vendor and has traveled all over his life. But after his dead death on his wedding day, Tommy learns that the company is in debt and will soon be bought by Ray Zalinsky (Dan Akroyd), the owner of a large auto parts business. So, in order to save the company, Tommy has to travel to sell the company's new brake pads. Next to driving, Richard Hayden (David Spade) is Tommy's former classmate, who was the right man of Big Tom. <br /> <br /> The film is driven by chemistry between two SNLs (and real best friends) by Chris Farley and David Spade. Duo has enough comic energy that goes between them to power the world. It's a big, stupid man and a smart little man. It works and some of their scenes are unforgettably funny. Farley and Spade are also decent dramatic actors. Although the film is mostly comedy, it has a fair share of drama, but Spade and especially Farley are just as good as they laugh at the audience. <br /> <br /> Forgive me, but I have to talk a little more about Chris Farley. I read his biography ("The Chris Farley Show: Biography in Three Laws" for everyone who cares) and understanding who Chris was in real life made this film more special to me. Chris Farley was a really good person who fought and eventually couldn't conquer his addictions. Although it was the first film to have a big role, it is her best film. It really showed who he was and how much he had. Knowing Chris's story adds another layer to this film, although it doesn't make it less funny. <br /> <br /> Farley and Spade fit into a good screen. Rob Lowe is suitably slimy as Tommy's "new brother" and Bo Derek is his step-by-step mother. Brian Dennehy is great like Big Tom. Dennehy is easy to believe they are the father's son. Big Tom is as crazy as his son, though he is smarter and more mature. Dan Akroyd performs one of the best performances of Zalinsky, giving Tomm the hard truth behind the ad. Julie Warner is also good at Tommy's love for Michelle. <br /> <br /> For me, Peter Segal is one of the great comedy leaders. He keeps pace fast and energetically, but most importantly, he knows how to do comedy. She does not joke and she realizes that funny actors know what they are doing and allow them to do it. But Segal goes a step further. He gives "Tommy Boy" a friendly, almost nostalgic tone that draws both the heartbeat (truly) and the funny joke. <br /> <br /> Critics didn't like "Tommy Boy". Shame on them. The movie does not have to be funny to be funny (God banned Farley and Spade were forced to do a silent comedy "Agency"). It's a great movie and one of my all-time favorites.
