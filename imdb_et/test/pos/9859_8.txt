I think Pierre LÃ©aud or his character is extremely extreme, but grace: I also remember a chess player and a girl who seems to have appeared at home in a casual way, something very curious ... a woman acting as a lawyer is one of the most beautiful actors for me who has ever seen the screen ... but I have to admit that the plot is too inconsistent to take it seriously. is really nice, especially if he is annoyed with a new actor, a purple t-shirt ... also a scene where a bearded actor from another company staged a stage is really exciting and relaxing, as often happens with this movie - for example, when they drink, then they just want you to have a cup ...
