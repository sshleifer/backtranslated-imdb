I just managed to find a copy of "Mission Cleopatra" that is not as easy as you think someone is living in the United States. So far, I've only been watching the first 10 minutes of the movie and I can say for sure that I laughed more in 10 minutes when I watched the first * live * Asterix movie. <br /> <br /> I look at the duplicate version, and while the duplicating work is a bit annoying, I've found the movie very funny and correct for the book. I see that the people here have said that the duplicated version is worse than the subtitles, which may be true, and after I look at the subtitled version (also on my DVD), maybe I have to come here and change the review . But as it is, I find this to be a very fun movie, and that's more than the confusion that has been made of the first movie.
