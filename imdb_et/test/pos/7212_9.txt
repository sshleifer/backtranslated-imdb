These men combine a low budget with a low budget. It's glorious. <br /> <br /> See if you want Bergman, rent a "7th Seal" or something. If you want to see greater fancy humor and abuse of sex then that's one. <br /> <br /> I think Jane Jensen, like Julia, will make it all traceable. He can actually act (really well), he's a complete dreamboat, and he doesn't seem to be upright.
