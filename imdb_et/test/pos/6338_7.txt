In addition to being a smart and well-marketed variation of today's very popular horror films and an excellent formula that attracts potential new fans in general, I have always considered "supernatural" as a huge giant tribute to the genre over decades. Although not always noticeable to younger viewers and / or people who are only interested in more recent horror films, each single episode contains some obvious and subtle references to classic and influential titles. From this point of view, it was only a matter of time before the writers paid tribute to the "terrible vehicle without driver-type films" and more specifically to the 70's "Duel" (Steven Spielberg's acclaimed debut) and "Auto". Being an avid fan of these two films, I enjoyed a lot of "Route 666" even in spite of my mistakes and flaws. The episode opens up a tense and atmospheric distance to a remote Missouri, where a black man is hunted and finally killed by a threatening monster truck that has no driver behind the wheel. The victim's daughter, Cassie, is a former Dean girlfriend and she calls Winchester Brothers for help. The brothers are unable to prevent two more similar "accidents" before discovering the unexpected presence of the ghost car related to the 60s racial dispute, involving both Cassie's parents and several well-known city dwellers. Some of my colleagues here tend to label "Route 666" as one of the weaker entries in one season, mainly because the script is preaching on racial issues and shows a different and more emotional character of the dean. He is usually a strong quiet type, while here he faces unfinished romantic things. To a certain degree, I agree with the debate on racism, but it really did not bother me. The writers had finally to explain the existence of a rubber lift and the racial conflict was acceptable to me. With regard to the dean's emotional vulnerability, I can only say that it is admirable to see how writers are constantly trying to give the main characters depth and detail. Dean's behavior with Cassie casts him a whole new light. Moreover, this episode is really a hopeless truck and its virulent attacks. It is an impressive and overflowing vehicle that produces dazzling lights and harsh engine noise. If you worshiped the above-mentioned "Duel", you will definitely find the fun in the sequences of persuasive chases depicted in "Route 666".
