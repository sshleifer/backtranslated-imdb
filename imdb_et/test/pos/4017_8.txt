The film is based on a book by Jules Verne, which I have read ten years ago. I remember that I liked the book a lot, and this movie does a good job of telling the story. But the most important thing about this movie is not the story, but the very original visual appearance is. <br /> <br /> Visual images are absolutely beautiful and are obviously achieved with a smart combination. Combined with live actors, stop-motion animation, and kits that are painted to look like an animated movie. Together with Jules Verne's own unique aircraft and submarine versions, and good control by Karel Zeman, a very well-made and convincing visual style is achieved that can keep the attention until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> There are also some problems, for example, one of the underwater scenes at the end will take a lot of time, for example, because the first part of the movie is rushed quite quickly. None of them is very important because the film is always very enjoyable. A gem that deserves more prominence for today's audience. Recommended movie for the whole family.
