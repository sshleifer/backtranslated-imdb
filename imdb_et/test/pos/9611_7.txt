Crimson starts with some cool jazz music, so I liked it right now, but when the movie was wearing, I started to wonder if the music wasn't the best. We have some thieves who are pulling the jeweler and if something goes wrong, the alarm starts and the policemen are pursuing them and when the car turns around, one of the thieves (Paul Nash, Jacinto Molina, whoever he is here) is fired. He now seems to die, but with the help of a drunken doctor and his crazy scientist's friend (and wife), he is rescued with a nightclub owner called The Sadist. Sadly, it is unfortunate that the gentlemen who kidnapped him lost his knife to remove it, so it would damage the injuries (or in this case death), they remove the head using the train, leaving the body to find the body, oops. Once the brain transplant is completed, Naschy wants to destroy all his close women because he now has his donor mindset. Well, of course, all this is quite unlikely and contains medical devices that seem to have been purchased in Radio Shack and in general it's pretty funny and buggy. But the look of the 70s is good and the music is cool. It's not so much a horror movie, but rather a thriller with a lot of criminals who fight it on green spaces and babes and other annoying things, but it's a strange entertainment that I can't describe. 7 out of 10
