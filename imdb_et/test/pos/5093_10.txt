Peter O'Toole gives an excellent result in this film. I've seen an original version of Robert Donat and I prefer a lot of Peter O'Toole's performance and film in general, although it's musical. I've never really seen anything that Mr. O'Toole has that I don't like. He is a brilliant actor, versatile, giving a vision full of passion and depth. Petula Clark also gave a surprisingly good result and was ideal for this part. It is an all-around warming film full of tenderness and bittersweet. I always remember the (para-phrase) line where Mr. Chips regrets that he has never given his children, and he says, "Of course you have hundreds of them - all boys." Thank you for the opportunity to vote on this film and to express your opinion.
