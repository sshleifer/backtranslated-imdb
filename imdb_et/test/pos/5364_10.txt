A great movie for those who just need to turn off Scotland's beautiful landscape. In fact, the film takes you on a journey of love that is in the midst of wonderful landscapes. The cast is "played" for the parts they play, so no glamorous costumes or peeled hair are in this movie, where action is great, sharp and ground. Every character is plausible, giving a convincing picture of the life, beliefs and culture of the island. time is sure for those who even have the smallest Scottish blood fall ..... because it pulls the heart strings and mixes the soul. Something that can be shared with the family and watch over and over again .............. real classic, which I am sure will walk next to some great movie that will never die.
