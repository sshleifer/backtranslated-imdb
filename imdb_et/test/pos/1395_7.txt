Although many of the copies in this film claim to be out-of-the-box, it is wrong. In fact, the movie opening segment doesn't even have a horror movie. With its sunken treasure, fish legions and mad scientists, it's much more like the adventure movie of Doug McClure. Of course, this movie is not a work of art, but it's fun to watch ... Just be warned that the start is pretty tough.
