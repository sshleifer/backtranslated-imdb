This movie is titled "Junior Pilot" here in IMDbis, but "Final Approach" by Netflix. Get your finger off! The film is a joy for both young people and adults who can stop their maturity long enough to watch this movie in the eyes of their youth. For an adult, this story is quite predictable and possibly subtle and melodramatic; whereas the story may seem new and creative to young people who have not yet seen or read such a story in a series of films or books. In any case, the film's creators, especially director James Becket, and the operator Denis Maloney, will be making this interesting and visually interesting film. The thoughts of Ricky's fantasy of the young main characters are fun and filmed. <br /> <br /> Young actors give equally credible performances that seem to be quite investing in their roles - fools are so many scenes. Jordan Garrett plays the main character "Ricky" quite well with a great camera presence. Jeffrey Tedmori delightfully creates a soft and sensitive "Shashi" who gets hot from all the ridiculous things in the sauce. Skyler Samuels and Adam Cagley are also delivering solid results. <br /> <br /> As is always the case, Larry Miller creates a solid parental figure that is surrounded by a partial, partial fantasy world of children. Compared to their father-figure, other major adult roles appear to be low and one-dimensional, deliberate and rather humorous to be sure. <br /> <br /> This movie is a simplified, youth-oriented story, of course, it is still quite fun, maybe repeatedly directed at a crowd of young people, but also for at least one adult who retains the ability to watch such a movie once in a while from a youthful perspective.
