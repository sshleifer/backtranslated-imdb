I bought this movie because of Raquel Welch. He was fantastic in this movie because he played the role of Harry (Mike Wagner) girlfriend. Harry is a robber who succeeded in trying to do another. Harry goes to a funeral where he meets Vittorio De Sica and leads him to ride. When things didn't work while driving, they put the mines together to find the quickest way to get the money. Harry and his gang, with the help of Vittorio De Sica, decide to go there. Rest assured that no matter what the gang goes, the result will never be the same and will keep you on the edge of your seat. The rest coming you have to look at yourself. As far as Raquel goes, if you are a fan here, you have to watch this movie because he never saw right on the beach ******. I'll give 10 movie cards alone in Raquel Welch's body. No wonder he was the hottest actor in the sixties. He was a sex symbol that everyone wanted and nobody could. He not only looks good, but can even do better. If you want, then Raquel Welch likes this movie
