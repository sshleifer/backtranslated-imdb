Man, I don't laugh so much this year and I find it quite difficult to laugh at me. Although I was expecting a hostel-style movie, my face even smiled from the beginning. This movie-in-film shows a female victim who drives the whole set until she finally dies. His exorbitant ride with the directors' nuts and his funny reaction tells us, viewers, that Mute Witness is not usually a fear film. <br /> <br /> The main player, muttering American make-up artist Billy Hughes, is played by beautiful but talented Russian actress Marina Zudina. His performance is top-notch; his character cannot speak, so body language and his face emotions must be compensated. And, boy, he did a great job. His sister (Fay Ripley) is a girlfriend or groom, or Evan Richards. They were both very funny. I don't break any more, but the scenes that accompany the bath, with these two, counterfeit policemen and later angry neighbors, were the usual brilliant black comedy. <br /> <br /> Ploting the plot to the end, possibly misleading. But don't worry. Such a delicious movie can be viewed in the family or the boy / girl / friend.
