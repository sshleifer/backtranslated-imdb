There's Poppa, Groove Tube, Putney Swope. It commemorates the mental age set of the NY era, the strange strange man with a strange plan, raises his petard and finally retreats to his adoptive bed. Absolutely absurd, this life looks through magic glasses, seeing things like they really are ... I don't think it's ever shown. If so, someone would have Tivo thing and put it out. Robbery goes awry: mixes with rain and storm, in and out, or in shops, our hero throws his prey into a prey and throws him on his bike in a Christmas carriage. She is surprised, surprised and incredibly disappointed when the diapers come out: she is a housewife of a medieval suburban instead of a strange lady who speaks and speaks and talks. The film is full of commuter life, suburban life, city officials, and all the stubbornly held attitudes. It pushes the boundaries of comedy, as magical reality can push drama, as Daffy Duck can use imaginative scenes to show his hardships or desires that are all plausible. All this is humorous, no one is average.
