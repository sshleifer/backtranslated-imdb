The Letter of Love is one of my favorite books of all time, so of course I was skeptical when I heard it came to be a movie. But I liked it. I found myself happy with the whole movie. I admit it's not a great movie, but definitely a pleasant hour and a half. I thought Capshaw and Scott were perfect like Helen and Johnny. Just as I imagined them. And the city and the landscape were also right. I recommend this movie, but don't wait too much, just enjoy it.
