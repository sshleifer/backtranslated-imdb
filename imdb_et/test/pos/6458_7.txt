Axel Nordman (Cassavetes) will appear on New York's docks looking for work, but with a hidden past. He gets one provided he pays the kick back to Jack Warden. When he is there, he will make friends with black Sydney Poitier, who will unfortunately lead the gut to a moral dilemma who usually learns from his problems. <br /> <br /> The film looks like an Oscar winner on Waterfront, as it seems on Waterfront, and most importantly, a lot of such 1954 Kazan productions. But this racial issue is groundbreaking for this time. Black Poitier and White Cassavet are considered equal in every sense. This can even be called the first black-and-white "friend" pictures that later dominate so many feature films. However, the central mistake of the film is unable to show why teammate Poitier first pushes friends with Cassavets. He really is going to become a friend with his newcomer. But why would he ever overcome racial barriers? One possible explanation is that Poitier wants to use Cassavet as a pretext for his teammate, Warden, but then he really comes up with this guy. Some of Cassavetes's suspicious reactions are a hint, but after that, this relationship seems unmotivated. Everything is done on the New York site without the usual movie accessories. In this sense, it is a production against Hollywood, carefully deglamorated up to the nightclub scene, which itself looks like a real after-hours crowd. I think sociologists would copy this rather raw gap to the "look of working poor". Kazan movie for convenience. Here is the fine actor of the unknown actor Kathleen Maguire as the redeeming girlfriend's role as Warden's corrupt boss, while Cassavets, like Brando, has to suffer bloody beating before restoring moral status and doing the right thing. Still, and despite the derived nature, the harsh urban science retains enough initial power to look at it.
