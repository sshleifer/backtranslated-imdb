The priest, in deep love and suffering, did not show the result of love, but the process of love and salvation has a human (or vampire?) High-soul beauty. http://www.plaza.rakuten.co.jp/confuoco/diary/200911290000/ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And the love of Femme fatale is not infamous but lovely taking a responsible death as a vampire. He did not fall deep into paradise, but decided to leave the man alone. Insecure but lovely Femme fatale! This film made me think about the suffering of people and vampires, far from the priest and salvation. I also thought about love. Adam was not so responsible for Eve, but the Adam (the priest) who was sacrificing and responsible to choose Eve Paradise from the lost, vampire world. Another Adam and Eve Symphonic Poem, Paradise Lost.
