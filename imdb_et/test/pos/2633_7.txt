For some reason some exhibitions just failed ... some worthy, some not ... Buddy Faro was an interesting character and dark humor that was nice to watch ... but it had "spiciness" about what made it enjoyable ... that it is said that it seems like I can be the only one who is watching .... Dennis Farina and Frank Whaley were perfectly cast into their roles ... the quality of production and writing was great and Vegas was the perfect background ... hopefully the first and only season will appear DVD, because I believe it deserves a certain reputation ... maybe at least doing it on telema ... cheers
