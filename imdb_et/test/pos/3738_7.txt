Eichard Gere & Diane Lane return to the story of another romantic love. They are a great team, but in no way is this film the best, <br /> <br /> Director George Wolfe, who uses Nicholas Sparks' novel Ann Peacock and John Romanao, is doing a great job. This is another story of two strangers who meet and fall in love, then go on from there when they start meeting again and start life together. <br /> <br /> SPOILER, but not really. Tragedy happens, one of them dies. <br /> <br /> How many times have we seen it? <br /> <br /> Those who haven't seen such tears will hopefully like it more than me. This story is for every clich√©. <br /> <br /> The only reason why it has ratings that I give. is due to fine and excellent production. In addition to our two stars, Christopher Meloni, Viola Davis & Scott Glenn also belong. they all give real good results and do the best they could. <br /> <br /> There is a good but not over-ridden storm sequence, Sex Scenes are well done, no nudity and no language error, <br /> <br /> Ratings: *** (4) 82 points (out of 100 ) IMDb 7 out of 10)
