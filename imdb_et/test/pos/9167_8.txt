I think the main idea behind every movie is entertainment or information. If you want information you look at for watching real movies and historical movies. Sometimes they are the same. The other side of the coin is entertainment. Did Hitch amuse me? Yes, it was. Okay, the formula is standard. The boy meets the girl or in this case the boys met the girls. They gather together and then fall together. But how it happened in the movie was refreshing. I especially liked the bar scene with Hitch and Sara. The romance of Allegra Albert was a joy to observe, most REAL men are shy when it comes to the woman of their dreams, and I would have had Hitch's advice. The first comment on this movie, which showed that this movie has been played safely and well, has laughed yet. I do not agree that there are so many smiles that can be wrapped in romantic comedy without making it a farce. There are serious moments in addition to relationships. All in all, I found that Hitch is quite fun, the actors did a good job (I watch them from other movies) and Hitch is a movie that I am very happy about in my DVD collection.
