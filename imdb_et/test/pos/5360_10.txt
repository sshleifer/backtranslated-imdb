Waiting for "Wallace and the Gromit fan", I waited for this full-length movie. Surprisingly I saw it in the world premiere of Vlissingen (NL) on Sea by the Sea. A great feeling to be one of the first to see this very fun and joyful movie. In relation to Wallace and Gromit (whom I believe do not need an introduction), the city has its own pest control company that organizes a huge vegetable competition in a few days. Everyone, including the eccentric baroness, hopes that his giant carrot or melon will win a golden carrot. Unfortunately, the city suffers from many hungry rabbits. This is where W&G comes in. They have their own chances of breaking their human beings for the control of their cute creatures. <br /> <br /> This is a very funny and colorful story. Anyone who liked three W&G short films (which is more than great!) Loves this full-length movie. Nick Park really gave an excellent and original result with a great sense of humor. Like Chicken Run, I am amazed at how she can capture so many stories and emotions in a couple of frames. "Work well done, boy" ;-) Oh yes: the music was fantastic! In fact, the race ends. Enjoy!
