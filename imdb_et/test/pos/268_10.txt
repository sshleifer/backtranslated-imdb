I'm surprised that so far my only comment on this is. movie ... as far as I am aware, the series itself has had a huge following, both reviewers and real people have praised it for the person. Anyway, let me say right now that if I like you, you are a mammal of police dramas, you like "The Lost Child" Tennison, the heroine of the whole Prime Suspect series, has won the police unit of the entire series, reaching its current, relatively powerful rank in the police hierarchy through hard work, fatigue and the talents associated with police work. She is essentially an ambitious career woman, but she has a romantic aspect and is definitely not a person. Unfortunately, his relationship with the evil times his career demands, and he is never married, so when he finds himself out of the last things, he is faced with the choice of becoming a mother and threatening his entire police work, not to mention the future or abortion - which he chooses. In the case of this abortion, this drama is never great - it is very skilfully handled, in less than a few minutes, the wonders of the economy in scripts and editing - but it is always there, as opposed to Tennison's desperate efforts to find another "lost child" - a kidnapping victim - before it is too late. The story takes a lot of surprises before the surprise ends, and one is fascinated, the same as the plot, and the characters (although I found a lot of dishes a little resurrected), the police, especially Tennison itself, are not always competent, nor pleasing that thinks given the unpleasant work they have to do on the stupid alley that this series usually lives on. <br /> <br /> Mirren himself has said that he does not do more in the series of films, but as he has always been in the role of Tennison, this series is "actor's proof", as well as another addiction to me - Dick Wolf of America's "Law and Order" - who appears there, anyone could go forever. Like my hopeless hope.
