The bay is a brand new killer and he does the work of God. Yeah, of course! This killer makes Jason Voorhe look like a field and Freddy Krueger looks like a guy against a doll with this guy. He is Jacob Goodnight (WWE's Glen "KANE" Jacobs), a 7-year-old monster who uses Ax and hook and chain. These guns are not something that he actually hangs from the sockets of his actual sophisticated victims. It's completely methodological! When the meeting took place 4 years earlier, Jacob killed the rookie policeman and beat the veteran after putting the ball. How did Goodnight live after four years? He has now been condemned at the Blackwell hotel. And this hotel had many stories to tell. I thought this movie was haunting and interesting. I liked the part where Goodnight checked one girl on the back of a tattoo. And Goodnight himself is really thanks to his manic mother. If you think Friday 13th was something, you mean again. This movie leaves you on the edge of your seat. And I think hanging the eyeball was cooling the bone. This movie proves this, and it was not a waste of my time. I enjoyed it. The title is not lying! Rating 2.5 out of 5 stars!
