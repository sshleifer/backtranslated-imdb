To some extent writers, David Croft and Jimmy Perry, have the experience of Butlins Holiday Camp entertainers in the UK on the same schedule, followed by "Hi-De-Hi!" amazes the post-war UK "slip, postcard humor" located in the fictional seaside town of Crimpton-on-Sea. British coast, owned by rich but never seen (on screen) Joe Maplin. <br /> <br /> Although the actual exhibition started with a pilot episode in 1980 and lasted until 1988, when the BBC held it in this top-notch comedy department, the years 1-5 in 1959 focused on the 1960s. years - the time when the old style British Holiday Camp started to fall, in the first 5 seasons, Jeffrey Fairbrother (played very late, great Simon Cadell) was a camp entertainer, with a meaningful but somewhat meaningful former university professor who interrupted his upper class background and pulled himself "real" world to lead a team of their entertainment staff who were in sharp contrast to their impartial person on June 6, replacing Fairbrother Clive Dempster (played by David Griffin when Cadell finished the show at its height), a former RAF hero who was in many ways similar to Cadell backgrounds for backgrounds but more gentleman than gentleman. <br /> <br /> But the real stars of the nine-season Hi-De-Hi were Ted Bovis (played great by Paul Shane), a stereotypical working class, ale drinking, a funny comic - someone who could never resist to entertain campers; Gladys Pugh (played by Ruth Madoc, who is currently experiencing a career return with BBC Comedy, "Little Britain"), Yellowcoat leader (called by amusement staff because of his light yellow jackets) and sports organizer - but more importantly one person who saved Jeffrey Fairbrother and Clive Dempster's embarrassment, interrupting his inexperience in running a holiday camp; Peggy Ollerenshaw (Su Pollard), a slightly buggy but lovable sub-home with an exciting ambition to become a Yellowcoat, and Spike Dixon (Jeffrey Holland), Tedi's innocent defense member learns more with acting than he hoped. /> <br /> As usual with Croft & Perry production, the assembled characters were a bunch of players that played great. Mr. Partridge (played by Late Leslie Dwyer, who had left her during the 70's), an alcoholic child rider; Fred Quilly (Felix Bowness), a former fighter with a dubious past; Yvonne & Barry Stuart-Hargreaves (Dianne Holland & Barry Howard), former snobbish dance dance masters, who were in their dusk; Sylvia and Betty (Nikki Kelly and Rikki Howard), the two main girls, Yellowcoats, who were always looking for fun Joe Maplin would never allow their camps. <br /> <br /> "Hi-De-Hey" characterized the late-50s stroke, where it is funny and to some extent vulgar "lips" humor (jokes about people sitting in the lavatory and anecdotes about "big knockers of women") were the day ). But despite being a "Carry On" funniness, it was always so innocent and in the 80s got some recommended family viewing. Of course, the critics of the exhibition noted that the exhibition was welcome a few years ago, but I do not agree. Although the early season focused mainly on humus and sloppy humor, the latest "Hi-De-Hi" series saw more thoughts in scripts and the main characters (especially Spike Dixon & Gladys Pugh) were able to grow into more sensitive lines. Nevertheless, there were some criticisms about the exhibition. Clive Dempster was not Jeffrey Fairbrother, and the former could not use Gladys screen chemistry as Jeffrey did (I think it would have been more credible if Gladys had been married to Jeff); Five seasons, dedicated to 1959 and four to 1960, caused more than just a few flaws in continuity (disappearance of old faces and introduction of new characters was not properly explained, especially with Yellowcoats who came and went on a regular basis; Gladys Pugh, who was a freely loving man-eater who was suddenly naive to a virgin, as well as a character, said in a pilot episode that most of the 1959 holiday period was the first in the season, so there was something incredible to stretch the five consecutive series of years wasn't meant to look carefully, and comedy overweighted its bugs. <br /> <br /> All "Hi-De-Hi" was probably one of the last comedies of the BBC's golden period, and even if he could not get the British comic strips like " Only fools and horses "," porridge "or even" last summer wine "are" Hi De Hi "t remembered as comedy, which all over the pe If you haven't checked it yourself, please do so.
