One of the few comedy Twilight zones that is really good. We have Floyd The Barber from the Andy Griffith Show, The Old Store Geezer beats many of the old west and the loving old Frisby. It is also that the cool spacecraft interior that I believe was used in the Sci Fi classic banned Planet.Or for the Day Earth Stood Sill.Plus new guys in the city are flying exotic Renault (I think) sports car back in days when European cars were known in the US as "foreign jobs". The whole sense of harmony as a weapon is a hoot. And the fact that Frisby's mates love her despite being an entire BS artist is a warm-hearted moment.
