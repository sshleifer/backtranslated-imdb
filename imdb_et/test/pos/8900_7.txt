I was a big fan of Asterix comics when I was a kid and everyone was watching. I didn't hear about this movie when it appeared, but I watched it with the kids last night. I remembered the comic well enough to find out that much of the movie's story has been added. Some of the changes I thought were a bit outraged (like the nephew "modern" dancing and the Viking chief daughter - almost everything about him), but I found it to be fun enough. Most importantly, seeing the reactions my kids looked at confirmed that the film is content with their target audience. As a family movie, it works better than the other Asterix titles I've seen. Many of the names that were not found in the book had the same complaint as they were. In general, it is a pleasant family film, whether you are an asterix fan or not.
