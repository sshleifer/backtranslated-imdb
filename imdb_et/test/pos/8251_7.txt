Just brilliant to be credible and still fun, it's a clean slice of the 1970s (even policemen need bad discounts). Shot in London and around it, an American ex-con plot that is trying to go straight, but finds itself as an electrician in Mayfair's bank, and then screws by the criminal David Niven and finds himself a perpetrator of the century is well handled. <br /> <br /> I liked its simplicity and even the innocence, it hurts back to the time when capri movies, just that, capers and violence were not part of the deal <br /> <br /> All in all, you can do much worse than watch it: it has enough turns to give it a nice and cast, which probably made it fun. <br /> <br /> Well done and traceable.
