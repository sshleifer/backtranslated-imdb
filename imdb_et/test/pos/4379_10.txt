This movie was so good! It was fun! There are so many jokes that you can watch the movie easily and still not get tired. John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson were fantastic like Pete Hogwallop and Delmar! I love these men! I also love the adventures they went on. Definitely recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> The music of this movie is also terrible! I love the song with all the songs!
