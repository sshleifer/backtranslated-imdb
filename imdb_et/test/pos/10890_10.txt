We've all played Halo and Socom and GTA and Resi etc, but none of them can stand with GE007. The game itself is great. I'm literally burning my N64 playing this great game with Zelda OOT. This game alone built a form that is important for all modern shooters. besides, the multi-player is great. The natural mode itself is worth playing a hundred times more. It's a great game for your table and you just want to shoot some people and there is endless opening. (Cheats, Aztec, Egyptian, God knows how many Multiplayer charries and three weights, as well as the famous "007" hardships) Our modern games are great, but when you sit and play this game, you get a few hours to get some other games with newer online gaming options we rarely see this old two in two styles of death, and if we don't do it if it's as good as this game, and if you play an eternal, endless mystery, disturbance and Easter eggs are found and used. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of the biggest times.
