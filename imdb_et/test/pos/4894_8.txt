The Royston Vasey characters from the three outstanding BBC TV series and the special, bizarre, grotesque (yet perverse love) heart of fictional fictitious city can jump on the celluloid with their creators - the Gulf. <br /> <br /> Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith are four-fourths more familiar with central roles. In the additional struggle, the last member of the team is Jeremy Dyson's actor Michael Sheen. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Dyson (Sheen) is in a conversation with his writing cohorts, when - with horror horror - his two boldest characters visit him. Both Tubbs (Pemberton) and Edward Tattsyrup (Shearsmith) are not happy with the decision to kill Vasey's residents. "You're not real!" punishes Dyson in vain, as local shopkeepers hell exactly their revenge. Mayhem follows because reality and Vasey are approaching our world to save our great rescuers. <br /> <br /> Confused? You are, like a camp, an enthusiastic military, forced by Herr Lipp (Pemberton) into the daily shade of Pemberton (Pemberton), while Pemberton (Pemberton) is kidnapped by cannibalist butcher Hillary Briss (Gatiss) and Geoff Tipps (Shearsmith). <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As for the more demented Misery shades, Briss is trying to force Pemberton to rewrite the film - continuing his life - but leaving Geoff's responsibility is never a good idea. The Historic Comedian enters The League's latest Vasey adventure - King's Evil - which typically enters the twisted 17th century England, with the lights of Victoria Wood, Peter Kay and David Warner. Geoff saves the day and treats her as a hero, known as Asda George (because of her chosen line of clothing), but with her release, she joins the old and new people at Royston Vasey Church. makers. <br /> <br /> For fans of the series, the movie is black-and-white. And yes, it also has Papa Lazarou (albeit a little too short). Pen-loving Pauline, Mickey, Barbara and Cursed Veterinarian Matthew Chinnery are some of the other favorite examples, and too self-portraying (plus Sheen like Dyson) is also an exciting overview. The gentleman is a British comedy Radiohead - they are ambitious, groundbreaking (they know great third series) and are not satisfied with their laurels. They also share their opinion accordingly. <br /> <br /> Their macabre sense of humor is definitely not for every palate, and although it is not written only for "fans", it would be understandable to those who have seen the series before. Nonetheless, Apocalypse itself is a film and the League undoubtedly is able to attract a new fan, as well as attract and enjoy existing ones.
