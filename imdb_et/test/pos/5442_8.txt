Political Satire Comedian (Williams), who is forced to run after political campaigns and presidential dissolution. But surprisingly, we win and serve mockery. "Man of the Year" is not the most fun film or the best, but in small doses. Williams once again informed Levinson after "Good Morning, Vietnam" hit. Both seem to have great chemistry and they work from each other. I do not compare them to Scorses and DeNiro, but get the picture. While I wouldn't say it was a hurry to watch it and watch the movie in theaters, I would recommend renting it. This movie is a comedy, but also has a great satire, please if you like movies like "Scary Movie 4", it's not for you, take your brain with you to see it. - ***
