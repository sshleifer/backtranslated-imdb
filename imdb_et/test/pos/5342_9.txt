Wallace & Gromit has been around for a while, but it was their first silver screen. British TV fans, like me, were eager to see them, and the movie worked quite well in the theaters. The big reason is that the movie is fun and quite original. In the world of CG films like SHREK and TOY STORY, this stop-motion movie is a nice alternative to the trend of children's films and is completely different from cartoon. Compared to much earlier stop-motion movies (such as KING KONG and Ray Harryhausen films, like SINBAD), the quality of the characters and the movement is a light year - it looks very liquid, natural and alive. > <br /> In addition to the quality of animation, this film deserves to be taken from other levels. First, the voters do an excellent job. Second, the script is very simple, but also very cute and enjoyable. Thirdly, they can do it not only for children but for people of all ages, because the film is not saccharin and is not only directed to the younger crowd. Especially I was fascinated by a very cute movie - and especially the divine bunnies. I especially liked them for the closing credit - which made me very happy to stay in the movie. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that if you are not a real mud, you will enjoy this movie. It's fresh, funny and amazingly smart. I hope we see the sequel - and it says something because I usually hate a sequel.
