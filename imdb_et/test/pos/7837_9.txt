I found that episodes are exciting and well written. As a TV show, it was entertaining that I am looking for in fancy entertainment. I like the "relationship" between the professor and his female security officer ... although sometimes his Scottish accent is a bit difficult to understand what he is talking about. I was hoping there were more than four episodes. I know that one of the commentators / reviewers of this series was related to their doctor's opinion. I understand this gentleman's comments; but it is a fictional television series that is meant for entertainment ... does not give exact facts like a documentary. Patrick Stewart works well and makes his character credible. If you want to watch a documentary, it's not for you. But if you want to look at a unique science-based theory in entertainment-based media, you will enjoy these four episodes.
