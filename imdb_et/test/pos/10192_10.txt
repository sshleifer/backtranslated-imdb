STATE EVENT definitely sets ten on a scale that is not a small part of John Woo's masterful direction, along with Kat's excellent cinematography: some of the calmly watching shots are worth the rent; there are times when it is bound to become a film of art. Both James Tien and Sammo Hung make this type of villain that you can't help but love hate. Tien is especially good as bad worst. This is a role that reminds me of what I don't think I've ever seen (Tien usually played a hero and actually didn't even know him with his mustache). Sammo chewing gum teeth only provide an unpleasant character that seems even more inadequate; that he is also a skilled martial artist, he makes it even less pleasing - a villain you love to hate. His choreography throughout the fight is fantastic. Jackie Chan appears shortly (early and late) as a blacksmith, and I believe I looked at Yuen Biaot somewhere along the way. Tan as a driver is nothing but great.
