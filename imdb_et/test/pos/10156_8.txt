If there is one good stop movie, this is one of them. James Stewart puts a dazzling result on American Dr. Ben McKenna, who is staying in Africa with his wife and son. They stumble upon the crime scene, and Dr. McKenna's son is kidnapped for hours. <br /> <br /> Before you say, "Attaching seat belts," Dr. McKenna finds too much of a murder attempt and tries to stop it. Other people know he can be dangerous, (dangerous to them) and try to throw him away. <br /> <br /> Hank, son, is found alive and well. <br /> <br /> If you like suspenseful movies, this is what you watch. <br /> <br /> My score: 8/10.
