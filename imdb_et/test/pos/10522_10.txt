I managed to record THE DION BROTHERS, broadcast television (with ads) in the early 80s. I have given loans to many friends who all agree that this is one of the best B-band movies ever made. One day, as I walked into my NYC apartment, I saw Stacy Keach in my television series, Mickey Spilane. We had a moment to chat and I told her how much I enjoyed THE DION BROS and considered it a clean classic. She thanked me and said it was one of the best and most memorable film experiences in her career. He was very friendly and sincere, and I was grateful for the moment he took to chat with the fan. This is one of the classics that must be on the DVD.
