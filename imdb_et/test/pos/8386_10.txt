I had a PRIVILEGE to attend the British Prime Minister of Inglorious Basterds tonight! Having seen trailers that had great hopes but had doubts about any self-evident film (let's be honest, the self-evident is the middle name of his tarantinos). <br /> <br /> I was surprised that he pulled the bag out with this cat. The film is rich with interesting dialogue, Perfect timed comedy with brutal murder. <br /> <br /> The crowning of this movie is Christoph Waltz, who has no mistake or error. He succeeds in creating a real tension for the audience, but still quite "theatrical" (unable to think of the right word). He certainly earned his prize at Cannes and is undoubtedly ahead of the Oscar !!!! Hoping to see her again soon!
