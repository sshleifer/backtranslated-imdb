Cedric Klapisch's film L'AUBERGE ESPAGNOLE is a light, windy charm packed with nostalgia for our younger years and attractive youngsters. At its core, this long-lasting presentation of MTV's soap opera of reality, called the "real world", in which its motto is: "It is the seven" real stories "of the house. Let your life be let ... so see what happens, when people quit politely and become real. "That's what happens - minus the cameras planted in every minus of the house, in Spain, where Xavier (Romain Duris) remains to learn Spanish to meet his job requirements. The alien in many ways slowly forms a divorce with his coworkers coming from all corners of Europe, except America ... this is a film in which the only American shown is Wendy (divine Kelly Reilly) communicates ("admits only sex," because she has her boyfriend who makes a later but blinded look.). Throughout her stay she tries to maintain a long-term relationship with her girlfriend, played by Audrey Tautou, when she starts the initial flirting with the spouse of the Spanish house owner, where she is staying and getting advice from the lesbian house - a partner (Cecile de France) on how to attract women. L'AUBERGE ESPAGNOLE is a forgotten fun that includes the threshold in the "real world" experienced by Xavier's eyes.
