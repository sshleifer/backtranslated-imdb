As far as the Christian film goes, it is typical. The lack of our budget, which they are trying to do their best. Some times are short, sometimes they hit the mark. Lovecraft and Frank Peretti had a good idea.All this was needed was a better back story and better character development to make this a great movie. Visual images are not so bad, also smart keep demons in the last few minutes that helped to miss a good pace . Could you use a better end though. Not a bad premise of having terrorist experiments go wrong. Much better than a typical Hollywood treatment about demonic real.Maybe someone will eventually make "This current darkness" as a movie.
