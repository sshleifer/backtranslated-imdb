Two hands are a very enjoyable Aussie criminal caper, which ultimately succeeds in combining tight dramatic moments with very funny characters and situations to give the film the right balance and feeling. The comedy of the film is naturally going on and laughing is not too precise and hasn't worked too much. It's really very funny because every film character is perfectly cast and every actor / actor admits and can be related to Aussie humor. They represent it very well and very realistically. Of course, they helped enormously to write a writer / director Gregor Jordan. I read another review of this movie, which saw it, and it strongly criticized it, basically as a Pulp Fiction clone. I think it's just garbage. This movie does not try to be Pulp Fiction, the feeling and style of this great movie is completely the opposite. I don't want to fully understand this movie without wanting to be good or arrogant. humor, sincerity, characters, etc. you have to be in Australia or at least understand the culture that the other man probably did not have. Some Americans whose reviews of certain non-American films seem to be aware (and who have difficulty understanding them) of something that is not an American product. This is a real shame because it is really a big movie. Also, the love story between the main character and the girl is very real, sincere and sweet. I'm very proud that this movie is in my collection. 4.5 out of 5
