The exhibition was amazing and very professional. Madonna is a 2-hour stop, dancing and singing. Opening was pretty good when he came out of the disco ball and jumped well. The whole exhibition was full of energy, so it's hard to say what the highlights were, because each song had something special and unique. I saw a couple of my previous excursions in life (the sunken world and the tour of transformation), they were good, but you can't compare it. The dancers were fantastic, the lights and the whole show were just perfect. Madonna still looks very good. If you haven't seen it yet, I suggest you see it. You will enjoy the exhibition from start to finish. Madonna is still a dancing queen.
