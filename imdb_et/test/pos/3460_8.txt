This is definitely a movie that makes you think about the daily struggles that a person can go through every day. The two main roles play great examples of this, and you will not regret seeing this movie in any way. <br /> <br /> This is a warm-hearted story of two new wizards who explore the ups and downs of everyday life. Wheelchair location. Their friendship has been tested, as well as their spirits when they get their apartment outside the nursing home. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who loves pictures of friends or want to see a wonderful and heartfelt movie that all clich√©s and pitfalls remain clear and never innocent.
