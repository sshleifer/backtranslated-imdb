It was a classic TV classic! The story goes like this, Bobil is the girlfriend of Alicia. Bob and Alicia are in love and want to get married. Bobil is a buddy called Owen with whom he works. Owen is jealous of Alicia. He likes to hang with Bob. Now Owen hangs with Bob and Alicia. Bobil and Owen have secretary Heather. Heather is very dangerous. He's also, if you don't think so, it's lonely. He also hangs with Bob and Alicia and Owen. Sometimes Alicia wants Bobil not to be friends. <br /> <br /> By the end of the first season, Owen seemed to find himself a really long-term girlfriend. Bob and Alicia went to ride before the wedding, did it in a tiny car and then stuck. Make it out in the middle of nowhere! So what happened? But with poor Heather? Did anyone get married? Sorry, the series ended. <br /> <br /> Even TV Guide's claim did not give FOX a thought about how to put it back in the air. It was a great show with great pain. I also loved Heather. He looked cool in these glasses and was fun. I miss this example a lot. It's like reading a good book, the end of which is gone ...... sad.
