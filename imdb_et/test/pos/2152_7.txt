Biodoc is a mysterious singer / songwriter who, according to friends' accounts, spent his relatively short life in the last 15 years on a seemingly destructive mission. He died of 52's, overweight and scattered heart disease, after a protracted stroke of almost no alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, and cocaine, furious partying and blatant abuse of his vocal instrument blood). <br /> <br /> All this despite the fact that he was: (1) probably the most talented pop of his generation's singing ability; (2) successful, after years of effort on industry recognition - Oscar, Grammy, a decent recording contract with top notch, and at least two star albums - "Nilsson Schmilsson" (originals) and "A Little Schmilsson's touch at night (standards); and (3) very happily married (for the third time), a lovely young family he loved. <br /> <br /> The film's strengths begin with the fullness of Nilsson's life, including the use of a fine for archival material and many images from Nilsson; editors are doing a great job of moving photos into photos. We learn about his close ties with John Lennon and later Ringo Starr (Lennon often said Nilsson was his favorite American musician). <br /> <br /> Even more impressive are talking heads, often the weakest aspect of documentaries. Here are people like Perry Botkin, Jr., Ray Cooper, Mickey Dolenz, Terry Gilliam, Mark Hudson, Eric Idle, Rick Jarrard, Randy Newman, Van Dyke Parks, Jimmy Webb and Robin Williams, all talking about Nilsson's great stories? Many amazingly funny, others deeply pathetic - and everyone who carries him deeply. Similarly informative and moving interviews are the Nilsson women? Annie and Una, her son Zach and cousin Doug Hoefer. The best headband I can remember in a biophoto. <br /> <br /> The most striking feature of the film is that it pulls out Nilsson's music. Even his biggest hit "Without you" is short after about 8 bars. Arrrrgh !! There is no excuse for this, given that the film lasts two hours. Lose some shots and we could have heard at least this song and maybe another one, for example "One" or "Everybody's Talking" winning his Oscar. "Filmmakers are just too intent on Nilsson's psychological mystic and not attentive to his music. My grades: 7.5 / 10 (low B +) (NWFC Reel Music series, July 1, 2007)
