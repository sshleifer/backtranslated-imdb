Kannathil Muthamittal was just one of the most touching and sincere films that have been seen for a long time. a story about an adopted girl who learns the truth about her parents on her 9th birthday. he tries to learn more about his true mother and learns that his mother is now a terrorist. <br /> <br /> The greatness of the movie lies in its simplicity. me ratnam has a tendency to create unreal and superfluous signs in this movie, every person seems real and their relationship is concerned and sincere. this is why it is one of his best films. <br /> <br /> The film is emotionally emptying and drags the viewer into the heart as a 9-year-old amudha and simran as his mother is just brilliant. their relationship is the cornerstone of this movie. here are some notable mistakes, especially the scene where amudha learns that he is a child, is dirty and seems completely unreal. it is hard to believe that such sensitive parents broke such news in the way they did. another mistake is a surprisingly brilliant song. they seem to be forced and stand out again, not gelling the rest of the script. <br /> <br /> They also said it was still one of the toughest and most beautiful movies coming out of India for a long time. This beauty is not only a script or characters, but also a technical glory, the treatment of chandran camera work is pure poetry. All characters work reliably and realistic humor, especially flash scenes are fun. <br /> <br /> Sincere 9!
