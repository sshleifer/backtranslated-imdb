This film speaks of Ramon Sampedro's real life, who lived 27 years in bed before breaking his neck, and fights the battle to get legal permission for someone who can help his death. <br /> <br /> Javier Bardem is one of the best actors in his generation. Think about it: he only has to wear this film on his face! Unbelievable that he didn't even get an Oscar candidate. Now we all see that the Academy is a joke! Supporting cast was terrible! Optimistic Rosa, her lawyer Julia, the rest of the family ... Everyone has their own opinion that Ramon wants to die. <br /> <br /> Whether you are against or against euthanasia, disregard your opinions because this film deserves people all over the world! Halfway through the movie I started to cry, and it didn't stop until the credit ran. This movie is a heartache, but also a wonderful watch and I can't wait to see it again. I'll give her 9/10, and I think it's still the best film of the year.
