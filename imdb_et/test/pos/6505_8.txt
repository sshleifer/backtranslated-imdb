Scratch is a documentary about DJ and their scratch art. There is no clue as to how fun and educating this little film is in one line of the movie. It is a joyful and lively celebration of a cool subculture that is little known. It's full of great hip-hop music and you will see some of the top DJs (such as DJ Q-Bert, DJ Shadow, and Mix Master Mike Beastie from Boys) showing their stuff. Going to the movie was not sure that "scratching" can really be called an art form or that a record player can be seen as a means in itself. Scratch completely changed these thoughts. What these guys do with their record players is really amazing - it's definitely some sort of art and record player, if you know how to use it, you can make it a tool that can play as much as possible drum or guitar. And you will even get a lesson on the basics of DJ Q-Bert scratching (eg how to use a fader to get different sound effects). All of these DJs were inspired in their own way to look at the art of scratching after performing Herbie Hancock's song "Rock It" (do you remember that song, isn't it?) Living Grammys. What happened to their attention was not Hancock himself, but his DJ and his scratching. Scratch is not just scratching, but it's "scratching" thanks to the creative way in which this documentary is photographed and edited. There are moments where the clips are "rolled" quickly and then "transmitted" several times, reflecting (on the film carrier) what happens when the DJ moves back and forth quickly to the disc player using its fader (that "wickawicka-wicka" sound). Whether you are a hip hop fan or not, you can count on Scratch to give you a very enjoyable night in the movies. After I saw it, I had itching to buy my record player. And I mean it as a compliment.
