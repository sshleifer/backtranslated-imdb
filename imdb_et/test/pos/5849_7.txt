This thriller has so many turns that it was on the edge of my seat. I saw it on the video, some of the "bluff" landscapes might have been a bit more spectacular on the big screen. Sandra Bullock, Ben Chaplin ("The Truth About Cats & Dogs"), Michael Pitt (Henry Parker "Dawson's Creek") and Ryan Gosling (???) are cast.
