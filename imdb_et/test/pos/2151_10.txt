I was fortunate enough to see this movie in the Seattle Film Fest screening and it was blown how big it was. This is undoubtedly one of the best documentary films I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot!) This is a loving look at the life and times of real legends of music, music and relationships. Harry Nilsson deserves to be the one who likes Gershwin, Cole Porter and all the other great songwriters of the 20th century standards. He was considered by four Beatle members to be his peers, all of whom called him the fifth Beatle and the same wavelength as himself. <br /> <br /> Harry refused to go around so many of us don't remember him today and those who were born after his prosperity don't know who he was. It's tragic. Everyone should have the opportunity to meet this great talent. This movie is a step in the right direction to finally give it its deadline. Unfortunately, the movie still doesn't have a wide spread or even a DVD to see it. <br /> <br /> If you are someone who has the right to put DVD distribution together, PLEASE contact the filmmakers. This movie must be available. Hey VH-1, how can it screen the air, maybe put it on a DVD? Harry Nilsson deserves something less.
