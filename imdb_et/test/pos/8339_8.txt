This film, early William Wellman, is an important message, especially today. It is an understanding that sometimes things are more important than your own personal safety or well-being. The movie, led by Walter Huston, steals "Chic" sales as a Grampa performance. He is the most complete drawing and joy of the film. You understand some familiar faces when you watch a lot of movies from the 20's and 30's. Take the time to see if you have the opportunity. Recommended.
