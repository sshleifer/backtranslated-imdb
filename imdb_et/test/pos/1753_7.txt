Hoppity is charming when a little phycadelic animated film, made in 1941, has been experimenting incredibly well over time. Now I have to admit that I have a soft spot for "HoppityGoes To Town" (as it is called in the UK), having been watching his parents' VHS version repeatedly with my siblings. this morning to catch it on the fourth channel (at 0615 never less!) The movie was as pleasant as I remembered with the animation that stood in the test of time and the lovely moral story that should turn to parents and children alike. Maybe one day I'll share this forgotten classics with my own kids. A nice running time for kids (88 mins) and a simple but inclusive story there really is something like this story about the little men who come well. I really saw that it was successfully rebuilt in CGI. Notice Pixar.
