The filmmakers made a rather boring eternal story interesting and complex, focusing on their wife at home. At the same time, we come across a truly original, existential French individual. <br /> <br /> Film is more than a documentary. I never feel that I have experienced something that is in depth, which makes it even deeper. <br /> <br /> The film has visually interesting interior moments. Absolutely loved the filmmakers. (Quite a lot of Europeans credit). Hopefully, PBS will display it so that it reaches the wider audience in the US.
