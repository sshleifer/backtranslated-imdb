Undoubtedly, the film is a powerful media because of the availability of DVD / video, more than ever, which gives the filmmaker additional assurance that his story or message is likely to be seen by millions of people. The use of this tool binds the artist with innate responsibility, as the film can be both educational and entertaining, which requires certain topics to be approached and sensitized accordingly. For example, Spielberg's "Schindler List" is important, because it keeps the memory that is not to be forgotten alive, and if history tends to repeat itself, the Spielberg movie can be considered a valuable tool for the repetition of this tragedy. Similarly, the film "Focus" led by Neal Slavin, which illustrates the problematic reality of anti-Semitism that has affected millions of years after years, is still an unimaginable manifestation of any manifestation today, it will continue if it is not controlled or ignored. A disease caused by a xenophobic strain is a communicable disease that can be a terminal; this film is an effective vaccine that simply helps at least stop its spread, and hopefully it can act as a step towards its complete destruction. <br /> <br /> Lawrence Newman (William H. Macy) served his country in a great war and has since lived a quiet, normal life in New York. She has had the same job as a staff manager for about twenty years and has a middle-class neighborhood in the middle of the house where she lives with her mother (Kay Hawtrey). Lawrence is a boy who is just fine in recognizing his business and refuses to participate in issues that are not (he knows) his concern. <br /> <br /> All this is changing, but like the advent of World War II, Lawrence, along with corner market owner Finkelstein (David Paymer), is inexplicably targeting neighboring xenophobia who are affiliated with "Union Crusaders", a national organization that is Targeting your fears and hatred to Jews or anyone who even looks like a Jew. And suddenly Lawrence finds that he can no longer just sit aside and watch the game; Because now, he is a game, whether he wants to be or not. <br /> <br /> By working on the intelligent, well-written Kendrew Lascelles scenario that he adapted from Arthur Miller's novel, Slavin presents a cooling scenario that consistently explores the impact of bigosis on those who are leveled; and, given the fact that it is not merely a hypothetical situation but a representation of reality, it becomes even more worrying, even more nervous. And what makes the film so effective is Slavin's obvious understanding of his subject and his investigated presentation, which is thought-provoking in this fineness. In the scene, Slavin sets the "character" of Lawrence and confirms it immediately after it gives the audience the opportunity to observe and assimilate how Lawrence's mind actually works; thinking processes that guide his life. Instead, Slavin can take his audience with Lawrence, as his problems will gradually open up. In doing so, it effectively illustrates the development of the problem, not just the problem and its management, which increases the emotional involvement of viewers and ultimately increases the impact of the film. <br /> <br /> Slavin makes an important statement about this film, which is not only a charge of grandeur, but also a warning message about apathy. And because of his credit, he never hit you with a head and did a subjective fingerprint to make his case; Instead, it will continue carefully, taking great pains to be as objective as possible and all that it pays for you. His approach is a cinematographic diplomat; and this is an approach that serves Slavin - and his film - quite well. <br /> <br /> Like Lawrence, William H. Macy - one of the best character actors in business - provides amazing performance. Identifying the credibility and credibility of your character with a sensitive, honest and introspective image. He never tries to bypass the personal mistakes of Lawrence's nature, but instead uses them to create a character that is decisively three-dimensional, which not only convinces him but also reaffirms the integrity of imaging. This makes Macy able to convey a process in which he explores his conscience, allowing the viewer to successfully share his personal epiphany experience. Ultimately, this Macy's performance strength is more than anything else that makes this movie so important. <br /> <br /> Another of the film's strengths is Laura Dern, like Gertrude Hart, which is an effective supplement to both Macy's work and Slavin. Dern lends a huge substance to his character, catching him physically and emotionally, and his colorful eagle boxes are a striking contrast to Lawrence's reserve, which works very well for both character and film. <br /> <br /> And as Sean Combs recently (in "Monster's Ball") made a good case against rejection of well-established "rock-star" catchers, meat Loaf Aday is doing a great job like Fred, Lawrence's next - The door neighbor. It also proves that a true artist produces whatever canvas he has given. <br /> <br /> Supported by Michael Copeman (Carlson), Kenneth Welsh (father of Crighton), Joseph Ziegler (Gargan) and Arlene Meadows (pr Dewitt). Such a film, which makes the filmmaker pride, "Focus", offers a memorable experience that will hopefully prove enlightening to those who do not know that such conditions exist and still - even in this, free land. 10/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
