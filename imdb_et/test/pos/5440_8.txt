The film is rather a mockumentary of corruption throughout the American system. The correlations of voices that are not important are so proven in machines that stop comedian voting at the oval office. Politicians are such jokes that we have almost comic to represent us, because we've been laughing for years. Bushism has become a way of life for Americans, and that is the only thing left after he leaves office. Strange is the honesty that no one is even elected to the post and finally speaks the truth. The story is very subtle and if you laugh, it won't happen. There's a lot to think about. In general, I enjoyed it.
