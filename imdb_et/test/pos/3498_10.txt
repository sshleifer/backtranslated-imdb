I don't see the problem with some people and their spiritual humor. If you can't find this movie fun, you'll have to get your head out of your head! If this is not your "cup of tea", look what it really is - a fucking funny movie. Maybe they DID tried to make another drug / T&A movie, but in that case they really hit the spot. This is especially fun for Ali G fans because it offers everything we love and expect from him. So I tell BIG UPS to Ali G and if that's not yours, don't sleep- BATTY BOY!
