Seeing this film, or rather a collection of films in my early teens, irreversibly changed my understanding of the possibilities of human activity and the scope of possible experiences. This monumental study of individuals and their historical environment shows how perfect and intense the existence of every human being is. People are depicted as they are: the experience of their smallest and greatest inner and outer phenomenon is detailed in the most artistic and perceptual. Edgar Reitz has a fabulous appreciation for people's motivation and longing. <br /> <br /> When these phenomena are set against the enormous time allowed by the length of work, we cannot help but understand the power and vitality of happiness, defeat, lust, love, sadness, melancholy that every person knows. When I saw these movies, I realized my future experiences of how my life inevitably wrists and trembles because of both planned and occasional events. I got a sense of longevity and what he thought about people, memories and contexts living in the past. Masterpiece and revelation. I just want the BBC to look at it again. <br /> <br /> If anyone knows where I can get a copy, can they contact me
