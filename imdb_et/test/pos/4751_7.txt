Seven Ups is a good and appealing film. It's packed with Scheider, LaBianco's reliable performances, and Richard Lynch's powerful scary presentation - though most of the characters are the tough-cut guys on the cardboard. The development of characters does not change on the screen at all. The only thing we know are good guys who are good guys and bad guys are bad. By deviating from the norms of criminals, the Seven Sunnels are able to throw Scheider and the team in a unique writing spell at the center of the building plot. Locations in New York and highlighting the choreographic car highlight the film. The only downside to the film is the slightly obscure line in the beginning. They provide little evidence to the viewer that the kidnapped men are tied to the mob (later). When someone started watching a movie in the dark, it might be a little confusing. Otherwise, there is a sharp testosterone-filled time in seven places.
