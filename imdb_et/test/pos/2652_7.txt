The film should primarily be good storytelling. It should be fun - and entertainment doesn't necessarily mean "laughing", and that doesn't necessarily mean "light." Basically, this means you don't forget to look at it. <br /> <br /> Like the brilliant 2001, it's a hard movie, especially for the current generation of video games / iPods. Its slow pace and sometimes the unbearable time it takes for an actor to take one action (eg an attempt to rescue a mobile crew member) stretches your patience. On the other hand, cinematography is brilliant, cunningly filmed, finishing thinking, and score ... the score is chilling, especially when the carrier team approaches the objects of the month. Boy, I had goose bumps, big time. It doesn't happen often when I watch movies and it shows Kubrick's leadership skills. <br /> <br /> This is considered classic and many people consider it to be the best scientific literature at all times. This is the only reason to look at it if you haven't done it yet. But just because everyone else thinks it's a brilliant movie doesn't mean you have to like it. You either (like it) or not. Maybe the slow pace is not so bad. Leading your attention to some rather static and slow pace for 2 1/2 hours can teach you a lesson. This is definitely a different experience for all those fast moving, fast-developed images that we've been through these days (either ads, music videos or video games). I think it's a "memorable" movie. But no one I look forward to will look again (unless I am especially enthusiastic about slow films). <br /> <br /> So, 7 stars out of 10 of me.
