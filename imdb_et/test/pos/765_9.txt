I heard about this movie, but didn't see it until my daughter, who saw it in Australia, told me it was a great movie. I was interested in whether Rupert Grint, away from Harry Potter, showed a promise in Potter's films. I was not disappointed. She has become a sophisticated actor, showing a range of driving hours in a shy shop that is beaten by a mother-in-law, a young man who is worthy of respect for himself and others. Through a series of games and poetry with his aging actor, it is obvious that he is ready to take on more complex roles in films and stage. But the jewel of this movie was Julie Walters. I saw her before in Potter's films, Billy Elliott and Calendar Girls and loved her. In driving lessons when he made poems about poetry and Shakespeare, I was scared of his timing, language skills and body language. I hope this was a make-up / costume because she depicts an older woman with osteoporosis, although she doesn't mention it in the movie - sister, I can say she did it completely, depicting a woman on the edge of aging but clinging to the past of sparkling wine she revealed. This is one of the best films I've seen for a long time, and I wish I saw it first in the theater - but I doubt it has never been here in Albuquerque. We lose so many such films here.
