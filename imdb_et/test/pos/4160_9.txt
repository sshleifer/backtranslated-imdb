It's Christmas time! In the case of Italian cinema, one can hope to have a rebirth or at least what can be expected. It was something for 30-40 years that the Italian cinema did not deal with such a larger piece of art. It is an absolute contemporary film that can be considered to be of the same quality as past Italian masterpieces without the need to name any. And finally, it is also Italian standards for a long time. In this film, there is a rare balance between the various elements, all of which are understandable and enjoyable at different levels. True poetry, true humor, true tenderness, true drama, true beauty. There is no rhetoric, easy surrealist shortcuts, a typical tourist turtle-shaped image, not overflowing, director's authorship. It is also cool to use two heartbeats on Nina Simone's song, which I think has never been used correctly for the score. So if this is not a true revival of Italian cinema, it is an extraordinary development for Emanuele Criales after her "Respiro" beautiful movie. "Nuovomondo" must not be missed, it is a "drug film" that is useful for making films, watching movies, helping to enjoy and understand life. Francesco Cabras
