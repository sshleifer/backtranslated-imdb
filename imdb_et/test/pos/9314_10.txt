For many years, I have learned all the great directors like Kurosawa, Lean, Fulci, Lenzi, Deodato, Peckinpah, Kubrick and admire them very much. My favorite movie is from time to time in America. <br /> <br /> I have just become a fan of D'Amato, and although he was not a horror player, his films were extreme, be it the soft core, hardcore or extreme. <br /> <br /> The Holocaust of Porn is now one of my favorite films, the way his shot is great and music is memorable. <br /> <br /> Joe D'Amato, not a horror player, neither Fulci nor Bava, but he was a captain of eroticism, no other director could shoot him with similar erotic movies, nor did he try to make any movies outside these genres. <br /> <br /> Long live Joe D'Aamto-Master of Porn and Erotica!
