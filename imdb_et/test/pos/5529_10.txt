The three zany pairs, all SIX OF A KIND, get into the looting of the stolen bank. <br /> <br /> This is a lively, entertaining comedy with six stars - Charlie Ruggles & Mary Boland, Toilet Fields & Alison Skipworth, George Burns & Gracie Allen - all heartily did what they did best: laughing. <br /> <br /> Ruggles & Boland make their movie for another man and wife - this time rather amorous than usual. They were the perfect team - he was an amazing lioness, he was a nervous rabbit - and they dominate most of the time on the screen here. From start to finish, they are a joy. <br /> <br /> Burns & Allen continues the Vaudeville-powered battery, upgraded to the radio, and finally took the television where George is the eternal crazy man and Gracie's eternal stupid. Sometimes the film tends to go a little over the top of the movie, but it doesn't like it. His heart was obviously strong gold. <br /> <br /> Although Skipworth is given a rather short fascination - only fragments coming from his great personality - Fields are their element in Nuggetville's ridiculous Sheriff, Nevada. Explain how he got the nickname? Honest John? It is best that he can complete his entire classical pool routine, preserving it forever for his grateful descendants. Eventually, he fills the strange thing - he's grabbing Gracie. <br /> <br /> Paramount was so pleased that SIX OF A BRAND was a great success because they wanted to rush the main players into another comedy. Only fields were removed. He felt that he had now reached the point where he no longer needed to share the movie with other celebrity comedians. Eventually, Studio agreed and started preparing Fields' first solo feature, YOU'RE TELLING ME (1934).
