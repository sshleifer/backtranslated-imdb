It started great. Photography and sound are the best I've experienced for years (okay, months). Particularly amazing is the use of "warm" and "cold" colors on individual sequences. There is also the idea of ​​whispering most of his lines to Jennifer Lopez, but I'm not sure what Singh wants to do with it. <br /> <br /> Now the disadvantages. The scenario was terrible. The part of Lopez turned out to be irrelevant or totally worthless. He seemed to be marked by the film only to sell himself and the picture. Three beds seemed too obvious. Child Carli's baptism was a psychologically too stressed way for Carl to "work" on the motif. And so on .. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the film was a great way to show where Singh comes from. Why do you think most talented directors now appear in India?
