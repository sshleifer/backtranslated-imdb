I watch this movie without much expectation, I think everyone should do it. This is a great TV series and of course we couldn't compare it to Gone With the Wind, but it's still nice to see. It's also weird to see another Scarlett. Joanne Whalley doesn't play Scarlett with passion and fire like Vivien Leigh, but I believe Scarlett is getting old. Don't wait to just look at it, but don't look like this: I think it's terrible.
