Except for the protagonist, the actor was not convincing to me, but the story was quite good: it is about a love relationship between a gay party and a young Mormon missionary. As you can imagine, such a relationship is quite problematic. The film is very American and has some metaphysical subtons to balance his criticism of religious intolerance. But some stories are fun: one of the main characters asks his gay colleague: "Do you believe in God?" And he says, "Do you mean: Madonna?" All in all, the movie is not one of my all-time favorites, but the script is really good and I liked it: it's fun and stands against (religious) prejudice and intolerance. I think this is an important message in our time. Since I appreciated the movies I liked less with 9, this is clearly for me 10. Some people may exaggerate it, but I think this film deserves it.
