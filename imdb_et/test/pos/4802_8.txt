you know i have seen a lot of crappy hong kong movies production and were good. But the exit from TIme was great. <br /> <br /> I think it was so good that Andy Lau and Ching Wang have such great chemistry. At the beginning of the movie is really a fast pace, but slows down not enough to even notice what is good, we don't want a heart attack, lol. In terms of plots, there are plenty of other things that interest you. There are some good moments on the table when he uses the underworld to downgrade people. The film also features the best oriental support cast because "Flying Daggers House". The film is great because it is so unpredictable and leaves you with an idea at every corner. Definitely a good rental with a ton of comedy, action and excitement for one, eight out of ten
