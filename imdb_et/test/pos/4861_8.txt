First of all, they came for the Communists and I didn't speak because I was not a Communist. Then they came to the Jews and I did not speak because I was not a Jew. Then they came to the Catholics and I didn't speak because I was Protestant. Then they came to me and by that time no one was left to tell me. <br /> <br /> This is assigned to Rev. Martin Niemoller, 1945 <br /> <br /> When it comes to intolerance or injustice, the easiest thing is to do nothing - talk and you run the risk of becoming an object of indignation. But when does too much change? Global anti-Semitic feelings allowed Hitler's genocide policy to evolve and equal doses of terror and ignorance enabled McCarthyism to destroy thousands of people in communist cleansing. Inaction is no less guilty. <br /> <br /> Lawrence Newman is a man's chameleon: quiet and unreasonable that he blends smoothly with his surroundings. Lawrence does not want to participate - if she feels an attack on a young woman, she won't tell anyone and will go to her business. His world spirals look like chaos in the glass and get lost in one of them. Lawrence's worldview and his view of him have changed forever. Although the theme of this movie is not new, its presentation is definitely unique. The irrational nature of the preferences is much easier to understand in the context - Lawrence is more interested in the assumptions that he is a Jew than his attackers. He believes that if he corrects this "supervision", that everything is fine, he does not understand that logic and prejudices will never go hand in hand. <br /> <br /> Do you play schemer (the only thing I liked about "Fargo") or a nice nice sheriff, William H. Macy's roles are related to a common thread - this character shares a fine, deliberate face gives them content. Macy's nails to Lawrence's smallest detail and speak more than a silly glance or tremble with your voice as a dialogue page. By showing, instead of saying, Lawrence is able to share its fear and confusion with the viewer. Supporting casting brings the story together. <br /> <br /> Laura Dern is convincing when Gerty, Lawrence's bastard woman, with the past. The trailer park is tough, but the second reputation wise, he has also felt the "foul" of prejudice and inadvertently worsens Lawrence's situation. Michael Lee Aday (aka "Meatloaf") is frightening as Fred, a prototypical neighbor of yellow, equal parts of ignorance and poison that connects neighbors with their virulent causes. In the middle of the middle is Finklestein (David Paymer), the focus of aggression, and a sound voice that raises important questions. The smooth delivery of the payer keeps Finklestein from becoming a stereotype or someone whose only purpose is to create compassion by making one of the strongest performances of his film. <br /> <br /> With tight editing and close-cut cinematography, there is a clean image that has little confusion and blurs claustrophobia into the air with a small town in the US - at the same time comforting and disturbing. The deliberate use of harsh lighting to emphasize the malicious aspects of a work and a carefully rated soundtrack is powerful without being enormous. Finally, the set and costume designs create an era of feeling that is an essential part of the film's message. <br /> <br /> Focus - An unusual approach to dealing with prejudices is a good reason to recommend this movie. Just consider a great story, solid action and the look of the movie as extra bonuses.
