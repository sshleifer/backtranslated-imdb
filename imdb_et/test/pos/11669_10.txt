I am surprised how the infamous filmmaker of his political left-wing passion can make such a fine, non-holy image. If you are on the death penalty, then you have seen it. If you are against the death penalty, you are still against it. But no matter what your point of view, this film at least makes you wonder why you feel how you are doing. There is no false statement in the movie.
