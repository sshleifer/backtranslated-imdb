Beauty. Terror. Poetry. Fear. The innocence. Debt. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's almost all I should write in this comment on the two inside. It is best to just watch this movie without knowing it. I didn't know any thing about the history of these two girls when I went to this movie. I was just looking at a nice cover design, didn't even read the summary on the back and put it on a DVD player. I only knew that it won several festivals on the world market and that it was highly recommended. Although the frightening part may be right, you can forget the rest, because the only thing the two inside have in common with these films is ... a ghostly expression with long black hair. It's even a little unfair to compare it to famous Japanese films because this Korean film offers a lot more and is actually a bit more complicated and intelligent than the others. <br /> <br /> This movie is just a little masterpiece and there are a few reasons (nothing to say about the plot): the film itself tried to watch me at least twice with smart surprises. And just when you think you have a conclusion (do you get it or not, it's not relevant right now) and you think the movie ends ... this movie goes a little longer. Cinematic art is amazing, using bright colors and dark dark tones throughout the day. Camera work is great when the director sometimes chooses impressive, if not innovative, angles. Some pictures are pure poetry (eg top-shot with two sisters on the lake). It all looks very stylish. There are only four main characters, but the surrounding intrigue is intense. The story itself begins a bit slowly, but there are many different shades and emotions to keep it interesting. There was even one scene (when the girls pulled down towards the lake), which suddenly reminded me of Peter Jackson's HIGH READINGS. But when the horror begins, it is quite effective. There are also some successful surprise fears. Damn, I jumped right out of my couch. The musical results are great, and at times when it shouldn't be scary, I couldn't point out that he had an Italian feeling. A bit weird for a Korean movie. But still, a great score. So much care was taken in every detail of this film, including a perfectly balanced spatial sound. <br /> <br /> I also think that calling the two indoor spaces just a movie is not enough credit. It's a more mysterious horror drama that works on both psychological and supernatural levels. No matter how you look at it, it is the horror of Asia that is among the best. It may not be comfortable, but it sometimes becomes quite scary and the subject is quite disturbed. So if you haven't seen it yet, find a copy for your DVD player, open it with a stream, and make sure you give this film full attention to your 110-minute driving time. <br /> <br /> There I hope I did a good job praising it without breaking anything.
