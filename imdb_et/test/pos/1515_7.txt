Well, this is a new one ... Famous Italian horror director Lucio Fulci will shoot the film from the famous Italian horror director named Lucio Fulci. After years and years of terrible horror sequences, it is difficult for Lucio to separate reality and apparently hallucinates from violent murders. He quickly descends into seemingly endless madness and uncontrollable poison. Even a dedicated psychiatrist cannot keep Fulci on track ... Now, when it comes to the value of pure fun and entertainment, Cat in Brain is definitely one of Fulci's most enjoyable movies. Gore is very impossible and abundant. It is impossible to describe the size of dirty mass killings, especially if you manage to get a completely uncut version (called "Nightmare Concert"). Overlaps around, casualties on all sides of the screen and chainsaws working overtime! The movie will soon become fun (because it is so exaggerated) and a perfect experience with friends when it comes to beer in the fridge. Of course, this cannot be called a masterpiece from a professional point of view! There is little or no tension to identify and the characters are completely empty. To make more room for gore, the characters are only introduced for 5 seconds and then die of dreadful death. Especially compared to Fulci's highlights, such as "The Beyond" or "Don't Torting a Duckling", this movie quickly sees a warm snack. The best way to interpret "Cat in the brain" is like Fulci's personal statement and direct attack on censorship. Maybe after seeing so many of his films? especially the latter? censored by censorship and wanted by pseudo-art critics, he wanted to apologize for a terrible confusion that cannot be cut! If you take out all the explicit violence and really sick make-up effects, you have only about 10 minutes of footage! Especially because the madness killings appear again in the movie Fulci hallucinates again. You can almost hear that our director thinks things like: "Let's see how you censor it now!" Even the whole development of the murder investigation is taking place in the background. Have any of your friends or relatives been missed? Are there police officers looking for clues that lead them to the killer? You don't know and Lucio is not worried about informing you about it because it would lead to sequences that don't need cutting. Oh, and it's pretty damn! The name "Mr. Fulci" or even "Lucio" is mentioned every 3 minutes (it is accurate 34 times in the whole movie) and our manager enjoys a clear view of the changes in the spotlights. Hey, I definitely don't blame him ... After having edited over 30 years of fun movie; he deserves a little extra fun. You are God, Mr. Fulci!
