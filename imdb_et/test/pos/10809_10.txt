This is one of the best films of the French Revolution that has ever been created. Being a person who is well versed in the time I was surprised at the detailed level. Costumes are on site. Even detailed small everyday items like ink wells, serving plates, etc. are all perfect. Like an American living in France, having access to film sites by becoming a member of various historical associations, such as the Napoleonic Union, I cannot say if I had the impression of the visual accuracy of the film. <br /> <br /> The dialect is known to be virtual quotes, and a non-preserved place is typical. I was very pleased with this movie and am disappointed that it is not yet on DVD. That is how historical drama should be done. Must See ....
