* Small spoilers * <br /> <br /> The inhabited is not scary, but it is horrible. This is an interesting "little" story that has good makeup and great special effects. <br /> <br /> Basic piece: The little girl blames the strange things that are happening in her family's new house and the accompanying playhouse with her faerie friends. <br /> <br /> Film does not waste time to move, though the end could have been more related. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend this movie to those who expect / want a hardcore horror. but I recommend it to those who want a cooler and not necessarily a thriller.
