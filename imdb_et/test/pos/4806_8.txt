Andy Lau and Lau Ching-Wan are both excellent Johnny To's tightly targeted crime thriller, which puts most Western efforts into shame. Think of it as Hong Kong's heat, but better! Everything from a movie stroke class; performances soundtrack, cinematic script. The tone remains serious all the time, but the film has a good core, black humor, friendship and romance. Of course, it will be a bit potty, but it would be a hard-hearted viewer who didn't find anything to love this movie. Thank God, Hollywood hasn't (yet) done and destroyed the classics. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie!
