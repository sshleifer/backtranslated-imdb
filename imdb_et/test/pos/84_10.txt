A very good film that focuses on a very important question. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is a very serious birth defect that is completely avoidable. If more movies were to be seen, there would be no more children like Adam. Jimmie Smith is in one of his best roles. This is a great film that takes into account a very special family with very important needs. This is not unlike the thousands of families that exist in the US today. There are the children who fight this world. The really important point is that everything could have been avoided. This movie should be viewed by more people and take what it has to say seriously. It's well done and important messages are handled gracefully.
