William M. Thackeray once said, "Good laughter is in the house of sunshine." When I looked at Take Away, I have to say that the sun is shining in my house. This movie was great, the opening was very wisely done, the story went well, in short, two fish-shop owners, who are usually enemies, are forced to form a union to participate in a fast food chain built by David and Goliath to build a restaurant on their street. The end was fun, although I found a lot of people who disagree with me. <br /> <br /> The film was very discreet, depicting contemporary Australian ethnic stereotypes, especially clashes or cultural clashes when you miss. Traditional Anglo Australian and Italian Australian stereotypes and how they found a sort of "unity, though an accident", very nice. <br /> <br /> I found Vony Colosimo's "Tony Stilano" Italian-Australian fish n. Chip shop owner in his thirties to be first-rate, his actor was very genuine and convincing, as a result of his performance he really managed to bring to the surface or I should say the Italian Australian stereotype, which is actually not too Italian, but not too Australian, Colosimo found this balance, breathing into your lungs and giving it life. <br /> <br /> Cinematography could have been better, more local area shots would have been nice, what I see was Melbourne e, but where in Melbourne? it seems to me somewhere between Ivanhoe and Bullen, though I'm not 100% sure. <br /> <br /> I don't know why so many people are comparing this movie with "The Castle", although they are similar themes that run through them, Take Away stands in his league. <br /> <br /> I think the movie was great with the capital "E", which has everything, it's funny, jokes are great, dealing with the modern problems facing Australian society, the story is fine, I loved it! I highly recommend it.
