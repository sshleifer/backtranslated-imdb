Better than the "kes-dun-it" of the World War II, which had a former geenster who suffered under amnesia and who was born again as a psychiatrist, now known as Robert Ordway, who helps both police and criminals who want to go straight. The courage of the doctors of crime is in four of the ten series and includes the victim who may have some mental problems. The link with "courage" is not very clear. <br /> <br /> This record revolves around the death of a happy hunter, Gordon Carson, whose two previous women have a mysterious situation and who in turn dies in a locked room under conditions that resemble suicide, but Dr. Ordway marks a murder. Hillary Brooke plays part of widow Kathleen Carson, who is associated with Anthony Carusa, a mysterious Spanish dancer whose work includes her sister who disappears on stage. As a mysterious novelist, Jerome Cowan is a good supporter, like Lloyd Corrigan as a criminal. <br /> <br /> Harsh doors, basement clamps and suspects who are never exposed to the air in daylight. The set of dance series is quite complicated and the ballet music is very good. Direction, production design and photography stand out. External shots and costumes refer to wealth rather than the usual B-detective thriller. <br /> <br /> Strong recommended.
