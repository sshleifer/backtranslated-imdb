Aparna Sen's 15 Park Avenue is a film about the nature of reality. <br /> <br /> A young delusional girl who tends to imagine things and hear voices, maybe just boredom, is her educated father and control-weird educated older step-sister for schizophrenia. He has been controlled, frustrated and treated as ineffective (even if it is out of love and affection), he has a strange opportunity to develop as a normal person. When a boy offers him to marry, his father and sister try to persuade him to take such a step passionately. The traumatic experience, which is mainly due to his hidden existence, eventually leads him back without return and lives full-time in his own misleading world. The family and the society around them are not able to withstand their disappointments and want to suppress these drugs with electrocution therapy, although they all have their own kind of confusion. <br /> <br /> His mother does not see irony when he allows a ghost player to treat him. His sister is a professor of physics, teaching, among other things, Quantum Mechanics, a topic in which a multitude of universes are accepted by a stream of experts, and much more in space than we can see 3. A friend speaks with admiration to a holy man who claims to hear hallucinations. Far, George W. Bush has Saddam's actual or counterfeit confusions and is allowed to penetrate Iraq. <br /> <br /> As some viewers have already pointed out, Aparna Sen has repelled all the rogue - mainstream religions - which is a pity. In other words, the accepted reality is what the majority or influential minority believes. It has been from the outset, and much more powerful than the Mithal movie, including Bruno and Galileo, has suffered as a result. <br /> <br /> The controversial and complex end of the film was necessary to show that it is a film about the nature of reality, not a case study of a schizophrenic girl. <br /> <br /> All casts have made great performances, but Shabana Azmi and Konkona Sen Sharma are great. Aparna Sen has created an outstanding philosophical film.
