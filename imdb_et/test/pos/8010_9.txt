"STEP BY STEP" is, in my opinion, a pure ABC hit! I don't remember every episode, but I still enjoyed it. It's hard to say what episode was my favorite. I think it was always funny when there were mistakes at school. I always laugh. In fact, I think almost every J.T. (Brandon's speech) and Cody's (Sasha Mitchell's) lines were funny. It would have been nice if Penny (Patrika Darb) had shown throughout the show. Everyone always gave good results, production design was remarkable, costumes were well designed and writing was always very strong. In conclusion, I hope it never ends in syndicates.
