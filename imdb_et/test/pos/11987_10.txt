I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> Someone I know doesn't like, but I do. <br /> <br /> I didn't like it as much as the first one, but it was still good. The script and chart have not changed at all, but the story was better than Caddyshack 1. <br /> <br /> The only reason I didn't like Caddyshack 2 is ... <br /> <br /> NO RODNEY DANGERFIELD! <br /> <br /> I think it would be better if Rodney Dangerfield had a part of Jackie Mason. Although I like Jackie Mason, it would be much better if they were holding Rodney Dangerfield. <br /> <br /> Another movie bug that I didn't hate so much was Dan Akroyd. The film took place 8 years after the first. Bill Murray, "Carl", could have completed his job as an assistant to green donors and joined the military. If Warner Bros had thought of it, he could have done a better film. <br /> <br /> This was my comment on Caddyshack II. <br /> <br /> I'll give it to 8.2 That could have been better, but still good. <br /> <br /> If you have seen Caddyshack 1 and discuss whether to see Caddyshack 2 or not, then try it.
