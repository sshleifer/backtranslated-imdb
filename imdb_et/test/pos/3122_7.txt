By 1950, John Ford had already developed ideas and motifs that would be the core of his most successful Western countries. For example, there is always a strong sense of community that is the most sparsely occupied Jad in the family "The Wrath of Wrath" in Steinbeck (1940). In these communities, even with Ford's racial and pioneering spirit, there is always room for smaller human activities, smaller friendships and novels that make life valuable. "Wagon Master (1950)" came after Ford had released the first two films in his "cavalry" trilogy? "Fort Apache (1948)" and "He Wore a Yellow Tape (1949)"? and it includes a similar territory without a military perspective and unfortunately John Wayne's strong leadership. Ben Johnson and Harry Cary, Jr. are beautiful actors, but they feel they should play for another five, and Ward Bond's passionate Mormon parent, though potentially a candidate for such a role, doesn't pay enough attention to the "Wagon Master" seems to have been so calmly tested with the Western formula that any character development has largely slipped. Ben Johnson's romance with Joanne Dru is treated more than anything else, and Harry Cary Jr's charming Mormon girl is so perfect that the final movie is almost non-existent, leaving one to contemplate the survival of deleted scenes. Only Charles Kemper's charismatic and shameless fear of Uncle Shiloh tries Ford, and it also works when he is surrounded by an uncertain jaw jaw force. When Ford succeeds, does he organize a conglomerate of three different races for Americans? Values-Oriented Mormoms, Light Horseshoes, Eccentric Migrants? one of the pioneers of the community looking at the white future. This obvious harmony is confused when the Uncle Shiloh's Resurrection Laws are used, which use western boundary lawlessness, but eventually lose the surprising cowboys who "only pulled the snakes." <br /> <br /> Ford considered the Wagon Master to be a favorite of his films, and perhaps it has something to do with the lack of big names like John Wayne or Henry Fonda. Armed only with the choice of its regular players, Ford is able to create a sense of community, avoiding focusing on a single character, although most Mormom passengers are still completely anonymous. Despite the fact that this is undoubtedly well done, I cannot feel that this film works well, what other Ford pictures did better: the terrible majesty of the western border was presented more beautifully, "He wore a yellow ribbon"; community romance and friendly quarrels are more prominent in Fort Apache; previous relationships with the Indians, which are only referred to here, were further explored in The Searchers (1956); bold pioneering views of early settlers were explored more mobilely (though Henry Hathaway and George Marshall) "How Western Was Won (1962)". "Wagon Captain" is pure John Ford, but it's not a landmark.
