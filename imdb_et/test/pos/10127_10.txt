The radio was a very good movie and, frankly, I will never cry in the movies. But it was close to my tears. It really got me when the mother of the radio died and she just didn't get out of her room. I really felt sad about how you could not really understand death if you were mentally slowed down. I liked this movie, and it has to be seen.
