This is just what Australian television and Australian politics need, humorous people !!! It's good for ABC to support these boys. The exhibition is based on a couple of Aussie blocks who know how to take mickey from politicians or other people in the limelight. The boys use Sydney as their main base to make the public splash. Keep an eye out for the Crazy Wharehouse Guy or Mr Ten Questions. The boys who perform these acts are the same guys who filed for CNNN. If you like the CNNNN and the glass house, you will love this example. I'm still interested to find out which stunts are real and that are purely working, because the boys do some doubts.
