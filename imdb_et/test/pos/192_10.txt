Mikhail Kalatozov's "Cranes Flying" is a great film. A golden palm-winner at the Cannes Film Festival, with excellent cinematography and performance by the only Russian actor who won the Cannes Award. She plays Veronica, a teenager who is in love with her boyfriend, happy and without worries, with marriage plans. World War II hit and his boy's army becomes a volunteer for his life. The film depicts the impact of war on teenage love and people who stayed and saw their loved ones fight, wait for a letter or other information. It is a lost innocence. Samoylova does an excellent job, and changing her character violates your heart. Camera movement is fast and many close-ups, it's a dancing camera. The first staircase scene is fantastic but it is not the only one, later there is a scene where Veronika tries to commit suicide, and the other, in my opinion, one of the most powerful scenes in the history of the movie, the bombing of Veronika's house when he runs down the stairs to find his apartment completely destroyed . Just great! 10 out of 10
