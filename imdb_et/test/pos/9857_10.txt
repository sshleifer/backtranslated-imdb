Be careful about watching 12-hour movies. It may be easy for people to assume that this is a regular performance - in fact, even in the arthouse cinema world, such mammoth times are, for obvious reasons, extremely rare. This is one thing Hollywood and art cinema share: a generally accepted 90-120-minute ride, a minority of movies that dare to approach, but rarely exceed a three-hour mark. <br /> <br For this reason, the challenge, like Out 1 (runtime: 729 minutes), is a challenge even for the most hardened cinephile, and it explains why it has ever been reviewed, and it is extremely difficult to find it initially. <br /> <br /> Originally developed by Maverick Nouvelle Vague, director Jacques Rivette's television program, it brought little interest to French networks and ended this short theater run (Peter Watkins was forced to do the same with his excellent nuclear war pseudo The War Game, although it was more related to national censorship than current time issues, it was shown a few times in 1971, Out 1 has emerged in the past twenty years in a handful of Rivette retrospects, and many who have seen it, including the esteemed US critic Jonathan Rosenbaum, has admitted it as one of the biggest movies of all time. <br /> <br /> Is it? Yes, yes, if you like Rivette, this alone is great if Jacques Rivette has never been a commercially successful director. the movie was hits (Celine and Julie Go Boating (1974) and La Belle Noiseuse (1991), both excellent), and many are hard to find on DVD today (Ou t 1 was recently made available on the Internet after a rare video tape upload). However, he is a highly respected and good reason in the film community - his playfully surreal narrative, the sense of revival and the use of improvisation made him distinguished as the most unique and satisfying filmmakers in the cinema. <br /> <br /> Out 1 deals with a theme that repeats all of Rivette's work: the nature of action, especially in the context of theater and improvisation. His pleasure to act makes Rivette's films a much more collaborative process than many of his companions, because improvisational aspects allow participants to play a much more active role in determining the composition of the film. 1 is divided into about four large narratives that gradually become intertwined and blurred as the film evolves: two are acting troupes, each of which tries to develop postmodern theater adaptations of Aeschylus games; the other two small canopies (played by Nouvelle Vague icons by Jean-Pierre Léaud and Juliet Berto) who follow eccentric money-making techniques; and an all-encompassing plot that includes a mysterious Balzac-inspired conspiracy around an organization known as the "Thirteen". <br /> <br /> As with any Rivette movie with a "conspiracy" narrative, mysteries and secret organizations are little more than red herring. As the characters are explored and explained slowly, and their plans and relationships of relationships disintegrate, the film becomes more and more symbolic of the post-1968 self and the decline of the ideals of that era. For the 1971 film, these were remarkably pre-eminent themes; another French director Jean Eustache would solve this issue equally satisfactorily in his 1973 masterpiece "Mother and Whore". But this is not the Out 1 range limit. <br /> <br /> It consists of eight episodes of about 90 minutes (at the beginning of each episode there is a short, abstract black-and-white still editing of the previous chapter's events), Out 1 is no less traceable than any high-quality TV series and can even experience better during a single episode. This does not mean that it will not stay in the segments despite the challenges. Like most Rivette movies, he uses the first few hours to just note before going to the plot, and some of these early scenes (especially sequences that show strong abstract exercises by the participants) seem endlessly long. However, these scenes are important not only for exploring improvisational behaviors that play both grammatical and metaphorical roles in the film, but as a method of adjusting the viewer at a somewhat sad pace of the film. Paradoxically, long films make the audience more acceptable, and this understanding of the pace has led Rivette, along with more modern leaders, such as Michael Haneke and Béla Tarr, to create less commercial hours that still retain the ability to leave viewers amazingly. Many famous faces of Nouvelle Vague appear, including the Léaud and Berto mentioned above, outstanding Michel Lonsdale and Rivette Bulle Ogier. Even another Eric Rohmer legendary director has a big fireball as a Balzac professor who appears in the central scene. Paris people and architecture c. However, in 1971, it seems to be just as important to play - city landscapes, crowd scenes, and spectators of interest freeze 1 time at a documentary location in a historical place. <br /> <br /> Slightly more than 720 minutes, the movie ends with an impossible short, mysterious note; Yet, the tiring journey that the viewer has taken is full of opportunities, complexity and spontaneity, so that one can be forgiven for having to start again from the beginning, or for twelve hours in the life of these stars. For those who have seen several types of cinema and thought they have seen everything the art form offers, Out 1 is a reminder that the cinema has the potential to have so many more things and to distinguish as many more directions as the current conventions allow. For filmmakers, film critics and artists from all disciplines, this is something to be appreciated.
