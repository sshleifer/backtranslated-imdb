Charlotte Beal arrives at a mental hospital in an isolated country to get a full-time nurse. He is faced with dirty groups and a seemingly wiser instructor. Is Dr Masters all he seems to be? <br /> <br /> DON'T LOOK AT THE MAIN is one of the best low-budget movies in the genre and why people always put it down outside of me. It's great, my favorite film, Betty Chandler, is Allyson's Nymphoma. Refrigerators just jump on the screen. You probably don't have to say, "It's just a movie, it's just a movie," it's not that scary, but it should turn to every spooky fan who respects the low budget horror I'm doing. It is very difficult to make a creepy film with a small budget and few actually succeed. AX is another cheap movie that will be reviewed. Perhaps the big budgets of the latest films are so spoiled that films that do not have great effects and / or are not considered classical have no chance of having an audience. But I think that after people see this movie, they see the importance of the low budget horror genre and this movie is classic, which stands out among other garbage.
