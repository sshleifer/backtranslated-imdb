Bloody wonderful. Recommended by a friend who knew I liked Thomas Kretschmann from Pian and DownFall. I loved the narrative flow - how the characters moved from the ideals of hope and dignity through shock, fear, decay, despair, and complete destruction. The first anti-war film that was to be confused in Germany. Not a proud moment for anyone and exploring a lost generation. This film was great to convey the removal of the command from the army and beat the utmost point in trying to manage nature and Russian psyche. If I didn't know, I would have thought it was Russian, it was so fatalistic. What is an uncompromising end. A lunch.
