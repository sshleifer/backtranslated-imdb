In a strange attempt, an astronaut is abandoned in the age of a month, when Alice (Florinda Bolkan), a sophisticated translator living in Italy, wakes up with a shell associated with six missions mixed with the old film that frightened her. He does not remember the last three days except for the torn photo of the Garma hotel found in his apartment. Alice drives out of her workshops to try to put together a mystery ... <br /> <br /> Often talked about as a giallo caused by her leader (fifth friend Luigi Bazzoni) and Evelyn Stewart, Nicoletta Elmi and Klaus Kinski, FOOTPRINTS, actually a deliberately lively psycho-thriller with a sci-fi record. The blurring of the difference between dreams, reality, memory, and movies is a worrying story of the beautiful Oscar winner Vittorio Storaro, who is thoughtful of Nicola Piovan. It also combines elements of diverse films such as Armando Crispino MACCHE SOLARI and Lucino Visconti DEATH IN VENICE, reflecting alienation, isolation, hallucinations, and perhaps madness. Brazilian actress Florinda Bolkan, all the time on the screen, makes her Carol Hammond's innovative image of Lucio Fulci A LIZARD IN WOMAN'S SKIN like Alice, a young woman pulls into a mystery that makes her question sensible. Locations reflect Alice's unstable mental state; The Garma Island, a seasonal, Arabic influence and ancient ruins, is a lonely, almost mystical place that does not want to give up its secrets. Evelyn Stewart has a little friend at the beginning, Nicoletta Elm and Oscar winner Lila Kedrova are hotel guests, Peter McEnery plays a beautiful biologist who is trying to help Bolkan, and increasingly intense Klaus Kinski is in "Blackmann" - "Footprints On The Moon". <br /> <br /> FOOTPRINTS is a stylish case of "Guaranteed 100% Euro-weird" but not for everyone. At the end, there is only one murder, but you will not see it when the film comes together.
