Dan Burgess is a nice guy. He happens to be a Christian. Dan doesn't have a date with the girl and thinks all her friends are fun. He is constantly bothered by the unbelievers and is entertained. <br /> <br /> Dan is praying one night and never wants to be a believer in Jesus. <br /> <br /> His request will be answered one day. Things get hairy there. The angel seems to Dan and explains his prayer. <br /> <br /> So all the effects Dan has had on starting a Christian club are <br /> <br /> and are exchanged for one day. <br /> <br /> Dan's eyes are open. His life really changed.
