Jimmy Stewart brings Charles Lindbergh's story to life when he tells almost the whole film about crossing the Atlantic. It's well changed with the setbacks of Lindebergs' life. Franz Waxman's score is bright and gives the image a heroic feeling. One of Stewarts' best roles and this movie can occasionally offer. Find performances by Murray Hamilton (Mayor of JAWS Film) on Bud Gurney.Comes with 8-15-06 DVDs, freeing up some more Stewarts classic films. I think Jimmy Stewart is America's biggest actor and never sees him see him, watch this picture and agree.
