For my money, probably the best film - or at least the most cinematic - director Ford never did. The dialogue is fast, truncated to the point. L The story starts from the beginning and ends with final credits. Ford uses a relatively small cast, but directs them and captures them with an uneven and epic proportion. Extremely realistic, warm-hearted, great-looking (hard to believe that Johnsonj didn't become a leading person after that), with the best photography and editing on any American black and white film. Has a lot of Sergei Eisenstein's editing technique, but never as cool and scientific as Eisenstein often got. And a great musical result. Great view of an important and ill-understood episode in American history. <br /> <br /> One Little Fraud: It is not clear why there are Mormons in the movie who, as far as I know, were never pacifists, Quakers, and Amish. This confusion leaves a bit of a bitter aftertaste. <br /> <br /> But the rest of the movie is a party that is easy to ignore. In all other ways, there is a real American cinema masterpiece that needs to be revived and re-inspected (and again and again).
