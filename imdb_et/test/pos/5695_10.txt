BLACK WATER is a thriller that can completely overcome its limitations (this is an indie flick), constantly subverting expectations that arise as an intense experience. <br /> <br /> The directors of all the thrillers in the middle of good animals, such as jaws, the Edge tradition, the original Cat People, know that the security system and what is not shown are the best ways to punch. The performances are real and captivating, the crocodile is very well done, even if it is believed that the Black Water website is because they used real crocs and the location of the swamps is fabulous. <br /> <br /> If you forget the black water after class B gore fest croc romp, but if you want a wise, arresting ride that is afraid of water and wondering what I would do if I was on that tree then must be seen.
