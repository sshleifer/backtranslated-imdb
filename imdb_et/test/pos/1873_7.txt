For years, Bruce Campbell, a cultural label, took a long time to get this project off the ground, but it is finally here - and what a great fun entertainment! Looking at the plot; it sounds like two things. A great base for a very stupid B-movie and a shameful excuse for Bruce Campbell to do the best - humor in the style of Evil Dead II and this movie gives both stories. A man with a screaming brain is a comic book nonsense all the time - but there are some great scenes and this movie is almost impossible. Bruce Campbell wrote, manages, produces and celebrates in this film - and although it is not a Citizen Kane, it has to be said that it is an achievement for the person who is best known for fighting with his hand in a forest house. The plot follows an American businessman William Cole with his girlfriend in Bulgaria. The journey, however, goes awry when he, his girlfriend, and the taxi driver die; thanks to the same woman. Low scientist Stacy Keach is ready to combine Cole and taxi driver's brain into one; and we have a worshiping cult on our hands. <br /> <br /> The first half hour is entertaining and the couple laughs; but when the point of the main point is fulfilled; the movie really rises. Bruce makes the best use of the scenario in all kinds of stupid situations, from changing clothes to trash, deciding (taxi driver in his brain) to eat in a restaurant. Humor is mostly cheeky, and anyone who enjoyed Evil Dead II (who should be anyone who saw it) will certainly enjoy it. It seems that Campbell plays a bit too much of his strengths with his entire project, but when you tune in and see what Bruce is doing he is disappointed. Moreover, there is no disrespect for the man; but he has never been the greatest choice actress. Despite being a lot of fun; the film is not big because it sometimes becomes too foolish; and there is a whole sub-block with a robot that I didn't like; but in general, a screaming brain man is a film that we unfortunately do not see too much today. The film is all-out, B-film; and it deserves it if nothing else.
