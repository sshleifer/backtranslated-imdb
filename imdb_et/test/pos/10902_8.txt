After reading this commentary on this movie and seeing it now, I understand how it felt about it. Decisions were made after common sense. When the movie came out, I had heard information about how it came about. The story was born of a real event. During the prize games, the actor, who thanked li'l people, gave an award to a former school teacher, unexpectedly leaving for a person. <br /> <br /> Of course, many people come out of the closet mostly. everyday. Each trip is different for each person. In real life, the outcome of any person is also different. And the willingness to accept who they are is most important in life for personal happiness. For those who surround them, joy and honest acceptance can make life much more perfect. In the film, the result of Howard's withdrawal is much more comical than real life. And the acceptance of the community showed others that Howard was himself and nothing else. <br /> <br /> In general, the performances were crazy. The memorable quotes and the use of music add to the stereotypes there, but they are taken with humor of tongue and cheek. It's a movie. Sit down, look open and laugh your head.
