In this colorful black comedy, Michelle Pfeiffer is a perfectly discouraged widowed widow. Matthew Modine plays a clumsy FBI agent who has fancy him. Dean Stockwell steals the show as a big hit and continues to destroy Pfeiffer; Mercedes Ruehl is dynamic as her jealous woman. It's all eighties, but it just adds fun. A nice little flick, though not for every taste.
