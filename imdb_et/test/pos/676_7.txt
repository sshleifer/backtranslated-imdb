We are in a small town, a homemade widow (East Lupino) hiring a caretaker (Robert Ryan). Soon he will regret because Ryan is growing insecure for hours, he seems to be a dangerous schizophrenia receiver and now he can't escape his house. <br /> <br /> Be careful, my beloved is the Mel Dinelli {The Spiral Staircase} story and "The Man". Quite a lot of one movie and two character piece, the film has two major central performances and offers up interesting take on mental illnesses. However, one should not be disappointed to think that this is a violent and nerve-breaking image because it is not. It is clear from the approach that Ryan's Howard Wilton is a dangerously disturbed man, but this is a different "dangerous" film. One that throws a second slant on psychosis and hence hates our dangerous protagonist. <br /> <br /> Ryan and Lupino are a great combination, they also made a great and much better, dangerous surface. the same year. So both actors are clearly happy together, highlighting a finely tuned character story based on one house, prison. Ryan is especially strong because his character's trembling in madness and out, some scenes are capable and occasionally frightening, and others are experiencing deep compassion. Harry Horner's direction is safe (he doesn't really have to do much more than let his actors do it) and George E. Diskant's cinematic art includes some smart and influential visual touch. With one touches Christmas tree baubles immensely memorable. Falling some places away from the middle-to-large time, my sweet enough to make it a recommendation for border fans and to easily follow Film-Noir. For Robert Ryan tho fans this is something important to watch, yes yes, and then some. 7/10
