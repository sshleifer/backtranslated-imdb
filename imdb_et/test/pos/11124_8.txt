Don't miss the picture that is getting older. Without hesitation, masterpiece. Not only script and music, but also choregraphy, pain, <br /> <br /> cut: everything contributes to perfect achievement. Now almost 25 years ago and still amazing maturity, art and <br /> <br /> sensitivity. Don't forget the DVD now. Transmission is perfect <br /> <br /> and the sound is restored. One great secret to this great job is: why did the makers not succeed after that flashing start?
