This is not a bad TV movie. Shtrafbat is short for Shtrafnoy batallion, which means punishing batallion. Such battles were created due to the growing demand for soldiers, as the Soviet Union made heavy sacrifices during the war. These battalions consisted of convicted and negligent soldiers who were given the opportunity to prove their names in battle. They were looked upon as pollution and were used much without regret or much honor during the military struggle. They were often sent to suicide battles and suffered extreme accidents. Those who refused to fight were executed by sight. Needless to say, their lives were sucked. <br /> <br /> There were very nice productions, especially Yuri Stepanov, who played Antipi, Alexander Bashirov, who played Stirah, and Roman Madyanov, who played Major Kharchenko. However, the series is not really addictive, partly because it is too long, it can be much shorter and more efficient. <br /> <br /> Although this is a war, Shtrafbat has very light violence and pretty much no gore. It is based solely on actors to make it work, and after all, it is in the TV series, so manufacturers did not want to intimidate viewers and sponsors. <br /> <br /> Shtrafba is investigated by the Soviet regime and explains why so many men chose to fight against the Nazis instead of joining them. Personally, I am a fascist rather than a communist, considering the facts presented in the film. One character explains that the Soviet people cleaned their farm and his family died of hunger. He was burned down by anger for his arrest for the destruction of the Kolkhoz property and he was punished by the punishment battalion. Antip recalled how his mother killed her youngest son to feed the rest of the family. Both men explained that they fought for their homeland, not for the Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> The Criminal Battalion had one navy (a naval infantry) who raped a girl who killed her companion in the process, threatened her second companion to keep her mouth shut for both trials, and then tried to fight. In addition, the girl committed suicide because of her shame. I imagine that if enough Marines looked at the film that they would pick up posters and riots on the streets, they would require boycotting or official apology from the producers. <br /> <br /> At least, I would recommend anyone with the slightest interest in the former Soviet Union or World War II. I don't think I'm wasting 500+ minutes of my life.
