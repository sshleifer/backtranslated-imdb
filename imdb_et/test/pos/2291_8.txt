I liked this movie, not because Tom Selleck was in it, but because it was a good story about baseball and he also had a half-dramatic view of some of the problems BASEBALL player had come to the end of his time in Majori. I also greatly enjoyed the cultural differences between American and Japanese baseball and the small facts about how games are played differently. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a good movie to watch on cable TV or rent in the cold winter at night and watch the "Dog Day" in the summer and know that spring training is just a few months away. A good movie for baseball fans and a good "DATE" movie? Trust me in that! * Wink *
