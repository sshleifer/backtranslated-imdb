Based on Colin Wilson's book "Space Vampires". This is (in my humble opinion) one of the best eighties of Sci-Fi Horror. The effects of the ILM remain with today's standards. The actors are mostly British and the British seem to give this film a greater reality. <br /> <br /> The film was criticized by critics and, unfortunately, they did not succeed on either side of the Atlantic. Tobe Hooper blamed the advertising work that was done before its release as its main reasons. But for some reason, it is still not a bad thing that it is an excellent film that has an excellent cast and well-paced plot. <br /> <br /> Don't review.
