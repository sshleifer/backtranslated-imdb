First of all, positive: a great job of depicting urban landscapes according to the mood of the film. Some pictures may be De Chirico paintings. Sophie Marceau, beautiful. <br /> <br /> Negatives: Stories are hard to believe. Unrealistic, one-dimensional characters preen and posture 100% of the time, as if they were in some way. It is not his earlier, much better films, Antonion or Wenders, whom we have all known and appreciated. Malkovich is too much luggage in this movie.
