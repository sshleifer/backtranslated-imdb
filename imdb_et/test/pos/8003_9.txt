Tim Burton, who lives behind the original Batman movie and Beetlejuice, brings the world to Batman's sequel, over one original. First of all, Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny De Vito are a great choice for Batman's enemies. Dark, deadly and sexy Catwoman works well to capture some story inside the story and the penguin works the same way the joker in the original worked. Sets are stunning and impeccable. There are so many dark roads in the city of Gotham that you would never know what was happening at one time or another. The only thing that gives it a bad name is its script, which from time to time seems to be out of date and then does not recover. Tim Burton's direction brings superhero films to a new area. Beats all the Superman movies and other Batman movies in miles. Although the new Batman bite is starting to be realized, it is missing, but Burton is a more original director than Nolan.
