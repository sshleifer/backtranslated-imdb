This is the latest feature film directed by Michelangelo Antonioni with the help of Wim Wenders and adapts to his short compilation "This Bowling Alley on the Tiber". Next to the clouds, there are 4 short stories that are familiar with his previous works, and summarizes the themes in vignettes woven through Wenders-directed scenes that include John Malkovich's director. But most of the stories seemed to be little or not at all deep enough to be accustomed to Antonion's film, while Malkovich's alleged depth of speech was an insecure speech that sounded clumsily and at times. <br /> <br /> Nonetheless, it seems that all four stories relate to occasional meetings and extremely fast romances that at first glance seemed more pleasing than perhaps due to lack of time (as they are still short stories) to allow a more multi-layered approach to to define and treat these signs as we know from a typical Antonion movie. And the obsessive approach here is that the characters are ejected to show the absence of a deeper connection that is sacrificed for immediate satisfaction of the meat. Maybe this is the thing that wants to bring about a more modern relationship? <br /> <br /> The first story that never exists in the affair of love speaks of the romance of Silvano (Kim Rossi Stuart) and Carmen (Ines Sastre), who meet when asked to hotel to get to know the hotel and later meet in the cafe. Just as Fate plays them when they meet, but participate and meet again much later, but like the games people play, it's almost like L'Avventura or La Notte, who has no communication, and expectations of a man. <br /> <br /> The director of John Malkovich will be in the middle of the next short time, showing some really brilliant views of the girl working in the shop played by Sophie Marceau. He is deeply disturbed and uncomfortable, but somehow he encouraged the courage to approach him. And what I thought to scare him, he tells him he murdered his father 12 times. But these two are in the middle of the bedroom with bedroom flash. <br /> <br /> The next short, don't look for me, is the longest party with Peter Weller, who plays a deceptive husband who must choose his lover (Chiara Caselli) or his wife, played Fanny Ardant. Perhaps the star that celebrated the more stars when Jean Reno stepped down to the house at the end, expanding to the small universe where it is short. But unfortunately, Reno's involvement in some smiles was because it goes into the improbable domain of laser-ray romantic tanglement. L'Eclisse also had a major element through the glass panel with a pair, while the introductory story of the soul story was quite interesting. If there is a negative subject here, this short wants to play, it's a double human. <br /> <br /> There was a small scene between this short and the next, combining our pair of La Notte, Marcello Mastroian, and Jeanne Moreau, where the former painted a landscape reminiscent of the Red Desert. Finally, we have the final shot of this body of dirt, Vincent Perez as a young man who goes after a girl (Irene Jacob) whom she just met and loved her to understand that this is too love. late. This is a fairly conversational piece, as well as the first story where characters are kept in the conversation when they visit the streets of the city, which reminds Richard Linklater before sunrise. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was managed in single pieces, they are never quite moderate, as the combined effort gave "an excuse" to unite them, exploring the possible stories of the film's director and looking for inspiration for his next film.
