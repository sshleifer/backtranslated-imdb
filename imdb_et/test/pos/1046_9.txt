I've discovered this movie accidentally and it was really a nice surprise. Christmas Classic, it is also one of the fine comedies of the 40s. The story is simple: Elisabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck) makes culinary columns for her life in a magazine. During Christmas, his boss, Alexander Yardley (Sydney Greenstreet), invites the Connecticut farm to invite the weakened seaman he writes. The only problem is that he doesn't have a farm and he can't eat. To escape the Jew, Elisabeth agrees to marry a prosperous friend (Reginald Gardiner, who owns a farm) and flies to Connecticut with her excellent chef, Uncle Felix. <br /> <br /> Peter Godfrey is in the big direction and is really wonderful: Stanwyck has never been such a sharp and romantic woman. Greenstreet, Gardiner and Sakall make fun and human supportive signs. The only weak spot is Dennis Morgan, a leading man. He starts well, but when the movie goes, it really becomes a cage. It almost seems like Elisabeht Lane comes to him with Gary Cooper or David Niven, both of whom would be more suitable for this part. Anyway, it's a cheerful Christmas movie with a refreshing score and I recommend it to anyone who wants to spend funny and sweet holidays ... in Connecticut.
