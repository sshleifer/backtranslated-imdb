I had been interested in this movie for a long time, especially after reading a few online reviews of the DVD edition; however, I continued to postpone this purchase due to the absence of excessive price tags and appropriate additions. When this year was printed out, I finally gave - but the entire order (which included several other highly desirable titles) lost transit! fortunately, the DVDs have been re-released at an affordable price - and I'm sure I was happy with it! Anyway, this is one strange movie and a real sleeping place: initially a confusing but striking hidden story that succeeds in defeating the atmosphere of small towns as well as the naturalness of unfortunate events. A small cast reacts perfectly to a subtle, absorbing and intelligent script: Strother Martin in particular makes it a leading dialogue for better than its subtle performance as a city doctor / witch leader leader; L.Q. Jones and Alvy Moore (both made by the movie!) Offer strong support as a nonsense sheriff and his comic aficionado assistant. <br /> <br /> The plot combines elements of various earlier films that deal with witchcraft and supernatural and not just obvious titles: the fact that the city is kept under a spell that cannot be identified first instantly reminds the misery of the same civic household as Luis. Bunueli's extremely surreal foreign debt ANGEL (1962); The "children in possession" angle was borrowed, perhaps WIN VILLAGE (1960); there have been many films - especially the recent vintage - showing the satanic rites of the witch-addict: DEAD BIRDS (1960) ART RIDES OUT (1968), but since the procedure is taking place today -day America (albeit in distant surroundings) and revolves toward elderly witches (searching "Renaissance"), the most memorable film is ROSEMARY'S BABY (1968). <br /> <br /> Hidden scenes (highlighted as much foggy on exterior surfaces, because the shady lighting of a quietly decorated house, with hellish events, is presented in a completely factual way to make them unpleasant and extremely effective - especially the opening order of a military tank crushing (!), damn doll rampage (a concept that has been fatal over the years, but here raises an indisputable refreshment), a surreal order of dreams (in the ice chamber where all the victims are kept because they cannot be buried!), a sequence in which witches attack the suspect Attached member who is a horse in the medieval knight (!) and long "black mass" finals (with witches accompanying the child) in red - except for the monochrome Martin, culminating in a ritual mass suicide! <br /> < The film also has guts to hide the "curtains", which is so refreshing to meet the headline in the Hollywood studio, in Columbia, that glow to go so completely against the grain (as I said, the film is rather weird - expanding also the editing) and score! It is also strange that such a stylish and cinematic - horror offer {sic} should come from a television manager who is most often associated with western and other family tickets! By the way, the same topic was dealt with almost at the same time as Christopher Lee / Peter Cushing 's co - operation NOW (1972, produced by Lee himself!) - a film I knew about 20 years ago when it was shown on local television and has been MIA since then. !! <br /> <br /> P.S. This review of Satan's BROTHERHOOD definitely includes a spoiler, but the summaries and works of art on the DVD cover all!
