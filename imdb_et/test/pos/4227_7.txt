This movie is an example of a certain comedy horror that is strictly adult but completely different from Troma movies (with which he shares certain qualities). Humor is tough and ready, but fast and furious. If the idea of ​​nervous dolls with evil forces and twisted minds does not make you bored with shrugging, get to the 6-seat beer and enjoy the best "Chucky" movie.
