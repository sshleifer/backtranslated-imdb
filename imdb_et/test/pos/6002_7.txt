It was a truly epic production that had all the elements needed in a fantasy film. Costume, music, cinema - all the artistic elements of this movie were absolutely beautiful and offered a rich experience. <br /> <br /> Ted Danson, the best known for his TV role "Cheers" and "becker", was a great Gulliver role. Time After Time (Cross Creek), Mary Steenburgen performed equally well in her wife's role. <br /> <br /> Other performances I really enjoyed were James Fox, Dr. Bates, Alfre Woodard as Queen of Brobdingn, and Peter O'Toole as Emperor of Lilliput. <br /> <br /> It would be an enjoyable children's film, but it would certainly be for adults with this deep social commentary.
