It was amazing. Participant of the Librarian and New York Libraries Union Vitali Foundation event on Thursday, October 18, I had the privilege of seeing the release of the new film The Kite Runner. The release of the film has been delayed because of the well-being of the children involved. I am grateful that the NYLA event was allowed to continue as planned. <br /> <br /> I felt the film was masterfully made. I thought it affected me as much as Stanley Kubrik's orange, though it's much less graphic - much less. There is no comparable fearsome, shocking violence and rape shown in the orange "Clockwork Orange" and the small amount of violence that the Kite Runner is actually showing; only the subject and the impact on the human psyche are comparable. (I've written more details about violence and rape and how it was dealt with on my MySpace blog.) My overall impression was that this movie was fantastic; one of the best movies I've seen. The image of the unknown art form and grace of an unknown art form took part in the image of Afghan boys flying their kites. The subject is intensely serious and the film carries the audience's emotions into this topic without many touching Hollywood, which has destroyed the other film. Although the overturning of the pomegranates was obviously symbolic (me). <br /> <br /> Finally, I have to mention the excellence of the sound track. The son of Rumi's poetry as the two main characters escaping the country during the Russian invasion - in terrifying conditions - really proved the power of their poems. I invite someone who watches to ignore the subtitles of this scene as much as possible and just listen to the beauty of the language. I don't even know in what language Amir quotes whether his usual Darian Persian dialect is the same as Rumi's original dialect. Also note the sound that has been heard every time the dragon is cut. I found this deep and distinctive sound, even though the librarians who came with me didn't even notice it. I can't help but wonder if kites actually make such sound when they are "cut", or when it gives a sense of kite flyer during the race.
