I love pop culture, but I was a bit afraid when I first heard about it. Then I saw the episode and I love it! I was a little upset when I found out that Christopher Eccelson wouldn't play the doctor anymore. He was probably the best. It fits the character so well. It's sad to see her. I really don't think the new man would pull out both the doctor and Eccelson. <br /> <br /> I think everyone can neglect the effect of cheeses in some places and beings, like the dagger. The story lines and characters can be more than offset it. I am looking forward to the second season and I will also look at the quality loss for some reason. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I think everyone should try to see one episode. I did, and I've loved it ever since. A well-written, well-cast and well-produced exhibition is worth a watch. Doctor Who is 10/10
