I wasn't sure about getting this movie from a DVD because I really have some black and white movies against people in the 21st century, but I finally got to buy it. I still do not understand why it was to be black and white, but it is the only negativity that I see about the film, and this is definitely an excellent example of the final rise of the Brazilian cinema. Not everyone can understand such a movie, but one who does it is quite useful. Unlike O Homem Que Copiava, this movie is pretty well suited to surrealism and is at least as good as other successful Brazilian films such as Bicho de sete cabe√ßas, Cidade De Deus, Brava Gente Brasileira, and so on. My only hope is that this pearl will not be offended or raped when Hollywood's new uprising is. It's amazing to see how these men spend zillions on dollars and still can't make a movie that's 1% as good as this low-budget flick. <br /> <br /> Bravo for the whole team! 10/10
