On March 17, 1974, Manhattan's Penn station is a dead man in the lavatory. Although he is well known, he cannot be identified because he scratched his passport personal data and his body did not ask the city for three days. It turned out to be the body many consider to be the greatest American architects of the twentieth century, Louis I. Kahn. He died at the age of 73 in India, where one of his biggest projects, a management institute in Ahmedabad, was completed. <br /> <br /> One of the most influential post-war American architects, Louis Kahn's architectural heritage, is the House of Parliament in Dhaka, Bangladesh, the Kimbell Museum of Art in Forth Worth, the Yale Art Gallery, the California Salk Institute, and a sort of mobile "music ship" for port concerts to give. in different cities around the world. <br /> <br /> Although the architect was celebrated, little was known about his private life. In addition to her husband, Esther and their daughter Sue Ann, Kahn lived with two mistresses, Harriet Pattison and Anne Tyng and their two children. All three families lived one mile from the outskirts of Philadelphia, but their paths never went through funerals. His son Nathaniel, the director of this film, was only 11 years old at that time and had only a few memories of his father's weekly visits to Nathaniel's mother Harriet Patterson in Philadelphia. Twenty-five years later, he goes on a trip to his father, visiting the Kahn building, talking to relatives and colleagues and visiting Louis Kahn's places of life. <br /> <br /> Most of the mobile confrontation is when Nathaniel asks her mother, Louis Kahn's landscape architect and mistresses why she was playing her second violin and never touched her. Tears cast off, but he has no regrets. "It was worth it." It's such an intense sad moment. He's obviously broken, being treated at his funeral he was forbidden to participate in, it is almost as if he had been leading a replacement life. It all looks strangely unrealistic. Another interview with Edward Bacon, Kahn's architectural non-goal, responsible for rebuilding his domestic Philadelphia in the fifties and sixties, suffers almost on the spot when he is reminded of Kahn's unpleasant architectural ideas. His son Nathaniel listens uncomfortably when very high Bacon shouts literally when Kahn's name appears. The last scene is reserved for Kahn's greatest creations, Capitol Dhaka, Bangladesh. It took 23 years, a big and extraordinary building, of which Bangladesh is very proud. It is one of the few national symbols that suffer the nation in this poverty. Some interviews with the locals brought tears in my eyes, especially when they discovered they were talking - God forbid - the architect of his son! <br /> <br /> The film is as much a personal journey as it is the perception of Kahn's great architectural heritage and it is above all about creating the film itself and more generally about the film. Perhaps Louis Kahn, as a father, attacked, but these shortcomings in his personal life make it a more interesting portrait for this extraordinary film. <br /> <br /> Obscura Camera 9/10
