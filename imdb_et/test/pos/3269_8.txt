The inspiration for this movie was the fact that American gangsters are well dressed, but the Aussies, if you can kill the boy as soon as you look at the blaster, you can dress as badly as you want and people will not criticize you <br /> <br /> Jimmy is a fighter , an illegitimate boxer, sometimes a striker and a local gangster boss Pando (ie Australia's notorious Kings Cross area, not a London cross fame as many British backpacks discover a hard way). <br /> <br /> Because of the feelings of love, he loses his job, loses a lot of money and must get it to Panda before Pando and his will kill him. <br /> <br /> Lots of dark humor, interesting activities, revelations Australia about human nature. It is at the heart of Australian nature and explores the nature of Australian criminals (compared to American and British countries). <br /> <br /> One problem is that all the elements of the story do not have enough content and depth, but it is a wide-ranging painting that covers many areas that have not been covered before, so it is useful as a general package. <br /> <br /> A team for "Chopper" and "Dirty Deeds" for your Aussie Crime Fest or "Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" and "Miller Crossing" for international crowds that do not match. <br /> <br /> By the way, Bryan Brown is a great actor who has just done a lot of really bad movies. Here's one of his great movies.
