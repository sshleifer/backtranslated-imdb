Dolelemite (1975) is a cult classic. Starring Rudy Ray Moore, who is wrong, while on the road. He has two enemies, no good Willie Green and a foolish mayor. Watch the Dolemite stroke, hit, poke and pimp your way across the screen. What is a man's name? DOLEMITE! <br /> <br /> An interesting film that paved the way for a generation of rappers and performers. To sell his own album albums, Rudy Ray Moore made a number of cheap films during the seventies. Self produced and marketed it to satisfy a certain audience. Some people call it blacksploitation, others call it the trash, I call it fun. Dolemite was followed by a half-a-time The Human Tornado and direct video return to Dolemite 25 years later. <br /> <br /> A highly recommended, confident cult class! <br /> <br /> Footnotes, if the film is properly matted in the video, would not see the boom mike. Dolemite was cut for R-rating.
