I loved this movie !! Jack Black and Kyle Gass have probably made one of the best comedies from Up in Smoke. This film has something for everyone: rock, drugs and Satan. What else could one want? I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to sit and forget all the woes in the world and have a good laugh. Even if the film does not work well in theaters, it will definitely become a cult classic. I recommend that someone who would see the movie take D against the first album, because a lot of jokes are only made more fun when you hear songs (for example, JB's obsession with Sasquatch and an epic fight against the devil.) The movie is still guaranteed to laugh even when you haven't heard your music, but the songs are so big that you can't pass them on.
