A couple of cowpokes will help the Mormon group to go through some tougher countries to go to a new settlement. This low-key west is unusual for Ford because it has no big letters. Johnson gets top-billing, but he's basically a supporting role, though he and Carey work together. Dru is given little more than to offer a love interest. The best result is Ford's favorite Bond, who plays the Mormon leader. In fact, this role helped him to paint the star in the western television "Wagon Train", ahead of his 57-year-old death. Talking about beautiful cinematography, Ford considered it one of his favorite films.
