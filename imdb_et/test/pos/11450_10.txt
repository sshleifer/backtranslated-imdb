I ignored this movie when I went to the movie before, but then I got curiosity and I decided to review it. I love it!!! The film begins with Judy and Jay, who run the Hull House, an abandoned tomb of Halloween. Then we'll see some more characters, Angela and Suzzanne (hosts), Frannie, Max, Rodger, Sal and Helen. Then they will, of course, at the party, and if they are really in the mood, they will decide on a session that awakens the demon. The demon has Angela and she starts her terrible killing. Will they survive the demons at night. <br /> <br /> The film was generally large. Gore was good, but the nudity of Linnea Quigley (from the ROTLD trash) again screws it. I've never been his fan and never.
