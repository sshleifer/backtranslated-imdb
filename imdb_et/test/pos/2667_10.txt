For all those who are confused by the length and tempo of this movie ("why does he show space shipbuilding, like 15 minutes?"), There is a word here that you might think: <br /> <br /> Beauty. <br /> <br /> Beauty is an underestimated concept. Of course, you often see nice photography in movies and so on. But when did you last see a movie that contains beauty for the sake of it? There is a strange belief among cinema people that everything that is not a plot or character must be removed. It's a frustrating machine bath. There is nothing wrong with creating a beautiful sequence that has nothing to do with a movie plot. The director can show the spacecraft for 15 minutes without any reason that they are beautiful and not illegal or evil. <br /> <br /> '2001' requires you to look differently than watching movies normally. It requires you to relax. This requires that you create strange and beautiful images without knowing that there is no complicated plot or detailed characterization. Don't make me wrong, plots and characters are good, but they're not all and everything. There are a variety of KINES movie and enjoy "2001" you need to tune your brain with different wavelengths and succumb to the pleasure of beauty, PURE beauty, unlimited banal conventions in everyday life movies. <br /> <br /> "All art is totally useless" - Oscar Wilde.
