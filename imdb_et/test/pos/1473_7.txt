It has to be said that this movie is definitely one of the best "most favorable" movies out there - I feel a little bit of a scam if I paid for it £ 15 but about £ 1.50. I felt like I got more than my money. <br /> <br /> The film can't really decide if it wants to be "Mad Max" or one of Clint Eastwood's "no name". Even the man of loony who "Mad Maxis" hangs with the bad guys is there. <br /> <br /> This "Blade Runner" guy also keeps a good bill, although he only appears at the beginning and at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Favorite Bit - Beating me on an oil refinery - if you look closely, you can see the distance that passes the distance as the two main characters knock out of the seven bells. <br /> <br /> Take several liquors, a few pizzas and sit back and enjoy what is ultimately light but fun.
