I really enjoyed this Minghella epic, I thought not as much as "English patient" (modern classic). The first 20 minutes or so you feel uncomfortable, but since Inman (Jude Law) starts his journey to Ava's (Nicole Kidman) love, the movie rises sharply and becomes a very memorable, thoughtful romantic drama. Apparently, the hatred of Kidman is now in fashion, but I do not agree at all and he does well here. I really think that the romance between Inman and Ada is weak in the script (they don't really have much time to develop relationships), but the law and Kidman give him everything and convince him. Ada's journey is the core of the film - she becomes a strong woman who can carry almost everything. First of all, Zellweger seems to be wrong with Ruby, but he grows on you and shines in many of his later scenes. The film has beautiful photography and design, but it will never let the pieces of the period prove. Especially Jack White has long hair and pale stone complexion that is completely uneven on the face. Cillian Murphy's fans enjoy seeing a gifted Irish actor early on and Natalie Portman proves she can act in the most striking order of the film. I'm sorry he's so inadequate in "The Second Boleyn Girl".
