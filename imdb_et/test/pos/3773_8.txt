So it's a little late, it's almost 30 years old. Amazingly enough, I have this on the BETA tape and it still plays well. When it came to a DVD, I pulled it to the heartbeat. <br /> <br /> Sniffer humor is not valued today, as it was then. It wasn't so damaging then. Similar to driving without airbags, seat belts and child seats. I remember my dad cried that he was laughing so hard. In the 90s I had collaborators who saw it, and I can break them up by getting to intercom and saying, "Iiiiiiivvvyyyyyyyyyyyyyy". <br /> <br /> Big lines, a great initial legend, and funny for me anyway, even three decades later!
