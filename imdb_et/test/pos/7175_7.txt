How important is a director? In this film, made in a political worrying time of the late 1960s, when the issues of social organization were the main conflicts, this question is asked by making a film that turns the camera away from action and only reveals the filmmaker William Greaves. This is an important job because it shows that no other film shows difficulty in blocking, organizing, and configuring the scene; it highlights the role of the team that most directors would honestly want to disappear completely, and that invisibility is to stop the supremacy; it also takes into account the role of performance and scripting and how they respond to reality and what to say how the director ultimately influences reality (if any). <br /> <br /> a documentary or pseudo-document or fictional narrative (whichever you prefer, through the interpretation of topics) is your brain in an educated, over-intellectual team, its guts in lost performers who try to understand the vague and unclear directions and its the heart of the director who stands as a desire to portray, represent, express without meaning how to do it or why he wants to do it. This is a film that repeatedly repeats banaals to see if they can become more than banal. This is a film that sometimes shows multiple shots at the same time, but leaves the audience to edit and also shows how distracting the different images are. <br /> <br /> This is an important job and something that everyone interested in the industry and film making process should follow and understand. Like many experimental films, there is no real mass-environment struggle - that's not for them. This is for the industry and its 60s, asking what to do with a group fishing environment that is still based on one voice and author. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
