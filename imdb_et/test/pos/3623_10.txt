I saw a movie at the end of the Ealing Film Festival in West London (England). Enjoy it enormously. Although the Crow & Chinese policeman does not appear and Dan Milligan becomes Dan Madigan (played by Sean Hughes (I)). The communication between Dan and the author (Writer / Director), published by Lord Richard Attenborough, plays very well. <br /> <br /> The rumor is that Lord Attenborough and Elliott Gould (Dr. Goldstein) appeared on the film's only pint of beer. <br /> <br /> Spike was shown in the movie before he died and it was very large on all accounts.
