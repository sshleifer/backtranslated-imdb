Distributor: GOODTIMES home video <br /> <br /> Plot: A beautiful high school student is celebrated with a film-filled arrest. Gail Osborne is new to the city. She makes friends, she has a boy and everything seems to be going to her. This is until she gets a bad and scary phone call while she is taking a baby. After more and more phone calls, he is raped. Throughout the film, he tries to find evidence that a person was raped by him. <br /> <br /> Audio / Video: This 1987 VHS edition of Goodtimes stinks. There are continuous lines below and below the screen. <br /> <br /> Attachments: No add-ons to Goodtimes home video. <br /> <br /> Final Thoughts: This TV film break has been made in 1978, so don't wait for many deaths (no). If you find this movie with Worldvision's home video logo, buy it. But the Goodtimes version is pretty messy. It may be a bit boring, but if you're patient, the end is pretty good.
