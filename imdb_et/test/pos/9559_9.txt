In a previous comment I mentioned how much I enjoyed this movie - the second time better. I am not moving on from this opinion. Strangely, I can't find anyone else who liked it. <br /> <br /> My mother saw it, but several friends told her "No way". My sister and her family saw it and half of the theater walked through. My wife's suggestion is that Australians see the character as just normal, everyday in the Americans, and that's why it's not funny. But hey, most Americans think all Australians are like Crocodile Dundee, so it's nice that the second leg has started.
