It's a great, pausing, murder-wise movie. Not only was the piece full of tension and intrigue, but you can see a couple of hours of wonderful Ryan Gosling, which you do not love! Sandra Bullock is also good in this movie - I've always been a fan of it (I just wish she hadn't decided to be "The Lake House", which was terrible, but that's another story). Obviously, because there are thousands of other murder / horror films, there are similarities between them, there is no need to start this movie because they have at least some similarities already made. Anyway, this is a great movie for those who really enjoy "scary" movies, it's a bit dark and twisted, but generally a great movie !!!
