The three-year-old children who were born at the same time as the sunshine begin to murder those who offend them. <br /> <br /> Though the killer boy's films were not an entirely new topic for children during this twisted 80s, murderers work well for this movie. The bloody birthday offers good chills and tension, but it can be a competent killer force with some strange qualities. It is located in a fine border between cheese and crap, but it remains an interesting plot. There are some strong scenes of murders, as well as good nudity to prove it as a firm guilt. <br /> <br /> Casting is a pretty good job. Young stars Elizabeth Hoy and K.C. Martel offers some threatening performances, while the rising star Julie Brown makes a striptease before a memorable murder scene. Veteran star Susan Strasberg does well for both the teacher and Jose Ferrer to have a cheeky look. <br /> <br /> Circumcision of this switching is not bad, although it is not flawless, but it is worth looking at genres. <br /> <br /> *** out ****
