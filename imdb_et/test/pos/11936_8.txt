Colombian terrorists hold hostage to US military school until their requirements are met. Pupils decide to fight. Can they do that? <br /> <br /> A stupid assumption, but the movie actually works. Children who fought were all up and coming when this film was released in 1991: Sean Astin (very cute); Wil Wheaton (looking unhappy); Keith Coogan; George Perez (symbolic Latino, who is very beautiful, very muscular and is mostly shown not in oblique underwear); T.E. Russell (symbolic black boy) and Shawn Phelan. None of them are very good actors (except Astin), but who cares? This is a pointless action film. The only other good performances are Denholm Elliott (who is the leader of the ball) and Louis Gossett Jr. As a Dean. . In other words --- FUN! <br /> <br /> The only complaint (and it's insignificant) - it's a little too long (there are three ends) and there are many random, bloody violence (the R-rating was well earned). However, I enjoyed it a lot.
