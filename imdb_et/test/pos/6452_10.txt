City Streets is an amazingly modern technically speaking film for a film made in 1931. Even those who could not be appalled were astonished by Gary Cooper's powerful magnetism, which raised the audience's attention. The plot is quite detailed and clear. Scenarios, interior design, are exceptional in every detail. All participants are above average. I think the director and his staff, including editing, sound, lighting, photography, would have been so brilliant. I couldn't find the mistake of realizing that the scenes on the journey (the dirty race) were the best with the big movie they got in 1931. All in all, I found this film a great and lively thanks to Gary Cooper's charisma.
