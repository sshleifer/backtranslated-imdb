the first time I saw this movie, I just thought, "What the hell?" 10-year-old boy who travels through odd places, meeting strange people, going after the game called MOTORAMA! Hell yes! I enjoyed this movie a lot! Jordan / Christopher-Michael is a great young actor! It's a shame that he stopped working. He is very good at interpreting his character at the Gus movie. Want more? <br /> <br /> OK, don't even try to understand the story, but why does this film need it? Just open your mind and let Gus go on this journey. <br /> <br /> "Motorama Gus, You Won Motorama"
