I loved this example. Such talent; and I'm so disappointed that it will be canceled after the start. I waited for this exhibition for the whole week. And so sorry for the people who hoped to be One. I would have loved to see who could have. It started simply and I do not think it should be canceled. I hope these young artists have been viewed by talent scientists and have the opportunity to achieve their goals. I voted and sat waiting to make it go; never knowing it was canceled. And I couldn't believe it was. I'm surprised that it had a low rating; because it was, in my opinion, one of the best realities on television.
