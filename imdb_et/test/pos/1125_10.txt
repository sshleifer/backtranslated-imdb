I'm so excited that Greece is back! This season seems really eventful. I am pleased that Casey is trying to talk seriously about school but is still involved with the corporation. He's really funny that he wants to go into politics and that he highlights his "powerful talent." I loved Calvin's new hairstyle! It makes her mature. They should also shave Cappy's head. All boys are hot, but Calvin is definitely the hottest! I can't wait to see more of him! I'm especially interested in what's going on between Calvin, Adam and Rusty! I also like Rebecca. She's really beautiful. I really think that Rebecca & Calvin should connect. go, Calvin! Join my team!
