I looked at it when it was first reviewed and then it disappeared from the British screen. It showed a different side of old Australia that we need to see more. The good side of the old arm and the young turkey. Then it was hard outside the realism fantastic. Unfortunately, it was skipped. This exhibition was a cold look at the old way of viewing Australia. Hard life and hard work. The young idealist has come across an old practical head. True Politics fights young people with new jobs. Adding modern political folk language. <br /> <br /> This exhibition was the first of the kind I found that did not attempt to work in Australia. This was a great example of a realistic <br /> <br /> documentary realistic show. Some good movies did a similar job at the same time. It would be nice to see that this type of TV is coming from Australia, because it has been lost for twenty years. all we have eaten is soap of different qualities.
