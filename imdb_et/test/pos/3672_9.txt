My partner and I had never heard of this movie, and decided to capture the title from the list of films on cables without knowing anything about it. When we opened and revealed the light, we wondered how bad it was? - Kathy Bates, Jonathan Pryce, Rupert Everett, Lynn Redgrave, Dan Akroyd and more. As the story unfolded, we became harder with our choice and the film was about to be ridiculous. It's not a "big" movie, but it's one of those rare movies that has such a great combination of memorable characters that "truth is alien to fiction" type surreal events that I couldn't but love it. I had no problem stopping my "infidelity" in some element of the hostile story, because the filmmakers' intentions are so warm when they manage to have fun with all the players. As others said in IMDb, this is a comfort film and I would not be surprised if it became a classic of culture.
