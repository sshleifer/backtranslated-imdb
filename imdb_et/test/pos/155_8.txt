In my opinion, the vampire "madness" has proved worthy of such a notorious categorization. Last year there were many sub-genres in many countries. I've reviewed a lot and I have some more discussions. Forgive my promise, but because I feel the trend as a phenomenon (what it is and randomly characterizes my favorite horror). I'm going out of North America and hopefully introduce you to movies you haven't seen at the moment. <br /> <br /> Many of the effects of Twilight are "boy" and "girl" vampire movies. I hate this sexist categorization, which results in the polarization of "generation" by fans of the entire generation. I think men have tended to hate Stephenie Meyer's work (and its offspring), because they feel a sense of deception that the archetype, which was always theirs, has now been released. Women may not have future "neutral" images because they grew up to fourfold. More directors are needed to create a vampire film, each sex can enjoy (unequally) when vampires start to survive and remain relevant. Cue: Thirst This Korean movie was starred by Park Chan-Wook of Oldboy. There are two ways to separate it. Whether it moves between gender expectations and is generally enjoyable, or it is a messy confusion that does not decide which target group it prefers and should therefore not be viewed. Don't let me convince you that the film has no tendencies. Its leader is the man whose fame is the story-driven action films. Her main character is a male and has a passive aggressive interest in her lover (later on). But his desire for a woman whom he has known both before and after mortal life has not been built and his attention is drawn back. This picture is inclined to a man, but it's not so one-sided that women can't enjoy it. The same cannot be said of Daybreakers or New Moon. <br /> <br /> The plot follows the novel by Emile Zola, called Thérèse Raquin, which I have not read. According to Wikipedia, the novel is something that develops between a husband and a man. She kills her husband during a fishing trip and starts her. Two of them are unable to have sex because they represent the body of a dead man between them. So they get crazy, but they care about the woman's sick mother. In a novel, they try to kill each other, discover each other's plans and commit suicide. Now, write this nearly 150-year-old French novel to modern South Korea and you have thirst. Chan-Wook doesn't decorate this story enough to see it. He often ignores many of his own ideas to follow his inspiration. I think the most memorable parts are when the narrative doesn't let your scare. Using her mother-in-law as a foil for their bad romance is just perfect. Look at it. <br /> <br /> Soon, an initially dedicated Christian who becomes a vampire after injuring his blood transfusion after having volunteered for a new drug. He will thus become a god he was once beaten. People scolded him and looked at him as a great healer. OKAY. It is really cool and could have provided an excellent basis for your relationship. However, this idea is given a little time for the screen when it becomes a realistic Christ who seeks to preserve his virtue, even though his lifestyle requires him to give up. Instead of facing confused people, he slips from hospital patients to a blood hospital. <br /> <br /> Let's continue with the Christian hint. A woman tricks a vampire man to kill her husband. Her excessive defensive mother suffers from a stroke and finally warns her daughter's girlfriend's family (fingerprints). The man kills him but raises him up. These two invite former friends and the woman starts to harass the people mercilessly. The man says enough enough and decides to drive to the beach and force him to wait for him to sunrise. They both die, but they accept their crimes (and theirs), but the film shows its evil more visibly. <br /> <br /> The woman's character is a caricature and her profession explains her behavior. She is a housewife with no education, while a man is a priest whose mortal life was restrictive. Vampirism increases their properties. He becomes a monster, as one would expect without knowing. He becomes a demigod of spirit. His life is how the atheists and their lives see how religious people look at those who have no divine intervention.
