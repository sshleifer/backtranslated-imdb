Terry and I think it is a classic all the time, with a rank that blesses this house with its late james and late diana coupland, but terry scott unfortunately misses even when he died in 1994. DVDs upto the press and I am looking forward to getting all 9, also it would be nice to see "happy after ever" published DVD <br /> <br /> June whitfield is still strong and terry scott always lives in my memory <br /> <br /> Terry Scott Rip Today is not much of a comedy that I think it will remain in the legend list and yes the middle class bit won't get on the nerve of some nations, but I don't mind, I think it would be great to see some of the celebrations of Terry scott's life
