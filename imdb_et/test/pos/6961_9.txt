If this film has one theme, it is that people are able to cope with the imagination. This family is poor, their father is working in the cemetery, and their mother works in double shift, and Peter is constantly being chosen for various reasons and is becoming increasingly disappointed that she is often misled by the girl. He has begun to approach the age of 10 or 11 where your perceptions are changing, and thinks your appearance will be relevant. The background to this story is the 1967 World Trade Fair and the Canadian Century. The biggest moments of the movie come through various fantasy lines where we can see how they cope. Look at relaxation and if you have ever had a childhood friend with whom you dreamed and for some reason lost, then you like this movie. Maybe the kids love this movie, but only adults appreciate it, including references to Bolsheviks and parents.
