I'm going to entertain movies. The first movie of this series, The DaVinci Code, was very entertaining. It had many turns to be very interested in me. Angels and demons are no different. If you liked the DaVinci code, you will undoubtedly enjoy this movie. Angels and demons have been made in exactly the same style as the previous movie, but the faster pace I liked. Ron Howard kept me glued to my seat two hours without boredom. <br /> <br /> What I really liked about this movie was that, while it is obviously fictitious, they leave enough real history that seems very plausible. If there is one thing I didn't like about this movie, it is that the plot itself is very unbelievable (does not want to give a spoiler). But hey, it's a movie. I was entertained by the whole thing and I was very pleased with what I saw.
