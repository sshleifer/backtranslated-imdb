This is undoubtedly one of Neil Simon's best films. It's full of great characters and a memorable dialogue. Johnathan Silverman makes a big version of Eugene's screen (played by Matthew Broderick on stage). It is the first of Simon's autobiographical trilogy, followed by the wonderful "Biloxi blues" and closes with the TV show "Broadway Bound". . If I had to say that the film has mistakes, maybe it is that the characters are sometimes spoken clearly in the dialogue, but that's fine because it's a great dialogue. Rent this little pearl, you're not sorry!
