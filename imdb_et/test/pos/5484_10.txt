I saw this movie for the first time last night. Wow! What a movie! This is the movie you want all the people in the world to see, because it's just so cool and so interesting. that people go cold. DON'T READ PLOT SUMMARY BEFORE seeing the movie! I'm just saying that Eastwood, Malkovich, Peterson and Jeff Maguire are top-notch. I want all the thrillers to be like that.
