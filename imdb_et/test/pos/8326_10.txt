When Jurassic Park came out for the first time, it was revolutionary in filming and special effects. For the first time, people went to the cold dinosaur film and were convinced that they were watching the real dinosaurs that lived. what the true beings could have been (T.Rex, Brachiosaurus, Triceratops, etc.), some were modified to fit with the film (Velociraptor, Dilophosaurus) and the film took place today on a tropical island where they were not in their natural habitat. Walking with the Dinosaurs shows us the real animals in their real habitats all these millions of years ago. The amount of details and scientific information used in this is high. Now we can look at such sights as the gloomy Triass Desert, the entire Diplodocus cattle, the birth of Icthyosaur, the MASSIVE sea monster, the pterosaur's eye view, the dinosaurs that bloom on the South Pole, the two Torosaurus lock numbers, T.Rex's roaring camera, and the influence of comets on their punishment. These dinosaurs are walking, running, eating, fighting, pushing, hunting and floating. At the same time, this series also shows other creatures they shared with the world, two episodes focusing on two different animals, flying Pterosaurs, and waves of marine reptiles. Locations and landscapes are remarkable and look particularly unique when the CG Dino is on the screen. And like CGI and animatronics, the CGI dinosaur movements look natural, the colors are vivid and bright, and team members have taken cautious steps to ensure that CG animals interact with their environment in some way with the actual being. by spraying in the water, brushing the bushes, pulling the dust and pouring the shadow on the ground. It is true that CG is not perfect in a few short cases where animals look too numerous, but the rest of the time seems breathtaking. The sting is in some cases bad, but it has moments where Cynodonts is in the first episode. Kenneth Branagh's narration is pretty good, giving us important information and drama at the same time. Of course, it is a real pleasure to see that the living dinosaurs do what they did all these years ago, and also to see some really cute moments with Cynodont (mammalian / reptile hybrid), Sauropodlets (baby Diplodocus) and T.Rex chicks (Yes, even T .Rex can be lovely) and then reminds us that nature can be brutal and even more. All this leads to the prehistoric nature masterpiece that allows you to see the true dinosaur and take away the soul. If you like nature, dinosaurs, informative learning, amazing visuals or just great viewing and entertainment, walking with dinosaurs is definitely for you. Just recommended.
