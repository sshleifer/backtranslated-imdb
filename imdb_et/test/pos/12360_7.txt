Victor Sjostrom, the grandfather of the Swedish cinema, led this tougher existentialist film of reconciliation, betrayal, death, forgiveness, guilt, redemption, and the darker moments of the human situation. He celebrates like David Holm, which is not a good nickname that responds to a friendly moment when he returns to his drunken ways. Unlike many silent movies during the period, the film has almost no scenes with excessive action. It seems to be annoying with his very familiar Dickensia narrative. Watching the movie in retrospect and compared to other times is a very bold and unique film. The target groups of this time were not open to such a topic, and the cinematic art is enormous, symbolic, and accompanied by double exposure and multi-layered setbacks. This is definitely a horrible and frightening film for young people. <br /> <br /> Watching a movie is easy to see, how later this film will affect Swedish master Ingmar Bergman. Most of the great Bergman themes are here in full screen. Of course, Sjostrom Bergman's masterpiece of alienation and loneliness was Wild Strawberries. This would be Sjostrom's final actor actor. Sjostrom was based on the novel by Swedish writer Selma Lagerlof. *** 4 stars.
