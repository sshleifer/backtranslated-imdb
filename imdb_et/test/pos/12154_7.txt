I would like to hear from the director, Barbet Schroeder, why she decided to do more for her first film and, more specifically, for her interest in hippies or rather for the form and death of this Euro-hippie paradise. The film is real enough to keep one interested, but in its own truth it is strange, biased. It's a given heroin (called "The Horse") is a terrible thing, rotting, a conclusion for many foolish addicts who see it as all-in-all, because it's basically the following: after that everything else stops it changes life and it's whether the constant ride is more of the same or of death. Something else is going on between the romance of New York and the German man, but it gets something different, better or worse (sometimes in the same scene). <br /> <br /> It's basically about two. young people, Estelle and Stefan, who meet in a town where Stefan has come from his home country. He also misleads, sort of, and maybe too friendly a big time pusher called Wolf. They get to a distant island somewhere close by and after a somewhat brutal grip on some of the "horses" found by Estelle, they also find a pillow as a seemingly distant house by the sea. Schroeder's comment on young people and sex and drugs is not too simplified, which makes the film much more intelligent and intelligent many years later. It is both direct and subtle, more of the characters, and then, of what it represents could be just a propagandist image of hippie exploitation in another case. Perhaps most pleasantly, and that is probably the case, Schroeder, using inspiration from Bergman's summer in Monika, is using a long queue similar to Monika: two children in the inevitable connection, some good are definitely not so good, against (too?) Ideally fired landscapes <br /> > On the one hand, I should mention that there are problems, some are really big. The performances are not very convincing; some scenes strike some force or show that the actors are in good relationship with each other, but Klaus Grumberg predicts himself even if he is German by nature (in this case I would have preferred Klaus Kinsky to make it crazy but deep enough for the subject) like Farmer himself. And in the scenario, there are gaps in nausea that keep it as deep as it really thinks. On the other hand, there are two great things for this: Nestor Almendros, the great operator (i.e. the heavenly days) is DP and this is a big boost for the first time director like Schroeder. Almost every picture can be seen with a fantastic purpose or art, whether it be a sea or a sun rock or something as simple as the natural lighting of the room. <br /> <br /> The second thing is Pink Floyd, probably the main reason I and many others have heard about the movie (years before I really knew who Schroeder had seen the "More" soundtrack when I looked at Pink Floyd's albums ). It is a very good music all the time, sometimes a desperate variety that gives them the dignity they deserve. It is also a bit annoying, even if it is a movie about free love and a lot of drugs, and sometimes both. I'm not going to find it as far as Meddle or Animals, not the Dark Side, but it also helps to highlight another notch, especially when at least waiting for it, or swimming in low tones or buildings and buildings like Stefan or other streets . It is almost a better atmosphere when the film itself deserves it, but Generally, More deserves to be still in sight, but strong, as less ambitious, but more important in Zabriskie Point.
