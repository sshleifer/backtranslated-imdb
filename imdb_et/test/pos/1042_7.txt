I have always liked Barbara Stanwyck, who was perhaps the hardest-working actor in the 30's and 40's, although few of her film roles are memorable. Today he is most remembered for "The Big Valley". Stanwyck worked so much that he was durable; it seems to accept the most important role and use it best to make the film a success, so the directors loved him and many of the regular images received credibility through their presence. <br /> <br /> And so it was "Christmas in Connecticut" is a very common effort that the plot's strength draws and is not even Christmas. But it has Stanwyck and Dennis Morgan, as well as some of the highest figures, including Sydney Greenstreet and S.K. So, there are twisted and funny moments in the plot, which undoubtedly seemed more real in 1945 than today. First of all, the plot concerns a journal writer (Stanwyck), who reads magazines that it is a domestic goddess, married child and living in a farm in Connecticut, but who is really single, lives in New York and knows nothing about cooking or home cooking. Can anyone get such fraud even then? Probably even the owner of the magazine (Greenstreet) is deceived, though one might think that he would have seen fraud for a long time, but the story goes on and Stanwyck, Greenstreet, a sailor who recently lived on his sunken ship (Morgan) and seaman. Stanwyck Restaurant Friend (SZSakall) finds that spending time in Connecticut on Christmas is at Stanwycki's nervous boy (Reginald Gardiner). You can imagine all the possibilities for this, because it deceives you. Gardiner wants Stanwyck to marry him to stay under the rouse, but wonder how he can stand at him. Morgan and Stanwyck fall against each other, but he should be involved and he should be married. Regardless of the fact that they start with what seems to be a belief, the cheek of the face of the dance is stumbling and stealing a horse-drawn carriage. Meanwhile, the incredibly naive character of Greenstree, who has seen Stanwycki and Morgan together, but still does not, sees one of the neighbors borrowed as a part of the fraud, and calls the police to report the kidnapping. Stanwyck and Morgan are arrested for stealing the stem and the hoax starts to relax. <br /> <br /> Then the movie is funny, like ridiculous or absurd, not funny ha, ha and it usually ends up like the screw comedies. A good boy gets a girl and will probably live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> I watch this movie every year at Christmas to enjoy these character actors in their story, reflecting how it was in 1945 and the long-lasting charm of Barbara Stanwyck. Thank you for the goodness that was set for Christmas or as 95 percent of Stanwyck's films that would have been forgotten for a long time and we could not see it again every year.
