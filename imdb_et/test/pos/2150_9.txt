This harsh visible little picture was played at the Mods & Rockers 2007 festival. It's a wonderful and loving look at Harry Nilsson, using many famous faces sitting for interviews, rarely seeing television shows and rear views of Nilsson at work. "Son Of Dracula" has even a couple of pictures. This film is one of the best voices, the smartest songwriter and the more fun of folk music, with a respectable respect. This is a crime that the name of this man is not as well-known as some of his songs written and / or performed. His friends talk about this talented stack of incredibly funny stories when they are subconsciously keen to destroy themselves. As a bonus, you can even get Eric Idle, who is writing this song on Nilsson's final album at the time of the closing credit. It's funny, it's sad. It is not generally released. If this picture plays wherever you live, look at it!
