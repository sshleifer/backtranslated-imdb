This movie was great and I waited for a long time. When it finally came out, I was very happy and waited from 10 out of 10. It was great and lived to my potential. The performances were great for adults and most children. The only bad force was by Milo himself. There was one problem I encountered with this (and similar) film. All the characters I wanted to live were killed. In general, I give this film an excellent 9. Maybe we should choose better people who would kill next time, ok?
