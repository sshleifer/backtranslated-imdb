This film has been my favorite and is related to my Christmas holidays for two reasons: (1) grew up in the 1960s, everything was between space-related advertising and television programs, and even Santa Claus found himself on space ships at that time; and (2) I saw this movie at Christmas shops when I was ten years old, and it brought back my favorite TV shows when I was still younger ("Supercar", Fireball XL5 "and" Stingray ""). it is a movie for personal reasons, it is biased. It means that the film's long-term student is mainly a movie for Gerry Anderson fans (and Barry Gray; oh, this gorgeous score!) Considering that the casual film reviewer is pushed from the vision of the past out (dig those wild cars, commercial planes, clothes, etc.) and the so-called "plot wrecking", which causes some wilting, but when you can look after "2001: Space Odyssey" desire to make the "distant" story of a fancy movie and enjoy the imagination effect, you will enjoy this legacy of the era when a person had just walked on the moon and people were still looking for stars in hope and hope in the future, not looking down on the actual 21st century banal trap udes.
