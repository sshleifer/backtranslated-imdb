Images control this movie. The characters, though interesting, eventually take the seat back. The first scene I remember is a framed black-and-white shot, which then opens to full screen and color. Water bubbling gives a small coffin that covers the surface. The film's theme here is that death can be received and brought into the living world. <br /> <br /> Water as the ultimate consciousness, as a tool of God, is accustomed to forcing people to get in their "house" order (Court Day). The dead must be taken into account and raised to the right. Anything that is unresolved or unresolved is washed away. The past has not been detained, buried in the memory that was. <br /> <br /> This movie has been compared to O, the brother you are, and the risk of water and its use as a cleaning agent is similar to this movie. In this film, it is different that the advent of water is aware, and so again, what is to be done here and now. <br /> <br /> I agree that some scenes resemble David Lynch's work. Take, for example, a dinner with a deep voice in the segment and an androgynous waitress. The same kind of surreal feeling arises from the setup and the odd character, as is the case with the Reverse Speaker on the Fire Starter scene. The difference is that Lynch attacks us with an image to express psychological processes of a restless nature, while this film seems to be a surreal element to create a moral message. Black suits don't get anything they want - they have to be patient and accept what is available.
