I found this movie in one of my old videos, after "Godzilla vs Sea Monster" (which should give you an idea of ​​this tone) and I didn't see it for a while so I decided to watch it. I didn't remember much about Rainbow Brite except when I liked the cartoon and it was cute. Most people know this way. You probably do it. <br /> <br /> When the movie started, I wondered if it was right! It didn't fit the Rainbow Brite form when I remembered her. But it turns out he's hitting the ass! This must be a strange animated movie EVER! I can't believe these characters were so popular (the series isn't very different), being so bizzare. As soon as I watched this movie again, it became one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> I really don't want to give too much. Just know that when you see a movie in a video store, rent it out and watch it. No questions asked. You get out of it. Especially outrageous princess. And a robot horse. And hypnotized sprites. <br /> <br /> If you can't tell, this is an 80's comic that is really an undiscovered "head" movie! Have fun!
