Abbott and Costello duo live in this time-class version. "Jack and Beanstalk", there's everything to see, music, magic and comedy rolled into one. Costello play plays Jack after he listens to a young boy repeatedly speaking. We know Jack was a poor boy who sells his cow "Dolly" for 5 magical beans. Well, he's raising these 5 beans and they were really magic. He climbs into the sky, sees a great castle there and sings a song he felt he would come into contact with a giant (Buddy Baer). Not only him, he danced with a woman who was also a giant. She danced with Jack's elbows during the dance. It was funny! You have a gambler who knows how to put the giant easily. Goose who puts the golden eggs. And my favorite, five Jack giants will be released. He gets an ax and began to split the beanstick. Another funny thing is where the ax started to work, and the last celebration is when people dance around a gig in which the giant fell. Lots of fun and fun for the whole family. Highly recommended! 5 Stars!
