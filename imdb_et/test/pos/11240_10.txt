There are too many people on this table who are obviously in conflict with the fine spirit of this series. <br /> <br /> This show is great because it is a fun parody yourself. Boys who have self-proclaimed plaques get a fair chance to convince us of their ability to seduce until they "hit" to reveal the absence of their complete "game" on national television? It's completely fun and the guys who are actually qualified are extremely convincing to watch because they spend effortlessly on awful women who often have these trendy nightclubs! <br /> <br /> It stands for a unique charisma, if it is deserved, and if it is deserved, they will take away misleading shower bags. In both cases, it is always entertaining, because unlike other introductions, it perfectly shows the authenticity and excitement of the "pickup". I recommend this exhibition to anyone with a sense of humor.
