After 2001 I spent a lot of sleepless nights. Not only because of the psychological horror (2001 is a masterpiece), but also because it led me (restless soul) to the clarity of how I look at the universe. It changed my way of thinking very thoroughly. And after reading the novel (Arthur C. Clarke), I discovered myself once again inspired (writer like me) at the level of imagination. <br /> <br /> The Odyssey of Space is not something that can just go and see. ‚ÄùOne must be ready for it or cannot understand it. In fact, I don't think it can be understood at all, at least not all at once. It is a philosophical journey to infinity and beyond, the masterpiece of this genre and another 32 years after the technically impressive power to the powerful music music that includes Richard Strauss 'spracht Zarathustra and Johann Strauss' Blue Danube. <br /> <br /> Take all the time you want, but finally you have to watch this movie. If it can bring some kind of understanding and understanding to a fighting artist like me, it can definitely do it for you. <br /> <br /> Or maybe I'm just crazy crazy ...
