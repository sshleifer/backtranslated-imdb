I can never figure out if it has ever been produced by the densest soap opera or Soapiest art film. It is not important that John Seale's cinematography is absolutely delightful. Ondaatje's novel is not reduced, but a movie at once. In the event of a mistake, it is in the original novel, not in Anthony Minghella's beautiful film. Anyone with problems of that length will certainly not have read the book and probably cannot read it. I don't like repeating repetitive adjectives, but scary serves this purpose. <br /> <br /> Players stand out. But this is the Australian feeling of light and shadow that ultimately wins. Like some antipodians, Seale uses the light that Van Rijn would have used to shade. Such excellent cinematography could be crying.
