My companions were surprised that this film was a documentary. It was so funny, it seemed scripted, but it gives the indie movie life a disturbing picture of real life. We felt we wanted to buy Coven and wanted to meet Mark and Mike. As a college student, this film gave us the necessary glimpse of real life.
