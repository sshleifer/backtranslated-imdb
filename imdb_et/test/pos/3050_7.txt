A bad land baron keeps a group of water cattle breeders to try their properties for a dollar penny. Will be Singin 'Sandy Saunders (John Wayne), who saves the day for Gabby Hayes and his daughter when she is a hidden villain's newest weapon. <br /> <br /> The first of the sixteen Wayne films made for Lone Star / Monogram Pictures that try to sing him with a cowboy, only with a lip-synched voice. The title card has "Singin 'Sandy" in its character, which believes it was supposed to be the first in the series! <br /> <br /> Yes, it is ridiculous, but also fun to see Wayne sings songs and fires, especially when she makes a little fun before she fires with Earl Dwire. <br /> <br /> Ride Of Destiny has a rare evil role in Al Fuzzy St.. John, who clowns as much as bad guys when he played a heroic sidekick, driving with Buster Crabbe and Lash LaRue.
