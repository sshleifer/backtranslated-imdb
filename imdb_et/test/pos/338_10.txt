Kannathil Muthamittal's director led the first Indian film I had seen on "Dil Se", which took me four months to buy more than 122 Hindi DVDs. I can say that I understood the whole attraction, I was somewhat confused about why the movie stops for "music videos". It was a great movie, I didn't know what to do, and the female <br /> <br /> vocal was a little bit for my western ears, but somehow I found AR Rahmen's hypnotic score. I bought the soundtrack the next day and then next week Lagan, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and K3G, with the exception of some other Korean films except "Ichi <br /> <br /> killer", can't bother me to look at much more. Someone who has been watching Hong Kong's strict diet for the past 30 years, Horror <br /> <br /> and Action / Science fiction movies. <br /> <br /> But I should go back to Kannathil Muthamittal, one of Mani Ratman's last efforts and I laughed, wept, got totally mad, scared and above all I didn't feel manipulated. Action was great, photography was beautiful, I think you could stop the movie at any time and notice that any framing would be worth painting. The music fits the movie perfectly and after <br /> <br /> I wanted to watch the credit roll again ... so I did. <br /> <br /> It would be stupid to discuss the plot for fear that you may not be happy to see events and characters develop. That's a great movie! I stood and praised my home theater when it was over! <br /> <br /> My wife is now watching and I can't wait for my reaction, I can't wait for it to be less than mine.
