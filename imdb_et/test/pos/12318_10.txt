John Huston finished his remarkable career with one of the most perfect and sensitive films I've ever seen. For his goodbye, he decided to adapt James Joyce's beautiful story "The Dead" and made not only one of the most loyal literary-film adjustments, but also designed a film that more than 20 years later goes a long way when I watched this film a couple of years ago as a university student , I looked at the awe of the screen, marveling at all aspects of the film: acting, screen writing, direction, costumes, settings, music, cinematography. Thinking now, I still can't get something to criticize. Huston just knew a good story. <br /> <br /> Lots of credits should go to Tony Huston. She knew better than being confused with a text that was not only perfect but already sufficiently visual for cinema. Father and son let the story breathe and rejoice between long, exciting conversations between characters and meaningful silence. <br /> <br /> Donal McCann also deserves his performance Gabriel Conroy. I had never seen her before in the movies or seen her later, but she gave me one of the most moving productions I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Overall, The Dead is a good movie experience, a legendary director who has never been great.
