George Barry is a genius. "Death Bed: Nourishing Bed" is a prototype of much of the "slipstream" fiction and camp's surrealism, which is now so chic. Truly innovative, maverick and just perfect. Hyper-strange operation, gently spooky atmosphere. I recommend reading Stephen Thrower's "Nightmare USA" (there is a chapter dedicated to Barry and "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats"). Available from FAB Press. In a related note, "Death Bed: Bed That Eats" and "Beyond Dream's Door" are the perfect double bill. What's more, it is a trick and tired - and ultimately foolishly ironic - to criticize the "low-cost" or "technically incorrect." The aesthetics of the B-film is the charm of these films. No amount of CGI can duplicate the cumulative effect of "Death Bed: Bed See Eats", which is an improved palate in front of the viewer.
