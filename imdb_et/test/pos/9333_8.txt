Although I'm not a fan of Michael Jackson, I like some of his earlier songs and some of Jackson 5. "Thriller" is one of his great songs and comes from the most sold album with the same title. As for the video, it's fantastic, one of Michael's best, but also very eccentric and weird. <br /> <br /> Behind this video is a story, but it is so complicated that even it cannot be fully understood. It's crazy. The most recent things are Jackson's turning into a werewolf, his evil red eyes at the end (like a werewolf) and these dead people are dancing. <br /> <br /> The video is very dark, exciting, nice and original. There are great landscapes and settings. The music itself is full of life and rhythm that is characteristic of the good old pop of the 80s. <br /> <br /> I love Vincent Price's fool art. She makes a great story with her special and unique voice, and her evil laughter is awesome at the end! My favorite videos of "King of Pop" are "Billie Jean" and "Don't Stop" to get enough "(both are his best songs).
