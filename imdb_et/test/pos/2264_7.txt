An old car looking for the lost past of the Jonathan family. <br /> <br /> "Everything is Enlightened" is a strange movie about a strange young man who has a duty to collect souvenirs from his family, so as not to forget the things that his grandfather's past is trying to understand, how his life could be if he the grandfather would not have moved to the US.
