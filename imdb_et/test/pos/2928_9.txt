La Petit Tourette is a pretty funny South Park episode. Cartman is in the toy shop one day and here is a child who swears out loud but can't get in trouble. His mother tells everyone that the child has a "tournament syndrome". the fact that he can swear without getting in trouble that he tells everyone he has a tournament syndrome. Kyle, however, thinks Cartman is lying and trying to tell people, but they think he is insensitive and put into a "Type place." At the end of the Cartman tournament I will land on talks, but he thinks he can't manage his tournaments and start saying embarrassing things in the meantime.
