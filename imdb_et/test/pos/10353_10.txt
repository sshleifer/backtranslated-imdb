Totally nasty and cheap bad humor. I love it!!! This is the most disgusting and utterly terrible film, except for Nicolas Read, who plays the comic shine. But as he might, I laughed so many times and I have to present it to the filmmakers, it was in no way terrible or ordinary. Robbery, fighting, zombies vomiting victims of rape. What other film is it? Not strange, but with a pizza, a bong and a six pack of beer you got it if you have a cast iron belly and a juvenile sense of humor like me.
