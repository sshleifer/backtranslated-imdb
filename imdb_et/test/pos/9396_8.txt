I'm not sure what to add, what has not been said in another fine and quite funny commentary, but I have to try. <br /> <br /> So you know the plot: there is a bed in the possession of a demon that "swallows" and selectively breaks down the body of this orange soda-filled body (or any). We have a man in some scenes that are looking uncomfortable like Robert Smith of The Cure, hanging in the wall, commenting on the move, and we have different victims who just can't resist the comfort of this mysterious bed. <br /> <br /> This is not an ordinary bed. No sirree Bob! Not only does it eat people, it cleans itself, pulls the covers back and even makes itself. Who doesn't want such a bed? It can even use its page as a primitive "lasso" to win the escaped victims (especially if they take half the length of the movie to try and escape). <br /> <br /> Our "main" story (if you call it) is about the three girls who go to this far-away household (??). I don't remember exactly, but it doesn't really matter because there are many things that violate the convention that you just have to give and accept. The dialogue in the film is like no other; The characters speak of telepathy with each other because their mouth never seems to be moving and is a constant echo. One of our girls believes he doesn't like the rest of the "gang", and tells us all his feelings on this issue through the echo speech, but we don't care about it; character formation was thrown in the window for a long time before this movie, why start right now? There are scenes when the bed is laughing, snoring, splitting, and doing a lot of other noise we expect when we decide not to respond to our cast noise. This and telepathy make the issue of colic very complicated ... but it's OK .... it's a bed of death: the bed that eats, and it breaks all logic so well. This makes lush dreamy quality of this most bizarre movie when you buy (hehe buy ... did I say "buy"?) This DVD, make sure to check out the introduction director. He explains that filming this "flick" began in 1972, did not wrap up until 1977, he bought it for a couple of years without luck and then for 26 years until 2003. \ t It was alleged that someone else's printout was in another country and he did it from the beginning, and it was quite random, not the least on the notice board that our director found evidence that people would know and complain! despite his little-known film. From there he decided to kick and release. I'm glad he did. If you have heard so much about the title of this movie, you have to see it. I buy one and I proclaim my gospel around the world ... starting with this commentary
