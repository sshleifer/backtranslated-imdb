When I first saw it on the tape, I thought it was about ten years after it was released that it was one of the best James Bond films. But after seeing it again at the turn of the century, I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> I think it's just a little overpriced just because the critics were so happy that Sean Connery ended his 12-year break from playing Bond so they didn't dare to criticize the film. I think my disappointment was the end. After a two-hour investment in the film, you expect a less-hacking, more satisfying ending. And it may be nitpicking, but I was disappointed if I didn't see the usual roles in supporting roles like Miss Moneypenny, Q, Felix Leiter, etc. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, there were many unique activities, especially early and two villains were interesting. I thought Klaus Maria Brandauer was more interesting with the two because she was so low-key and saw a "nice guy next door." He wasn't your usual Bond frog. <br /> <br /> It was a lot of "skin" for a PG movie, especially in the starring of Kim Basinger, never an actor hiding his figure. The language was very tame, but most Bond movies are pretty good in this department. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a "fair" bond and nothing else. Just because Connery is in it does not mean that it is automatically good. Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan have proven that they could play this role well.
