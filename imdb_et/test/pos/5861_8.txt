"Numbers of Numbers" refers to Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitti as two insurgency schools who are pleased with the perfect murder to overcome their broken self-esteem. Sandra Bullock plays a heroic occult when discovering her plans Det. Cassie Mayweather. It is not close to the mystery of the traditional fingerprint murder, because the film expresses our heart murder (Gosling and Pitt). Instead, the film focuses on the goals of its killings and if they have what it takes to make a perfect murder. <br /> <br /> The title itself is rightly chosen for a number of reasons, mainly the most vocal of the title "Numbers". The corner that focuses on the causes of terrible killings, although haunted by this chilling dialogue (especially in the case of calling boys), does not fully fulfill the origins of their origins, leading to the killing of their killing. The characters are riveting, you have a good looking rich child Richard (Ryan Gosling) and smart but socially uncomfortable Justin (Michael Pitt). At school, they pretend to despise each other and even share a pleasant classmate with Lisa (Agnes Bruckner), but staying out of school are allies and collaborate in a ritual where murder is a release. <br /> <br /> Surely it seems that the story about boys seems exciting, but it is put into the background for more everyday Det. Mayweather (Bullock), who assumes murder, was discriminated against (hence Gosling's arrogant appearance) and inexplicable qualities, but succeeds in achieving it correctly. At first, the audience can despise Cassie's character because he is very strong and not very supportive. He shows dominance and control over his younger partner, Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin). Even if he tries to think of him, he knows he is a battle he certainly won't win. <br /> <br /> The reason for this tyrant's behavior is that Cassie was a sad victim of a crime who has left him with a permanent mental scar. In this side there is not much in this film because it does not offer something riveting to the basic piece (boys murder). It also offers some development to Bullock's character in the film, but it is only half-work and not very perfect. I would have liked to have had a story for the grieving students. The resources were in front of them for a perfect criminal foil, the boys' creative schemes to manipulate the police with their fake evidence and just lie in the jail to expel a possible life sentence. /> Despite the impact points and the pointless end of the "real killer", "sporting murders with numbers" is a great performance. Sandra Bullock was convincing as a tough verbal madman who was trying to make his inner pain more positive. Ben Chaplin shows his strength as a young detective who strives to understand his partner and to fight off his random tyrannical floors. But the stealer of the scene is the damn duo of Michael Piti and Ryan Gosling because they keep you glued to your seat, waiting for what they are going to do next. The boys' chemistry resembles Matt Damon-Jude's "The Talented Mr. Ripley".
