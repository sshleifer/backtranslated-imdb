I'm a Christian and I thought this movie was pretty good! :) Although the actor was not a caliber of the Academy Award, I thought it was good, given that this film was limited in its function at the time of making this film. <br /> <br /> The gospel message and the transforming power of Jesus Christ were perfectly explained. The message that the director tried to overcome (what is important, not how characters dress!) Definitely went through. A good topic was also the involvement of key characters in illegal racing competitions (cool muscle cars, btw). I think this film will definitely reach many young people. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie, it's a great witness! :)
