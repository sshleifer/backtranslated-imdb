If you haven't heard of this movie, it will be followed by two Sudanese refugees from an African refugee camp in America, where they will convince themselves that they will find success and wealth. Life is harder than expected in the countries, and this movie strikes a beautiful disappointment that seemed to go right. Life is captured so many moments it seems written because they are so perfect. Whether it is work, school or at a time when two boys, Peter and Santino, are very honest with the filmmakers and make very thoughtful comments about the lives of the countries. This is one of the only documentaries I remember that when it ended, I wanted it to continue for another two hours. Finding this movie can be difficult because it didn't get a big deal, but check your local "art house" or an independent theater and let it go (a side note if you read it when it is definitely worth renting under the video). Rating: 28/40
