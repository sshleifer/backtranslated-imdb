This movie captures the scenes that open you and never let you go. You look indulgently when you look at Janos Szaby's excitement of coming to America. She is a pleasant companion. You can't help her even if her zeal is replaced by bitterness, like her treasures. You know that in his situations, you would be forced to make the same choices to survive. This film comments on the worship of society and all things superficially, and it is more true in the culture of the 21st century. Janos himself becomes the victim of this philosophy when he speaks to his blind girlfriend, "you are young and beautiful, if you could see, you would have a world." And like many modern gangster films, if he threatens safety, he makes a strong revenge. His innocence, however, is not completely abolished because he demands the same high price, knowing he deserves his destiny. <br /> <br /> Peter Lorre is in a great shape in this star. Only a handful of actors could convincingly achieve the innocence of blinded-to-blind offenders of this character for sixty-nine minutes. Lorre is supported by all the cast elements that make it a real ensemble image and not just a one-star vehicle. With a little less preaching dialogue, this movie would be 10. Recommended.
