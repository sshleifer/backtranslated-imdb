Caution, My Lovely is an experimental studio film from the early fifties, led by a man, Harry Horner, who is better known for his design. Robert Ryan plays a handyman hired by East Lupino to do household chores. The problem is that he is a psychopathic murderer and he doesn't know it. Miss Lupino is an empathetic soul and tries to make little use of Ryan. He is not a man whose compassion could help or heal. So we have two interesting situations that essentially mean well, but one of them can't do well because there's something wrong with him. He carries out periodic interruptions during which he makes acts of violence that he later forgets. Basically, Ryan has an impact on the Lupino hunter and his prey or in some other sense sadist. The audience will soon discover that Ryan is a crazy killer, but it takes Lupine much longer. So we have to live with this knowledge when we look at the poor Miss Lupino to try everything in her power to "win" Ryan so things work, work, get a life. But dealing with things is not a Ryan makeup because it is not capable of becoming a normal but the most open form, and as soon as it opens, it confirms paranoia itself. As a mental illness study, the film is not too impressive. What is supreme is to show the effect of the great mental illness in combination with dangerous psychopathology and its effect on the normal person. In this regard, the film is realistic and compassionate, although it is hopelessly logical that we know that Lupino cannot improve Ryan, but we want him. The result is that if someone wants to, this movie can be very emotionally involved, if it can be said to be out of its melodramatic structure. <br /> <br /> Horner gradually shows us the layout of the Lupino House, a forbidden gothic monstrosity that never feels home. Check out the staircase, kitchen and pantry; and we know what windows Miss Lupino can escape and what she can't.
