Crack House (1989) was one of the few films in the 80s that belongs to this genre. What should be an anti-drug film that is nothing but white exploitation in misery. But there's nothing wrong with that. Even the anti-drugs message from one of the show's "turncoat" stars in the video presentation, <br /> <br /> The film is followed by two young lovers in high school. One of them is a tough guy and the other is his girlfriend. One of them sends out a mutual friend, while the other is given a trip to the slam and later given the opportunity to return to his former friends. Jim Brown appears in "Mister Big", he is a bad guy who still can beat someone and is a very sadistic guy who likes to hit his lockers and crowd out those who try to defy his word. Luke from the general hospital also makes a guest spot. <br /> <br /> If you like slipping hard, this movie is for you. Unfortunately, Hollywood doesn't do them anymore and if they do, it is neither exploitative nor interesting. <br /> <br /> Recommended for sliding fans.
