The relationships between the main characters I thought were very realistic. How these two parts are credible. It doesn't have the whole "oh yes" that most Hollywood films have. Not too much to mention how they hit the trapeze sexy, beautiful and painful side. I'm a trapeze student and I love that they showed how hard the body, hands and yes these fabric burns are brutal! Certainly, both the film and the art that has been done must be treated. I love it! I'm happy with how the movie ended, but I definitely wanted to see more. Be sure to stay out through the credit for a special treat hehe. Great scene!
