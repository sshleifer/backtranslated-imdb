Spunky journalist Holly Hunter produces research news for a large news network. She is a maverick on a motorcycle, dazzlingly good in her work and a romantic relationship with little time. Enter William Hurt and Albert Brooks, two men who love him. <br /> <br /> Brooks is an old-school journalist who worships Holly because she represents everything from a good press. Both believe that the media exists to test the gods, educate the public, and fight for the truth. Children of the sixties embody the hippie values. They are the defenders of the public. Knights who fight bravely with a pencil and a camera. <br /> <br /> William Hurt, on the other hand, is much more complicated. Originally uncomfortable, cumbersome, and in itself depreciating, he is gradually revealing a sexy and manipulative high achiever who can step on the business ladder. Unlike Holly and Brooks, he symbolizes modern media values: news such as speculation, press entertainment, news anchor as celebrity, truth as editing desk. We want to despise him and his blip-time junk food journalism, but we just can't manage it quite well. He plays the game with his rules. Do we condemn the lack of moral backbone? Do we condemn the game? Is there a game if its rules are not being followed? How have these rules evolved? <br /> <br /> This is not Lumet and Chayefsky's "Network", so the film won't hurt these questions or raise them. The content that keeps things at a light comedy level ends with the Hurricane Promotion to the London Division and Brooks has been launched into a small community network. Holly, who both men have rejected, will be between them. The last bastion of media integrity, this dirty reporter remembers to him, mourns the disappearance of Brooks and warns himself as the guardian of the future William Hurt. <br /> <br /> This is a lovely ending, but compared to the network "The film seems to be positive. Chayefsky's vision is where global media, despite its universality, provides less meaningful information. It provides a world where globalization is homogeneous cultures, information has become a corporation and a handful of media monopolies control all international news, a world where truth belongs to shareholder meetings and economic interests. A world where viewer ratings determine content and opinion polls dictate top stories. <br /> <br /> Maybe "Broadcast News", which lasts for the glory of journalism, ends up with such a bittersweet, he knows what the future holds.Has been produced in 1987, living for at least ten years. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, things are even worse in the digital age. a very small number of massive businesses dominate the social landscape. sialism, a barrier between creative / editorial and commercial, but collapse. Today everyone can start their own blog or website, but these are grassroots issues. As the individual communicates (due to technological development - e-mail, internet, electricity, air mail, etc.), the size of the human world also increases. He must present his voice so far and louder to fight this sad white noise, a constant verbal static that is a global community. First, you need powerful people and people who want to be in power, both private and public. Secondly, you need informed opinions on all the important issues of the day. In a democratic society, the media system as a whole should produce such a culture. Unfortunately, the structure that currently exists in the global system functions directly against the needs of democratic journalism and democratic society. <br /> <br /> 8/10 ?? It's a light stuff, but a funny script, some funny moments, and Jack Nicholson's short forefront, will raise most of the other press-related movies. Interestingly, unlike most media films, it never gets into satire and instead plays things as a straight triangle of love. <br /> <br /> One worth seeing.
