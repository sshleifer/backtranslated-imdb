Anti-war music "Hair" is my first cult film. I don't know how many times I have seen this movie in cinemas and VHS, or how many times I have heard the sound of the CD, and now this masterpiece has finally been released on DVD in Brazil. br /> <br /> The pacifist and the story are still amazing, an anthem of freedom, friendship and freedom of choice, and represent the generation's resistance to the stupidity of war. I do not know what happened to this magnificent generation of culture in the 70s and their dreams, because the present world is probably worse than in the 70s. I do not remember who won the Oscar in 1979, but Treat Williams and John Savage deserved at least the display of their candidates. Beverly D'Angelo is extremely proud of her hypocritical teenage role as a hypocrite. I've seen "hair" probably more than twelve times and my eyes noticed while Berger walks on the plane to sing "It's me, it's me, it's me" and I'm gonna bury my tomb in the cemetery. I believe that this is one of the most beautiful, sad and touching conclusions of cinema history. My wife, my daughter and my son love this movie; therefore I can guarantee that "hair" is timeless and recommended for every audience. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Hair"
