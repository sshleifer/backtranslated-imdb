As a child, I was never in a situation where I could introduce Dr Who, and although I would have heard of the series, I never understood exactly what it was. Then I was hesitant to sit down to look at the ninth doctor and his antics that he was told that he was like Arthur Dent (Hitchhiker's Galaxy Guide), but it was cooler. I can't believe what I'm really missing, why didn't anyone talk about it before? My entire childhood was without doctrine; I'm a huge fan of most sci-fi and fantasy adventures. Honestly, I enjoyed it thoroughly and look forward to all future episodes. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that at first I wasn't so sure Billie Piper would be the best actor, but I'm happy to say that she did well, thought and added a very realistic touch to the series. I really think it was one of my favorite aspects; a contradiction between the scenes of the great alien conflict, which is in contrast to the reviving normality of the South London Soviet living environment. I am always interested in cases where people's ideas about the world are seriously challenged and how people can take the situation and change their minds to suit their daily lives. I also loved Christopher Eccleston. I haven't seen many of his films and I've never seen another actor dr. Who'd, but I thought that his doctor's presentation was great, extremely pleasant and still dark enough to marvel at you. I find that many other characters with their own character history tend to be slightly two-dimensional; they have all the right emotions and activities, but they always look a bit low. On the other hand, this doctor earned his loyalty with his stratified personality. I agree with some other comments that special effects, aliens and so-called. For a larger budget, it could have been somewhat more effective. but then it doesn't talk about special effects (though they do) about what I've read and heard from long-time Dr Who fans; it is the spirit of all things that really counts. And I don't think they did a bad job with what they had. I liked all the foreigners, but my favorite was to be Dalek; if i ever knew something dr. From Who before watching the series, it was that there were things that looked like reversed bins on wheels. Before watching, I was quite skeptical about the pepperpots threatening human dignity, but some of them were quite scary! Of course I loved it. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a good show. I look forward to future episodes. The doctor has a new fan.
