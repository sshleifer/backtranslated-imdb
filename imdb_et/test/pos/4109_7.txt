A huge amount of this remake was collected, which, unfortunately, was a great flaw, despite the great soundtrack. I can't say it was entertainment, not insomnia. Nonetheless, I enjoyed this movie - it gave away after one afternoon. A good look for those looking for an ideal life, though fantasy. Wait for pleasant moments, a few excitement and sometimes laugh.
