I find it hard to believe that it can happen at all. We don't know if Justin and Richard were in trouble in the past or committed crimes. The film seems to have been out of trouble and out of it. So the first crime they do is murder? Just playing and talking to the police? How do they get a girl and say you are? It also seems that Richard suffers little or no woman, and women do not see the struggle. Hmmm. It is really hard to believe this whole concept. That said, let's go ahead. I found myself really angry with these points and I would have been with my firearms with police tactical ammunition and see what they fit with their plastic. For Cassie, who was the victim of Carl Hudson, it's a terrible time to try and survive. The memory that Carl has captured 17 times leaves him emotionally confused. Sandra is doing a great job. He made me believe he was one angry policeman. As for solving the crime, I thought it was great. This movie was left on my seat. Loved the action of everyone except Sam. He didn't have to go and go. One thing that this film does not need was a scene of love or I should say a rape scene.
