Jean-Pierre Melville's Le Cercle Rouge follows the lives of two criminals: Vogel (Gian Maria Volontè), a murderer who slips to the police when he is transferred from one city to another by train; and Corey (Allain Delon), a thief just released from prison. Fate decides to join these two men to draw a prominent throw. The background is Matei (André Bourvil), Detective Vogel escapes, involuntarily in his quest and sometimes ruthless in his methods. Next to the film, the viewer will meet other small but exciting characters, the best of which is Jansen (Yves Montand), a disgraced ex-policeman and a great flagship. <br /> <br /> Melville has such a unique style t you have to watch many of her movies. Le Samourai, Un Flic and Le Cercle Rouge are clearly made of the same fabric: symmetrical angles; long shots; silence; coats and caps and cigars; quotes at the beginning; amazing heists, fatalism; amazing and terrifying criminal life. Everything that's great about Melvill is up here. <br /> <br /> And his shortcomings didn't bother me so much this time: the illogical, puzzled behavior and confusing storytelling of his characters, which harmed my enjoyment, his other movies are almost invisible here. Since Le Cercle Rouge preceded Un Flic, it does not mean he got better with time; maybe I am used to it and come up with a mindset where it no longer disturbs me. <br /> <br /> Melville made unique criminal films. As old as possible, they show more ingenuity, realism and grace than modern techno-thrillers, where cool thieves use computer systems and James Bond-iquire gadgets to pull impossible crimes. Melville's criminals are not cool: they are lonely, socially uncomfortable and probably know they aren't much more than hesitant planning. They are unwanted in the society, live at night, always step ahead of the police in the game they know they will eventually lose. There is nothing romantic about them. <br /> <br /> For this type of film, it is surprising that police officers are not complete idiots. Matei is smart, insidious, patient and even compassionate. He is not an unlikely villain or cliché; he is just an old man who does his job and does it right. He knows when to use force and when to use the brain. Many movies could learn from him. <br /> <br /> This is an underground, unromantic style that makes Melville movies so joyful and puts him on a special pedestal as one of the cinema's great criminal masters.
