This movie was all boring. It deals with reality. For people who think this film was boring, open your eyes to the real problems of our society. Our children die. The consequences of alcohol and drug abuse must not be ignored. I work as a chemical addiction consultant in a repair facility and I deal with these problems every day. People of all ages and all walks of life are affected by the consequences of alcohol and drug abuse. It destroys families, hurts people and leads to serious brain damage, all kinds of health problems and death. Everything is avoidable. This movie must be shown in every high school in the world. If someone owns this movie and wants to sell it or sell it to me, send me an email at: Ottenbreit2@netzero.net
