I personally have horror films placed in hospitals and asylums, so I had a good feeling about this "Don't look in the basement," though its reputation is doubtful. It turned out I was right! It is a great trashy entertainment with a few effective strokes and pleasantly absurd characters. Of course, you need to look beyond the values ​​of poor production and the totally illogical plot, but if you manage to do this (and if you are a fan of this type of horror, this is important quality), you must be rewarded with an outrageous "video-nasty" in which the main elements are blood and madness. Young and cute sister Charlotte arrives at a distant sanitary home where she should start her new job. He discovers that the doctor who hired him was killed by the patient and the responsible physician-captain appears reluctant to accept the new arrival. Life inside health is quite peculiar, where patients run freely and all doors are unlocked. After a series of bizarre events, Charlotte discovers the terrible secrets that the institution hides ... Opening for 10 minutes (pre-credit) is a big climax, and so is a completely hidden climax. All in the meantime is a surprise or a tension, but you are patiently waiting because you feel the final is fun. Asylum seekers are textbooks, but I still love them. Some of my favorites include a former judge (who is still speaking only legally), a suspicious army — Sargeant and a mad scary old lady. "Don't look in the basement" is a very small relaxing fun, especially recommended for 70s trash bins, sick puppies and other bouncers. Redeemers have taken over the shelter, yes!
