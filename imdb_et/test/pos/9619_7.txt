Having recently seen Grindhouse, I was browsing the Video in the United States looking for some movies that might have played in downtown areas in the 70s in the real lighthouse theaters. Hong Kong Friction Five fingers of death seemed like this picture. Classical sound effects and quick jumps seemed a bit annoying, but after a while I was both a story and a character I didn't care about. The parts of the music ball heard like the "Ironside" TV show, which was later used in Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill films. Some of the scenes associated with the hero's betting seemed on the border of the parody, but they were so short that the film was not destroyed. The most exciting parts include the tournament and some segments of retaliation afterwards. Noteworthy for kung fu fans!
