This film reminded me of living dramas of the 1950s, not like the recent "Failsafe", which seemed to be a stunt rather than something else, but a TRUE moral drama that is as interesting as thought-provoking. Anne Heche is more than plausible because an army officer who communicates with his commander, played by Sam Shepard, and Eric Stoltz are wonderful when his lawyer protects him against a military establishment. I found myself waiting for them to start, if only because they look so good together. This film is obviously based on a real story and it is a relief to ask you to think about the real problems of change. <br /> <br /> Director: Christopher Menaul, who also made Ayn Rand (Stolz) passion and Prime-suspected series, is a panic and style movie that is well worth it.
