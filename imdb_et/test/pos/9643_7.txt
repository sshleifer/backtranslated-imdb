When I write these comments, I watch the DVD of this movie that I just got through the mail merchant, and I find it very good, strong in character, credible situations and well-staged activities <br /> <br /> It has been good 45 years, maybe 50 years since I saw HELL BELOW, but one scene that made me feel very deep was the scene of Sterling Holloway's death, which many other commentators have mentioned here. I have not yet reached this scene in this scene, but I can confirm what other comments have said: If you see in the movie Sterling Holloway's death scene, you will never forget it. Judging by how strong a film has been held so far, I hope this scene will live up to its memory - undoubtedly one of the greatest death scenes in film history. The film deserves to be seen only for that moment, but even without it, it would be a first-rate early submarine.
