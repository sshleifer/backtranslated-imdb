this is a great movie I've been watching because I was 6 years old with my sister. this is the type of film that u can watch over and over again, and still laugh, smile and cry every time he starts to get bored, like other movies. it is a film that lives forever with generations of generations. I love it :) if my case is 1-10, I would rate it 9.9 times each time. <br /> <br /> This is a movie about the relationship between girls (baby) and her first boyfriend (Johnny) in the family, changes in baby and Johnny worldviews in their relationships. br /> <br /> DIRTY DANCING MONITORING IS OUT OF THE TIME OF THE TIME. thank you, however, only for a brief comment.
