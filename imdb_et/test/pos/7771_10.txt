I watched Love Jones over thirty times. This is one of the rare films that depict the love story of people who are African-Americans. The dialogue was realistically written and presented honestly. It was so nice to see a movie where the story focused on young professional African Americans. This is a virtually untapped market. Love Jones was also visually appealing. Lorenz Tate and Nia Long's chemistry bring memories of past and present love. The feeling of the film is jazz and blues, and also brings the sensuality of the hot creamy hot chocolate to Kahlua and Butterscotch. If you hadn't thought, I loved it!
