Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) begins to hide this story by helping to poach the famous physicist "Dr. Franz Tobel" (William Post) from Switzeralnad and under the watchful eye of Nazis who want their bombs. Allies will probably want it, and Sherlock will help. Dr Tobel has invented a tool that greatly contributes to the accuracy of aerial bombardment. <br /> <br /> Holmes and dr. Tobel would safely return to Baker Street, but the scientist would rather be alone, for some mysterious reason, even though he had promised to help English rather than the Germans. He remains with this promise, but there are some despair for Holmes and English. <br /> <br /> This is an entertaining movie where our famous detective uses only one, but three different disguises. She needs all the help she gets when she goes against her archive, Professor Moriarity. One complaint: if Moriarity was this evil, she would have dragged Holmes without eyelashes instead of giving her holes to escape. It is also quite sad, as usual, when Dr. Watson (Nigel Bruce) has a few times to save his superior from certain death. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some credibility issues in this story, but if you can hold your brain a few times, it's a fun movie to watch ... and it looks nice thanks to the great recovery work done on this DVD. This makes the old print alive with some great visual images, especially at night. <br /> <br /> Another note: who made English subtitles here misinterpreted or at least one and a half words. This is a very sloppy job and not the first time I saw it to watch the whole line on a restored DVD.
