This is one of those rare films that are familiar with the introduction of the usual Hollywood momentum. This is indeed a skateboarder because we are watching the impact of a fake 500 euro note on many people. One asks "what if" all the time, but it is definitely the butterfly effect that is recorded on the film. That means you're laughing, crying and lips. I loved it every minute! And thank SBS for showing Australia's true entertainment movies, even struggling to read subtitles. In my opinion, the only downside is that I do not have to book a frozen country holiday - they all seem to be too depressed - to have such cold weather. Either way, look at it - it's worth every second.
