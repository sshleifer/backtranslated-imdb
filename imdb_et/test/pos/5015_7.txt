This film worked well and kept my interest in the film's main character. Stu Unger lived an extraordinary life. Imagine if Stu was alive today! This film represents a picture of what Stu Unger's life would have known. It was interesting to see how the connected was growing. I would have liked to see Stu's party, his play and his relationship with Bob Stupak in more detail. All in all, this film is well done, well-functioning, and the story touched on many aspects of life that were filled with many events that were bigger than life. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth renting.
