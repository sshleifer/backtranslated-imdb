A very good political thriller with regard to the consequences of terrorism and the use of political torture in order to achieve its goals in rinsing terrorists. </p> /> <br /> This is one of Meryl Streep's best years. He plays a cold, computational and insidious CIA leader who promises to go ahead with these things. He is George Bush-Dick Cheney's school on the war on terrorism. If his part had expanded, Miss Streep would certainly have won an Oscar award. <br /> <br /> Jake Gyllenhaal is our hero. CIA agent who really doesn't get what's going on. <br /> <br /> We have a terrorist who really has a heart and it costs him a life in this well-directed, little-paced movie. br /> Alan Arkin appears briefly at the Senator. Mr. Arkin seems to be better with age.
