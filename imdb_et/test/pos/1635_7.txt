Tom Hanks returns with Dan Brown's symbol, Robert Langdon, in his first adventure, Angels & Demons, which Hollywood decided to make after the Da Vinci code, given their more controversial subject that hit the raw nerve in his own faith. The Catholic Church was under the arms of the first film, but apparently unaware of it. And it's hard to see why, given that Ron Howard had decided to make a solid look, a great tourist video from Rome and the Vatican City, would probably increase the number of visitors, given the many beautiful scenes on the ground. St. Peter's Square and the Basilica used as a scaled model. <br /> <br /> So I think most of the budget goes into sets, so the ensemble's cast must be reduced accordingly. Ayelet Zurer tried to get into the female gap left by Audrey Tautou, but given that Tautou's feature had much more involvement in the film, Zurer's scientist Vittorial was much less than she was just waiting in the wings to exchange some of the batteries in a canister filled with anti-matter. In the book, he naturally feeds Langdon to talk about his great knowledge between the Vatican, the Illuminati, and the two, but here he is not interested in love or his intellectual equal. <br /> <br /> Ewan McGregor, on the other hand, sees every scene he has, like Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, who takes care of the Pope's office temporarily while other outstanding cardinals are in the Sistine Chapel to choose a new Pope. And he's playing Patrick with this eye, enough nuances to let you know that there is more to the eye. There are no surprises here for novel readers, but McGregor's presentation is one of the highlights of the film, as Hanks plays well, Tom Hanks. <br /> <br /> The book itself is richly rich in content, as always, and had much more plot points on science and religion, and rich information that Dan Brown explored and combined in interesting fictional work. Reading the book a few years ago, I thought that if it were to be filmed, it would be easy to expire and take more action. Unfortunately, what this Ron Howard movie did was a pace that did not allow for a temporary breath. Unlike the first movie, where the characters were sitting in a "discussion time" with a cup of tea, it changed so fast, it's like reading the book again, the page after skipping the page just to get <br /> <br /> Catholic reviewers have called angels and the demons are harmless, because I think it didn't talk about many contradictions, unlike the Da Vinci code that hit the raw nerve. faith. And, if anything, this film was a great video of tourism advertising with a nice presentation of many of the famous tourist labels that would attract many to visit the world. Of course, certain areas, such as the Catacombs of St. Peter's Basilica and the Vatican Archives, are beyond the borders, but walk along the path of lighting, which is now almost free. <br /> <br /> Nothing new for those who have read a book, except to see that it is alive, but for those who don't, this movie can just force you to pick Dan Brown's novel, to read a little more about the importance of landmarks and characters such as Galileo, Michelangelo, and Bernini, who are intricately bound to the plot, but much left. Satisfied with pop-corn entertainment, leaving you with something remarkable.
