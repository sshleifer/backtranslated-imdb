Love Jones is one of the best films I've experienced. <br /> <br /> The main thing that tells me is that it is very well targeted. I've been looking at this movie as a whole - watching movies more than once, some things are scarred by you - the direction and writing of the movie is stylish, clean and skillful! I love the direction. The scene where Larenz Tate and Nia Long ride a motorcycle over the North of Chicago at night is amazing. The director of this film DESERVED awards for his excellent work. <br /> <br /> Love Jones is a stylish and sexy movie. This highlights the fact that we can be loving people who have mistakes who love to live, learn, and just be a leap. We are our natural selves. <br /> <br /> The poem is great, but the story, the dialogue and the scenes will make this movie really. <br /> <br /> This film deserves visibility. It's a great movie for lovers and friends to sit and watch, or hopeless romantic (like me) to sit and enjoy alone on Friday or Saturday night. Every day of the week, where peace, loneliness and little entertainment are needed, I love Jones for what I recommend.
