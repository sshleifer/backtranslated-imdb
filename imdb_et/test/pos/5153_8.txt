You, Life (2007) <br /> <br /> Mordant. I've never written this word before, but it comes to mind. Let me look at it. Well, it's part of it - corrosive, but also funny. So funny, so corrosive. This is a solid film, so with dry dry dry odor and inconvenient humor it is impossible to enjoy it at any level. Filmed with a very free style, often with a static camera and a truly balanced, stable composition, such as theater theaters, we can see a brief entry. <br /> <br /> It seems normal - it's not. Normal life has shown that it is clumsy, ironic, delightful, coy and frustrating. And impossible. We, the living, must live and, as we are alive, we can also take notice. Something like that. I think it was Ebert who said you were laughing and not knowing why. Exactly. And somewhere in the promo material it was said that it was a cross between Bergman and Monty Python, and what they mean is Ingmar Berman's famous Swedish films with a dry, silent and trying appearance, but it has zany, somehow touching the elements of British comedians. I'd definitely say at least half an hour of it. My part is that I thought I was gone by then - the rest will continue in a collection of similar small sketches and moments, and they will gradually evolve, but there is no large plot of land to track or climb the usual type. Later, there are some great moments, even attention to a thunderstorm that takes us well from everyday human activity. Filming is fantastic in its classic control, almost like Gregory Crewdson's series of scenes (and indeed the photographer's crossing). And acting, with all your very ordinary, non-glamorous people, is right. An amazing, beautiful and bizarre experience.
