H.G. Cluozot had trouble working in France after having made "Le Corbeau" in 1943, produced by a German company and later as a French-language propaganda. The fan of Clouzot's work, Louis Jouvet, invited him to lead the thriller "Quai des Orfevres", where he played an unclear police inspector investigating the murder that happened at the Paris Music Hall. Without one another's knowledge, seductive cabaret singer Jenny Lamoure (Suzy Delair) and her jealous piano character, Maurice, who is in love with her (Bertrand Blier, father of Bertrand Blier), tries to cover (without knowing each other) what they believe is their involvement in the murder ? Enters a permanent police officer (Louis Jouvet) who has decided to discover the truth. Jouvet stole the movie with virtually cynical and sentimental performance. "His character, his eagle profile and his unique way of speaking made him unforgettable." "Quai des Orfevres", witty and atmospheric monitoring of human weaknesses was H.G. A good comeback for Cluozot, the French Hitchcock.
