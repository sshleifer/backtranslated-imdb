The film is partly a thriller and partly a public announcement of events from the perspectives of politicians, terrorists and, of course, victims. This intelligent drama training provides information on contamination and surviving chaos, but in the meantime, looking back at crisis management has encouraged viewers to trust carers and intimidate the attackers. The film that was originally delivered to the BBC may raise doubts about formal preparation. The performances are right, underestimated, but never terrible. Flick is just the beginning, a provocative start that leads to more discussion, but I think it can work, giving the right excitement and causing the audience to justify and ask questions.
