Looking back at Jim Henson's works years after his death, it's like looking at another time. Because unlike most of the so-called creative types that are trying to sell children today or even worse cynically, Jim never seemed to forget what the child was. And if there has ever been a moment when he proved it, the maze was set aside, this is the 1979 Muppet film. Filmed as an allegorical story of how Henson started to work on children's television, and who reached a half-hour show on his television, "Muppet Movie" comes up with everything that is more progressive, understandable: says children who did not meet the expected norm in the 1980s. And when we enjoy the fruits of this era where we are gagged and bound to talk about something that no one can offend, here is an open distinction or diversity that represents a large part of the Muppet Show. I have said this in other comments, but I have to say it here. The day of Jim Henson's death day was a great light. <br /> <br /> The Muppet movie begins with its cast sitting to see what's coming in the next eighty minutes. In short, the exact punches we introduce to both the minor and the minor. And when the right story starts, we'll give the boy a great song to bring us to the moment. Rainbow Connection painted both a beautiful and a sad picture of what Muppet was, especially Kermit. These were not just a bunch of fun dogs who had the only personality to combine the show. They were living things that were based on all of us, just writing as much as we used to. Since each cup was introduced to us, we saw another part of our reflection and, of course, the audience's children react differently to each character. So everyone was a favorite. When Animal appeared behind the drum set and tried to eat the zymba, I knew I had found one. Nowadays I am more of a Swedish chef fan, but hey. <br /> <br /> Adding to these characters, there was a musical number that further developed their motivation and personality. Do you imagine that? shared the knowledge of Dr. Teeth and his band and Henson's creative soul. But for me the Gonzo number was the most appropriate song, asking what he was and where he came from. Many of us spent our lives watching the stars, and like Gonzo, saying that we know we're going back there. Of course, all the songs were so deadly serious. Fozzy and Kermit share the number after deciding to combine their talent (or lack of it) and track the path. If there was a need for evidence that today's "musicians" have lost the ability to use the pop structure to create something to listen to, that would be the number. Never before and never would the dynamics and music of the cast group complement each other completely. With doll artists and voice artists who played so well on their game, there was a lot of human casting. <br /> <br /> What makes it even more amazing is that the human element also survived the transaction. Cameos is literally filming, all from Steve Martin to Telly Savala to provide his support. Even Richard Pryor, the last person to be seen in a movie about Muppet, looks like a fun moment. Mel Brooks' firefighter is as disturbing to me as an adult when I was a little boy, but I suspect it is because Henson knew why I was bothering it now. However, the great acting force is Charles Durning, who embodies Doc Hopperin, both Henson and his audience, who decided to resist. At every intersection, Hopper can either give Kermit the opportunity to sell and betray its kind. Or maybe offering stops is the right word if Hopper's attempts to meet Kermit's requirements become more and more powerful and violent. The whole thing is one big metaphor about how every artist is broken by the world. <br /> <br /> Of course, the animal also reminds us that precisely because our friends are not sweet and soft, they are not a friend. In fact, it turns out that Animal is the best friend Kermit currently has. And this has been the main message of any good exhibition or film that Henson has ever been involved in. The fact that other simple linguistic or cosmetic differences cause or disrupt can literally be the worst mistake. There can be no doubt that in today's world, where a purple moor can tell his son that they are not good, if they do not have fifteen seasons of good feelings and that child protection organizations are not able to study them seriously, the Henson Being Workshop could never be off the ground. gone. Making the title of the album wrong is one thing to be stupid, but making a choice for others is another thing. Muppet Movie shows how Henson encouraged us all to think, both old and proverb. He never wants to be completely different, but he doesn't want us to end the event. <br /> <br /> This is why Muppet Movie is showing ten movies. If we sent a movie to space to prove to the intelligent life that we are worth more than destruction, that would be the case.
