The film deals with universal topics without mentioning any particular country as its context: it can happen anywhere - and in essence if not in form. Those who are concerned about the first change, censorship, etc., but do not want to be used to lectures, need this art to illustrate, dramatize, teach, inspire. <br /> <br /> Rickman is definitely an undervalued character actress; he shines in this movie, showing the talents of several actresses that you must see (I haven't seen him yet to give bad power, not even in good films). Stowe is probably giving her the best results (and proving she has one of Hollywood's most prominent pairs) - in two words: stunning, convincing. <br /> <br /> Complete design fits perfectly with function and mood. Audio editing increases the effect. The full contrast delivered through animation sequences is the perfect symbolic device - and welcome and only the most breath-taking story to the required place. The script is dense and imperative, involving an amazingly dramatic-yet realistic-dialogue (i.e., as it could and should be). Perhaps the most striking aspect to combat is that 1) this is the first time the director has been; and 2) he is a writer. In one phrase: tour de force - with three suggestions: look at it, have a copy, watch it repeatedly to understand all its secrets and grab all that genius.
