Okay, here's the thing. There's an American pilot who goes by looking at his business, maybe he's bigger than the number of evil, cowardly non-American fighters (they are Middle Eastern types, but enough to say they don't like apple pie or Elvis Presley) who will continue to shoot him down. Now this American pilot did nothing wrong, but those evil non-Americans didn't care and before he knew he was banged into a stranger prison and sentenced to death! <br /> <br /> Now, what usually happens here is that the US military beat a couple of nearby cities until the pilot was released, but not this time. These evil peace loves are likely to be involved, and they managed to stop any reluctant massacre. As you can imagine, the pilot's family does not like it and the evil foreign dictator has this secret, satisfied look at him. He will make these Americans pay, oh yes, indeed! <br /> <br /> But he didn't consider Doug Masters, his 16-year-old son. You see that Doug has been able to fly by plane longer than he can drive (which cannot be so long) and decides to fly to this evil, foreign country and get back to his father. So, with the help of his friends, Dougi and his impeller, retired pilot Chappy 'Sinclair, opens a two-person air strike with the help of retired pilot. <br /> <br /> Now you think this plan would have failed, but you would be wrong. Of course, these Middle Eastern species can be all veteran pilots, but Doug has his sleeve ace, he listens to rock music when he flies! After firing down ten enemy planes and blowing the oil refinery, Doug lands at the airport and gets his wounded father on the plane. Of course evil, not so funny, the dictator for these antics is quite annoying and takes to heaven to shoot Doug. But the young boy listens to more rock music and blows the scum from heaven. HURRAY! <br /> <br /> After Doug and Chappy have dropped 90% of their air force, aliens are sending their latest planes in a rather bad attempt to drop Doug, but in timing, US F16 flying is rising and intimidating. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this movie enough. It was the first movie cassette I brought, and until I was twenty, I was hoping my dad would get off the ground so I could save him. But he doesn't want to fly, so it didn't happen.
