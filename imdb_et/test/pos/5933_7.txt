Royal Rumble has traditionally been one of my favorite events and I've been a wrestling fan a few years ago. Other exhibitions may have better matches, but I've always found that the actual rumble game is full of excitement. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to reveal the winners of the competition, as I can't see it is a fair attempt to destroy the results. I comment on their quality though. <br /> <br /> We have a standard 4 game and then a big rumble. Two from Smackdown and two from Raw. <br /> <br /> Shawn Michaels and Edge open to Raw. It turns out to be suitable for two talented men. This is a game I would recommend looking at. It's hard to sum up without giving away the winner. <br /> <br /> Next we have the usual Undertaker against some big nasty monster, be it who it is. Giant Gonzales, Yokozuna, Kamala ... and this time it's Heidenreich. It's also a cup competition. Typical price list. See if you are a fan. I have to admit that I'm just for the entertainment factor. It cannot be considered a classic wrestling game. For once Smackdown succeeds upstage Raw. Their title fits quite exciting and enjoyable. The raw game is a pretty boring and boring thing that is unfortunate because I'm a fan of both companions. <br /> <br /> Now, the main reason I love the event is rumbling. This year it's pretty good. When we arrived at the event, we all had a good idea of ​​winning, and it might not be a big surprise, but hey, it's very enjoyable. There are different ways to eliminate people. There's a symbolic guy who doesn't make it around, a ridiculous participant and we all want to see that it's lost, and someone loses a previously eliminated fighter. It has normal highs and low values ​​and I loved the end, especially the entrance of Vince McMahon. <br /> <br /> I recommend this show. Not the top form of WWE, it's good. Add it to your collection.
