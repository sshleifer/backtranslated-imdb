Before I leave the new millennium, I'll go back once again because I had completely forgotten these gems !!!!! <br /> <br /> In 1987, Disney, being a "low" company in the 80s, was able to launch several films on "Not Quite Human" geeky on television, as the "Inspector Gadget" looks like a human, but is really a robot !!!!! Now it's SCREAMS 80S with other movies like "Tron" and "Honey, I Shrunk The Kids" because it combines everything with modern and future technologies !!!!! <br /> <br /> My parents will then remember it on TV when I was just born or something. But my first encounter with this movie was on the old Disney channel (once, I saw this and other parts on my 12th May '99 !!!!!> <br /> "Not a real person" is a very good series of movies to watch if you can ever find these movies. <br /> <br /> Has this been shown recently? If so, give me an email or personal message. <br /> <br /> 10/10
