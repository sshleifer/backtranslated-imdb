I went to see what would be a great comedy and Robin Williams's comeback, but when I saw it, I realized that I was lied by advertisers because it is more of a drama than comedy, although he has some very good laugh at it. It seemed I was watching two movies. One was a funny romp with Robin Williams, which should have been the whole pool of the film, but you also get a techno-thriller movie with a political nerve in the middle. I really don't know how to classify this movie. But I can tell you that it was good and I laughed, not as much as I hoped, but at least Williams is back in the right direction. Look at this, but I know it's not all comedy before you go, and it's a little intense.
