I didn't see this movie until it appeared on television because I was suspicious of cartoons. From "Batman" series, "Spawn", "Judge Dredd" and many other pious-13 bombs, I will pay for everything. I would ask, "Why can't anyone make a movie that is rated R and stays with the story, how hard is it?" And finally, my prayers have been answered with Blade. This film appears on the screen with violence, blood, martial arts, weapons, fire, evil, and so on. Yes, yes. It is certain that a lot of momentum includes all these benefits and most of them have been bombarded. But not Blade, the movie was just right, not going overboard, giving a good length and never a boring moment. Blade II is cool, but not as cool as the first one. Blade is indeed one of the best true comics I've seen for a long time.
