Rajkumar Santoshi tries his hand in comedy and succeeds. One of the few good films associated with Salman Khan. Very funny movie from start to finish. All the characters in the movie help and believe me, there are many. Aamir Khan, Salman Khan, Raveena Tandon, Karishma Kapoor, Paresh Rawal, Vija Khote, Jagdip, Deven Verma, Shakti Kapoor, Harish Patel, Tiku Talsania, and others. Direction, editing, sound is not up to par, but it is still not important because the participants are more than that part.
