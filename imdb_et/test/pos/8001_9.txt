Batman Returns is really a dark film that shows a captain attack that fights against the penguin and sexy Catwoman (I get them later). Michael Keaton works well as Bruce Wayne, showing he is a good actor. Tim BUrton directs this picture well and the movie locations are impressive. Crap: Danny deVito threatens penguin. A cruel but disturbed man who had a really hard childhood. But Michelle Pfeiffer steals the picture. She's BEST Catwoman ever! She is threatening and extremely sexy. There's a scene where she kisses a Batman cat that just warms the film. The actions are also good and the end is a dramatic and tragic, probably the best end of the Batman movie. Tim Burton shows that he can manage Batman very well (he has already shown it with the first Batman) and gives Batman a darker character. As much as him.
