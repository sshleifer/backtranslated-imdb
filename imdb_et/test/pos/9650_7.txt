Seeing Les Amants Reguliers for immediate comparison with Bertolucci's "The Dreamers", I think is the best film about the rebellion of students in Paris in 1968. In fact, the director, Philippe Garrel, does not seem to compare his much more famous colleague, sharing the main actor and even containing a direct copy of the eye-catcher with the older Bertolucci film. And yet, LAR is a different film and interesting. <br /> <br /> The story seems familiar. The film begins with long scenes from the 'emeutes' of 1968, perhaps best done. The film is made in black and white, and the static camera's perspective on one or another barricade resembles Eisenstein. Then, like The Dreamers, the action moves in a Paris apartment, where the heroes of the rebellion defeated art, smoking drugs, dreaming and falling apart. There is no direct social comment, no real explanation of the rebellion background. The film focuses on the psychology of the characters and the love story between the main characters. It's like an idea of ​​the process of transition to the 1968 generation, it's just that not all participants can adapt or survive. events. And that's just the style we remember. Black and white cinema is memorable not only in revolution scenes, but also in the evolution of characters. Many sequences are enhanced with techniques derived from silent movie movies, along with long shots with piano tuning. The effect is subtle. But the length of the film is hardly justified, it lasts more than three hours and I doubt that it would have been missing for only two hours - in fact, I am convinced that it is the opposite. <br /> <br /> Raising the depth and nuance of the Bertolucci movie LAR is another perspective to remember one of the most important years in French and world history in the 20th century.
