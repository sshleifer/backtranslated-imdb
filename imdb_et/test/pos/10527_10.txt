Great adaptation of Christie's novel. Surprising attention to the details of authentic periods over time (Many of the 80's films from the mid-1970s that strive to make the 1920s-30s look like too much from the mid-1970s to the mid-80s. well done. Did I like this production very much? largely thanks to the divine idea of ​​Francesca Annis' carefree bright young lady Frankie and James Warwick from the charming Bobbie. The couple would portray Christie's Tommy & Tuppence, which is funny because some contemporary book critics compared Frankie and Bobby to his earlier Tommy & Tuppence. Supporting characters were equally well done? over Mrs. Rivington (acting as Miss Marple-to-be Joan H.) and "Badger" are played perfectly as a post WWI, "Bertie Wooster Type."
