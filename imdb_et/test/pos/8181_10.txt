This story, which documented the rise of China's first emperor and his efforts to unite the empire, was the most expensive film production in Chinese history. <br /> <br /> It's worth every penny. Visually dazzling cinematography, wide-ranging scores and outstanding characters make it one of the best ethics ever put on film (abroad or otherwise.) Please do not miss the opportunity to see it on the big screen.
