If you are intermittent, considering what is real and what is just fantasy, this is a thriller for your seat that will probably keep you thinking. Try to get a copy of it and see for yourself! I looked at it recently at the L.A film festival and it was by far the best I saw in the group. It helped that it was actually something, unlike the others that were screened. It is very well targeted and the production value is the upper limit. I would compare it to the ladder of Jacob, because it will keep you from what our real reality is. You should definitely try to hunt for this movie and if it is screened at every nearby festival, try Watch.
