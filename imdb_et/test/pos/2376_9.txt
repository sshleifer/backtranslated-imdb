The third part of Miike's Dead or Alive trilogy is more or less related to the first two parts as they were to each other, more or less. Show Aikawa and Riki Takeuchi are once again in the lead, but this time the film will be pulled forward 300 years later ... post apocalypse. <br /> <br /> Riki is played by a harsh policeman, enforcer for the extreme police policies of a corrupt city, and the show plays fun, grabbing a host of oppressed rebels. The film has to be made in Hong Kong because most of the rest is Cantonese, Terence Yin and Josie Ho are the most well-known faces. There is also a HK stunt team for movie activities that are very cool in HK-via-Miike style. <br /> <br /> This may be a dreadful low budget feed for a B-movie, but Miike's hands will naturally become more interesting. This is a rather slow, thoughtful film that runs along and does not try to force anything under the viewer's throat. The characters are rounded and interesting, and the plot is an interesting, but quite open, framework for a hanging story. <br /> <br /> All in all, it is a scene that shows Miike's increasing ability to lead and choreography in a very nice action. Show & Riki a short selection of wire mesh is really fun - you can say they have a great time. <br /> <br /> The movie finals will be tied to 3 dead or alive movies, which is quite unnecessary because everyone is truly independent. Miike's explanation of the community is very funny and the series is pretty nice. <br /> <br /> Not as deep or well developed as DOA2, not as terrible and intense as DOA1 ... another good Miike movie though.
