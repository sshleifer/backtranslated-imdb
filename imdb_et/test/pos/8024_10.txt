<br /> <br /> When I first heard this with coffee and friends in 1997, I decided to review it. The only problem was that it was on a small screen at one of my local cinema. <br /> <br /> It didn't stop just enjoying a great movie with Donald Donald Aidan Quinn. Sutherland and Ben Kingsley. The whole movie, kept me glued to my seat. I just didn't find any mistakes in this great movie, I give her my highest recommendation to those who love thrillers. I'm very proud to have it in my collection. <br /> <br /> 10/10 (I don't give it lightly).
