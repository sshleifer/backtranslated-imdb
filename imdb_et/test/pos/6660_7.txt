I have not been able to completely block this movie from memory, although it has been two years since I have seen it. <br /> <br /> Don't make me wrong - I've long forgotten the main story. the relationship between Kidman and the law that didn't impress me, but it was the scenes of torture in a movie that really hit me. I cried for about two hours right after the palace. <br /> <br /> It had never happened to me in the past, how people in wartime could use something as clean as their mother's love. Here are a number of examples - Natalie Portman and her mother's fingers in the garden to keep her son home. I was shocked in these scenes and probably never watch the movie again, because the scenes are now clear to me. However, I am delighted that I was watching the film simply because it made me more aware of the horror of war and the terrible cruelty that mankind can attribute to it. <br /> <br /> The blonde albino character has been one of the most important malicious listings in my movie. His terrible sneer and lack of human feelings for the people he tormented were nervous with me. At one point I wanted to get up in the cinema and kill myself (see that the film pushed me to the edge of the mind, it only happened after I only hit a big screen - it shows the power and intensity of the film at least). <br /> <br /> I recommend the movie because it is not only an intertwined love story, but how it depicts war without a battlefield.
