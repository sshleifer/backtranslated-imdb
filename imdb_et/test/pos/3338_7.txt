George Sanders, who is playing Saint in the penultimate time, is doing a good job with a good script - with a normal good RKO. It's also not Charter's story of murder and good clean fun. <br /> <br /> Topic 1: In New York, police inspector Fernack, a Templar friend with a corrupt scandal and shamed - ST comes over London is trying to get things right. Nice and simple so far - but is there more than $ 90,000 in the world? Theme 2: Another story about a woman who revenge the murder of her brother, Wendy Barrie makes some shameful people and loves her. Including the evil who was under their direct protection, and in the Fernack basement - of him (dead and staring), this horrible blow and them in the car when they bring him back to where they got him. Paul Guilfoyle as Pearly Gates must have been a homosexual in this - witnessing the beginning of a bathrobe and later an amazing ST comment that he thought he was holding him as a pet - and also did "Palm Springs"! Fernack was usually played by Jonathan Hale, but this time with such a defeated defeated attitude that what he really needed was a good blow from the Templar to enliven him. <br /> <br /> The Hays Office also made sure that the image to the right, all the threads are caught. It's worth looking at all those who like this thing, but if Val Kilmer's version is your yardstick, don't worry.
