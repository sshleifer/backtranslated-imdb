Louis Khan was one of the most influential architects of our time, and this film tells how little everyone actually knew. His son's desire to find out who, and more importantly, what he is moving, and emotional. <br /> <br /> This movie captures what architecture really is, what good design is and the emotional price that is paid for it. The same ghost is also a soundtrack. When you see the movie and then listen to the soundtrack, you can just listen to the movie. As a 30-year-old practitioner, my heart has hurt and rejoiced in the film and its very straight forward, though with emotional honesty and sincerity. <br /> <br /> I was honored to see this film in Chicago as the National Institute of American Architecture. The film was introduced by Daniel, and he was later kind to ask questions and answers. There was no disturbance at all during the presentation of the film, not sound, not cough. The whole audience was sitting mesmerized and the real petting was during Daniel's show of film. <br /> <br /> I always remember the movie and keep listening to it every time I listen to the soundtrack ...
