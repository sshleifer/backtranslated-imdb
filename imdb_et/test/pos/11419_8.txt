All the shootings, blood horror films that have been in our recent times, "Saw, Hostal, Saw 2, The Hills are under the eyes". Yes, they have their place, don't get me wrong! I was going to look at "When a stranger call" my friend the other night! Why? Because it's a remake of the 1979 classic that was great at that time and scared you to know everything! I didn't know what to expect. But I was pleasantly surprised! It was a mood, atmosphere, distance to the film! Because you remember people you don't see, what you think, what you don't hear, or what you think you hear is much more frightening than what you do! If you love mood, creepines, intercourse and atmosphere! You love it! It brought it back to the original Halloween roots. Thumbs up, solid 8.5 out of 10 Remember people, it's well done! is not perfect! It's horrible, not bloody, it's horrible, not gory! It was nice to see that the movie is so long. Our senses are due to the bright and shocking value of today's horror films, we forget what is really scary.
