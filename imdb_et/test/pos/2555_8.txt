Chop Shop. Written and directed by Ramin Bahran (Man Push Cart). Bahrani specializes in conducting character studies in natural-style films, such as small people who pass by every day without ever being seen there in New York. <br /> <br /> These are people who have come to the brink of society. They exist in a gray world, many of them immigrants whose legal status in America is somewhat doubtful. Where do they come from? How did they get there? How do they cope? Where do they finally arrive? They do not know good stories as such, but stories about survival at its most basic, everyday level. <br /> <br /> Ale is one such street boy. He has no education and no hesitation to save money, nor does he go far to tiny theft. Mostly, he wants to reunite with his parent's sister. We see him in early scenes that call a safe house looking for him but have no real success. A young friend, Carlos, gets him working on a carbonate shade in the Shea baseball stadium. Eventually, her older sister arrives with her on the spot, but she is jealous of her friends' motives and suspects how she makes extra money. She dreams of buying a food van and buying her older sister vending machine. <br /> <br /> Bahrani shoots all of his films. There is nothing glossy or glossy about them. It is life when these people keep it raw. It is not quite beautiful, although it is never ominous, and the slightly desperate air that hangs from a large part of the film is the same as hanging in their daily lives. <br /> <br /> The script is also very natural, and plenty of space and space for the characters to work. Polanco is in the lead and Gonzalez gives strong support to the older sister.
