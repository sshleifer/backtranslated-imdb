I think it was never a fantastic movie to kiss. The casting was really good and they worked very well. I like Drew Barrymore and of course it was great. I was first frightened because he said it wouldn't come out of the video. Boy, I'm happy that it's because it's an amazing movie. Look at it if you don't already!
