When I was young, I was a big naked Gun movie fan, but recently I was looking at the police at Sqaud! and I think it's great! Leslie Nielson is awesome, Alan North is cool and who the hell is Rex Hamilton? But still this is a funny show. <br /> <br /> One of my favorites in this play is when they make a credit card during the end credit of the scene. I think my favorite is when Norberg (not O.J.) walks during the scene and tries to match the freezer. Classic! <br /> <br /> The only problem for me is that the cigarette gag becomes very old (when Drebin tells a cigarette and asks, "Cigarette?" and the person says, "Yes. I know.") I think they used it too many times. <br /> <br /> Good functioning, good gags, great show! <br /> <br /> 7/10
