Misfit recruits the skills of a private Owens test drill supervisor, Sgt Moore (Jack Webb). No explosions, no bloodshed, no hips or no sound. It's set at USMC Parris Iceland S.C. and the majority of the cast was the real Navy. A memorable one-time lining is rich and the "dedicated ..." closing loan is intense. With such strong male and female characters, this film cannot be made in today's world.
