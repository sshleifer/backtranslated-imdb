Finally, I have seen a real reason why Peter Boyle became famous. It wasn't a "Young Frankenstein" monster or Frank Barone's "Everybody Loves Raymond". For younger people who only know him on TV, he tries to try this movie out of Frank like a saint. <br /> <br /> "Joe" is Boyle's best actor and, as someone mentioned, probably "Archie Bunker" inspired "Everything in the Family". I think Boyle even went back to play Frank. (I say this because I noticed that both "Joe" and Frank Barone basements are similar.) <br /> <br /> I didn't know about this movie when I logged out of this book, I just knew Boyle and Susan Sarandon was featured. Yes, Susan looks good here and a very good early role for a young actor. The young hippie wants to be the one who flees from his parents home and lives with the ultimate lost drug-induced fog that sells as much as he buys. <br /> <br /> Too many pills after the almost fatal dose, she has been hospitalized when her parents go to her stuff, her mother does not go into a smelly, struck apartment, but her father does it. Though his father collects his stuff, his boyfriend comes home and has two exchange measures, and then his dad does what we hear later Joe says he'd make a hippie. <br /> <br /> Joe shots off her mouth as she hates different cultures / races, hippies and other people's heritage. When he says, "I'd really like to kill one of them," says Dad (trying to look like a joke), "I just did." Joe buys it almost, but then takes it for fun. Later, when the police are on the scene and the story is on paper, Joe understands he wasn't kidding. Instead of defeating the rich man by extorting money, he actually crushes him. Just wishing she and her husband and her husband get to know her. A long story short of their relationship is uncomfortable, but after Sarandon gets the wind that his father has done, he falls out from the bottom. <br /> <br /> How it all ends, you have to look at yourself. Although it's over 35 years ago, it's the end you expect. If you haven't seen the movie, of course. Again, I recommend it to those who haven't seen it. <br /> <br /> 10-star Boyle, who not only plays someone who is completely the opposite, but shows others that he was more than just a television and a comedy filmmaker.
