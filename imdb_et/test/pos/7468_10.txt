This movie is outstanding! On that date, April 8, 2007, it was shown by display time. It was a while because I saw it, but it is Thomas Jane's first role I saw him. First of all, you see a normal man who seems confident, a woman who looks close to her path. The drivers I just watched have a cool scene that is cool. Paulina Porizkova is dressed in a cheerful type, looking very fresh and hot. In an attempt to buy coffee late in the evening without hurry to rush into violence, Paulina indicates that her name in her writer is the real thing. Aaron Eckhart's old old Nick played with his first was cool and he even gave him his wife's car to take care of some company. Then he captures the silver suitcase and the day becomes strange and violent. There are real signs that parade in the following series of scenes. But Paulina Dallas steals the show. He tells Casey's story to a doctor who is in a receiving request for a personal interview. As a rule, I have never thought that high women were sexy, but as with any rule, there are exceptions. Paulina is like she's never seen in movies. Sexy and deadly, as in one movie with Tom Selleck, but never before. If you are looking for a movie to add to your collection, it's worth it. Paulina is naked alone, but that story is all that can be hoped. Love, friendship, sex and violence in a terrible mix. When I saw it for the first time years ago, it blew my mind and I know you know the same.
