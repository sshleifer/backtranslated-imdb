I was 9 years old when I saw it for the first time on TV. Friday evening. I remember the entire page ad in the TV guide with Rex's picture. Amazing how some things in your mind will stay after 30 years. Anyway, if your child who likes monster movies is fun enough, especially with the boone and Keats against each other. Special effects are not harryhausen, but its value is one and a half hours if you find it somewhere late at night. It hasn't been seen in a few years, because these classics disappear from cable TV. If you catch it late at night, don't be too critical, just grab some snacks and enjoy it. it may be cheesy, but I thought it was much better than the cell remake that came out in theaters a year earlier.
