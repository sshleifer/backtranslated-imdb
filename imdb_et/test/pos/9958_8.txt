"The Venetian merchant" was one of the most popular Shakespeare plays in his lifetime, but in the 20th century it has undoubtedly fallen due to anti-Semitic content. The game is also called a schizoid from comedic scenes to tragic ones, so some say it is two games that try to co-exist. Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes, who played William Shakespeare in "Shakespeare's Love") is in love with Portia (Lynn Collins, great), but he has to lend a significant amount of money to hide him. He goes to his homosexual lover Antonio (Jeremy Irons), who has no money for his person, but takes out a loan from the Jewish insurer Shylock (Al Pacino). Shylock is amused and offended by the fact that Antonio, who is offensive to his faith, is now receiving money, but he offers it on the condition that a penalty is imposed on Antonio's meat for non-compliance. What happens of course. Bassanio and Portia offer much more to Shylock than the original loan instead of the meat pound, but Shylock, who is disappointed after leaving her daughter and marries a Christian, refuses to take it. Portia, in a scene where the audience is never quite sure where to place her sympathy, leaves Shylock out of what should be legally her, and then splits her into wealth and faith. Shylock was originally an essay comic book, but modern actors and directors have turned it into a tragic line against the injustices of the 16th century Venice. Al Pacino does a great job like Shylock and Jeremy Irons are good at Antonio, but I think Lynn Collins works best for Portiana. Portia is one of the few notable female in Shakespeare's canon, and Collins is wonderful in this regard. However, Joseph Fiennes is a bit bored; I have never particularly enjoyed her often overwhelming acting style. I'll give "Venetian Merchant" 8/10.
