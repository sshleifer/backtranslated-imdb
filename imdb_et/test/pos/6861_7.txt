Ultimately, the spooky image set for the parody, which is still playing, can frighten some of those who are nervous or easily outraged when they see the skin. I laughed though. The real killer was easy to decipher and his actions didn't help. This only made Potente even better. Anatomy is not a form of horror for these strangers, but they should get some unintentional laughter and an interesting tip in the German fear cinema. 6/10
