I don't see how some people find this movie funny when I saw it ending in Sky Movies in 2001, I thought the DVD would have laughed since then with my balls like Rik Mayalls laugh "HAHAHAHAHAHAHA" and Eddies "Hello night porter "If they don't get any phone calls at all, I think this movie is very funny.
