It is widely agreed that Hayao Miyazaki is the master of his handicraft when it comes to combining rich animation with a thoughtful story and imagination. His films from NAUSICAA, TOTORO, KIKI, LAPUTA and MONONOKE to the last HOWLI MOVEMENT PAGE are not only beautiful works of art, but also filmmaking. Can't this man do the wrong thing? Not really, but it is impossible to expect all of his films to always be five stars. His newest film, PONYO, the shameless family-friendly story of "Goldfish Water" is just as lushly animated and alive with interesting characters as you expect ... and this is also the first movie to enter into less territory. Don't make me wrong, PONYO is in no way a bad movie. As mentioned, it is the eye of the eye, it is as charming and divine as TOTORO and KIKI. The problem is that the story does not survive to satisfy someone who wants another, relaxing, deep plot. redundant young goldfish (later named Ponyo) makes a forbidden trip to the human world, where he later adopts his childhood, called Sosuke (designed interestingly after the director's own son). It doesn't like Ponyo's father, a mysterious wizard named Fujimoto, who is very angry for people to destroy the sea (this environmental issue is not much different from other Miyazaki films) ... a problem he is going to improve by creating jellyfish from his submarine hero. He separates the pair and tries to talk to Ponyo for water. Goldfish, however, has already tasted Sosuke's blood (healing finger cut) as well as part of human food (a ham that he becomes inexplicably addicted to) and of course steals his father's forbidden drinks, becoming a hyperactive young girl (who is Mei's smiling image of MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO). It triggers a dangerous tsunami that threatens to seize water all over the world. Fujimoto decides to test the love of two youngsters with his wife, Gran Mamma, who has shifted directly from super-sized titanium to human size. They do this by raising the sea to the level of Sosuke's house, encouraging young people over their now ocean-infected world in a large toy boat (which is enabled by Ponyo's own magical power). This is where PONYO starts to run out of steam. Although Ponyo and Sosuke are divine and their scenes are funny and cute, they slow down the film. When a movie really takes water, it is unfortunately an extreme where Sosuke has to prove his love to Pony by strangely submitting it to antimicrobial and hurrying, otherwise bringing a stunning story to a halt. This is likely to bring down viewers who are waiting for another man's masterpieces who have given many interesting finals for many of his other films. Remember the destruction of Laputa? Satsuki was looking for a small Mei? Who saved Tombo? Porco Rosso fights Curtis? Save the head of the Forest Spirit? Or even a test between Chihiro and Yubaba? All of these resolutions were much more satisfactory and felt more complete. <br /> <br /> At the technical level, PONYO cannot be injured. Animation is absolutely fantastic to see what is produced without any computer-generated images, and of course Joe Hisaishi gives us another breathtaking musical score; the best moments are the submerged sequences, with the addition of cream and soprano. Backgrounds are lovingly painted and detailed like all other Ghibli films. <br /> <br /> Being proven to translate and copy Ghibli's previous movies to English with the best quality results, Disney Studios and Pixar again offer English. copy with mostly capable actors. Frankie Jonas is surprisingly good as Sosuke, who sounds very natural and credible. Noah Cyrus as Ponyo, on the other hand, sometimes goes over when she screams before she finally comes down. Leaving aside, the remainder includes Liam Neeson, who is a superhuman Fujimoto (who leads himself surprisingly well in character), Cate Blanchett Gran Mamarena (everywhere in the ring that does not differ much from his Lord of the Galadri rings), Matt Damon as Sosuke's constant sailor, Koichi (who is good but nothing writes home) and Tina Fey as Lisa. Of these, Fey's best voice is cast, filling this character with just the right spirit and personality. His scenes with Sosuke show real chemistry. On the other hand, Cloris Leachman, who was prominent as the fortress of Dola Castle, was disappointedly wasted as one of three disabled elderly women (he hardly has any traits!), Also expressed by Betty White and Lily Tomlin. Of these, only Tomlin's character, central women named Toki, shows any real personality, but when I directed the film, I would switch to Tomlin with Leachman. Probably Dub's only real setback is the blurry techno-remix of a memorable (but ridiculously repetitive) title song that luckily doesn't exist before the average of the closing credit. <br /> <br /> as a whole, PONYO is a good movie; fine animated work that is perfect for the young and the family. However, due to the loss of the end result, it remains beyond the classic status. Since Miyazaki is at least better than most other animated films, I am generous and I give PONYO a full star recommendation because his specialty is still very remarkable, especially on the big screen. (Watch it in theaters if you can.)
