This is a very touching movie. This is the story of a special bond between the child and his grandfather. The villagers (Arun Nalawade) bring their granddaughter to the city of Parashuram to treat her eyes. But it should be known that Parashuram (Aswin Chitale) has some rare eye cancers and they have to undergo surgery and lose both eyes. The film has all the emotions and confusion they both pass through and how they accept the whole thing. The film avoids the melodrama and tells the story in a simple way. Though the film is in Marathi, language is not an obstacle at all. This proves that there is no need for elements, superstars and ordinary masala to make a good movie. Great performance. This is India's entry into the Oscar in 2004. I hope it will at least be a candidate. The rating is 10/10.
