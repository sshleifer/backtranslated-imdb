My friend took me to screening this movie in Hollywood and it was fantastic! It is an amazing actor, a great script, cool music that was very well done and fun. I don't know if he gets an excerpt from theaters, but it would be a great date or a fun movie to see in Blockbuster. This is the kind of film I love, with a low budget, but with style and imagination. I hope Alexandra Holden gets the bigger parts as she is, she's fantastic.
