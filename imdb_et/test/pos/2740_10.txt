My father had this film in 8 mm rolls. I loved it when she pulled out the projector, onto a sheet of tape on the wall, and played Gerald McBoing Boing. I thought the child who called through the sounds looked at me. <br /> <br /> Nine years ago my son was diagnosed with autism. Doctors would ask me questions about my son, for example, "How does he communicate with you?" I would say, "Have you ever seen a drawing, Gerald McBoing Boing?" I would like me to have a copy of this copy to show my son and his educators, this is how my son sees him in the world. did not include sound until the mid-1970s. I think I was pretty happy to see the sights and sounds of Gerald McBoing Boing in 1972.
