Nothing is worse than the genocide of our world history. This film attempts to describe the face of a particular family - a common narrative device - in the world of atomic bombs. The most memorable parts are the graphic and sad images that the Hiroshima people face in the postwar period. However, the story is more concerned about the impact on a particular population and how they cope with their lives; in other words, if you don't really care about them, the film will grow bored. It is difficult not to take care of if the family home has been damaged. I am not sure if I would recommend this film because it says very little politically and honestly did not keep my interest in family concerns.
