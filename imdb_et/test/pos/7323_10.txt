The Columbia Pictures Short Subject unit never had any feelings about producing any "Art" movie. They wanted to give the filmmakers a little more for their money than they ordered a picture of Columbia in their theater. That would be double for the 3 movies "Stooges". <br /> <br /> THE MUSIC MEET (1934) came as close as any of their comedy shorts as they received the Oscar nomination for the best short message, comedy. Although it couldn't, it may well be. It was good enough and even those who do not own Stooge files still seem to have won "........ calling Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard!" This was the second entry in the short comedy series by Stooges, Jules White, head of Columbia's short topics department. Harry Cohen's Poverty Row sweatshop was preceded by WOMAN HATERS, which is described as "Musical Novelty" in his credits. <br /> <br /> The film begins at the office of Dr. Graves, head of the hospital. He gets a new internship and tells the group that three of them have been medically conditioned because they were so long there. But a good doctor says he will not reveal his identity until they all promise their promise and commitment! Stooges fly in front of them, promising "... duty and humanity!" And run out of the office, breaking the door glass. The game was on. <br /> <br /> Stooges started and didn't stop for the other 2 reels. Any gag was evidence. From a broad Sennett-like sight, punches, humor, an absurd theater, and a surreal running trick that includes a public address system that seems to be alive and has a real culprit, the radio tube gets hit "... ! " (It all plays pretty well, honest!) Used kits were very authentic and were undoubtedly borrowed from Columbia's features that were done at the same time. There are many wheelchairs, surgical bags, stethoscopes, Surcical scalpels and so on to preserve the illusion of the hospital. <br /> <br /> MUSIC REALLY, true strength is a large number of unnamed players we all face. Together with them, the film has a large number of veteran comedians who always turn to fine performances, often lurking in the scene. People named Billy Gilbert, Hank Man, and Bud Jamison seem even in small parts. <br /> <br /> And finally, we have Maestro, the conductor-director Raymond McCarey, the brother of Leo McCarey, who showed his abilities in getting this little movie "jar." He kept it all moving, acting from time to time as a traffic manager that all actors, extras, and behind the scenes move around and next to each other. And it doesn't count Giant 3 Man Tandem Bicycle, The Sway Backed Horse, and Miniature Cars, not to mention Giant, Green Canaries!
