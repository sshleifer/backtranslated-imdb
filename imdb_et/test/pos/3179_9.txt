It was a great show ... I don't remember that much, but remember watching it and loving it. I remember mom and dad. I like Grandma. She was like a grandmother you don't really understand until you are an adult. He was very conscious and pointless. My favorite song at the show was the Sardines in the morning. (this may not be the title) I remember after this show and listening to the song that I went to Cleveland Ohio to visit my cousin and I and my sister sang this song so much that we left all my little relatives with this song . I would also like to find it on the DVD.
