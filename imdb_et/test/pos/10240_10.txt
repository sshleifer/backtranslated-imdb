It is interesting to see what people think about this film, because it is actually quite unique (although it has some Clive Barker written trademarks). Although it may seem a bit cynical to say, the film is just complex enough to target those who need the usual Hollywood plot hooks, and layered, so if you assume it is being fed, you'll see a normal monster strike with a lot of monsters and a scattered plot. <br /> <br /> Those who need a linear, specific, and complicated plot line hate this movie because this story, like a short story, is partly between lines, or in some cases partly off the screen, comments, and imagination. <br /> <br /> Another possible hanging is the end that I can say without breaking it is not entirely good and not totally bad. In fact, it is not exactly defined what I know to send some people furious tantrums that they did not know what happened, but to me and many others, I am sure I will add another dimension to the dimension - the dimension of speculation and, moreover, that a major disorder has a tendency to produce rather far-reaching waves. <br /> <br /> Here is definitely moral, but quite different from the usual Hollywood movie-end-the-the-end-the-end-the-end-the-end-the-end-type screen. In conclusion, the moral structure is simple, although it is not simply displayed; prejudices and the tendency of people to hate differently. <br /> <br /> I love this movie, though, as many observers have pointed out, the actors' expressions (except David Cronenberg, who makes a wonderful look) are quite sticky. I'm not sure they are completely guilty of their rickety appearance and lack of depth, seeing that they are common problems in converting literature into a scenario. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a great movie, provided you don't expect it to be a normal horror movie.
