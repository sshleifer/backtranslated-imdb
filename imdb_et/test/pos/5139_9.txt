Hoot is a nice young man's movie about a group of middle school students trying to catch a pancake chain from a plot home to some endangered peeling owls. Action is pretty good and fresh faces are nice to see. In this film, there are many well-known comedies who are holding the humor shortly. It's a movie for a young crowd, maybe between 5 and 11 years old. I thought the adult movies that passed through the screen these days are a nice change. There is neither reality nor the accuracy of life for adults or children. It's just a bunch of fun, constant messages about saving this country's beautiful places. If you remember the day you didn't win the box, you may remember that money is not all. Not many people over the age of 12 want to enjoy it unless they have a delicate place in the old post-school series.
