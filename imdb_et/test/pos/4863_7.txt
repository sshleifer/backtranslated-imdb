There are moments if you do not want these deep drama series. If you don't want the series with heavy stories or have to watch every episode so you can hang. There are moments if you just want to look at a simple series with lots of activities and cool characters. In those moments you have Cleopatra 2525. <br /> <br /> I was one of those who really enjoyed Charlie's angel. Critics said it was superficial and stupid. But the thing is, it's a thing! People who can't relax and wait for a serious movie hated it. It's exactly the same with Cleopatra 2525. It's superficial. He has stupid and unrealistic characters. And that's why I like it. It's not like any other series. <br /> <br /> The first season was not very good. The character Cleo was irritating and a little too much. The story was a bit flat, and you didn't know much about the characters. But hey, they had just 20 minutes for all episodes. <br /> <br /> During the last 5 to 6 episodes of Cleopatra 2525, they finally gave the series a 40-minute length. And it was here, I started to love it. Finally, the series began to grow into a very qualitative series. The series had to be canceled too bad. Because the latest episodes of Cleopatra 2525 were really good. I'll never forget Hel, Sarge and Cleo. Unique characters that only Xena creators could create!
