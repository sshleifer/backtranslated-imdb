How many movies are there, what do you think when you see such a movie? I can't read them, but it seemed like filmmakers were trying to give me some clues. I was so often reminded of other films, which turned out to be a big distraction. One of the borrowed memorable lines comes from the 2003 film - Day After Tomorrow. One line per se is not so bad, but this film borrows so many films that become a bad risk. <br /> <br /> HOW ... <br /> <br /> Watch the movie! Despite its undercutting, it is interesting enough and perhaps it seems wise. Lending so much from other movies, it never goes overboard. In fact, you will probably find yourself under the hatches and out of the storm. Why? ... Costner and Kutcher played their characters very well. I have never been a Kutcher fan and I ended up in The Guardian soon, but he was in good fashion. Costner seamlessly carries the film with Costner's best chance. I do not believe that Mrs Robinson had anything to do with her success. Finally, I had no problems with them. However, some of these characters were used too much. Enjoy the movie, the parts that work, work well enough to keep your head above the water. Just wait for a smooth ride. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 but almost 6.
