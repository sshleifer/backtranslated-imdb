I'm a horror movie that must be one of the most phenomenal horrors I've ever seen. The drawing line is completely original (who would otherwise think of a city that has become totally obsessed with death and madness?), Special effects are amazing and cinematography cannot be better. Some may interfere with this, but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie. This is also a good point. The spiral symbol is sure everywhere. Spiral notebook, spiral shell, spirals for cakes. Of all the images they could have used (square, triangle, trapezoid, rectangle), this was one of the best choices. If you find this movie, be sure to see it. This is definitely unique and unforgettable.
