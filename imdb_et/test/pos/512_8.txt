Wesley Snipes is perfectly molded like Blade, half a person, half a vampire, who is known as a daydream. He has all his strengths and his only weakness is thirst for blood. Since she is with a quiz (Kris Kristofferson), she has hunted vampires who have lived among us for centuries unnoticed, but the almighty high priest Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) is tired of living in harmony with people (food when she calls them) and she is going to awaken blood god and take over the world. <br /> <br /> This film is well cast, written and directed; ensuring the viewer an exciting journey from start to finish. The excellent Blade, packed with struggle sequences and slippery dialogue, is definitely more of a fear, but definitely offers it. <br /> <br /> 8/10
