I thought this film was excellent, peculiar and different from the usual mill run that was separated from the police serial numbers. Kiefer Sutherland was brilliant as usual - I really don't think I've seen anything he's done where he's not working great. Dialogue was sometimes a funny mood relieving and engaging plot. Thanks to the other reviewers, they showed a connection in Alice's wonderland - I hadn't taken them over. I recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Kiefer Sutherlands (like me) and everyone who wants to watch an entertaining movie for a few hours. It was disgraceful that it wasn't released to a wider audience in cinemas.
