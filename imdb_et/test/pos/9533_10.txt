Edith Nesbit's best book is tailored to a really great movie, I love it. The film also boasts the perfect realization of cinematography and theme. The end is enough for you to have tears because it is so beautifully done. Lionel has directed some really great movies, such as the amazing Mr Blunden, but it's his best film as a director in a mile. The costumes were absolutely cute that matched the beauty of the countryside, and sparkling and comfortable-faithful scripts helped. But it works that keeps this movie together, because it's not shorter than incredible. Dinah Sheridan is appropriately sincere as a mother, a character of great need and Bernard Cribbins was as fun as Perks. In fact, I preferred Perks on the film because he is not so humorous in the book. The kids were perfect. Gary Warren and Sally Thomsett gave such entertaining performances, but just Jenny Agutter's enchanting imagination of Bobbie, which impressed me most. Another special remark is Johnny Douglas's proud music, the title music reminding me of Charlie Chaplin's smile. All in all, I think it's better than a book, a funny and terrible masterpiece. 10/10.
