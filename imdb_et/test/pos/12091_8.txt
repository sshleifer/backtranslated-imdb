"Crossing the Bridge: The Sound of Istanbul" is one of the best documentary films I recently saw and more than a music movie. It is also a musical love statement for a fabulous city, one of the largest cities in Europe and the world, one of the most important cities in European history and Islam, a city that can moor in the future in Europe and the Middle East, or may mean once again, as has happened in history between the two worlds. <br /> <br /> Then there is music. An interesting approach to film music is that it begins with modern music and we hear a lot of (good) stone and oilseed rape in the first third of the film. Then, like the backward movement of time, the soundtrack leads to roots, to Turkish traditional music, to commercial romance and to exotic instruments, which are the main elements of the Turkish music landscape. In such a complex and conflict-ridden country where Turkey is, the film does not exclude some political aspects, such as the censorship introduced by the military in the 1980s, or the relevance of minority songs, especially Kurdish songs. One of the best musical moments is actually a Kurdish singer who has a fantastic voice in the cathedral-shaped hamam (Turkish bath). <br /> <br /> One person loves watching and listening to this movie at the end of the city and its music. I've never been to Istanbul, but after seeing this movie, I'm sure I want to visit this place soon.
