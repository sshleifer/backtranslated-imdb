Nowadays, Hollwood seems to be a rare achievement. Many find that the film industry has only two of the best image candidates to demonstrate. And the "Everything is Illuminated" sign hits directly. <br /> <br /> The film shines its shine with a beautiful setting-scene input. From the beginning, you will feel the warmth and true family ties and relationships between the other. And the cast is also perfect. In the case of Elijah Wood's character, Jonathon, his sensitivity is expressed in the dying grandmother's hand. And for Alex it is easy to see his life from his point of view - a true Ukrainian rock star. In the initial illumination, the story slowly eases into our minds when Jonathon decides to turn to Ukraine to meet a woman who is thought to save her grandfather, so with the whole family. And from there, the story is filmed slowly, but it keeps the pace from the contrast between the teardrop drama and the ridiculous humor in the scene, every scene. <br /> <br /> The film itself is rather a prize, there are complaints about other sources, commenting on Liev Schrieber's inaccurate adaptations to Jonathon Safron Foer's novel. Personally, I have never read a novel. But every movie, especially this movie, should not be categorized according to whether the storyline of the film matches the style of the book, but rather how the main concepts of the novel were published and used through the film. Just because it can farther away from the novel does not mean that this movie is no longer black - it's still. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie, the new information will inflate the audience very slowly. Some of these thoughts never answer; and on the other side of the movie, all of their subject matter and the reason for traveling is directed to Ukraine, but rather like the original intentions of this film. The film, however, leaves you with a note of satisfaction, but a tear may fall to the weak hearts. And the whole movie. For those with a good sense of humor and having a good sense of humor, one can just laugh at Alex and John's fun and ongoing conversations. genre drama-comedy for those who are interested in family reunions, and for those who are interested in Holocaust topics. And for those crazy people who find slapstick like fun comedy, it's not a movie for you. And for you, who you think is a funny and totally brilliant funny movie, you're wrong; this film shares comedic moments and dramatic sequences. And for those who appreciate a movie based on their likely novel, you can enjoy this movie or not, but this movie should be much more than whether it was near the book or not. All in all, "Everything is Enlightened" is a brilliant work that illuminates someone's hearts.
