The bedrooms and corridors were one of the funniest films at the 1999 Melbourne Film Festival. The United Kingdom is a crowd of young people and their different relative dilemmas. Much of humor focuses on the self-help group of men of the new age, where they move around different tools like the "stone of truth". They're also going to have fun with the "hunter collector" weekend. Trust me, you laugh your teeth.
