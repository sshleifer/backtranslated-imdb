I don't usually comment on IMDB movies, but in that case I feel like I should. I love movies and I want to do them, and this movie is a great example of fine film making. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few movies I saw on small screens (originally I saw that air) I believe on the AMC, and then on the DVD I just watched) that made me feel stomach . This little worshiping feeling that the director hopes you will feel while watching his thriller. <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmon's performance is good and Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas are following. I felt so much empathy about Lemmon, a character with Jack Godell, but wanted people to listen to his warning. <br /> <br /> But what impresses about this movie is the lack of scores, and that's what makes it beautiful. Apart from opening titles, there is no background music to increase the tension, because none of them is necessary. And while credit is black, black defaults to home. <br /> <br /> I use a movie, for example, to say that music makes a movie. I think the film should make a movie and the music should amplify it. However, the Chinese syndrome music does not need to be overcome with realism and the urgency described here. The characters represent all this much better than ever. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie, this is one of my favorites. If you like movies, you won't be disappointed. If you like movie soundtracks, you may not be able to go.
