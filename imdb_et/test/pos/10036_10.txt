Now it's more like that! One of the best movies I've ever seen! Even though it was very well done in all aspects, this movie was only made to be not too historically accurate. which was forgiven for not being historically accurate and many of them not even close to how big, how fun and how this film was enchanting! Now that's exactly what the movie ticket is! this movie genre and all naysayers are those with anti-flynn syndrome. This conservative rooted syndrome is very closely associated with anti-Elvis, anti-Ali, anti-Clinton, anti-Kennedy syndromes, usually caused by the fear of individuals who, if you have an open minded viewer of this film and have the ability to separate politics from art, you will find this movie not only from one of the best classics but also from one of the best films. second best west ever right b ehind Wayne's Cowboys ........
