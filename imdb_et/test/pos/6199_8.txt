* IS AVAILABLE FOR POSSIBLE SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> A friend told me to review this series, and I'm glad to have taken the words for it. DVD cover and I was immediately interested. The main protagonist is Muslim? Under no circumstances is it the first! It is about the FBI agent who is under the deep cover to penetrate LA into a possible sleeping chamber; and get it - he is a practicing Muslim. First of all, I was a little skeptical, a semi-half-hero, a hero, a free and meaningless holistic fanatical driver, a hero or an antagonist ... let's face the fact that many exhibitions are at fault. But then I looked at the first three episodes, and I thought it was good. It was only the fourth episode ("Scholar") when I had a good and real impression. I would like to commend the great writing of the actors and the great performances. I just love how complicated each of these characters is - they're not directly two-dimensional cardboard cutouts for good guys / bad guys. Michael Ealy gives an excellent and incredible result as Darwyn Al-Sayeed, a Muslim FBI agent, training a fine line between good Muslims and the occurrence of mistakes. Oded Fehr gives his character Farik an interesting depth - Farik is not a typical oily Middle Eastern stereotype, but just someone who really believes in his guilt and doesn't see himself as a fanatic, but a man who wants to take any extreme action to justify his beliefs. He is very charismatic and authoritative. But I would say that it was Alex Nesic's presentation that was clearly "Scholar". His imagination of the emotional struggle for his character was amazing - the Muslim teacher's softly spoken words that encouraged him to return to a non-aggressive path, as that is the only acceptable way in God's eyes and to persuade Farik to believe otherwise. > <br /> I look forward to seeing more of these exhibitions and not any ridiculously high octane consensus. It's smart and open.
