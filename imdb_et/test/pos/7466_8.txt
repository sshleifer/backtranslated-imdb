I was honored tonight to see the movie "These Girls" at the Philadelphia Film Festival. When I got into the movie, I knew very little about it and just took it on, because the film's plot sounded interesting. So when I entered the theater a couple of hours ago, I was wondering what would be the final judgment under the thumb or thumb. "These Girls" is the story of three of the best cities in small towns. Keira (Caroline Dhavernas) is a leader who basically does not know what to do with her life after high school, but her father keeps her at a college she doesn't want to do. Lisa (Holly Lewis) goes after a Christian school in the summer. And finally, Glory (Amanda Walsh), who is going to spend her childcare in the summer. But this summer it will be special because they are all blackmailing Keith Clark (David Boreanaz), a sexy older hunk they use to have a baby. Funny time and lots of laughs? <br /> <br /> I usually don't like movies like "These Girls", but this movie has something I really liked. I think the quality I liked most was that it seemed quite realistic. Three girls who want to study their sexuality choose a hunky boy who will let them all have sex with him only to be extruded later. It's a pretty funny story about growing, friendship, and sex, but even though it sounds pretty funny, I can see most of the film that happens in real life. the film didn't get mainstream in the United States. All the girls in this movie are expected to be under the age of 18, if I remember correctly that two of them are 17 and one is 16. Now in the United States, although a minor sex takes place every day, many production or financial companies do not fund this film because of their sexual content. This information was confirmed by the director himself for John Hazlett's film. What happens to me is that the sex scenes in this movie are not graphic and the nudity is small. Not to mention that all the actors in this movie are in real life for over 18 years. Go figure. <br /> <br /> What the film does best, it will give you so much laughter and very strong characters. I liked all the characters in this movie, and every character seemed to them "now and then". The jokes were funny because they were written in writing not because they were dirty or up. Everything seemed to flow well in comedy and drama. The script was very strong. <br /> <br /> Operation was mostly very good. I thought all three girls were great. Caroline Dhavernas, who also played the slowest ever "Wonderfalls" TV shows, was just terrible; as well as Holly Lewis and Amanda Walsh, who both did a good job. David Boreanaz did a good job and seemed to have fun during most of the scenes. The boy played the pot so it was funny to see him in this role. <br /> <br /> I was happy to meet tonight with John Hazlett, who seemed a very nice guy and was very grateful for the comments on the film. I'm shocked that this movie didn't go anywhere. I think that with the little marketing behind it, it could have taken off. Unfortunately, this is one of those direct DVD movies, which to such a small extent is a pleasure to see. I think that with a small budget that Mr Hazlett had to work on, the film turned out to be good and I think he did a good job of running this little gem. <br /> <br /> Someone who usually hates teen sex comedies can honestly enjoy the movie. The development of characters and the witty script allowed me to sit and have fun for an hour and a half. It's a great comedy because it has a heart and a mess. I know I'm buying this movie from DVD on May 16, 2006. If you're a fan of age-related problems, teenage sex, or romantic comedies, be sure to check out this movie because it is one of the more funny movies released at the end of those years. <br /> <br /> The final rating of MovieManzel "These Girls" is 8/10.
