Mary KAy Place, Steve Sandvoss, Jacqueline Bissett, and Rebekah Johnson have excellent results. A great story that rolls you into the movie, emotional but light. I own this movie and everyone with whom I share it love it. Excellent for mixed business, 18+ crowd. <br /> <br /> Nice production, not cheap budget, well organized and keeps your interest. Uses newer domain ideas, returns, and at one point keeps the viewer at the seat. <br /> <br /> No matter what the life of the viewer, they buy the points of one or more of that movie. <br /> <br /> It would be nice to see the sequel!
