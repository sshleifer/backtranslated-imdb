The problem with the other participants in the line of Dorian Gray is that they saw some of the old ones (Hurd Hatfield, Helmut Berger, Josh Duhamel, David Gallagher, Ben Barnes) or that they couldn't take the English aristocratic way without being rigid. Dorian is an eternal 19-year-old (or so), all milky skin and honey locks, as described by Wilde, so the challenge is to find an actor who has that part of maturity and scope (ie who can portray naive, eloquence and manipulation), but at the same time looks like someone in his late teen. And Peter Firth pulls out all this great British TV adaptation. <br /> <br /> Gielgud, like Henry Wotton, though much older than Wilde's minds, does wonders for his scenes - Wilde aphorisms have never heard of so natural and compulsive. Especially George Sanders in the 1945 version was quite weak (and his costume didn't fit). <br /> <br /> Finally, Jeremy Bratt plays Basil as the most masculine and at the same time most gay. trio, again an appropriate interpretation. In general, the movie contains enough gay subtext, without Dorian himself being homosexual - he is all for all people, and allegedly he has no drug or sexual perversion he hasn't tried for 18 years, but it makes him more narrative than homosexual. It seems that he is doing the same destruction for both sexes as he should according to the novel. <br /> <br /> Of course, the budget for this production was not very high, so everything seems to be a little step. In particular, Doria's meeting with Sybil's brother suffers from the appearance of an obvious studio. The final shot of Doria (I think doll) is also more fun in her white scarlet fever than convincing and the Basil's death scene is accidentally funny. (Also remember that Basil should have been killed at the table.) <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a very valuable adaptation. I'm sure Wilde would have liked it. The only thing missing is the sensual side. Not so much about sex scenes, but Wilde's decadent world of fragrant flowers, luxurious clothes and precious metals has not really been studied here, ie aesthetics are completely lost. But like "I, Claudius", those who simply forget the shortcomings of the value of the production are doing great things.
