I think I like life as good as everyone, but about five years ago the opera was not part of my entertainment choices. Oh, I did some tests to find out what all the noise was; I watched several television productions - namely the Wagner Circle on Public Television - hoping to understand the charm of other people with an art form. And I knew I could love different operas (I remember being surprised as a child that I actually loved "My Geisha" fragments of "Madame Butterfly" and I enjoyed opera scenes "Moonstruck" and "Pretty Woman", but unlike their from the characters of the movies I didn't get it easily. <br /> <br /> Then, in 1995, I saw the live performance of "Rigoletto" presented by the New York Opera and that night I "got it." What a wonderful, glorious color and music contest and raw Emotion! And I mean Emotion's capital E, the key, in my opinion, is that opera music allows performers to act freely and incredibly in a way that seems foolish when their words are spoken, everything naturally depends on music, and when music is magical, as is "Rigolettos", opera can be great entertainment. /> <br /> A friendly family member gave me a laser discography of the 1982 TV production, and I've found that because I don't see the live "rigoletto" rmans living regularly, this video version is a good substitute. Luciano Pavarotti is the perfect duke; Ingvar Wixell is excellent as his average-minded judge Rigoletto; Rigoletto's beloved daughter Gilda plays with somewhat simple Edita Gruberova. Sets and costumes are plentiful and the river sections on the river have a story that can never be matched on the stage. <br /> <br /> If you've never seen "Rigoletto", or if you think you don't like or understand opera, I'll invite you to find it on a video tape and buy or rent it. If you don't like it, if this "Rigoletto" production does not make you an opera, you just give it up and move on. But I suspect that if you're new to opera, be pleasantly surprised. Bill Anderson
