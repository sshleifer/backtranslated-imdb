Finding those pieces placed between uneven prequel and rehashed 80's machomovie in the UPN Partner's midday Saturday program would be misleading. It deserves better benefit and certainly uses your talented references the best. The Bracco and Walken team give a film that may be predictable to people who are familiar with their genre, making street light, "worrying thoughts" that they are so good at portrayal. The opportunity to ride a psychological skateboarder on La Fuqua's "training day" dive back into the world of TV films from the early 90s to find "scam"!
