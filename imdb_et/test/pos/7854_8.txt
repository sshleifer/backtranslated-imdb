This is probably Clint Eastwood's best film. Here is the action with minimal but good action. Yankee soldier Eastwood has been wounded and taken by schoolchildren and teachers from the South School, where he is hidden and cared for. Soon after being recycled, all women wanted to have fun with her, and some of them were successful, including the school director (Geraldine Page). Erotic scenes come until the ladies discovered that their "macho" has been shared by many of them, so they were angry and poisoned by the goodbye. Although Geraldine Page was somewhat old, she had managed to play as a school director, a woman who had more accidents in her life than good luck.
