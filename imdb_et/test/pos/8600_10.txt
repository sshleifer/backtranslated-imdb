In the light of the recent typhoon that struck the country hard (or onfoy Ondoy), I thought I was looking at "Black Rain" (1988, Japan), the haunting black-and-white masterpiece of Shohei Imamura during the destruction and after-effects of the atomic bomb that hit Hiroshima in the Second World War. The destruction and impact of both disasters (war and typhoon) can vary in degree and quality, but trauma and scar (physically and psychologically) still exist. <br /> <br /> It is a testimony to the power of the film that its images remain as strong and indelible as those they first saw. The only thing is that the difference in my case is that watching these pictures has taken on a feeling of greater sense and power, caused by an almost monumental accident. So there is a sense of kinship. <br /> <br /> Imamura has always been one of my favorite Japanese filmmakers. His films are always a joy to watch for his anarchy, sensuality and reputation: "Pornographers: Anthropology Introduction" (1966), "Eijanaika" (1981), "Warm Water Under the Red Bridge" (2001), His Two Palme d'Or Winners "Narayama Ballad" (1983) and "eel" (1997). Given the mood of his films, who would have thought he was once an assistant to Yasujiro Ozu, the toughest and minimalist filmmaker in Japan? But then, Ouzi's strict formality and homelyness, which Imamura rebelled. <br /> <br /> But when "Black Rain" is possible, Ozu can obviously feel the traces. A father (or father-figure) intending to see his daughter's marriage before the time runs out, and the silence and tranquility of the scenes that show all family members (especially dinner scenes or Ozu's) movie lexicon, tatami) is something that a revered master artist is constantly studying his work ("Tokyo Story", "Late Spring"). In principle, the "black rain" is a generally weak and deliberate quality of remarkable contrast to the Bachanan chaos and the instinctive drive of Imamura's entire filmography. <br /> <br /> However, this does not mean that watching a movie is not a totally unpleasant experience. "The Black Rain", as the American filmmaker Leonard Maltin correctly described, is "full of black and white images." In the first 15 minutes of the film, Imamura strikes to show one another the direct and graphic horrors of the nuclear bomb (rigidly burned bodies, flesh, walking dead, fires and debris everywhere, madness). Surely this attack is against the senses of spectators, along with Takashi Kawamata's evil photography (he made Yoshitaru Nomura's crime drama "Incident") and Toru Takemitsu's cooling (he made music in classics like Akira Kurosawa "Ran" and Masahiro Shinoda "Double Suicide") . <br /> <br /> Even during the presumed "peaceful" phase of the movie (ie, five years after atomic bombardment), there can still be no sense of satisfaction and order, with restlessness and pain still being felt by survivors, not just a lack of physical health, but rather psychological trauma and social stigma. The human race, which is now undeniably evident, is destined to be a legacy of the bomb as long as it lives. <br /> <br /> A few years ago, I wrote "Black Rain" (posted on IMDb.com), but only Volker Schlondorff's excellent "Tin Drum", another film about monumental human stories and a global catastrophe. Moreover, it has never been my practice to write twice about a movie I wrote earlier. In the light of our recent disaster that destroyed our country, I was asked to visit this remarkable Imamura film again and to rewrite it, because there are many lessons from both the film and the recent event about the shortcomings and dangers of scientific knowledge and activities and the widespread destruction (caused by human or nature). ) for long-term scars and wounds. <br /> <br /> Nuclear Weapons and Destruction Films ("Testament", "Threads", "The War Game", Everybody in Their Own Country), and "Black Rain" are among them, if not more, so undesirable and the amazing depiction of the individual and of the social disintegration caused by the destruction of the atom, and the fact that it is based on a historical event. <br /> <br /> Few weeks later, another Hollywood disaster, Roland Emmerich's "2012", will finally hit a big screen. As we all know, this is not an American director's "disaster / apocalypse" for "Independence Day", "Godzilla", "Day After Tomorrow" - for purposes other than mere entertaining value, without a true understanding of the nature and wisdom of the apocalyptic disaster and the condition of the injured person. I do not know how this "giant" movie could take advantage of the trauma, discomfort and fears that our people still experience due to the modern accident. If you say that this flick is a precaution, it would probably not be more than superfluous. <br /> <br /> But yes, I still look at "2012".
