The apolitical musicians Eva (Liv Ullmann) and Jan Rosenberg (Max von Sydow) have been married for seven years and live in a small farm on a remote island to escape the civil war on the continent. They offer lingenberry to a couple of customers to raise money and buy some supplies. They love each other and Eva is twenty years old and wants to be a child, but the reluctant Jan, a weak and sensitive person, doesn't want children. When the rebels arrive on the island, their peaceful and peaceful life turns to hell and they get into the middle of the accusations of both sides. When Colonel Jacob (Gunnar Bj√∂rnstrand) supplies Eva, Jan changes his behavior and becomes a cruel man and the love and affection they feel against each other for hatred and indifference. <br /> <br /> "Shame" is an antiwar champion Ingmar Bergman's film focused on a couple of artists who are apolitical and do not listen to news, but when the war arrives in their lands, they destroy the meaningless love, friendship and affection of soldiers. Liv Ullmann and Max von Sydow have the usual premiere and I can't remember seeing Liv Ullmann's chest in another movie. The process of quiet and sensitive Jan Rosenberg's brutality with war is impressive and the grim open conclusion is pessimistic and sufficient for a dramatic story. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Vergonha" ("Shame")
