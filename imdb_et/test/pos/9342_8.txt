Michael Jackson Thriller (1983) must be the greatest video ever made. Dude, you have zombies, gore and memorable tunes that you can still ask. John Landis blended the elements of the Living Dead Night and the American Werewolf in London and came from this video. What begins as a beautiful evening for a young couple literally becomes a day of hell. You have dancing zombies, a werewolf funky jacket and Vincent Price "rapping". A cool video for a song celebrated by all neighboring neighbors. You don't like it. <br /> <br /> Check "Thriller Making". There are some "interesting" things in the documentary.
