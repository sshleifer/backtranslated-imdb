Chinese Syndrome is a perfect pace thriller that is not at all slow or dull as some people say. Transitions from one scene to another are great and the tension in the film keeps you on the edge of your seat for two hours. Jack Lemmon is great, as always, because somewhat nervous operator and Jane Fonda are once again able to bring true emotions back. This film can be seen as a political statement of time or simply a thriller made intelligently. Either way, it's definitely worth it.
