About Bridgale's drama reporter, who discovers some flaws in nuclear power plant safety measures, is a well-directed and quite interesting film since the late 1970s. It's not amazing, but its strong, exemplary is pretty good, especially Jack Lemmon, but Douglas and Fonda were good. It was a pretty good scenario and Bridges's direction was solid and appropriate. This is certainly not one of the best films of the 1970s, but one of the best. Good early Michael Douglas movie and Lemmon's prime .--- IMDb Rating: 7.2, my rating:, in simple words, solid but not amazing ... what this film is, solid but not amazing 8/10
