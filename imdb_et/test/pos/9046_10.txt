This is classic Disney's best in live caricature! Bumbling College Student Dexter Riley (Kurt Russell) develops a mysterious liquid invisibility formula that actually makes items disappear and helps him save his money with a strapped college. Further experimentation shows that it also works amazingly for people! Riley's amazing discovery takes some fun twists as the notorious A.J. Arno (Cesar Romero) steals the formula and tries to use it less than for legitimate activities. Dazzling special effects and fast-paced story make this live movie college comedy tutorial! I love this movie! This film has always filled me with wonder and joy. Pleasant little comedy that the whole family can enjoy. It is not a lot of violence or sex and absolutely no fear of making the film that parents can watch with their children. Very good is one of Kurt Russell's films at Medvale College. A pleasant little series set for a healthy America before terrorists, when people appreciated integrity more than money! I highly recommend this movie!
