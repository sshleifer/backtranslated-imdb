James Cagney (The Yankee Doodle Dandy Boy) began his career and was able to perform as a gangster and also as a social worker for the Boys' Reform School, led by corrupt politicians. Detainees at the Reform School are juveniles from the streets of New York, such as "East Side Kids", who were poor and were not happy during the Great Depression. In the final scenes, the reform school boys' trial with burning torches and sheds is a great leap of fire and a corrupt caretaker. I noticed that they let the horses out of the ship. This movie is not shown very often and I really understand WHY!
