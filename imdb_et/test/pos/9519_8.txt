Wow .... it's been a long time since I've last seen such a fun movie like this !!!!! I've never been a big fan of French movies, but from the time I loved Catherine Deneuve's beauty and acting skills, I decided to see all her movies ... but I didn't think it was as fantastic as it turned out. Fortunately, I bought it, although I had doubts! It's a really good time movie with class and quality. There are some great social themes and moral dramas that are very close to today's modern lifestyle, which are very beautiful and realistic. I also liked the ballroom in the men's room! But my favorite is Catherine Deneuve's rather useless attempt to sing ... ... she brings it as she is, at the same time a lot of grace and modesty ... very tempting! Next, I would like to express my respect and admiration for Line Renaud, who played a fantastic role (I didn't even know he was acting .... I know him only for his music). So, don't wait any longer and watch the movie ... you can surprise in many ways.
