I haven't seen it since 1998 and I still can't get it out of my head and don't let people find it to show what it is like. <br /> <br /> Just a great story. br /> <br /> I hope to see the stairs at least once personally ... <br /> <br /> I didn't know much about Mr. Petersen before this movie, as I didn't see in his earlier works, but he exquisite action in this impression made me and I think his portrayal of Grissom in CSI just shows the same. He knows enough to let the character shine instead of the actor's appearance, which makes him a much better actor. <br /> <br /> I don't remember enough for "bad accents" to comment, but I have to say that I've always enjoyed Barbara Hershey in all my roles and I thought she did phenomenal work in this movie.
