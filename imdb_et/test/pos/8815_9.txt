This movie was fun. This gave a somewhat comic overview of the British club scene, which, if you really look at it, is a funny thing. The characters in this flick were so realistic for those who watched here with me that it was like watching a movie about myself. <br /> <br /> There were some important scenes that really made this movie. preparing scenes; "Send me a real doctor" scene; a white background scene showing every character that is broken, ending with a notorious line "What did I say?" and comenown-sunup scenes. I have lived these moments myself and found myself ridiculously hypersensitive to my ridiculous behavior. <br /> <br /> I can't give this movie 10 because it doesn't measure up to Groove, which I thought it wasn't in the world, but it certainly has moments. Mise-en-scene and camera work are great, special effects are worth noting and acting is fantastic. <br /> <br /> After waiting to see this movie, I'm glad to say I wasn't disappointed. I hope the writer / director would look more in the future.
