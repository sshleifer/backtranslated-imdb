Great movie in many aspects. Vicente Aranda has managed to imagine the time (1830) carefully. Light, places, feeling, is perceived perfectly from the beginning of the film. And with it - as opposed to what happened to "Mad Love" (Juana la Loca), a rather episodic historical film - all this beautiful photography / music / clothing - is surrounded by a very liquid scenario that reaches its peak in the only possible way. is Paz Vega, who is Carmen, outstanding: liar, seductive, aggressive, totally sexual, so beautiful Carmen. Sbaraglia is somewhat less convincing for the audience because of his immediate mad love for Carmen, but he succeeds in delivering the right tragic mood to the entire film. I recommend it to everyone: the best Spanish film of the year.
