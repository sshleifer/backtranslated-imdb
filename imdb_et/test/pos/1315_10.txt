This is a film that should be seen and treated as a work of art. This is the beloved love of Schrader's brothers for the life of Yukio Mishima, which is truly truly artistic. The film jumps from black to black, to the past to the present, Mishima's fictional works for him. All without confusion. The only thing that gets me is that the whole movie, except the parts told by the narrator, is in Japanese. Still a masterpiece that deserves the audience but has not won. The criterion, if you read it, is the film that should be included with as many extras as you can. This movie truley deserves more. 10/10
