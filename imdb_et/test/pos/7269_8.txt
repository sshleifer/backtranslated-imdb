I've been waiting since last October to see this movie! (it had to come out of October 98) and now I've finally seen that I'm not disappointed. Bloody wonderful! OK was slow at first, but when it went, it's a very exciting nail bite for Robert Carly, both from Gaza and "The Full Monty" and Begbie in "Trainspotting", so hard to recognize! And Johnny Lee Miller, who no longer has a fine hair sick boy, plays his foolish gentlemen's highway with better humor and sensitivity, so it's easy to see why Liv Tylers Rebecca falls for him. Great movie. As Hades in Disney's "Hercules" would say, "Two thumbs up!"
