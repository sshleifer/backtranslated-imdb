The extraordinary rendition is a surprisingly admissible scary practice under Clinton, which allows the US government to seize and hold anyone suspected of being a terrorist against the United States for any reason. This is an extraordinary issue, especially after September 11, because supporters of practice always criticize the opposition as a vital power of the US for the effective fight against terrorism. The fanatical supporters themselves mark the opposition as terrorists. <br /> <br /> But like the recent film that gave life to a death-like humanity, David Gale's life, the story shows us the story of abusive rendition abusive, or at least the ease with which it can be used and misused. The story includes Anwar El-Abrahim, an Egyptian-born American chemical engineer, who is arrested in Egypt for a lecture back to America. The reason is that he called a known terrorist. No evidence has been given (or required) that it was Anwar who called that his phone was never stolen. Meanwhile, Anwari's extremely pregnant woman Isabella has returned to countries that are trying to find her husband frantically, who came to Chicago on an airplane, but apparently never got it. The weak explanation that he was never there is evaporated when he discovers that he made his credit card purchase. Recently, I have studied modern Chinese history, especially Mao Tse-tung created an amazingly selfish and brutal dictatorship, and it is more than frightening to see the similarities of extraordinary rendition and some of Mao's cruel intimidation tactics, including his public executions (which people were forced to follow) and extensive. Use of torture specifically used to remove "confessions". <br /> <br /> It is quite disturbing to note that Mao did these things to create an environment of fear to achieve Chinese obedience. If we say that the Bush administration has not created fear for the environment and continues to throw this milk, it would be extremely naive and, although Bush's extraordinary rendition was not created, it is clear that it is doing more harm than good. Adding film thickness is Douglas Freeman (Jake Gyllenhaal), who works behind the desk behind the CIA and has little experience until his boss is murdered and suddenly finds himself subjected to torture by someone he hesitates, has something to uncover. The daughter of Fatima (Freeman's boss) also plays an important role, as does Peter Sarsgaard's playwright who may have the most satisfying role in the film. Meryl Streep is also a Cold and Clinical Cold Senator, who supports dogmatically the necessity and practice of transfer. <br /> <br /> Like a political thriller, this movie is very remarkable and pace. But the most frightening thing is that it's all real. The purpose of the film is to really make people think about things made in the name of America, especially when they say that these same things are being prevented. For the sake of preventing terrorism, terror cannot express our compassion and does not support despair through brutal torture, which is the main form of criminal investigation. Unfortunately, we are gradually moving in this direction, rather than doing less. The frightening question is what is the event that will happen at some point in the future to persuade us to stop and lead the way, civilization and peace, or will we just proceed to military dictatorship until we finally arrive there?
