Stooges are back and more fun than ever. "Brideess's Groom" was, in my opinion, probably the best shempti. <br /> <br /> Shemp has the chance to inherit $ 500,000 from his dead uncle (which was probably more than a million dollars compared to today). BUT! There's a catch. He has to marry someone one day. Shemp is a bachelor teacher who doesn't have too many admirers except one high-level aggressive annoying singer student. But he doesn't want him, he wants somebody a little more of Victoria's secret model-type women. But obviously he has no choice because he is not himself Collin Ferre. But when it is printed on paper that he must inherit all that money when he is married, his former girlfriends are attacking "I want my husband back"! <br /> <br /> What a great stooge! It is there for all the winners of the gifts! <br /> <br /> 9/10
