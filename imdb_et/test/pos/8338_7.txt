The sale of Charles "Chic" is absolutely terrible as the only member of the Leeds family who wants to acknowledge the gangster when they saw the murder of the police and the informant. He fought in the Bull Rune in the civil war and his patriotism goes high, even after beating his son and one of his grandsons robbing the gang, intimidating all other members. He says the fear of his grandchild's death is not. He doesn't want his grandson to live in the country where the gangsters run. The conflict with citizenship and personal security is a stark home to this Oscar candidate story. Walter Huston is also a standout attorney for a heavy-duty driving range, threatening the family if they are not refused detention in court. The rest, including the sliding killer, Ralph Ince, are all excellent and directed by William A. Wellman. It's also a good relationship because Sales will disappear as the trial begins.
