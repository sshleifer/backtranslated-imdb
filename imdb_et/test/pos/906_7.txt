This is Laurel's and Hardy's comedy, which has some great and funny moments, but generally the film is just a little too much of just one comic assumption. <br /> <br /> This movie's basic premise is very simple Stan Laurel didn't wear pants. Laurel plays a Scottish na√Øve young person who arrives in America completely. For some reason he gets the spotlight because he and his uncle, played by Oliver Hardy, thinks his time is to put some pants on Philip. also a bit tiring after a while. Although the film also has its comical moments of excitement, it is also a long way off from many of Laurel's and Hardy's comedy shorts that are still around. The film is simply too simple to be considered one of the biggest, although it is certainly the most fined one, much. <br /> <br /> Great fun, just something too remarkable or memorable. /> <br /> 7/10
