That's how I got it together! There were others who said that Naked Gun will meet James Bond. I think it's more accurate to me, but I'm not neutral at this point ...; o) <br /> <br /> This movie is a blast of the past. It reminds you of old movies (since the 50s and 60s) and it's not just because it plays during this period (exact 1955, but also a rebound exception), but it's the mood that the movie is made and shows on the screen! Here is the main actor (who is very popular in my country, France), which is perfect here. He is a spy with number 117. There is one sign that puts him in the movie, asking if he's good or not ... you see the movie! It is very funny and if you like your spies to mix comedy with old school elegance, but don't take yourself or anything else for this matter seriously if you need it! : o)
