Who should watch this movie? Anyone who has ever taken acid, read Philip K. Dick, thought Matrix's premise was better than special effects, interested in philosophy, or that their sense of reality would be confusing. I laughed at the movie loudly, just because it was so embarrassing and so on the spot. This movie is great. This film is cool. It's better than a matrix with a long shot (I did not sleep in Existenz to launch: action / special effects movies to me stupid and, despite the plausible philosophical gloss, that's the matrix). Existenz is tough, it's annoying and funny. David Cronenberg has done some shonky things (Rabid) and some gene works (videodrome is another thing worth seeing, as is Stephen King's customization The Dead Zone). But this is one of my all-time favorites. I don't remember the end that is good, that is, I can look at it again. Or I didn't watch this movie at all. Maybe it's an implanted memory. Or maybe it happened to me. I do not know. In any case, it is seamlessly sewn into my general illusion of reality, and I'm glad.
