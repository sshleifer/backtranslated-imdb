This is a movie I watched when I was a young girl and never forgot. Certainly it is never the best film ever made, but there is something very special that I can't put my finger on. I love it. I am the kind of person I like to explain to me, and only because of this crazy film. What exactly / who is this mysterious witch-lady and what is her relationship with Tom? WHY AND HOW did he become a Water Baby ... why was he lifted up on earth? These are the questions that just eat me! I thought when I read the book, I get answers, but I just read an article with a book based on "very different". So I think I never know what the writer was thinking! <br /> <br /> I still love this movie and I recently watched it with my two-year-old niece. She loves it even when she calls me to call it "Baby Water" for reasons unknown to me. She loves the part she jumps in the water and then says, "I'm all clean." (You have to realize that my niece is the cleanest 2 year old in the world!) We looked at this scene over and over again. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad we can enjoy this movie together! There should be more such movies. (But what is homosexual? !!)
