From time to time, a film comes together that forces one to think about the reaction of society to people who differ in their usual definition. <br /> <br /> Mitthi has suffered from social elements, leaving alone to cope with his tragedy in his idyllic world ... one that he says is a real world ..... Surreal (The Mitthi World) places itself in the real world. Mitthi suffering from schizophrenia forces us to reconsider our priorities on how to restore patients like them. Do we have the right to take them back to our reality when all we have to offer is pain and suffering? What right do we have to take them from their source of happiness? What should we take away from our joy if we cannot help them in their sadness? 15 Park Avenue is one of the best films on social issues ... shows us the need for every patient to have empathy, not just compassion.
