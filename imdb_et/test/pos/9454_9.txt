I thought that the movie was completely flat on the basis of the ads in the theaters. When my sister loaned a friend, I decided to watch it because it was summer and there was nothing else to do. . hasn't said in the movie for ten minutes and I loved it. Amanda was a great actor in the film, her comic timing was perfect. The man playing Duke was hot, plain and simple. My favorite scene was definitely when Amanda walks from a gardener and a fellow student who suspects her and she talks to her mother about dresses - as she pretends to be a man! I watched this part over and over again ... to make a short story, the movie I thought was flat - I now embrace it.
