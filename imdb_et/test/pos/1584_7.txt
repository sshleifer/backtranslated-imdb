I heard for the first time from the Commanders' Log when I was in agreement with local science fiction. Craig Bowlsby, Linden Banks, Sophie Banks and Brian Oberquell came out to show the video and give a couple of panels a television budget for making a flower. I have to say that I was very pleased when I finally had the opportunity to see this example. Comparisons with the red dwarf are inevitable, as the first seasons of the red dwarf were made with a small budget (although the commander's log must set a record for the minimum amount of money it takes per minute), and thus the lack of "eye candy" must be compensated by good writing and action. Linden Banks, who plays Chief Petty Officer Blather, is doing a very good job of presenting a serious but helpless person. <br /> <br /> Bowlsby's original idea was that the story would be spoken in two minutes in "interstitial", which would be shown in the evening between other exhibitions, although for some reason Space could not have been there if the idea had been and so the interstitials would all be rolled into one for an hour that Space usually showed in half for half an hour. The existing DVD does not contain episode 3 (which was premiered in Cascadia-Con in Seattle in 2005) or episode 4 (which was viewed in VCON in Vancouver in 2006), but if you have contacted the local Fannish community, you may catch news from some of the exhibitions around you.
