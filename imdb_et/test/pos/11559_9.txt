I would like to know if anyone knows how to get a copy of the film "The Way of the World". It has been around 30 years since I've seen this movie and I would like to see it again. Earth's wind and fire cross the nation all over the world with its inspiring music and themes. Unfortunately, this group was not a colleague at the beginning of the 1970s, but as mentioned earlier, there was a racial tension in the United States that banned the equal exposure of African-American musical groups. It is good to see that the wind and fire of the Earth will continue to succeed. I'd like to add this movie to my collection. Someone please help me if possible. Thank you for your attention.
