after my daughter was born in 1983, I have to lose weight. I tried a 20-minute workout and I was hooked. I lost about 50 pounds. it was the greatest weight I've ever lost in my life. I can't believe this show is forgotten. it would be a blessing when you started strictly for cable TV for your workout and included a 20-minute workout. I think it was once the best training video. I wish I could buy it somehow and somewhere. routines were easy to learn and you did quite sweat. The trainings they have today are too complicated and too hard to learn. please do your best to get this video in circulation. I pray that it is a blessing to anyone who sees and uses it.
