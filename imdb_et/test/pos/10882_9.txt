This game is not exactly the best N64 game. Of course, this is good, but only if there are 4 players. Without 4 players, the only fun thing to do is take the farms and see how many people you can kill. But half of this game is the levels where you have to rescue Natalya, so you have to limit the use of your mines at these levels and it will be quite boring. The graphics do not reach exactly Super Mario 64 or even Mario Kart 64 levels. And if you're talking to a first-person shooter with a big multiplayer, you'll have to go to Perfect Dark. At least you can play "multiplayer" yourself.
