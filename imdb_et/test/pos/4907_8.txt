"Four daughters" introduced John Garfield to the audience, and it is remembered most about this film today. Unlike some of the films that appear in several films before the screen gels were created, Garfield immediately slammed into his mouth and spoke out of his mouth and talked about the fate that was against him. <br /> <br /> It's actually four stories of girls, their widow's father (Claude Rains) and their different judges, one of whom, Felix, plays with beautiful Jeffrey Lynn. He's the one they all have, but he's in love with Buffi (Priscilla Lane). Then he meets Miss-Mickey Borden, who also belongs to him. When Buff realizes that one of his sisters is in love with Felix, he leaves the altar and marries Mickey. <br /> <br /> This is a fairly formal story that gives life (and descendants) to the actors. Garfield has already been mentioned, but Priscilla Lane was the strongest daughter, the most interesting and the best actor. Jeffrey Lynn was a fresh and good-looking leading man, and this film got on the right foot with a warning device. But there was no real certainty. Like many other ages, he went to service and when he came out he had a bronze star, but not much of a career. Later he went to television and real estate. Claude Rains is warm and wonderful as a patriarch. <br /> <br /> So popular was "Four daughters" that inspired "Four Women" and "Four Mother", and reunite a large part of "Girls". Bold "where actors acted differently. <br /> <br /> A very enjoyable, pleasant memory of simpler and probably happier times and a chance to see John Garfield in his first movie.
