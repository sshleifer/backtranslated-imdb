When I read the second comment on this great TV show, I felt I had a few things in balance. If you like murders, have a signature and a series, and your police officers are British and shout a lot, and gore is bloody and have a religious inclination, then it hits every button. Not quite enough to scream Sweeney to rare heights, but otherwise it's highly appreciated. Ken Stott is great because "policeman on the edge" and guest stars are well cast, including Edward Woodward and Art Malik. Recommended. (In response to previous comments, although I agree that "red" would not hit "normal" hits and runs, he had just seen his brother arrest for murder and I'm pretty sure he can't see the boy's move.)
