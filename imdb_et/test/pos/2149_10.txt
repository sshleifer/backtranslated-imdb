I saw this movie on 23rd of August in Santa Monica and it has stayed with me. I want to thank the filmmakers for digging Harry's mysterious, eccentric, life details. And also to show Nilsson's mistakes and flaws. Thank you for showing good and bad, ups and downs and revealing this amazing BBC material. The film is also a great exhibition of a large number of Nilsson's music, which is really well placed throughout the film. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves good documentaries, especially if you are interested in Harry Nilsson or the early 70s. Some Ain't It Cool website reviewer wrote that it was the best film they saw at the Santa Barbara Film Festival, and I believe it. The film is informative, funny, sad, touching and full of fantastic music. It succeeds at all levels. Really, really good.
