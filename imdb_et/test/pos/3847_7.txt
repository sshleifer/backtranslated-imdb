Walt Disney's 20th animation feature was the last one that the great man himself blessed green (he died at the end of 1966) and is generally not considered to be the best result. The main problem is that the film appears to be either LADY and TRAMP (1955) or 101 DALMATIONS (1961) cats. Both are definitely loved by fans. and a cat lover, I dug this reasonably bouncing medium where a pampered female cat (expressed by Eva Gabor) and her three little kittens are thrown into the streets of Paris by a wealthy lady (Hermione Baddeley). Fortunately, they meet a street-sloping cat (Phil Harris) who drives them back while driving and is assisted by a feline jazz band (led by Scatman Crothers) and two useful and rewarding dogs; at the same time, Edgar Butler at home celebrates his supposed legacy, and the mouse and horse make their own contribution to helping their spouses. The legendary entertainer Maurice Chevalier went back to old age to sing the title song (which also contains a verse in French) and the Scatman ensemble gave the mood to "Ev'rybody wants to be a cat".
