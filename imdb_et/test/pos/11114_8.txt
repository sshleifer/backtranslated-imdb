While at first glance this film looks like your older high school life (and many people are trying to tell you that this movie is out of date) ... and I admit it was my first impression ... but honestly, heroes / heroine lessons are def . NOT expired. Who doesn't want to be famous? And who doesn't want to be accepted by my companions? And a homosexual guy - is there no gay marriage today, blah, blah? However, this film, released in the 80s, is still dealing with the biggest problems of today's world. However, this film has too much embarrassment and nudity for my taste. (so 8/10 rating)
