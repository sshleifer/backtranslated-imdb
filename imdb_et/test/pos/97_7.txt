Well, I have to briefly agree with Leonard Maltin about this animation. She loves it and claimed it was fun. I enjoyed it but didn't see humor. She doesn't even like ice hockey and knows nothing about it and loved it. I've been living right on the border of Canada for 50 years, both in hockey and in Buffalo. Oh, it was interesting and I know what would happen if the Toronto jersey disaster in the Quebec area! This is especially true for Les Canadians' glorious years. But it doesn't make the story funny. In the 1950s, the Montreal Canadians were all idolized in the provinces of Quebec and their star-playman Maurice Richard and everyone wanted to be like him. When her mother orders a new sweater, she has the emblem of the Toronto Maple Leaf, so the child doesn't want to catch her dead. his hockey buddies. What's so funny? I saw the same thing with Boston, who is the red Sox, and his mother gets him a Yankees shirt! Fears! You couldn't wear it and vice versa. <br /> <br /> Maybe for someone who doesn't do sports like Maltin, this situation seems strange and humorous to him ... but it's a fact of life or a bit-time sports fan and his favorite team. It was an interesting story and completely believable, but not something that made me laugh. <br /> <br /> The art was fun to look at, almost like a talented schoolgirl who made a series of long crayons. . The French Canadian accent was also good. This movie was part of the DVD "Leonard Maltin's animation favorites from the Canadian National Film Office.
