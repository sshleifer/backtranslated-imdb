Having received a copy of the Bostocks Cup, I have to admit that it's not as funny as I originally thought! It's better !!!!! Charlie Williams ... eat your heart out. Confirming matches ???? Never! Tilt angle 45%? Ronnie and Reggie Kay? George Best? Coach Driver, who thinks Pontefract is located in South Wales (it's all Ponty and Ponty) Bertie Masson (Tim Healey) happy cup !! (not that he is tricky) Sugar Plum Fairy ????? Confused ???? Look at it again. The innovative use of the actual material with Bostock players was brilliant and the manufacturer should be proud of MASTERPIECE. Come to ITV to make viewers and serve themselves - show it again!
