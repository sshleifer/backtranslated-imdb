I saw it on television years ago when I remember, but never forgot Sammy Davis, Jr., I just thought I was looking for this video. This Porgy and Bess transfer is a treasure. I would like to see it again and introduce it to my son. I just can't imagine why it wasn't announced as one of the greatest performances by Sammy Davis, Jr. Anyone who is responsible for not being passed on to the public should be ashamed of his ignorance. I'm looking for it in the future. Perhaps the drama responsible for such things will come to realize the forgotten work of so many African-American actors.
