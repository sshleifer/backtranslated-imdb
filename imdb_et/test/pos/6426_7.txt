Alice (Florinda Bolkan), an Italian-speaking interpreter, discovers that she has a memory loss and cannot recall the last few days. He will follow the traces of memory material that will take him to the small town of Garma. The inhabitants of the city know him and he suspects that the astronauts' repetitive crusts carrying out terrible experiments are related to his own amnesia. <br /> <br /> The film is interesting and the plot is good, but it's a bit slow and tasty for my taste. The plot has some nice twists and it is really hard to find out where it is. Florinda Bolkan is good in her role (but even better in "Flavia herese") and it is always nice to see "star" child artist Nocoletta Elmi. However, Klaus Kinski's role is too small. It is not a movie for a hard-to-do whore or exploitation addict, but still a very nice hour and a half mystery.
