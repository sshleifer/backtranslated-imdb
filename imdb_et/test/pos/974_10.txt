I can watch this movie ALL DAY! I love it. Probably my favorite movies. By the way, "badger1970" is some parts of a bad language, not too bad, but it is not exactly a G-rating. Great movie !!!!! I recommend it to everyone. In some way, it makes me write 10 lines of text, so I will continue to write until it allows me to post this comment. Okay ... Still typing ... It gets annoying. Ugh. I have four more to go. Anyway, SEE THIS MOVI! Even if you have already seen it. I don't care! Is it another 10 lines? No. Only two more lines are left. I don't even know why he wants it. I think I'm ready. Wait, I don't, SORRY, people. I know it tortures me. I think you don't have to read this comment ... But you should, because I wrote it. I'm probably done now. Finally.
