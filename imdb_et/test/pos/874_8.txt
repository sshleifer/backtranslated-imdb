I have slowly collected both Catherine Deneuve and Francois Truffaut's DVD. Both the actor and the director have made some stinkers during their time - fortunately, the Mississippi mermaid is not one of them. <br /> <br /> Beside the "soft skin" that randomly looks at Deneuve's sister (late Francoise Dorleac) must be my favorite Truffu film. <br /> <br /> Truffaut also wrote a manual. Something that always strikes me with Truffu is his almost childish story of innocence - it can be called almost naive. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, there is a scene where Belmondo returns to Lyon's apartment with looting. He calls the doorbell and Deneuve is negative. At a time when Belmondo comes to the room from the street, Deneuve turns into his dress, puts his best pair of stockings and shoes on, then stays on the bed and pretends he's sleeping. This is a scene that can almost originate from the child's mind - but it's Truffaut for you. <br /> <br /> Watching Catherine Deneuve in the late 1960s is indeed a sensory joy. She is so extraordinarily beautiful that we have almost pain. By the way, for these fans, in this movie, there are a couple of surprising scenes - indeed sinful pleasure. <br /> <br /> I disagree with previous posters. I don't see anything "Hitchcockian" about the movie at all. As for its "appearance", I love the look of older films used in the 60s. Certainly, this time films will give a unique look. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for Deneuve and Truffaut fans ......
