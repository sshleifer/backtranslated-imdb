I watched it on the second night at the local station because I didn't feel like "American Idol". Peter Strauss gives an excellent presentation of the convicted "Rain" Murphy, who keeps himself. He admits his crime and does not make bones that he does not feel ashamed. His cell has bare comforts that other inmates have like books and pictures. The only time he knows in another zone is working. He does it often and can drive a mile below four minutes. When a college coach hears it, he wants to hit him at the Olympics. First, "Rain" does not want this part, but when his best friend is killed, he shows interest. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie, a period. Strauss is very good (what did you expect, nothing less?) And Michael Mann shows clues about the size that will come full of prosperity later. This film had such a reality (probably because it was filmed among convicted persons). It almost seems like this was a real story. Additional casting is good. There are also many notable names like Brian Dennehy, Roger E. Mosley and Richard Moll. <br /> <br /> My heart sank when a pompous board didn't let her run because she didn't feel bad about her crime. His last act made me stand up and rejoice. When they took their dreams, they took them back. It was back when the TV movies were really good. Jericho Mile is the pearl of the film. ESPN Classic, HOW TO TAKE A FILM !!!
