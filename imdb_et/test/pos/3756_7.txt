I've only seen this movie when it was shown on television, but I remember it 15 years later that it should say something about it. I thought it was a smart look at school, friendship, bullying, and its impact on adult life. <br /> <br /> The title really refers to how good or bad sport can bring you the lowest low or you are tolerant of school clicks and even later in adulthood if you enjoy it - it's set in a private school in England, but that can be everywhere. <br /> <br /> The main character in the games is bad, looking for retribution later in life, which culminates in a climate conflict cricket. I have to admit that I finished the end - it was powerful and sad.
