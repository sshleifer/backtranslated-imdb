Formula For Murder is not known as Giallo, but that doesn't mean it's not very good! The film is directed by Alberto De Martino, a man behind the cult classic, such as the Antichrist and Blazing Magnum. The film was released late in the Giallo cycle, but it is more than many of the golden periods that appeared in the early 1970s. In spite of the lack of logic in some regions, the film works mainly with a competent way that mixes Argento-style death scenes with the twists of some truly surprising parcels and a number of well-defined characters. The film may not be as exciting as many other genre films; but it is more than a compensated, sure way that the central situation is fed to the audience and the resulting tension. At the beginning of the plot, a false priest rape a young girl, named Joanna, before she pushes her down, is shown. Then we move for several years and the girl is now a woman who is unfortunately in a wheelchair. Craig trains her for a sports event; a man who also has his romantic design. But Joanna's personal assistant, who also has a romantic design for her, does not judge her proposal. <br /> <br /> The film has a half-twist on the film, which forms the backbone of the film, and although it's not exactly logical; It's a good watch and tips to make you an interesting movie. Director Alberto de Martino is probably not afraid of some unheard of gore scenes, the best of which on this film is the priest whose spider is dead - and I personally do not hesitate to call this sequence one of my favorite Giallo murder scenes! The plot may occasionally be somewhat uneven, but in general it is very good. The filmmaker spends eternity at the end of the film; but it is completely tense and the way it plays is good because it takes advantage of all the plot points that have passed before. The musical result from Fulci The New York Ripper works well in this film and, in violation of Giallo's tradition, De Martino's film also features some pretty good actors from veteran David Warbeck and Christina Nagy, the only feature film. All in all, this film is not the easiest to meet Giallo; but it's worth watching and it is recommended for fans of such a movie.
