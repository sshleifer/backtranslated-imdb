Instead of going ahead and making a real film about drugs in the city of Windy, contrarian director Otto Preminger decided to go in the opposite direction and make his film as artificial as he could, against the men's fashion. Kazan, Huston and Zinnemann, who made their pictures all over the world. Nelson Algren, whose novel is based on the film, continued to despise it. What marveled was this Preminger and why did he do that? <br /> <br /> The sets in this movie are so small to recommend Mr. Magoo's comics. Drug Propulsion Louie is dressed to recall what a gangster is Mad magazine artists. Arnold Stang, the wonderful comedian he was, seems to be inappropriate in such a serious picture, and his appearance, accompanied by an exaggerated and exaggerated baseball cap, creates laughter. Robert Strauss, the second best-known actor in humorous roles, is also inappropriate as his big, strongly consoled face and Runyonesque lines seem more suitable for Jerry Lewis. Against all of them, Frank Sinatra, Kim Novak and Eleanor Parker have to work overtime to keep the viewer chewing. Sinatra is a nervous and manic that refers to a person who is easily ill, so it is perfectly suited to the role of a drug addict. Miss Novak, a plant-like and sublimely corpse, is sympathetic and seems to be an artificial product of the fine slums she loves in the film. Parker is pure Hollywood and very laborious, like paralyzed and cunning Zosch. He's never convincing, but it's not a movie either. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in realizing the real life of drug users in America. Caligari alone makes it incredible. Preminger may have tried a dream effect because cardboard backgrounds give the procedures a surreal feeling of a nightmare operetta, perhaps reflecting on the early days of Preminger Vienna.
