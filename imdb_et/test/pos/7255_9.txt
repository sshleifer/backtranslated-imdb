When I went to a video rental store, back when the DVD was still unknown to me, I had seen all the movies I wanted in the shop or I thought! The man behind the team told me he had something I would definitely like. He gave me "Plunkett and MacLeane". First of all, I doubted that it was good, but I trusted her advice and ... man, I'm sure I'm happy to take this jewel! This is one of the best adventure films of the years when you ask me! Of course, if Robert Carlyle has a big part, how bad can a movie get? Certainly, Liv Tyler once again does what he has good and nothing more: being beautiful. However, it is still very clear that the film was probably a lot of fun.
