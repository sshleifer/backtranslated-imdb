After seeing quite a few times since his release in 1995, and reading the reader's comments (mostly from Jane Tennison's background and Helen Mirren's great role in it), I am more than ever collided. Robert Glenister Chris Hughes plays a brilliant role. Even after 10 years, it is still one of the most reliable ways to portray a complicated personality of a child's offender who carries the weight of his past. Watching the episode after an hour and a half will keep you constantly exchanged between the feelings of love and hate the man who hates his gravity. I've seen the biggest roles of my favorite actor, but I never get the most impression. Helen Mirren would never be bright without these amazing actors. Thanks to Robert Glenister!
