Like those who listened to radio reports about the Pearl Harbor attack, anyone who has ever seen PINK FLAMINGOS can say exactly where they were when they first saw it - and about thirty years later this movie is one of the most pointless harsh, unpleasant , reluctant and fun funny movies that have ever been put on celluloid, guarantee the strongest stomach and heavier funny bones testing. around, PINK FLAMINGOS talks about two families competing for the tabloid title "Filthiest People Alive". Just how dirty are they? Much: The movie contains everything from sex with chickens to what I can only describe in the form of remarkable rectal control to help dog-doo, and I guarantee you don't want to eat eggs for at least several weeks. It's either wonderful, cruel or amazing. wonderful, depending on how you look at it. The star, of course, is divine ... and describe the divine as the planet's greatest dragon queen would be an underestimation of the year. He is a mammoth creature given to BIG's eyeball, BIG's orange hair, and BIG expressions. With amazing real-life buyers taking a walk along the Baltimore sidewalks it is both indescribable and unimaginably funny. Others are cast by Mary Vivian Pearce, Danny Mills and the ever-terrible Edith Massey as members of the divine family; and Mink Stole and David Lochary as a white-slaving, baby-selling couple who challenge divine status. <br /> <br /> It should be quite obvious that PINK FLAMINGOS is not just a movie that turns to everyone, and viewers who know director John Waters only through later films like HAIRSPRAY and CRYBABY are for big jols. But if you want to see something completely different that even Monty Python couldn't imagine it, it's a movie for you. Just make sure you eat before you see it, because you probably don't want to eat later - and you may want the barf bag to be available just in case. <br /> <br /> Gary F.
