I found this film to be one of the best for this time and age. The cast was very extraordinary and most interesting to anyone who saw it. I would like my younger generation to have seen this movie, but I haven't seen or seen the movie before. My first viewing was back in the early sixties and I've been looking for it every year. The film showed me the potential for how far we go to become a gifted craftsman, where we would only have a meaningless role that would serve as buffalo and servants. <br /> <br /> Porky and Bess showed some of their neighborhood lives when I saw it at a time when I needed good solid male models. Singing and Dancing I was skipping the days, playing different characters in this great movie.
