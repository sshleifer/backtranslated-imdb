Turkish culture is full of different cultures. different cultures have different styles of music. Istanbul is like a turkey mixture. it usually has the same language but different dialects. this documentary shows us various different dialects and different instruments. You can watch stories with singers and groups, their performances, everyday life and learn their thoughts about music. the film not only contains Istanbul music, but also life in Istanbul, how people communicate and what they eat and drink. a surprising part though i live in Istanbul, I learned a lot of things from this movie.
