Wolfgang Petersen (Das Boot, Air Force One) gives us an exciting movie where awards go to supportive actor John Malkovich. His criminal, who tried to murder the president, was first-rate and credible. <br /> <br /> This does not mean reducing the efforts of Clint Eastwood and Rene Russo, or even Fred Dalton Thompson, who plays the White House Headquarters. Eastwood was great, and I love all the movies that Russo has. <br /> <br /> The movie features original Oscar winning five times (Mal√®na, Bugsy, The Untouchables, The Mission, Heaven Days) by Ennio Morricone. That alone makes your time worthwhile.
