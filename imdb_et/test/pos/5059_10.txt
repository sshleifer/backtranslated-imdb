Let's start with all of our comments with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 films a year over the last 15 years. Recently we were honored to receive a free movie from any newspaper on the live movie! So we see what we want. The idea is that CRITICS takes zero. Your local critics or national critics, like Ebert, do not really differ from you or me. The only difference is that they can write a movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies, whether they want or not. Therefore, our conviction is that if you get your money for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! NEVER IS ANY QUESTION by critics. We care only about our friends and the ones we know about the same things as us. That's good enough. <br /> <br /> When Meryl Streepis director of the NSC says, "The United States is not tortured," the film was very laughing. Of course, it is wrong that the Bush administration has repeatedly refused. This is a very good movie and it is scary what they can do to us when we lose all of our civil rights. They can just "grab" everywhere and say they have done it. In this case, they grab a man with a similar name to those who killed thousands on 9-11. He is, of course, like you or me. And so they take him to secret locations outside the US to torture and spend. <br /> <br /> Very scary. Jake and Reese worked well, and the cast worked well.
