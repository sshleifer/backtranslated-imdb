Well, I'm not going to add this film to "proclaimed". <br /> <br /> Everything I can add is NOT even timing the "historical" picture. Unlike "Braveheart", "Titanic" or "The Patriot", all of them have very credible and serious historical changes that are only intended to be a theatrical effect (possibly the worst apology). <br /> <br /> Have everyone had a sense of humor? <br /> <br /> Everything I can add is a paraphrase of the good captain of Macleane - 'It looked <br /> <br /> fantastic and we have a bloody good smile. <br /> <br /> - One last point. I am astonished that there are comments on "contemporary music" in the historical environment. I don't know if the same people made the same decision about Moulin Rouge. I don't recommend it.
