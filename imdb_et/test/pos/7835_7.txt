Let's take one thing straight, it gives 7 out of 10 not on a regular scale, but on a bad movie. this is the movie you rent to rent, where you deliberately walk, knowing that it is a scary knock and everyone else. <br /> <br /> I went to the movie with one promise that there is a snake on the train and it gives! <br /> <br /> Gore is really good and characters have a fantastic role. Come on now, it's all from stoned train pilots to teenage girls who trade drugs, even an electrician who gets his pimp! You will see some topless nudity, explosions, snakes, gore and the main Mexican line that runs around your girlfriend, hitting your crack tube and blowing smoke in your face! As I mentioned and many others are, the movie's pace is off a bit, but still respectable. Such films keep our group's tradition of bundling together, and everybody beat the waist or two to look at masterpieces like this. There's no better time to enjoy a good movie. <br /> <br /> It could learn something or you like other alien locks or Boa vs Python, but these are some great shoes to complete. <br /> <br /> Solid 7 out of 10.
