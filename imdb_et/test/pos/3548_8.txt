10 respected directors took the short film with operative arias for inspiration (and music). I'll do it separately: <br /> <br /> Nicolas Roeg (dir) - Giuseppe Verdi (music). The story of a murder attempt in Vienna in 1931. Theresa Russell (Woman of Rough) plays a man! Not bad - very beautiful and exotic. Russell is great. <br /> <br /> Charles Sturridge - Verdi. There is no story, but there are some haunting black and white images that are perfect for music. Jean-Luc Godard - Jean Baptiste Lully. Dreadful. Pointless, boring, not a plot, nothing. Filled with a woman's nudity. Worst! <br /> <br /> Julien Temple - Verdi. Buck Henry, Beverly D'Angelo, and Anita Morris celebrate this funny, if obvious, story about a cheating couple. Pretty good. <br /> <br /> Bruce Beresford - Erich Korngold. Short, lush and romantic. Very good. Robert Altman - Jean-Philippe Rameau. Tuim. Yawner. <br /> <br /> Fran Roddam - Richard Wagner. That's Bridget Fonda in the film. Beautifully made love story with quite explicit gender. <br /> <br /> Ken Russell - Giacomo Puccini. Really weird but OK. <br /> <br /> Derek Jarman - Gustave Chapentier. Lyrical look at youth and old age. Very sweet. <br /> <br /> The last one is Bill Bryden, who makes "I Pagliacci". He is John Hurt (!), Who is dressed in a clown lipstick Carusole (!!!). <br /> <br /> When it came out, it got almost X-grade (rich in nudity and sex). It was given R, accompanied by a rigorous warning stating that the R-rating is being implemented heavily. After the bombing of the film, this warning disappeared. <br /> <br /> The idea is not bad and 6 out of 10 segments were worth. It is worth noting even if you do not like the opera. Just avoid the Godard segment. I'll give her 8.
