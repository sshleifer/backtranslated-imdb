Great, Chris Diamantopoulos must be the best Robim Williams I have seen. He works great. It was like watching Robim Williams when he was and was. It almost made me cry look at her. <br /> <br /> I had no idea Robin was such a close friend to John Belush as he was. The portrayal of this relationship was very good and can almost stand its own. Very sad, both of which went through. <br /> <br /> I felt really Val and Robin during my harsh times. I'm glad they stopped this high star! <br /> <br /> I hope Robin will put a $ 100 bill on this boy's hat !! <br /> <br /> And it was great that it was filmed in Vancouver!
