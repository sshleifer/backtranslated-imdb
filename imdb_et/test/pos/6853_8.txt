(spoilers?) <br /> <br /> I've heard of some special effects. But it should harm the movie. Film is a temporary film. And that is very good. So from this point of view, this film rocks. Franke rocks. Enjoy the content of your plastic hearts. So there is no complaint about this movie. If you look at English, that is a complete farce. This creates the illusion of B-film. <br /> <br /> One complaint I have is a music video on DVD. It doesn't say who sings it. I would like to know. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 10/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Replayable: 5/10
