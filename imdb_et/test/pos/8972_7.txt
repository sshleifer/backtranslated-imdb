It is possible to spend a good time with this film, while regretting everything that is not. In the 1980s, US Congressmen (Tom Hanks) supported Afghan partisans against the Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> Hanks is in the wind, in a hail-well-filled form, like a robber, politically wrong Charlie Wilson, first saw a shared hot tub with a view of three deeply accessible women. If only the film had the same air of uncertainty; but besides the cynical CIA agent of Philip Seymour Hoffman, he is also trying to be patriotic. Aaron Sorkin's trademark staccato dialogue serves its purpose, but the story is no longer credible as one of Wilson's high stories. And there is a strange voice text: Wilson's Afghan palms later mutated to the Taliban and other western groups, leaving the world worse than those events took place.
