Abbott and Costello's talents shine happily in the childish version of "Jack and Beanstalk". Using sepia tone and color, music and choreography, singing and dancing, crossing players from one role to another, and other aspects of this very fine movie make it clear that the techniques and styles used in Oz have been played here. And it works well for our intrepid duo There are also other things that make this movie terrible for me ... Buddy Baer, ​​Uncle of the Baer Jr. The Beverly Hillbillies, appearance as a police officer and giant. Pat prince, Lou's brother, was involved in writing the script. However, it is below: I think the choreography is badly done, but the cute songs and the accompanying vocals are helped by the rather sloppy dance numbers, some players, the beloved couple (prince and princess), are not very good in their trade. these things are a small price to pay for a yellow brick for a otherwise very enjoyable walk.
