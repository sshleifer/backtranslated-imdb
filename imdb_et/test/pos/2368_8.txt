This film makes a number of scientific literature films. The prologist reminds me of the original Thx-1138 theatrical version (BUCK ROGERS trailer, here were some Japanese SF TV shows). Then, in 2345, the city opens a blow to the dragon flying from the pill, noting BLADERUNNER immediately. The BLADERUNNER aspect is even greater when we meet a hero called a replica (she is a blonde hairy and is called Ryo, a tribute to Roy Batty, the character of Rutger Hauer in BLADERUNNER?). Soon, the battle scene will soon be resembling MATRIX. A government that forces people to take drugs is like a THX-1138 and editor-in-chief, while it looks like a cross between Elvis and Dan Ackroyd, the robot is very similar. The final battle recalls TERMINATOR 2 and the end result is fun. Probably not one of the best SF movies out there, but it is enjoyable, definitely much more enjoyable than trips like BATTLEFIELD EARTH.
