Inside I'm Dancing (Rory O'Shea was here) is a story of two young men with disabilities, Rory O'Shea, who is almost completely immobilized and confined to a wheelchair, and Michael Connelly, who is weakened by the MS and limited to a wheelchair. <br /> <br /> The film in Ireland opens with Rory, who comes to the marriage. Ultimately, he meets Michael, but only after some tense scenes where Rory rebels against staff and other patients in the usual "movie mode" that plays loud metal music with fear and general discomfort. His promising friendship with Michael is confirmed by the fact that Rory seems to be the only one who understands Michael or is at least ready to try. <br /> <br /> Finally, through a few litigation and affliction statements and the right to live in a specially customized apartment. Michael's father, who had essentially given up his disability, pays for the apartment. Two also employ an attractive assistant named Siobhan (played by Romola Garai) to help them in their daily lives. It is essentially the place where the core of the film develops when both develop feelings for him. Michael is particularly difficult. Unfortunately, Siobhan does not feel the same for both, but especially for Michael, and this leads to his departure. When Michael temporarily retires and wants to return to Asst. Life Center, Rory persuades her to continue living. The film ends with a sad comment that many viewers may have come, but ultimately we have the feeling that Michael has become truly independent and the future is his, as Rory pointed to him at the end of the film. > <br /> You know, I can't say I have seen many "disabled movies" and I don't know if they could be considered a specific genre. However, they have some type of formula. One person does not want to live beyond his illness until some liberating force forces him to do so and Inside I'm Dancing is really different. What works, however, is that there are probably more subtle peaks and valleys that these two men are going through, what to expect. There are no deliberate moments and "upright and joyful" manipulations. Sad parts are sad and funny parts are funny. Some viewers may retract a bit, that Rory is a nervous hairline with an ear on his nose, if a too "rebellious" clich√©, but an actor, James McAvoy, makes it somehow real. The same can be said about Steven Robertson, who plays Michael. When Michael's heart is broken, it doesn't seem to be a weak scenario that tries to work for the audience, but rather a young man who is really painless without love. Such pain, which many may touch, regardless of their physical condition. Again, these are the things that make the movie work and make it poisonous without being excessive and enjoyable on many levels. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
