TROMEO & JULIET - 10th Anniversary Edition <br /> <br /> William Shakespeare's play Romeo & Juliet has been translated hundreds of times on stage and in films. Sometimes the original text is literally followed (sometimes in vague stages), sometimes in new interpretations, where the directors decided to show their views. Some are good, many are mediocre. Lloyd Kaufman's film is certainly one of the most original, most modern versions of bard creation, it can be placed in today's disintegrating New York City and full of contemporary anti-social behavior, body piercing, breakage and kinky sex (which for more than a random reader was not a scary one), but at the same time at the same time it remains incredibly close to the general feeling and thought of what the game is, which is quite tense. Kaufman wrote a script with his co-director, James Gunn, who has now been a member of two successful Scooby Doo films, making it impossible to make a perfect new perfect movie with his script Dawn of the Dead and management as one of the best horror films: Slither. Lloyd Kaufmann's innovative view, along with James Gunns' original and unlimited writing, gives Shakespeare an interpretation of the performance that perhaps not everyone can get, but is certainly recognized as a truly unique and very important view of the classic game. With a script written entirely in the iambic meter, Motorhead's Lemmy appearances and Tromeo and Juliet are a terrible powerful soundtrack that nobody will ever forget. In addition to its historical importance, Tromeo and Julia are the treasures of all kinds of film lovers. Not only for the James Gun script, which now has a good impact on Hollywood, working from the inside, but also because it contains the early part of the legendary actor Debbie Rochon. Everybody is familiar with films made from lower budgets. The 10th anniversary edition of the DVD adds everything to include so many undiscovered jewels that not only all the information you might want about the film itself, but also the experience of doing it, it would be impossible to exclude the DVD but also the very honest (and disturbing) ) The picture is given to how independent cinema must survive these days. In many ways, the recordings on the disc are an invaluable addition to the already impressive amount given in Kaufman's film school "Make your fucking movie". Included are the historical elements of the Troma vaults, which include James Gunn, Debbie Rochon and all the other supporters of this masterpiece, and the film itself, besides being better than ever, comes with at least four audio commentaries, each and all informative, extraordinarily funny and all made in the movie Instead of serious additions instead of everyday and usual comments. There are new comments (one with Kaufman and Gunn), but one of James Gunn's initial releases of DVDs, but he could not add any honesty to some other people on this disc. With some of the scenes from some of the movie's fans, Lloyd Kaufman's visit to James Gun's Slither set and two visits, the Eli Roth Hostel was brought together for a birthday party and much more, it's the ultimate choice everyone needs to have. The weather where you are a film historian, someone who is interested in interpreting Big Bard's work, a big movie fan, an independent cinema fighter, a James Gun fan who is more interested in making movies with a small budget, fan Lloyd Kaufman or whatever: this is the millennium more important DVD edition!
