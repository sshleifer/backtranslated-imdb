The 1990s were very popular with British sitcom with many popular creations such as ONE FOOT IN GRAVE, ABSOLUULA FABOULOUS THIN BLUE LINE, BRITISH EMPIRE and MEN for the first time on TV screens. But> MR. BEAN is the biggest sitcom in the 90s. <br /> <br /> MR. BEAN is the first major effort to set off the era of quiet supremacy, such as Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. Rowan Atkinson plays a single character for the audience - Mr Bean. <br /> <br /> Many people who have commented on this page, as well as on the bulletin boards of this and other websites, have been discussing whether Mr Bean has a mental disability or has significant learning difficulties due to such disability. However, I believe that this debate is not necessary, because I doubt very much that the creators of this exhibition were waiting for someone in the audience for a moment to even consider Mr Born in such a context. <br /> <br /> Mr. It has been shown that beans are a character who seems to have very few friends, rarely speaks, and decides to solve problems himself, without the guidance of others. Some of his methods for daily tasks, such as preparing lunch or going to the dentist, are approaching someone who sees the view. This is where humor comes from. Mr. Bean may not be a mentally disabled person, he may be just an eccentric person who is used to dealing with things. And, of course, some of the methods associated with one of his tasks often lead to a disaster, which we then see to be resolved by Mr Bean. <br /> <br /> Sometimes we see that Mr. Bean shows a medium or small band, often trying to compete with the people around him or playing bowling for their least anticipated. At the end of the day, however, there is no real harm to anyone and the results are always happy. <br /> <br /> Unlike most British comedies in the last 30 years, MR. BEAN is a simple, unpleasant, harmless U-rated entertainment that is suitable for all family members. For this reason, the TV series became a big hit in dozens of countries around the world. This is also the reason why many decades are still remembering how many other TV shows have come, lost and forgotten. Some critics claim that exhibitions only want children, but I'm just laughing as much as Mr. Beani's antics now as I did when I first saw episodes as a child in the 1990s. Rowan Atkinson has used his natural ability to create effective visuals that seem as funny as repeated viewing as they did for the first time. <br /> <br /> There have been two spin-offs, BEAN and HÃ„RRA in TV series so far. BEAN DAY. As you are familiar with the type of humor shown in the TV series, it does not succeed on the big screen. These two films do not give the TV series little rights and do not really let the magic of episodes. The biggest failure in both movies can be a change in layout. In both films, producers take Mr. Bean from their usual British neighborhood to America (first film) and France (second film). As a result, Mr. Bonn's film players react differently to their behavior than their TV series counterparts. Both films use the TV series gags again and the evidence shows that gags were made for the first time. The second film shows that Mr. Bean behaves beyond his character and some aspects of his personality are exaggerated until some gags seem more stupid than funny. At different times I found myself thinking that what I was looking at was not Mr Bean, but a pale caricature. It is clear that Rowan Atkinson didn't enjoy himself as much as he did in the TV series. His heart was simply not in the show. After the second film appeared, he publicly stated that he would not play Mr. Bea again. I understand how he felt. <br /> <br /> Back to the TV series, every episode shows proof that each scene is written and executed accurately. Even the weakest episode is still very enjoyable and in front of two films. <br /> <br /> My favorite episodes are the first three - they set a high level that was supposed to continue. In my opinion, the last episode is the weakest, but still fun. <br /> <br /> To sum up, MR. BEAN is a really great sitcom for the whole family. Rowan Atkinson is a true comic genius and the evidence is in this 14 episode of the TV series. My recommendation - watch and have fun. But just watch movies if you feel hard after watching TV shows.
