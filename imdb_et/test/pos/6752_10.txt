Mascot is a masterpiece by Ladislaw Starewicz. It tells a story about a dog that is looking for an orange after his mother's daughter tells her that she has no money. The dog is chosen with other toys for sale. When the others jump on the vehicle while the vehicle is in motion, the dog will wait and wait for it to be removed from the warehouse before it starts itself. He succeeds in getting orange after biting the woman's feet while holding and selling fruit. When he runs, he meets a fucking guy and accepts his offer to stay at a nightclub. There he meets other toys that jumped from the truck. The cat who was next to her in the vehicle has decided to get the dog's orange. I'm just here to say that there are other wonderful things in the nightclub that you have to see. Suffice it to say, if you love Starewicz and are interested in all past animations, I would definitely recommend that you look for it!
