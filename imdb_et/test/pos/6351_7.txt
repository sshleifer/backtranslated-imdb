A touching love story that resembles love. Great attention to Chinese poetry and how it is used by Eastern people to communicate with each other is focused on a teacher who wants as much a teacher as well as a good husband and father. The senior student is very interested in her. As the story opens, we see the emotions under its surface in our 20-year-old marriage and how it grabs its moral dilemmas. Beautiful and touching story.
