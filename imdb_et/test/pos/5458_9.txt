Over the years, I've been watching this movie several times during the HBO and now I have a copy on DVD. I have to say that it is memorable and entertaining in the meantime, it is also interesting and educational. Like any TV fan, it may be related to the early 90's when Johhny Carson was replaced by a live TV legend "The Tonight Show", who will be Jay or Dave? This original film, HBO The Late Shift, remains real to design and depict real events that show that NBC and CBS network leaders are fighting behind the scenes, and even ABCs fight for Jay and Dave services. Action makes it real, as real people have very little real TV material, because the actors depicting Leno and Letterman make it so real. I haven't read Bill Carter's book, so I don't know if it was true to the pages, but I've been enjoying this movie over the years. From the moment he starts showing Ceno entertainment heads that look at Leno sub-Johhny, they decide they want to play late at night. But when Carson announces his unexpected retirement, NBC wants to keep Leno loyal, but the conflict will also come when Letterman wants to break 11:30. It was nice to see how terrible a meeting with Michael Ovitz (Treat Williams) who would make all the networks want to show Letterman. It was interesting to see Johhnyi's scene on Letterman by phone, and to consider CBS. And Rich Rich was terrible because Johhny Carson could not match his image. And a lot of tense moments were offered, showing Leno's talent manager Helen, whom NBC leaders pushed. In general, a big movie that showed what the TV really likes, and it proves that networks are powerful and money hungry, showing that it is tough. It is clear that there is no business like exhibitions. The great work of HBO is very memorable and the time when it showed the true story of wars in the late evening.
