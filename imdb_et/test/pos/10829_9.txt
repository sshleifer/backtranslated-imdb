Director and author Jean-Pierre Rappenau was 8 years old in the spring of 1940, as the French Republic collapsed in a few weeks. He said "all adults were a little crazy." He and the manufacturers have reused this world lovingly and carefully in a film where all the characters are essentially fictitious. The structure, the classic farce, is the ideal period for the lines of several plots to shrink and intersect only in a logical, satisfactory conclusion. This plot is confirmed by Frederic, played by the brilliant newcomer Gregory Derangere, who plays completely against Adjani, Depardieu and Ledoyen. The true strength of the film is its supporting performances. M. Rappeneau has made a fine contribution to the actors who voluntarily gave ideas for action and dialogue, and who know and prove that it is possible to realize only two short sentences of a full dialogue. Although the rules of the Renoir are not yet so extensive, Bon Voyage is a worthy companion to this classic. Although it requires a lot of audience, it gives a lot back. One of his demands is tolerance for the particular birth and wrong direction we look at: criminal melodrama, no, spy thriller, ah, romantic comedy. Recommend it to cinemaphile friends. Just make sure you let them discover that this is a romantic comedy.
