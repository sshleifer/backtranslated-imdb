This series has been recently discovered and extracts can be seen at least in the UK, at http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/527213/index.html Probably there is hope that the series may eventually become more accessible. The problem is that this series was followed by the series THE WARS OF THE ROSES, which was similarly marked and has been available for cable television or at least crowded out of the market. <br /> <br /> These two series are quite different in dramaturgy. WARS brings together games through extensive rewriting and shifting of scenes; The age of the king follows closer to Shakespeare. Both series benefit from complete casting.
