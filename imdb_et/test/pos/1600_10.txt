<br /> <br /> The Philistines warn, especially America! It contains all the elements you hate - a linguistic approach to film language, a picturesque composition feeling, an intense homoerotic focus on your elegant narrative, a wonderful and unusual use of music and even worse that it is based on the story probably hates ... If you think movies don't have the lines of derivatives, full of dirty dialogue, no visual grammar for MTV / TV ads, check it out. This is one of my favorite films and perhaps Visconti is the most complete form. It's superb, like the Mahler movement, which he uses consistently throughout the film.
