Most Christmas movies have a "redemption" theme, but most of them are a very similar plot variation. This movie is crazy and has an unusual piece. You may need to hang there in the first half where events may seem incredible for the film (but not as incredible as in real life - Scott Adams, Dilbert's creator, says he has never built anything from his cartoons - they are all based on his fans by him BTW, one reviewer said that the idea that no one can get money is not plausible on these ATMs, but it is quite reliable if you have lost your wallet - who is carrying ATMs cards somewhere else on a business trip?
