I read ashew's comment and thought they had to look at a completely different picture! I just watched the movie this morning and I was quite surprised. <br /> <br /> Ashew's commentary: <br /> <br /> Trail Street is a very well done West. <br /> <br /> And Randolph Scott was pretty little in it! <br /> <br /> Gabby Hayes was more fun than I ever saw him. The bad guys, in my opinion, were very good. <br /> <br /> Plus: <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see Robert Ryan straight - good boy - he's usually so slim. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, a good Westerner has worked well and written well. <br /> <br /> I liked the story of Kansas and "winter". wheat ", which supposedly helped this country. <br /> <br /> I thought the girl who played Susan was cute - she can't think of why she couldn't become a big star!
