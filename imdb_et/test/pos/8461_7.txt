Christine Lahti (Sandy Dunlap) and Mary Tyler Moore (Holly Davis) worked well with soap material, Ted Danson played an unpopular role in Chip Davis. The premise is that the friendship of two women, one seemingly happily married woman, and another career woman who is aware of her biological clock. I found a relationship that Ted Danson's character had with a woman played by Christine Lahti. He behaved in a dingy manner, but he left two "widows" to despise him. I found it disgusting when Sandy told her she wanted to break up with her husband after a meeting with her husband, she told her to leave her (did she call her husband? No sign). He acted like a heel. Maybe he would have made a more interesting movie if he wasn't killed. Perhaps both women would have wisely put him down and he was not. I liked the friendship between the two women, but it was spoiled for what they had in common: husband Cad.
