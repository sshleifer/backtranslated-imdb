What makes it one of my favorite films from low budget production? Not joking, I looked at it ten times and didn't get tired. Is it a gentle melancholy all the thing? Is it similar to the classic like "Niagara"? I thought about it for a long time. And I thought it was: I think it is: there is no hero, there are only people. Some are trying to be good. Some gave up trying to be good. Some are hopeless cases, but still carry a human being. This is the story of a catastrophic night in the motel at the end of the world. One way the disaster is not just the end of the coincidence chain. On the other hand, this evening shows the logical consequences of this people because they are in a certain world that is cut off from the rest of the world. There's something about Dostoevsky's story.
