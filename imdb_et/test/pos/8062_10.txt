As good as the Schindler list was, I found this movie much more powerful because it is a documentary and based on real life. It describes the story of Frank's family and especially Anne. Although it is a bit slow in the beginning (specifying your family life before the war); it becomes very capable. <br /> <br /> Thanks to some camp movies and photos, it is not recommended for children, but for adults, which illustrates the horror of the Holocaust through a young girl. Highly recommended.
