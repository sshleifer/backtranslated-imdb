Once you've seen the trailer of this movie, you know pretty much what to expect, because what you see is what you get. And even if you haven't seen the previews, it won't take long for what you've done, especially time and a lot of laugh - from this "Reality TV" review of satire. exhibitions and "Buddy Cop" movies, "Showtime", directed by Tom Dey, starring Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy. <br /> <br /> Mitch Preston (De Niro) is a LAPD detective and he has a great deal to do; but one evening there is a case of suddenly going south when another policeman, Trey Sellars (Murphy), involuntarily intervenes, the television news team appears and Mitch loses his cool, resulting in a lawsuit case that goes to pay department's some big bucks. Except they can handle it, thanks to Chase Renz (Rene Russo), who works for the station and likes what she sees in Mitch - enough to put her boss in the "reality" police show, it wouldn't contain anything but Mitch Preston, whom Chase sees in real life "Dirty Harry". <br /> <br /> His boss likes the idea and gives Chase a green light. Now he must first convince Mitch to participate, which should not be too difficult, because the station has agreed to cancel the case if he shows it. But Mitch is a policeman, not an actor, and he doesn't want to do anything about it - it is as long as he has a heart-to-heart master Winship (Frankie Faison) who puts Mitch's future in short perspective. And just so the show is on. Oh, yes, another thing; for the exhibition Mitch needs a partner. And who do you think they can do? Let's say: Trey Sellars is more than one of the usual suspects. <br /> <br /> This is Dey's second film as a director, his first "Shanghai Noon" - also comedy - and he will definitely show the genre a pleasure. From the opening frame, he creates a tempo that keeps the story moving to the right, and allows his star to take advantage of his own talents and personal strengths, including their impeccable timing. Like De Niro and Murphy, Dey was, of course, the beginning of this project, but he is the one who keeps it on the road, showing that he knows what works, just getting the right physical comedy and dialogue nuances with great influence. <br /> <br /> There is no more natural actor than De Niro, and he's going to Mitch's skin as he was born. And after years of hard-working, cutting into drama (where he turned to one remarkable result after another), with movies like "Analyze It", "Meet with Parents" and now it has firmly confirmed his skill in comedy. Mitch is not very complicated; In fact, he is something of a "normal" man, but there is a challenge to the actor - to believe him to be one who could be your neighbor and just one member of the community. De Niro succeeds at all readings. He is Mitch, a boy you got into a grocery store or a bank, or say "good morning" in your job direction; who likes to play on television and has a life just like you and me, who happens to be a police officer. This is a sign Mitch has to do to make this movie work, because it makes the "ordinary guy in extraordinary circumstances" credible. It is one of these roles - and work - it is often misplaced because it seems so easy; and of course, De Niro is so extraordinary - he makes it easy and does it with the facility. <br /> <br /> Like Trey Sellars, Eddie Murphy wins well, and that is the role that suits her as a proverbial glove. Trey is a policeman, but also an aspiring actor - and bad - and it gives Murphy the chance to play on his overwhelming side of his personality (Dey led it enough to keep him resurrected) - the upper Jim Carrey territory that works great for that character and its for the film. From his melodramatic participation during the hearing, his expulsion with a single liner - delivered directly to the camera (as far as he is not even there) when filming an example of "reality" - Murphy is a rebellion. And he has chemistry with De Niro, which really clicks (which is not unexpected because it's another De Niro's many talents; his ability to communicate and bring out the best stars of his star, all of which is support - is better Crafting after working with him, including similar names to Meryl Streep, Christopher Walken and Ed Harris, the most important thing is that it is the part that makes Murphy stand out for what he does best, and he will definitely use it. br /> <br /> Russo also uses Chase's role, a character who is not a lot of stretching artistically, but whom he presents with joyful, strong and credible performance, and William Shatner (playing himself) steals a couple of scenes as an exhibition manager. / p> <p> <p> </p>) Well-designed and delivered "Showtime" is a comedy that is exactly what it is meant to be: Pure entertainment that offers a lot of laughs and a pleasant few hours that will make you laugh for a while. It's the magic of movies. 8/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
