The film begins with a promise, because there is more communication between Spanky and Buckwheat, but as the movie progresses, both boys have fewer scenes together. This significantly slows down the pace. Billie's "Buckwheat" Thomas gives a very high performance in his early scene. When he falls on a river boat, his fear and rejection are felt, and his tears are truly heartbeats. If he goes from person to person asking for help and is repeatedly rejected, the viewer really begins to think about whether it is comedy or not. The second birthday is to watch the kids' birthday on a long journey. As another reviewer mentioned, I was also worried about a big dog choking on chicken bones! When Spanky and Buckwheat are Marshall Valiant at home, Spanky tends to communicate mostly with adults, and children's chemistry is essentially gone. <br /> <br /> Old South / Hippie The Finn-type device doesn't do much on the plot unless the kids have lots of doors. Ralph Morgan is the most attractive adult, but then the other roles don't have much content for them. Louise Beavers will lead the fun moments with the Yankee soldier to the end. <br /> <br /> Roisto is not quite weak and lovers are not intense enough. But I think it's worth checking out if you are our gang enthusiast, if for some other reason the whole piece is not strange curiosity. I'll give her seven stars because, although it's not a great movie, she kept me all the time and curious what's going to happen next.
