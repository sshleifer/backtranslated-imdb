I started to look at it very much because I heard a lot of different things about it. Somewhere I read that it was a drama of child abuse and PG-13 violence. Another critic said it was a fantastic and nostalgic adventure for children (and I thought it was also for children). Well, now I've seen it so many times and still don't know which category to put it in. Sometimes it is very funny, but the next moment is terribly sad and frustrating. For a nice relationship and adventure, I would like to recommend this film to all the young people I know, but I'm afraid that a gloomy atmosphere is not suitable for children. However, because of the perfect performances and the magic of the film, I have to say: Look at this, especially the children! The last thing I have to say is that I hate a script artist who has ever given his poor Bobby his family after his king's escape (who didn't even miss Mary and Mikey to terrorize). It is very good that the film does not have a perfect happy ending when everyone is happy - and I did not expect it - but this solution left me very, very sad!
