Wow, I loved this movie, this movie was full of plot twists, good acting, a great story and a surprising ending. To be absolutely honest, this film was not too passionate, it contained some gore, but was rather psychological. I read it online: the film cost $ 3,000 and shot in 8 days. Amazing !!! This is someone who wants to think and loves great filmmaking. What starts as a terrorist thriller is slowly becoming somewhat more complicated, even a bit more sinister. Not much can be said when leaving the plot just indicates that this film goes beyond my expectations
