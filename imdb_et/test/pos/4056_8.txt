I first saw Life Life in the PBS as an American playhouse presentation. It's a wonderfully written, ensemble production that has terrible Michael Lewis performances by Joey and Vincent D'Onofrio as his brother Daryl. Arthur Kennedy, in his latest role, is also an excellent shipbuilder whose family business is about to close. The rest, which includes Beau Bridges, Kathy Bates and Mary-Louise Parker, gives their characters considerable clarity and content. <br /> <br /> The direction is subtle and effective. I've been watching this movie many times over the years and I would highly recommend it. Beautiful cinema.
