It was one of my favorite films from childhood. I watched it so many times, finally wearing my tape. I was a big fan of this show and I am still. The thing I love the most about this film is that it attracts so many people, both young and old. I watch this movie now and laugh as hard as I first saw it. I am now able to appreciate all the adult jokes I never had as a child. My favorite characters are Elmyra and Foulmouth. Almost fifteen years later, my father (also a big movie fan) and we still quote the features of this movie. I love the part where Foulmouth and Shirley go to the movies. "You save seats, Shirl and I stab dad's snacks." I also loved the story of Plucky and Hampton and his family going to Happy World Land. Wade Pig reminded me a lot of dad. I love that part when they finally reach the happy world, and all they do is ride on the monorail. This movie is fun and invites children and kids. Animation, jokes and all that is the upper limit. If you haven't seen it, rent it. You're not sorry.
