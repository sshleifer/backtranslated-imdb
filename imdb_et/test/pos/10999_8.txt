Gothose Squire is one of Star Trek's "sillier" episodes and is therefore one of the most interesting. The entertainment factor is generally the abandonment of William Shatner and the funny guest star of the episode, William Campbell. <br /> <br /> During an undefined routine mission, Sula suddenly disappears into thin air and Kirk will soon follow the church. Spock is about to look for his missing colleagues (and though he doesn't want to admit it, friends), while two complicated team members have to deal with a mysterious, powerful, enchanting Trelane (Campbell), self proclaimed Squire of Gothos, a creature capable of Create or destroy everything he wants through his power. <br /> <br /> At first glance, the plot can be recycled from previous episodes (frankly, is there any sci-fi that did not contain at least one of God's similar character), but this feeling disappears quite quickly thanks to the use of the exaggerated humor that won the script everything is transmitted to Campbell deliberately through camp performance: his Trelane is essentially a trek version of the child's child, while his curiosity about the human race (his knowledge is quite limited) due to his ignorance was an inspiration for Gene Roddenberry when he came to the next-generation pilot Q character, About two decades after this episode was aired. <br /> <br /> In short, the key to evaluating Gothos prison is: "Foolish" may not be "bad".
