GZSZ is Germany's longest running soap and it's a cult! I started to look at it from day one and began to grasp it from the beginning. Over the years, so many have changed, like old characters like Heiko, Elke, Tina, Saskia, etc. And new ones appeared like Marie, Kai, Cora or John. I have to say that I liked GZSZ better from 1995 to 2000 because today the exhibition focuses too much on the younger characters. My favorite figure is Sonja Wiebe, because she is the most soapy person who has ever been on this soap and she is also one of the most interesting characters. Tina Bordihn was the first Sonja, but as Tokja got Sonja's recast, the sign became even better.
