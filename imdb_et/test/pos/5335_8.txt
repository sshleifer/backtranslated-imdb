Based on the signs that have been developed in the past for many commendable short shorts, the HIGH-OUT RABBIT is about as far away as the mill's "Family Ticket" as you can: beautifully designed and clever dialogue and clever concepts, it's really a movie that likes almost every family member . <br /> <br /> The story is about Wallace and his dog Gromit, who live in a village that is embedded in growing large-scale vegetable growing at the annual fair, and operating "Anti-Pest", is a humane solution for all those irritating rabbits who torture passionate gardeners everywhere. The business is very successful - but Wallace proves a little too smart for its good. When he tries to "rehabilitate" the rabbits with his plant crunchy grapes, he unexpectedly releases the ancient horror of legendary proportions: Were-Rabbit! And maybe there's no safe vegetable in town! The film is full of crazy inventions, unexpectedly intelligent dialogue and references from everything from KING KONG to WOLF MAN - more than enough to attract even jaded teenagers - but the real charm is its characters. The amount of personality that artists and animators can take away from clay bits is amazing: they seem to be as alive as every muscle-blood actor. The DVD disc (and I recommend a widescreen) also contains a number of informative and entertaining appearances. Highly recommended! GFT, Amazon Reviewer
