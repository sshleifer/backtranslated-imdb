OKAY. Is Barney the Best Children's Show of All Time? Of course not. However, in some comments left by other IMDb members, you would think that this was a multi-million dollar production for high-level players and special effects with a ridiculous budget. Well guess what? It's Barney for God's sake. He shows the children good behavior, good mansion and that is OK who you are. For those who find it annoying because you are not five years old and the show was not meant for you. For an IMDb member who wrote on the first page of this page, I think you may have gone too far. Did you actually describe the character of Sesame Street as "underground"? Grow everyone, this is a great show for preschool children and actually helps kids learn fun and creatively.
