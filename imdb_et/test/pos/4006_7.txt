I can't show hate. When the old (and better) tech-TV was supposed to hit the bricks, the channel was transformed and new exhibitions started. They were Kevin Rose, Kevin Pereira and Sarah Lane. Brendan Moran also became a co-founder, but most of the time he made a pre-recorded piece for the show. Kevin Rose decided to leave the show, and finally there was a contest to see who was the third host, but that didn't cause any reason. <br /> <br /> Finally (I learned from this very IMDb bulletin board) Sarah Lane and Brendan Moran moved on because (hey, that's what I read) these two married. It was a big secret to me! Now the new female co-host, non-hot (my opinion) is Olivia Munn. She hides something she wears while Sarah Lane had the perfect body and she wasn't afraid to show it. <br /> <br /> AHEM! Sorry. <br /> <br /> "Exhibition Attack" deals with everything young people want to know. It is music, movies, comics, internet and television. That's what's great at the show. If you don't want to effortlessly clean up your network or waste time watching MTV, you get everything you want from AOTS. Some of the segments and bits they do are funny. They have regular guests and supporters in this industry, as well as guests ranging from irrelevant internet stars to real big names. I have always found that "Exhibition Attack" is entertaining, even if it is the newest.
