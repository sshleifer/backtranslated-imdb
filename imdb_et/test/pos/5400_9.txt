Before Barton jumps over my remarks, we must remember that opinions are like donkeys, we all have them ..... <br /> <br /> I loved Sigourney Weaver and Jeff Daniels, loved the dialogue and thought was sublime. Only perfect and underestimated. Unlike others, I couldn't find it @ predictable. <br /> <br /> I found the role of Sigourney refreshingly humorous and realistic, especially his scene, which stood in the temptation of the trailer. <br /> <br /> I found it to be enjoyable and did not expect it for everyone and others. That's why there are a variety of ice cream flavors.
