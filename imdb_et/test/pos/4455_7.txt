It is located in a poor working-class city in rural Italy, a madness. The landscape can be quite picturesque, but here is the madness that lies behind the mask of a person with normal feelings. This person kills toddlers. <br /> <br /> This style and tone resemble a movie such as Dario Argento's famous Italian giallo, these fascinating fiction films except that Argento's movies are much better. However, Fulci's "Do Not Torture Duck" visuals are competent, with some interesting compositions and lighting. Lightning and thunderstorms in thunderstorms at night increase the ratio in one order where one of the "ducklings" is alone. <br /> <br /> In one order, gore is a bit redundant. But this is not a slasher film. The story is legal. And the issue is that madness can take many unexpected forms, not just the obvious confusion of people practicing voodoo or black magic. Director's agenda. Don't leave someone who may not be a suspect. The distortion close to the end gives a good guideline. But in one scene, a dialogue could have been added to explain the relationship between the two characters, one of which is the murderer. The final of the film is on the beautiful hills that the wind hates in the background. We see the clues as feedback and get an insight into the killer's mindset. <br /> <br /> I don't care about the projection of the film's widescreen. But the background music is effective and ranges from the gloomy jerk to the low key jazz up to the indigenous Italian songs. Action is generally average, although in some cases it is a bit overestimated. contains a thematic storyline and a sufficient number of puzzles that are most interesting to viewers who love thrillers and the mysteries of murder.
