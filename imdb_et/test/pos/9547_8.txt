What could happen to the dull city in Texas in the summer? Well, a lot of teens can find out what happens and what can be done. <br /> <br /> It turns out that this Mexican werewolf story is nothing but el chupacabra and film, unlike the name. it is not a remake or look of American Wolf's movies, but something completely different. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, it's not bad for a low budget movie! Some smart camera work, pretty decent-looking traditional creatures and gore effects, and once not all the knowledgeable people who make and make mistakes, such as collecting a colleague who thinks it's a big bad beast, and are confused with things they couldn't find out. <br /> <br /> Sit down there, waiting for millions of dollars in the impact segment, and turn it off in a short time. Sit in it, waiting for some entertainment and a fairly simple story, and it's pretty good! In general, it gets 8/10 for me to be creative with OK, and pulling out some good work for this movie's budget.
