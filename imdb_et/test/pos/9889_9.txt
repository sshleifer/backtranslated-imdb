This movie is fun, bright and straightforward. Although this story would work well, covering almost every ethnic group, the character's character's own ingenuity has given an extraordinary meaning to the prize for a wonderful dialogue. There were so many social issues on the plot that only for this reason would have seen it; But the real treasure was with a warm laugh that spread to the whole respectful audience. Games with complex characters and their various strengths and weaknesses play a role in all sins and humor that Shakespeare's drama would appear to be a parody of their life. This is a film about the family; - Often insecure, sometimes invisible, composed of different individuals and lifestyles, first of all between brothers and parents, and inevitably among larger friends and even strangers. The technical aspects of the film have given the film the pace and development that keeps the viewer interested until the final scene. Peter Falk is amazing, as always, in the role of family patriarch Morris Applebaum. Strong productions show surprise to the guests. Don't miss this movie!
