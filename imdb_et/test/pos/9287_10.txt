One of the television comedies, whether sketch, sitcom or animated, is nice to watch something truly refreshing. <br /> <br /> Chaser must be the best comedy of this decade, Seinfeld is the last triumph. It follows the hosts with the city broadcasts to improve the situation, make "ad-driving", and try to get the facts from their politicians good old-fashioned. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the plays are sometimes very controversial, from a well-made and truly funny opening to credit schema studies (sketch style only over time, they are not scripts, at least those at the other end of the joke) ) definitely worth it. Even the most cynical and intellectual viewer does not have to be disappointed and the exhibition deserves ten stars. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is well done for ABC to show it and I highly recommend it.
