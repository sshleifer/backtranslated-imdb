The Italian term "sprezzatura" was a grace and a mismatch in social ways that led to love, as described in the 16th-century handbook "The Courtier". The film "Hitch" is worthy of the "sprezzzatura" concept embodied in Will Smith's dynamic performance. <br /> <br /> Smith plays with Alex "Hitch" Hitchens, who is a professional dating consultant with happiness and confidence. The best scenes are when Hitch painfully shy and maladrades Albert in his quest to win in the heart of New York society and Hitch's own attraction to Sara and his surprise to Ellis in Iceland. In these scenes, Smith's good work is supported by Kevin James and Eva Mendes. But this film is driven by Smith's charm and charming personality. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, Smith rises above the average comic book to make a "catch-on" highly observable and entertaining film. I don't think there is yet another actor who is capable of giving charisma and a perfect era with comic moments like Will Smith in this movie. And his secret is "sprezzatura"!
