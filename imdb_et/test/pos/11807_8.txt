There was nothing else on television yesterday afternoon, so I thought, "Let's see it." I didn't know the plot and I had no expectation, I was thinking in a few minutes or I was going to surf again. But then the story began to emerge and two boys played beautifully. The story was with unreal parts and scenes, but in general it was a real good movie. Very worth worth.
