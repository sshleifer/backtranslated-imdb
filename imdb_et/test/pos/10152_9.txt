This movie is what you love. Alfred Hitchcock always stays with the leaders of his time. The most influential aspects of his films are simply simplicity and thrilling drama. The second best thing about Hitchcock movies is one sure and exciting end. <br /> <br /> Every thing that talks about "People who knew too much" is less. Cinematography, action, dialogues and camera works are great in this movie. The song "Que Sera Sera" remains at the end of our memories for life. The movie is so enjoyable from start to finish that we never know when it will end. Rarely would there be humor in Hitchcock's films, this movie has comics that fit with the film. <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely great and as good as Vertigo.
