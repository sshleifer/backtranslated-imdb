Of course, together with all the other people, was created to wait for a lot of Hollywood fantasy revolution with their BIRTHS BORN. Just that someone like Errol Flynn plays Custer has enough clue that the legend takes precedence over the truth in this production. And most of the time, my expectations were met (indeed by a migratory and entertaining way). <br /> <br /> Even in this obviously biased (and critically criticized) reuse of Custer's story, some of the points made in this film that sometimes showed a fine, but still firm, contradiction to the obvious fate and routine of the early 20th century western countries. uncut heroism with typical clich√©s. <br /> <br /> For example, even though this movie attempted to stifle this hero, certain scenes still offered Custri's more vile and stupid character: <br /> <br /> 1) his original entrance to the West Point gate where his arrogance and the splendor is a clear aspect of his character. <br /> <br /> 2) his unfortunate record in West Point, which seems to have been attributed as much as Custer's marriage to military requirements as any other factor; there are moments when Flynn plays Custer at West Point, where he feels stupid. <br /> <br /> 3) Custer's promotion to the general rule is not only presented as a ridiculous mistake, but rather as a little comic. I was half-waiting for Marx's brothers or Abbott and Costello to go to the scene. 5) The Custer drink problem is certainly not ignored. <br /> <br /> While Indian music and some of the ways in this movie were, they were certainly a racist stereotype of ignorant wildness, it was still a surprise to me that the film went exactly to the reason why the Indians were justified in attacking the whites who had moved to their country, and fairly explicitly blame the black mountains at the foot of a man for black battles. In fact, no one can claim that the clear offender of this work is not Anthony Quinn as a sedentary bull, but Arthur Kennedy & Co as the white devils who make the golden horn in Black Hills. Of course, this story is true, but I did not expect it to be quite unambiguous in such a movie. <br /> <br /> And another thing: usually in these films, Indians are depicted massively as drunken animals that seem to be unable to prevent common common sense to avoid dropping alcohol at any time. In this movie, it is actually the 7th cavalry force, not the Indians who are depicted in this way on at least two scenes. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie slides into the Hollywood bunker with some surprising moments.
