This film is undoubtedly the best I've ever seen in my life. Star stars are just an extra bonus for amazing special effects and deep story and sublime choreography. The film talks about an old love relationship that falls into the modern world. Two heavenly lovers suffer the great sage anger and curse. Then the woman is born again on earth. During the college he is raped and committed suicide. The rest of the film basically focuses on hunting rape people by their lover who has supernatural power and proficiency in multiple languages. Sonu Nigam offers a very mature and deep action in this film, and almost all other players do it. Scenes with Akshay Kumar are peace of mind and must not be missed. You just have to watch this movie !!!
