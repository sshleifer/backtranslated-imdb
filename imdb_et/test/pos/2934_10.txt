"Americans Next Top Model" is the Best Reality Show! I was entertained 99.9 percent of the time I watched it. I kept my eyes open all the time. (Well, I blinked) It may be sad, funny or addictive (mostly addicting) "America's next top model" kept me more and it's pretty much. It is also on more than one channel. Sometimes it's not on MTV at other times. I hope it will become more fans and grow into a series of hits! It's great to pretty much any age, so everyone can enjoy it! :) <br /> <br /> Also, when you saw this example earlier, have you not noticed that Tyra is in the style of the judge every time a different hair style? He's short and curly one week, then long and straight.
