This movie was an amazing tribute to anyone who has undergone this type of pain and suffering. Action was not the greatest, I admit it was passionate about this message, sending people to prisons without the lawyer or some type of trial being cruel and unusual. They even had a sad trial for Saddam, so why does every suspect terrorist have no fair and reasonable trial or hearing about why they were first labeled? I'm getting the movie down, but I think it's worth the hurt, twisted idea the government has. The movie's way to tell the story and backstory was a big secret. Throughout the film, I tried to connect my daughter and the plot and this is finally very obvious. There is no doubt that the management was incredible, but one thing I was not interested in was that, in the interests of the character Reese Witherspoon, so much emphasis was not placed and in the ideal he was fighting, it was a lot of skipping. Otherwise, it was actually quite fun and most of all he kept the attention and interest for the two hours he played.
