I have only praise for this movie. From the beginning to the end he hit the shine of Stephen Sondheim's music. I am not a big fan of musicals, most of them are superfluous. But that changed my mind. I'm an actor myself and I have played Sweeney and I know how hard this role is. George Hearn gave an excellent, masterful and rounded result that deserves the highest prizes we can give him (He won Emmy and that is something.) Everything he does is gold. She's so good that she's hitting her why she's not in the movies that won the oscare. Lansbury is also very good and very funny. Sara Woods is horrible and wonderful as a beggar woman. All in all, great video. Take it up when you can.
