A stylish documentary about how a small group of idealistic young men have used music, art and dance to unite and treat the community of Rio Vigario Geral ("favela" means neighborhood in Portuguese). Young people are a positive alternative to the deadly gangster world of drug traffickers. <br /> <br /> Zimbalist and Mochary have created a film that is breathtaking because it works on so many different levels. As a social document, it provides facts that we need to know to get the context to understand the importance of the story here. The story itself is well-developed, with a strong narrative arc, and for extra action it strikes with great tension. It is an arresting, charismatic central protagonist, Anderson Sa: he is a savvy natural leader, expressing, bold, mentally advanced, talented performer, seer who walks his speech. <br /> <br /> There's also a lot of music and dance to entertain. Are you talking about the head there? mainly Sa and his closest associate Jose Junior, but they are equipped with imaginative cinematic glory. Editing blends well with the different subject matter of the film, which is only occasionally written between texts filled with some facts. The pace is as lively as music. Much will be achieved in 78 minutes. <br /> <br /> Grupo Afro Reggae, a neighborhood social club formed by Anderson, Junior and some others in 1993, used music and dance as a weapon to go to drug addicts and double police. They teach percussion skills to every child who wants to join the classroom, dance, martial arts, community newspaper. The only requirement to have children is not smoking, drinking, drugs. Moving, soft and spiritual fabric that moves through the movement is quietly based on the Hindu God Shiva, an old habit destroyer. <br /> <br /> Jeff Zimbalist, also a leading operator and editor, is a student of contemporary culture and media at Brown University. He chopped his shell editing film for PBS and others, and taught the film at the New York Film Academy and elsewhere. Matt Mochary, like Andrew Jarecki ("Friedmans the Friedmans") made a few years ago, recently came to the world of business film. <br /> <br /> Zimbalist and Mochary won in 2005. TribBeCa Film Festival and Favela Rising were associated with the best film of the year at the International Documentary Union in 2005. I could go to the pages about Afro Reggae, Sa and this movie. It's a better idea to just go for you! My class: A 10/10
