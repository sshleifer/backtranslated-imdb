I can't say much more what has already been said, unless I need 10 lines of minimum policies. <br /> <br /> I got a copy of this VHS-DVD, but the quality is pretty bad and I urgently need it officially released. <br /> <br /> I can just imagine what I would like to see (the character of Tim Healy who gives his way through one of them). Football robot programs would be great!). You can imagine it now, isn't it? But, of course, it seems that most people have to dream about DVD distribution. <br /> <br /> In the ITV DVD publishing department, there must be someone who also knows about British culture and has enough web skills to watch IMDb now and again? Oh, well.
