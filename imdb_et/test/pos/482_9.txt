There are times when I'm convinced that The Mikado is the best Sullivan & Gilbert opera, but it's only as long as I don't listen to Iolanthe. As it is, Mikado is probably the most frequently filmed of Savoy's operas. (Yes, I first made the composer. Nobody tells Hammerstein and Rodgers, Hart or Rodgers, Boito and Verde or Mis-His-Face and Strauss. Balfe, Gilbert was just a bigger name at that time (and a bigger ego), so they put their name for the first time, it is time for silly practice to be set. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Mikado is a blessing for S&G operetta, with some of Sullivan's most memorable numbers, with some of Gilbert's finest words. This particular production, filmed in a live performance in 1990, makes this imagination a striking simplicity, resulting in a costume and erection in the worshiping enemy of the eye, with white, gray and black tones, accentuated by random red pieces (and rarer for yellow and green uses). It's going to be customary, but it's really spiffy.Of course, when the cream tells you that they are Japanese gentlemen, you would have the right to exclaim: "Oh, pooh. Bah!" it is more gratifying that this fine production is now on DVD. One Warning: The print seems to have been photographed through imperfect glass, so the expected sharpness of the image is softened and ever so lightly fuzzy. Unfortunately, the tendency to apply images is annoying. Why do people who really produce spiffy want to capture something with artistic jokes? But that's the most result. We can skip it because even though it is done, Sullivan never writes. (True, it may not be that he wrote any Savoys. But Mikado's opening game is not even since Sullivan's lifetime, and has been made following the techniques used in others.) For the rest of the operettas, it is first-rate and extremely funny. <br /> <br /> Ko-Ko is appreciated here by Eric Id, who credits it. The big name is tradition. It was the US television production a year ago, when Ko-Ko played with mixed results with Groucho Marx. Idle's presentation is admirable in spicy ... she "takes county prison", assisted by a tennis court. His "I got a small list" is a microphone speech - of course, it has the usual updated words that are much more fun than the usual course of such things, and its delivery is positively hysterical. It goes so far. <br /> <br /> In this operetta, it is important that you have a good Katisha; it's not just fun if you don't have style. This Mikado is a fabulous Katisha by Felicity Palmer, almost as big as Idle. She relaxes with their finest wonderful rich contrast ... wonderful, especially for soprano. And her costume ... !!! (Not to mention his reasoning with Franz Liszt, probably accompanied.) Nanki-Poo plays Bonaventura Bottone. I'm having trouble moving around - it's somewhat un-Nanki-Pooish chubby short - but the voice is undoubtedly a strong and rich addition to the vocal palette. "A Wand'ring Minstrel" is a nice touch where the bark reacts awfully to mention "his nancy from his knees" - remember the Mikado decree on flirting. As it is, Bottone is a good singer, and if his appearance doesn't put Nanki-Poo's best face on his performance. <br /> <br /> Yum-Yum (Lesley Garett) and her friends are pretty beautiful and silly. She and Bottone are making beautiful duets. Pish-Tush (Mark Richardson) plays his staff as something blageur and does very well. Poo Bah (Richard Van Allan) is marvelous as a stuffed shirt from water ... role later killed in American sitcomides (you know: haughty butlers who are forced to care for children - such a thing). Mikado (Richard Angas) is a bloody wonderful, utterly loud with his ridiculous words. <br /> <br /> I don't want you to get it on your only Mikado. Also get a good traditional production, so you'll see what Gilbert looks for (more or less) productions. When I say this, I look at it twice when I look at any traditional bit. All in all, this is an amazing offer, vocal and visual joy, with delicious excessive action. It is a treasure of DVD, with dervish servants, dance dances and everything. Make sure the bellhops are with signs.
