This is definitely the biggest surprise of the festival so far and no doubt the best festival has to offer. I went to this film with little hope after I realized that the director was responsible for the terrible vampire for Forsaken. and I was pleasantly surprised. The film celebrates Lor's fame in In Crowd's fame as a young mother whose husband has just passed. He moves in the mountains to an old family with two daughters, next to the mine, a grave plan that has been working for the children of the day. It is unfortunate for them that the children return with revenge who kill and eat everyone on their way. The film works on several levels. It is well done, tense, has very good cinematic films and particularly capable presentations. The atmosphere is spooky, but somewhat submissive, the score is decent and makeup effects are harsh and simple. The film keeps the horrible and astonishing tone, and the children themselves are very frightening and unreliable with pale skin, lips and hollow eyes. The film is original and inventive without being artistic or complex. I don't see this movie, which makes it a great release without some sorting and easy tuning. But they definitely have a good product out there and they should continue to distribute the theater. But the theater where I saw it was terrible. The sound was terribly confusing, which felt the big take away of the movie and it stopped in the middle, because they couldn't get in the middle of the screen that killed a bit of murder. All in all, although it was the most horrible entry of horrors, perhaps because he had the least expectations, but was still welcome in addition to genre films.
