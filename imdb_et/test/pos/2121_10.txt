Visited the Grand Champion preview today (Dallas / Fort Worth, Austin, Snyder and some other Texas cities). There are a few movies that are suitable for small children ... but that's and it's great. Although the plot is a small "Hokey" (also a movie management name), it's a great story for kids. And I enjoyed it too. The film is quite well represented in West Texas ranch family life, although it is a bit exaggerated. Director / author Barry Tubb should get it right after he grew up in this environment. He called the film his "love letter to Texas". <br /> <br /> Joey Lauren Adams plays the single mother of Buddy (Jacob Fisher) and sister Blow (Emma Roberts). Watch Emma Roberts (Brother of Julia Roberts); she's very good and I think she's more in the movies. Julia Roberts, Bruce Willis, musicians George Strait, Charlie Robison, Robert Earl Keen, Joe Ely and rodeo legends Larry Mahan and Tuff Hedeman. Feel a good movie, check out the "Grand Champion" when it comes to your city (supposedly later this month). I enjoy it and it makes you well. <br /> <br /> I think that since I am from West Texas, maybe I'm a bit biased ... skin, I'm impartial. The movie is great!
