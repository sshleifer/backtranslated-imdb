Okay, when it comes to plots, this movie is far from believable and a bit stupid. But despite its many drawbacks, the film manages to work - provided you turn your brain off and enjoy yourself. If you can't, you probably don't like this movie at all. <br /> <br /> In one of the twenty-one plots of the thirties, Robert Montgomery plays a man living near the Arctic Circle. radio station. When he arrived at such a far-sighted outpost, he was uncertain, but in this very lonely and isolated existence, a constant number of visitors arrived - although it had been for years since he saw someone besides the Eskimo. First, Reginald Owen and Myrna Loy arrive when their planes run. They're said to be on their way to Montreal - how they got far from faith! Reginald is a troublesome and boring man who is very worried about Montgomery because Robert hasn't seen a woman for a long time and Owen seems to be constantly scared that Montgomery is stealing Loy from himself. As for Montgomery, that's what his plans are! For a long time you will never understand why Loy Owen is engaged - because he is about as attractive as striking bread. <br /> <br /> Loy and Montgomery will soon love it, but it's all empty when the blue AGAIN comes from Montgomery's old bride to declare she's married there !! Considering that for more than two years he has never written and refused to follow him, Montgomery naturally thought the relationship had ended - but the chipper and the annoying arrival of the fianc√©e were enough to destroy Loy and Montgomery's plans. <br /> <br How it's all solved is something you can see for yourself. As for the film, this plot is very silly and natural - I can't protect it. BUT, it's also pretty funny and charming and I see this movie as a kooky comedy that is just a step or two in today's movies like BRINGING UP BABY. Silly, light but also very charming. It's worth seeing, even though it's not very plausible.
