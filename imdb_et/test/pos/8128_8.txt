An inspired choice for this latest Brit-Flick, Rose Troche, who broke the scene with the NY-Dykes budget-free story, _Go Fish_, gently brings a fresh look to the Londoners who choose a somewhat inappropriate milieu of a male-binding society to declare their desire for a male seek the truth. For me, highlighting is a scene where society tries to return to a primitive hunter gathering, but ends the order. The film as a whole works great, and Troche, whom some of the lesbians in his previous film had never accepted, loves a larger budget, allowing some strange catching versus the _Go Fish_ terrible hyperkinesis. A really enjoyable movie
