Beautifully built and well-functioning comedy. There is no person cast who does not recognize himself (or herself) in a fun way. But the real star of the film is the unseen director Frank Oz, who brings to this farce all the mad sensitivity and thinking he brought to Miss Piggyi's meetings with Kermit's frog. It's an unforgettable movie.
