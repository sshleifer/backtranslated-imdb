The story takes place in Germany before the Second World War, in a unique environment where a couple of British agents keep the Germans on the farm. As they are not yet technically in war, it seems that both sides should have understood what is coming. Both agents (Bruce Lester and Ray Milland) flee the countryside and divide. Million happens one night to a gypsy woman Marlene Dietrich when she is alone in her camp where dinner is prepared. Their meeting is an amazing and enchanting scene, not so much for Milland, but for Dietrich, who takes a sexy sultriness to a brand new plane. Milland hides himself as Germans to hide from the Germans, but he remains committed to finding a scientist who knows the formula of a new poison gas, but who is not a dedicated Nazi. The life and habits of the Hollywood Roma are predictably depicted, but the underlying knowledge that they are one of the goals of Nazi destruction adds some tension. There is a serious story about the poison gas and the quick search to get the formula, and the colorful but not overly convincing love delivery between Milland and Dietrich. However, they are both very good; it is the film's guilt that did not give them or their relationships enough dramatic realism, relying on and exploiting the obvious cultural differences in questionable comedy goals. Nonetheless, there are many tense and interesting points, surprise meetings with German soldiers and Gestapo, where Dietrich makes a great palm reading and almost the same as Milland's fake, and a dinner party with Germans with various stripes, where it is known by radio that Poland has attacked Germany and all stand and make a rigid hand salute. Mitchell Leison may have missed some opportunities here and there, but he took advantage of others.
