I had no great expectations just before dawn. I don't know why I buy these slasher movies when I know it's always the same. Maybe I'm a little masochistic? Anyway, I'm glad I bought it. Yes, it's all the same. No, it has nothing original. Yes, it is a small group of young people who go to camp, drink and have sex in the forest. Yes, they die with mania one by one. And you know what? It's just magic! This is one of the best experiences I watched in the movie. The places where it is made are so wonderful. You see mountains, waterfalls and rocks. It's just amazing. Before the killer kills, it will take a very long time (except for the opening), but I don't care about it! It was enjoyable to look enough to not care. I mean, you don't sit there waiting for the murders to start because every thing that happens is enjoyable because of the beauty of the movie. The end is a bit weird, but I'm not talking about anything more. You know what I mean. Another thing I enjoyed: you care about the characters. They are not just a bunch of people spending time with each other. Of course, they are common slasher characters with pure stereotypes, but they have something special. Anyway, this is a great horror movie and I hope you have a good time to watch it because I really did!
