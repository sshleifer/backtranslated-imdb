Dirty Dancing - I think everyone has seen this movie at once. I remember that as a child I loved this movie and watched it over and over again without fatigue. <br /> <br /> Now that I am a little older, I recently bought a DVD and STILL was not disappointed with Swayze and Gray is creating the atmosphere of this movie, although it is claimed that they will not come, the film chemistry is incredible! As the film progresses, their relationships are sucked and we believe in each other. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack is amazing, music adds only the romantic mood of the movie and adds a relationship between Baby & Patrick. <br /> <br /> The last scene changes this movie, which can ever forget the famous line "Noboby puts the baby in the corner." The song is perfect and the dance is amazing! <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone of all ages, it's just a fun movie everyone can enjoy 8/10.
