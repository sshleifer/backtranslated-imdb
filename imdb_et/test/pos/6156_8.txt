Surprisingly beautiful film. Beautifully crafted, beautifully managed, beautifully acted, beautifully acted and beautifully captured ..... cinematography is nothing great. It is a war movie, but it is epic in its scope and combines romance, tragedy and comedy with a story that is as harrowing as it provokes.
