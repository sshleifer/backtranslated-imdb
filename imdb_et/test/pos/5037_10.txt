John Travolta was in the movie "Michael" a great name the same. I don't think I could have done a better picture. The movie was funny but touched. Michael is a very "human angel" (if any). Andie MacDowell has an excellent role as a reporter because she is unbelieving in faith. Bill Hurt and Robert Pastorelli are big as reporters, both hard to prove angel hoax in the countryside. Every supporting cast is great, especially the older woman (I don't know her name) who plays Michael's mother! One of the most beloved movies I've seen for years ... I can watch this movie tens of times!
