Front spoilers. <br /> <br /> 2001: Space Odyssey is undoubtedly Stanley Kubrick's most challenging and successful film. This is not a movie you look to be for entertainment or amusement. Instead, it provides you with a thought book, images that will remain in your mind long after the movie ends. This is a movie you could meditate on. <br /> <br /> The film deliberately raises more questions than it can answer, it is made for puzzle and mystery, but still leaves the observer with a sense of awe and respect (which allows him to be involved in the viewing process; some effort for the viewers), the questions it represents are great and criminals concerning the birth and destiny of mankind. the ultimate place in cosmic design and the existence or absence of creativity behind the structure of the universe itself. <br /> <br /> The first of the four quartets gives us a clear view of the species. We see that our distant ancestors, half-massive, are near hunger. The climate has destroyed most of the plant life and vegetarians are near hunger. An exterior object will appear, a completely smooth and angular black monolith; animals are inspired at the same time for its presence in the tool and for violence. They become carnivores overnight, and when two tribes meet each other near a source of water, the tribe who has developed the ability to make a tool, as well as disbelief, will destroy a neighboring tribe. The new leader of the winning tribe, able to deliver the first technological vests, throws the bones he used as a weapon in the air. We see that the bone is converted to a floating satellite containing nuclear weapons. Soon we will know that nuclear paranoia breaks the world. The signs inspired by the appearance of the monument, which helped us to survive, now threaten our existence. <br /> <br /> Humanity is in crisis again, again, the unrestrained presence of the black monolith is helping the human race in the next stage of its development. A month's study reveals a monolith that is identical to the one we've seen before. World governments, usually mortal enemies, have come together secretly to discuss its consequences. The mission is organized. The memorial has been dealing with some kind of radio communication with Jupiter. Some men drive to the destination of the transfer. Most of them are held in suspended animation most of the time. A spacecraft pilot is a HAL supercomputer that is programmed to imitate all human features. <br /> <br /> The film has many outstanding sequences. For Kubrick, the use of classical music is outstanding. The most memorable are "Blue Danube" and "Ka Spake Zarathustra" (especially suitable for the subject of the film, which goes beyond ordinary consciousness). br /> <br /> The core of the film is the nature of HAL. In imitating all the qualities of people, it has its negative features. It evolves into paranoia, which almost leads to the destruction of the mission, an accurate reflection of paranoia, which has allowed the political situation on the ground to reach a point of desperate crisis. The film shows that these are the traits we must leave if we want to move on to the next stage of our evolution. <br /> <br /> Film architecture also makes sense. Many spacecraft designs are designed to recommend reproductive organs and the process of birth and rebirth, the central motif of the film. The completion of 2001 is the most outstanding and has never been in the fight for victory. <br /> <br /> This film represents a life similar to the presentation of William Butler Yeats and James Joyce's novel Finnegan's Wake. It is a cycle, but a progressive history and human development that repeats the same events over a large period of time, but with the human race develops according to the will of the greater purpose creature. Although we never know what this purpose is, the film assures us that the human race is not meant to fail, its fate is great if it can imagine. I am still amazed that, despite this film, many people continue to regard Kubrick as a misanthrop. <br /> <br /> This is a religious film, not in the usual sense, to follow any particular faith, but because it is a marvel of the great panorama of existence and its deepest and most important questions of purpose and truth. <br /> <br /> With any other director, it might all be a bit too much. The Hollywood view of life is too harsh, usually to include a vision like this. But Kubrick was a visionary, he led with full confidence, not only that he was able to handle such material, but that he was the only one who did it. The process of making this film used all of his creative resources. Arthur C Clarke's writing partnership is the most fruitful filmmaking. Kubrick had to find some special effects that were used at the amazing climax of the film. The tools that bring their vision to life were not there at the time, so he brought them to life. <br /> <br /> 2001 is a totally unique film experience. Those who do not use it do so to the detriment of their intellectual and imaginative abilities.
