eXistenZ was a good movie, first I was thinking about what's going on, the organic "pods" made of mutant reptiles that united you and other players into a surreal virtual reality game through the umbilical cord, seem a little weird. <br /> <br /> But when she goes to her pretty good movie, a couple of twists with a big open end and a good movie in the whole movie will be fun too, see if you're not sure what follows. br /> <br /> Security guards throw away metal detectors; they have bone guns!
