1969 was the year. New York City was the place. Putney Swoope was another Robert Downey film to gain some recognition. The first was Chaffed Elbows (1966). Putney Swoope achieved a much broader release. Pound (1970) and Greasers Palace (1972) were even more prophetic and reluctant. These two films meant that they drew a career in prince's feature film several years ago. <br /> <br /> The topic is Putney Swoope. And this is a crazy fear / satire that must be believed. I'm not going to go through the plot here. What's the plot? People looking for a plot will scratch their heads. Keep scratching! This movie is not PLOT! It could be compared to Mel Brooks; only without the Hollywood parody party Mel always scored. I also see a bit of Monty Python in it. By the way: This movie was shot before Monty debuted at BBC !!! I've noticed that Gags and Lines, which are dead, are fun. DO NOT transmit well word of mouth. You have to see them in the context of the movie. There are some mistakes in the movie; but even the bugs are unique. For example: Actors repeat SAME LINE over and over; and somehow it works. How Many Syllables Mario? Putney says Borman's six girls have been able to breathe! etc ... <br /> <br /> B / W photography is outstanding. The sound / score is even better! Editing is just that. Operation is above average. The script is invaluable. Jokes are both un-PC as you can: MR. The bad news is, "Sonny Williams got a 13-year-old girl in a motel," Putney says, "At least He's not superstitious." The way to create this movie will take you straight out of the room. Nothing is holy. <br /> <br /> There are many things in this movie that relate to today: NO SMOKING !!! Racism; African Americans treating Caucasians like a trash. Mass media manipulation of masses; Madison Avenue, Deroit, Hollywood deliberately tried something that every 8-year-old can say is pure rubbish; Internet, I'm talking about "drum"; Interracial dating; I could go on and on ... <br /> <br /> I should also mention that there are about 8 minutes of this film made with 16 mm of color. These are the ads captured by Putney Agency. The patches work relatively well for the first time. They get tired of repeated views. The real magic here is in the B / W sections of the movie. These are the non-scenarios they will be with you: "Rent Yourself A CHORT Schmuck". "I love you, I love you, I love you ... did you take your pill?". "something I have to say would be just superfluous". And many others. I also like a little minnow attached to the wall: "The gambler wanted me to throw it back ... I put up such a fight, I decided to install it!" <br /> <br /> The sample standouts include Buddy Buttler as Putney's bodyguard # 1. He should have been a much larger star. Antonio Fargas as Arabic. She went on TV and watching movies at the start-up. Arnold Johnson has the right to watch Putney Swoope. Robert Downey used his voice instead of Arnold remembering his lines. Downey also realized that he could later perform each additional dialogue / joke when he named his governing body. <br /> <br /> The film has some drawbacks. The short term is one. I wish that the start with the White Board members would be extended. Stan Gotlieb and Allen Garfield are outstanding. The ultimate stitches have been folded as if it were just able to understand. All in all, this is one of the best low budget independent movies ever. The time when very few Indy played outside New York, Chicago, San Francisco and L.A. Anyone who loves satire and comedy should see it at least twice. Downey Putney Swoope is a time and since then.
