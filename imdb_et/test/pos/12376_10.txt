Okay, so it wasn't what I expected. I rented this movie to see how it would be because I want to see it first. But this film had the whole B movie. But when I looked at it, I realized it was very funny. The First 30 Minutes This was exactly how a snowman chased people and a man lost a man. But in those first few minutes there were some funny liners. When he threw his small minions first, I knew it would be very funny. They all act like the nineteen-four in the gremlins that it looked like it was buggy and made me forget that it was a B-film. So if you want to laugh it, then.
