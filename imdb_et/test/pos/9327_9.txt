No matter how you feel about Michael Jackson, you cannot deny that this video is the most unique video of all time. There are no other videos near the "Thriller" that are even close by. I saw it for the first time when I was 6 years old and it scared me badly. Now I look at it with a smile because I can now understand the wonders it is. I love this video and it's as long as there are music videos. I think everyone should sit back and watch it when it's sometime and look back and see how big it was, especially in 1983.
