That's how Burt Reynolds describes this film, which happens to be his best. He plays Tom Sharky, vice president, who is an international mobile (Vittorio Gassman) and a man he finances as Georgia's next governor (Earl Holliman). In William Diehl's novel, this story is more complicated because the boy is working in front of the president. This is a very long film that looks like more than three hours instead of two. Filming in the center of Atlanta and the Peachtree Plaza Hotel will make you feel like a story. Reynolds does not make a lot of laughter compared to his comedy films. She's very serious here, especially at the beginning of the movie, because she's getting bad when the fucking bust goes wrong. Sometimes the film plays more than a voyeuristic drama as a criminal film in which Burt tries to get the mobster close to the woman. Only at the end of the film can violence bow down, leading to bang bang climax. Like Lalo Schifrin's DIRTY HARRY's great jazz score, Sharky offers a great city jazz soundtrack with many guest characters including Chet Baker, Julie London, Flora Purim & Buddy De Franco, Manhattan Transfer, Doc Severinson, Sarah Vaughan and Joe Williams. Al Capps deals with scores of magic. This movie has become one of the best crime drama. Check it out. <br /> <br /> Score, 8 out of 10 stars
