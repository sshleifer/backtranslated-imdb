I really remember BATMAN RETURNS when it came out in 1992, but now I think it's the best of all Batman movies (even over Christopher Nolan's terrible 2005 BATMAN BEGINS and definitely over serious surplus 2008 BACK!). I first remembered that the first BATMAN w / Jack Nicholson was the best (and I still love it). But I think this film hits the nail on the head. The 4 main characters (Batman, Penguin, Catwoman and Max Shreck) are all lively and memorable. You really see what Batman / Bruce Wayne is in Keaton's terrible character. Keaton is the best Batman, not Kilmer, Clooney, or even Bale, who was extraordinary in BB and who could have stolen Keaton's best rewards if his character wasn't destroyed by making Nolan's cages in TDK! <br /> <br /> Danny DeVito as a penguin is annoying, frightening, fun and deadly. DeVito is great and does not need landscape chewing to give great results like Nicholson Joker. The viewer is able to circumvent this paralyzed state and its situation in a normal society. I was never Michelle Pfeiffer's big fan of this movie, but it is definitely my favorite. Pfeifferi Selina Kyle is funny and strange at first, when she has become Catwoman, she is at the same time sexy and scary, all deadly sex boy! I also feel that Keaton and Pfeiffer have more chemistry than BATO than Keaton and Basinger; they are a tragic love story. Christopher Walken like Shreck is fine, as always, Christopher Walken! <br /> <br /> BATMAN RETURNS, more than BATMAN, is more confident and focused. It is certain that movies are from start to finish. The introduction of Burton's Penguin Heartbreaking Wallpaper takes you from the beginning. The first 5 minutes are among any favorite films: Danny Elfman's music sets a dangerous predictive tone that defines the rest of the movie. This is the result of the original BATMAN and excellent change. <br /> <br /> Then 33 years will flash for the current Gotham and we will introduce a powerful businessman Shreck, who wants to build a new power plant in Gotham. During the same event, we meet Shrecki's senses, tempted, unconscious secretaries with Selina Kyle. And not long after, this movie is an exciting opening action as Batman has to fight Penguin's Red Triangle Gang, a fun but deadly group of emigrants and circus performers. Penguin puts a plan to move to attack Gotham's Christmas party, rob Chaos Shreck and force him to help him introduce him to society. Meanwhile, Selina discovers the criminal plans of Shrecki, and she kills her from the high-rise office, and the cats are reviving. Sound twisted? Yes, but Burton never claimed to be a realistic story. He has created a world in which the viewer can accept that such things can happen, a dark, noirish world that consists of abused, deformed emigrants who want to be deeply accepted and fit. Reliable storytelling, if you ask me! <br /> <br /> Action scenes are small and far away, but everything is exciting, fun and nail biting. They are not just showing how some of BATMAN is. And they all make sense. A climatic scene where Penguin is an "army" marching into the center of Gotham with Batman's zoning in Penguin's hiding and sidekick butler Alfred (Michael Gough, welcoming the original!), Helping Batman, is short, confident and heart-pounding! br /> <br /> I also love Christmastime, a winter environment that adds a super-dark and cold feeling to Burton's Batman world. I also love how Burton slowly introduces Batman's "toys" to us without letting them down. Every "toy" at this point fits in the movie and we are forced to receive it for our own purpose. And though dark, RETURNS is still a funny movie. DeVito Penguin has many funny features. That's what Walken Shreck does. Batman-Catwoman exchanges are very stimulating and filled with humor! Great ensemble! All in all, BATMAN RETURNS is a tightly knit story of the dark forces played in Tim Burton's fun comic book.
