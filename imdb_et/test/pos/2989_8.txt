I can barely remember what I saw in this movie. It was when I was a teenager, I think I'm now 37 years old. I started watching it as a late night movie sometime in the mid-80s to the early 80s and so much has been with me since then. Looking at other comments, I had no idea that it was shown in theaters, or that someone else was even new. I don't think I even mentioned the movie to anyone else. I think that the innocence of the symbols, their situation, their mutual attachment over a long period of time remained a long-term impression for reasons I do not understand. Maybe it's because I was a teenager when I saw it, and it touched me somehow ..... I really don't know! I also really wanted to know what would happen if the movie happened at the end. Oh, agony! <br /> <br /> I haven't seen it before or since, but I'd like it. I keep it at random, but now I doubt it has been shown and it seems like it's gone. But I would leave it in the television guide even if it appeared. Pssttt !!! <br /> <br /> Reading opinions here has renewed my interest. If anyone knows about its availability in Australia, send me all by email and let me know. I watched my movie history and noticed my last appearance on James Bond's film. What are you up to now? Do you have a copy of the movie? CHEERS !!!
