I tried my attention to the Netflix Quick Game because it was only one and a half hours long (it is almost 4 years old) and because it is Norwegian, which I wanted to follow with Dead Snow and see what else the country is offering at the international cinema now. This movie is characterized by a man, Andreas, who is sent out to some brave new city where everyone is happy and cheerful and food is not tasty, nothing smells and even sex loses its appeal. Due to the common lack of common senses, he feels almost ready to kill himself. <br /> <br /> After a fun catching last, Andreas pursues a man with similar complaints, and two discover a small, vaginal hole in a concrete wall out of which music comes out. Two attempts to interrupt to see what is on the other side, watching the little light they hardly see. Of course, in the allegory of fantasy, the desire and the mismatch in the land are not allowed, and the elements of the city are completed by the experiment of Andreas's freedom and sensuality. <br /> <br /> Jens Lien and his team create a simple, straight forward story that flows well with its themes and moves at just enough pace to keep the backlog. The similarities of other similar science fiction are not worth mentioning, but the film still has a unique feeling and balanced some very funny scenes with some rather terrible ones. I like the limited but effective use of this movie, some disembowelment and flagging that makes your heart harder than the passion of Christ just because it is as perfect as it is from the gray-toned mass scene. Trond Fausa Aurvaag is a reliably squirrelly actress who physically feels away from her surroundings, which works very well. Despite the fact that the term itself does not write home, all the actors involved work and the film realizes its world. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
