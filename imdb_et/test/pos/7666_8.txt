This show was incredible, but for most people it was too esoteric. If you had never seen a European Diversity Show in the 70's or 80's (or at least Mexico), the whole exhibition would probably have disappeared for you. If you had, this exhibition was dead because of a fake spectacle and a shimmering satire, which they show to dive into their worst. "Viva Variety" is a versatile exhibition that tries to smoke the chain and pencil mustache and his ultra-glamorous and immune EX-wife. and the deeds went wrong. Hosts are joined by "Johnny Bluejeans", a blunt-sided side-kick who seems to have been named because blue jeans are a very popular product in their country and that means children love her, of course not <br /> <br /> was a fun spoof that shows in general. Imagine that the BACKSTAGE "Sonny & Cher Show" allegedly happened in recent days. Imagine that this is happening in ONSTAGE in front of you and the stars are trying to keep their attitude. Now add cheesy snails and Euro-riche mentality (tuxedoes, gowns, booze, accents and fumes). Now you have a "Viva variety". <br /> <br /> Have you ever heard of a musician whose music is pretty much written for musicians? Too conceptual? Viva Variety did this comedian. Too esoteric standard for an American audience. It was funny as hell. And doomed.
