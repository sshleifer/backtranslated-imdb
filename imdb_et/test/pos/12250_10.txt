I don't think this was the best film of 1987, it's probably in my amorphous list as one of the 10-20 best films I've ever seen. For some reason, I am really involved with this movie and this is one of the most personal films I've ever seen in my life at that moment (I was 26). For the better or worse, I'm firmly in the nature of Holly Hunter (and I'm a man!). She plays a very bright, loyal and intense woman who couldn't think of romantic relationships. There were so many things he said in this movie, which were things I would say or would have told others in similar terms. And the end of the movie, which I think is so, very sad. <br /> <br /> Of course, this role was a big break for Holly Hunter. It is clear that I was not the only one who thought so much.
