If someone refers to an independent cinema area in the United States, it is often concluded that it means a filmmaker or the people behind the project have much more creative freedom and what they wanted. Nowadays it is not always the case if no one is "auteur" and creative freedom is still a warning that we have to find distribution with the independent sections of one of the larger studios or somehow getting some sort of uplift. low-level transactions worth the film festival. But Putney Swope, Robert Downey Sr's film about the harsh nails that Afrikaans-America accidentally promoted to a production artist, is * an independent cinema, a job that he liked in parallel or Romero's Night Live Dead and Cassavete faces at the same time, not getting a true typical studio breakdown, but cause waves, hitting fucking and names in the cinema world. For all your moments that are crude and crude, it's unforgettable. <br /> <br /> This is a funny, very extraordinary funny movie. Sometimes the sense of humor is just as ridiculous that it is almost impossible not to laugh, President Mimeo's dialogue on the ads that the Swope team brings together like "I can't eat an air conditioner" is a real "soul" voice. It is as wise as the audience to whom it is targeted, which is anyone who has two brain cells who see that this work is not offensive or * too * shocking because it is meant to rob a cage and it does it quite well for the first within five minutes. When it is over, Downey Sr will go to his variety, a filmmaker with nothing to lose: his main character is part of Fidel Castro, part of Isaac Hayes in 1972 (and yes, it's in 1969) and partly hard assed with a shooting line to make Mr. And don't forget these side effects, dear God. <br /> <br /> There are so many memorable lines and moments that are hard to follow. Perhaps the most fun assassination attempt in any movie on one "Face-Off" skin cream ad that includes features that would give South Park its dirty mouth money, just a little aside from one Jack. Hill's movies play a Muslim who keeps his lips on Swope and that one boy with a nun, who stabs a storm and impresses with Swope's quick stroke. This is a pretty direct message about the media and advertising, but there are also many powerful moments where it just hits the nail of racism in America, sometimes without having to do more than gesture and sometimes doing something great, such as this type of panther type black and Swope ad mode. And for a low-budget production (I mean super low, so a comparison with the night of living dead and faces), Downey got some very good actors, all non-members, and it's hard to imagine that some of them might have been on the camera for the first time. <br /> <br /> It should be mentioned that Downey's style does not make it perfect: it is crude and sometimes too crazy and dated for its own good, and I'm sure I didn't. t get some of the humor that is the basis of some ads because after these ads I have been completely generations (although "Miss Redneck Jersey" was definitely missing on me). In general, although it is one of the best times of its time, it is a satire that adheres and has a predominantly black-colored feature that is too aware of what is due to excessive power, irrespective of skin color. As anyone can say, it's "good s ***".
