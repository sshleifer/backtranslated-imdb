"Idiocracy" is the last film that comes from Mike's "Office Space" judge, and it definitely follows a film-like theme of being a stupid observation and how mediocrity can fight ... relatively. This is the story of Joe Bauer (Luke Wilson), who is literally the most common man. Joe and a prostitute named Rita (Maya Rudolph) are becoming the test subjects for the hibernation military project. They were supposed to stay suspended for only one year, but due to lack of supervision, Joe and Rita are forgotten and will wake up randomly for 500 years. <br /> <br /> This is a frightening part: this movie explains, in a very realistic and credible way, how the entire 2505 population was decelerating. In the absence of wild predators, the development of a human species does not necessarily support the fastest, smartest and strongest people for the progression of genes ... just the ones who are the most bred. Unfortunately, these people happen to suck the welfare, the garbage of the trailers, as idiots who are like rabbits. This abundant reproduction of stupid people has had a detrimental effect on social growth, and now Joe and Rita are the two smartest people on the planet. If this helps, imagine that the entire population is just a hybrid that is tiny, jockey, colossal, and hoochies. Seeing this worrying dystopia, Joe learns to follow the time machine to see if he and Rita are back when they came, and that is basically the whole plot. <br /> <br /> But no matter how-dimensional I can make this sound, this movie is a higher angle than you can. The nuances are everywhere, and anyone can see the daily afflictions of everyday life (warning signs if you want) and turn it into a train wreck that appears in "Idiocracy". The film has a really awesome show on the realistic slowdown that is being laid. I don't want to give you anything and destroy the fun, but let's just say it's pretty thorough. I see how some would say that it is just a lot of humor humor, but strange as it may seem is a goal; show how these people are stupid and harsh. <br /> <br /> This movie is unfortunately meant to be the same fate as its predecessor, "Office Space"; no one can see it in theaters, but anyone can enjoy discovering this fantastic / funny movie when it comes to video. My only complaint about the film would be that the stream of narrative can sometimes break so that they can make Hitchhiker-Guide-to-the-Galaxy exposure about how things are, where they are, but that is the evil needed and better implemented here . Apart from this, good characters, funny jokes and a better average social commentary are packed in a funny bow. redneck / ghetto trash bin and it's proud ... if you are educated and cultivated anyway and you see how our country tends to be out of control, foolish, god, look at this movie.
