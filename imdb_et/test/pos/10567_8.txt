This film is definitely one of the best of its kind. Victrion's age story about love and graininess. The depth of the nature line is one that most interferes with the inner emotions and hate of love, some very interesting twists, it must be a movie not only for the lesbian audience but for all viewers. I can't say much more, or I break a new experience for a new, young audience who might just get out. Another good job for Sarah Waters. It is also a great opportunity for Sally Hawkins to win audiences who only have a brief look at their talents in another Sarah Waters work, "Tipping the Velvet."
