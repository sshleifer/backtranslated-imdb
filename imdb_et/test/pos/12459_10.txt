The biggest Tarzan ever made! This film is made so that no other Tarzan has ever done. That's all you want in Tarzan's movie. No other Tarzan film ever depicts this character. I would say that if you have seen the Tarzan movie and liked it, you should see what you love, and if you have never seen Tarzan, you should see it and forget the rest.
