Wolfgang Peterson leads the thriller with Clint Eastwood, who plays Secrect Service Agent Frank Horrigan, who fits against a smart psycho (John Malkovich) in a cat and mouse game involving presidential protection. Mitch Leary (Malkovich) keeps in touch with Horrig, persuading the agent with fond comments about his abilities, as well as protecting the secret service in the past. Agent Lilly Raines (Rene Russo) tries to hedge Horrigan; but he is the main force to stop Leary's murders. Very good FX and fast paced keep the plot. Eastwood and Malkovich are great. Russo has the chance to get your attention. Rounding this strong cast is: Dylan McDermott, Fred Dalton Thompson, John Mahoney and Gary Cole.
