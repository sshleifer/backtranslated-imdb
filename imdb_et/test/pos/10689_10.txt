This movie is surprisingly good. Ninja's sequences were incredible. I haven't seen all Sho Kosuk's movies, but it's probably the best I've seen. Probably the most impressive battleground was at the beginning when the ninja killed about 20 people, one of the most impressive ninja sequences. Another good fight was the police funeral, where ninja gives more people to bury. The last fight was also very impressive. I also liked the soundtrack of this movie. The story was good enough for the ninja movie, it really was different from other ninja movies. So if you're a fan of ninja movies, you probably like it.
