I agree with BigAlC - this film made me a lot of cultural differences and practices before I went to live in Japan in 1993. Tom Selleck does a fantastic job here, as always, and the film is very humorous and educational. I'm a big fan of Tom Sellec and he blesses this part with his usual charm and charisma on this part, bringing the movie to life so that I can't imagine any other actor being able to pull out. <br /> <br /> This movie featured some first-rate Japanese actresses and it was a lot of fun to watch them because they were communicating with Sellec - I can imagine how fun she was during the actual filming - Japan's fantastic place to go, or want to go to the party, see the sight or just try to get in.
