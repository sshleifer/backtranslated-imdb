His apartment was brutally murdered by a murdered man named Joseph Samuels. It seems that Samuels was visited by a group of drunken soldiers last night and one of them apparently missed a soldier. But when Detective Finlay digs into a deeper case, he finds that they may be wrong against barking trees, and that this crime is desperate for sad and whistle, anti-Semitism. <br /> <br /> Crossfire was born by Richard Brooks, a novel novel by John Paxton and stunningly stunning Edward Dmtry's novel Crossfire {origy titled Cradle Of Fear}, which boldly tackles anti-Semitism. When the authors were forced to reject the story from the original source, the novel is homosexual hatred, not anti-Semitism, largely due to RKO's superior Dore Schary and producer Adrian Scott, a kind of restless turmoil dripping into Noirish style. <br /> <br /> Three of Bob, Young, Mitchum, and Ryan, cast by Gloria Grahame, are cast, adding the heart of an emotional woman. Only on the third account is Robert Ryan's picture, his portrayal as bullying, the uniting Montgomery is on the top line and shows a great talent he had a lot. Ryan had a good reason to give Montgomery some of the best work, because he had served at sea with Richard Brooks, both men discussing the possibility that if a novel should be made for a film, Ryan wanted and played Montgomery, so Ryan's career was born. Gloria Grahame is also doing a great and cordial move, which is even more remarkable because she was hit by her abusive husband at that time. Stanley Clements was known to be violent towards him, and his constant presence around the set shook the cast, but Grahame, who was probably heading for real emotions, got Ginny's character and looked very light. Both Bob Mitchum and Bob Young come out with flying colors to really abandon the agreement on what really worked on Crossfire. <br /> <br /> This Crossfire appeared before the second 1947 anti-Semitic picture, Gentleman's agreement and looting over a million and a quarter-dollar office, some of its thunderstorm was stolen with the Fox Studio academic award winning image. Candidate Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor {Ryan}, Best Supporting Actor {Grahame}, Best Director & Best Scenario, Not Winning Anything, But Time Critics Appreciated This Great Change in American Cinema and Today It's High, Proud and Dark as a bold and wonderful job. 8.5 / 10
