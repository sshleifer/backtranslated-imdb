As with so many modern US films, the plot has to be a supernatural element, but if you just let it go, this story is a charm with a bunch of crabs and a kind hearted crab shell. <br /> <br /> We are being presented with an economically depressed urban scene where nothing can be found to be happy. The nature of Beau Bridges is indeed against the rise of the family, the balance of the zero bank and the brother who has been sold to the big business chain he hates secretly, but in which he is ready to rub Beau's nose. D'Onofrio finds the surface of his Bubba lifestyle rather than taking care of his blessed baby brother Joe and itching to escape from this dead hick city. The business of these bosses closes (much against his will) due to the lack of new customers, and is worshiped by his father's memories as he builds a tension towards his own self-destruction attempt. > Joey, who seemed to be passionate about his life, has disappeared at sea - it is believed that the drowning is - in an accident. His wonderful restoration to the Portuguese trawler whose boat they just built and launched (perhaps a symbolic angel crew) is a sign they have been waiting for and they all decide to give life to the last dice. br /> <br /> In this work, there is a beautiful embodiment that has attracted our attention as well as "The Shipping News". There are also other parallels with later work that call into question one remake. I like the simpler, less developed story of my life and inflatable actors who work in their craft rather than the stars.
