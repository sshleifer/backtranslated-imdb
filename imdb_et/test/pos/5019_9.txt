Why should this film be so good, but only gross, estimated at $ 95,000,000 and without NO prizes? John Travolta knows what he's doing. He knows he is Michael, a cigar smoker, a female and a magical Arabian angel who died to live with a woman and is now in the car "The National Mirror" and their dog Sparky in Chicago. Then it becomes a road tour that is both terrible and great. I don't even think death scenes (3 are accurate) make it a tear. Soundtrack is best than "Heaven Is My Home", "Up Over Bend" and "Chain of Fools". I have great expectations of this and I will say that in the 1990s it should have been a bit more respectful. Read my comment. Hey!
