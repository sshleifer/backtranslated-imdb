I love dr WHO so much! I believe David Tennant is the best that Dr has ever shown and Billie Piper is the best companion! I liked how dr and the rose had such a relationship and a great relationship and dr got a few times closer to express their love for rose! Unfortunately, it only ended in two seasons. I miss the heaps of roses and I think the show is not the same without Rose! But David's still laughing and happy to see him play this fantastic role! I appreciate this show 110%, it's FANTASTIC! Graphics and monsters in this show are wonderful and each story is different, but somewhat united and I have actually learned about the love, the world and the relationship of this exhibition. Therefore, it must be one of the most fantastic exhibitions of all time!
