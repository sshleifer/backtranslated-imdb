Big Fat Liar is a great view for children of all ages, even adults. It was a great time for me to watch this movie and recommend it to the 10-year-olds and under the kids. The laughs never stop and the adventurous plot is pretty good! Frankie Muniz is funny and Marty Wolfe is fun! Generally, a beautifully crafted film for kids to enjoy and just enjoy.
