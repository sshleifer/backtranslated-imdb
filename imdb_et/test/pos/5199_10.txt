This film does for infantry what Das Boot did to Submariners. If you appreciate Das Boot, that's all you need to know. <br /> <br /> This is a well-made cinema. Parallel to Das Boot. Basically, this German lifestyle "Stormtrooper" infantry company will leave the garrison in an idyllic Italian seaside town and will immediately pull into the chaos of the decaying Russia. A good war film outlines the nonsense and cruelty of war and at the same time gives us an overview of the experiences and important humanity of these fighters. This movie does it. The film is full of drama and action, and so is the level of entertainment.
