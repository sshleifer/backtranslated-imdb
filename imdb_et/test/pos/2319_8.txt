The first minutes of this movie don't make it fair! For me, it's not funny until they enter the bottom and these fun characters start gelling. I was born and raised in Norfolk, Virginia and met my "different" sailors - I even married one! Most of my favorite movies are just funny, not topical, independent of sex or violence and fun every time I see them. The Day of Painting, Bruce Almighty and Down Periscope are still funny even after I feel a heartfelt dialogue. Kelsey's Grammar with His "God, What I Love This Job!" It was sincere, genuine and lovely. Rob Schneider is hysterical because the team gets him back up. I'm still surprised by the size of this fishing vessel! I see why people living in this life would mark uh-but not his documentary, and I just love it!
