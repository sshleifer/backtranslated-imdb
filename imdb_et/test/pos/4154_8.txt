The Golden Door is a story of a Sicilian family trip from the Old World (Italy) to New World (America). Medieval man Salvatore, hoping for a more fruitful life, persuades his family to leave his home country in Sicily, takes a painstaking journey through the roaring seas and lives in a country where rivers are supposed to flow milk. In short, they believe that the dreams of their well-being will be fulfilled in the new world. The images of the new world are optimistic, smart and very imaginative. Silver coins come from heaven to Salvatore when he expects him to be prosperous in the new world; Carrots and onions that are twice the size of a person have been shown to be harvested to show wealth and health, and the rivers of milk float and flow through the thoughts of those waiting for what the New World brings. All this image is surreally intertwined with the characters and helps to complicate the sharp realism that the story brings to the audience. The contrast between this image and the reality of the darkness of the Sicilian people gives hope when they are on the ship with the New World. <br /> <br /> The New World of Travel is hitting almost completely in the dark, especially when the seas are tempting and almost killing people. In the darkness the reality I referred to is the Old World and the journey to New World. The Old World is depicted as somewhat poor and primitive. This is shown by Salvatore to sell what he has left (donkeys, goats and rabbits) to get the appropriate clothes he needs to enter New World. I thought it was quite interesting that these people believed they had to respond to a certain dress code so that they could be accepted in the new world; it was almost assumed that people had to morally fit to fit a particular stereotype or form. The most powerful picture of the film was when the ship left and drove to a new world. This shot shows a top view of people who slowly separate from each other, depicting the separation of old and new worlds. It also said that people were torn out of all that were familiar, wanted to separate from their previous blind living conditions and wanted to enter a world that made more promises. <br /> <br /> As later contrasted with how the new world looks visually, the Old World, which is a bright and blurry New World, appears dark and grim. I thought it was particularly interesting that the Statue of Liberty would never be shown through the fog of Ellis Iceland, but it was hidden. I think it was a deliberate choice of leadership that seemed to apologize for the meaning of the shape of freedom: "Give me your poor, tired, hungry" jokes about what these people had to go through when they reached New World. When they arrived in America, they had to undergo quite humiliating tests (i.e., delousing, math, riddles, etc.) to prove themselves suitable for New World. These tests completely changed the perspectives of the Sicilian people. Especially, Salvatore's mother was the most difficult time to obey New World rules and laws, feeling more corrupt than respect. If their dreams repeatedly gave hope and optimism about what the New World would offer, what the new world needs, reality and rude. Salvatore does nothing more than his attitude to what he felt, that the new world would be similar to what the new world actually felt to him. This attitude was usually shared by everyone who traveled with him. The arches of their character deal more with expensive dreams that are very upset, and the blind reality that had to be accepted. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be a strong comment to enter heavenly and civilized society. Prerequisites are cleanliness, marriage and intelligence. Compliance with these rules is to prevent the dominance of diseases, immoral behavior, and stupidity. Perhaps this is a comment about how America has learned from the failures of other nations and so purposefully designed to ensure that these plagues were not infested or destroyed. Although the rules seemed rigid, they were there to protect and help people.
