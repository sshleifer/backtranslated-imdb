When Melville "Pierre or The Ambiguities" hit bookstores in 1852, his first edition of "Moby Dick" was earlier, the public response was similar to the "POLA X" IMDB review. Newspapers even published titles like: "Melville Insane!" which of course was not. But when comparing the writing style found in "Moby Dick" and "Pierre", the latter finds that the latter has abruptly left the first simple and often deceptive style that emerged. It is obvious that he mimicked the redundant style of forgotten Victorian novels, which included his immortal "Moby Dick". However, he was not happy to point out what product his publishers wanted, and it would certainly have sold. His version of Victorian romance was perhaps complicated, cynical, but excellent in synthesis. Alternative title: "Uncertainty" is quite appropriate. As Pierre looks and thinks he finds the truth, we become more and more uncertain about what to believe and with whom. In search of happiness, he becomes more and more unhappy. <br /> <br /> "POLA X" is an exciting adaptation of this novel set in modern or near modern France. While in some ways it leaves little imagination and graphically shows us the inquisitive relationship that Melville could only suggest, the ambiguities that make the novel and its message attractive are completely tactical. The questions that it raises are such that some movies have been thought to ask, but the answers are left to the viewer. <br /> <br /> I recommend reading a novel that is much shorter than Moby Dick before seeing this movie. I hope more people will discover this hugging movie.
