Recently I bought it on a DVD, as I didn't hear it and like Robert Carlyle. <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie does not intend to express Hollywood's special strengths, saying that although the special effects were good and the actor was good too. <br /> <br /> I found the movie to be nice and don't regret buying it at all, after almost 2 hours it's just the right length for this type of movie. br /> <br /> Don't expect explosive action from start to finish to be a fairly balanced movie with a decent event!
