Just, Goldeneye is one of the biggest N64 games so far. The learning curve is almost perfect and you still play it with your friends for months, because the multiplayer mode is nothing extraordinary. <br /> <br /> The one-time fraud procedures require a certain amount of skill rather than knowing which buttons to press, and the Aztec Challenge 00 agent level is amazing. <br /> <br /> All in all - this is the best game I've ever played on N64
