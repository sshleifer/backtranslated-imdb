I hit "On Run" in the New York screening room and was immediately appalled by his true independent spirit. In part with Michael Imperioli and John Ventimiglia from Soprano, "On the Run" puts us in a 24-hour wildlife in a city that is ever sleeping, as we follow an introspective salesman who is suddenly struck by his long-time partner - out of prison. In fact, he has escaped from it and is "rolling" in search of some activities and a glimpse into life in the midst of a large metropolis. Building on the great performance, this film gives the old feelings of the 70's so that both characters discovered themselves again when they look over the city, bumping into wild events and locals. On a particular side of New York, which seems to be vanishing, there is a great sense of sensitivity and humor. I predict this is a cult class that requires discovery: future viewers should definitely give a trip at night.
