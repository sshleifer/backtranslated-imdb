I thought the interaction between Crystal and DeVito was great. The film is more away from the wall, but there are still unforgettable features. Ramsey as "Momma" is vulgar and up, but also very funny and effective. A person must be quite terrible, why else should someone think about killing their mother? Now Crystal is her husband - she is a "bitch", everyone wants her fire, so her role, albeit small, is effective, as it must justify Crystal's ridiculous "writer's block". Although there are certainly dark moments, this film is not frustrating and, despite murderers, requires the protagonists to feel that they have also redeemed their qualities. <br /> <br /> In general, this is one of the funniest movies I remember, one that I don't want to watch many times.
