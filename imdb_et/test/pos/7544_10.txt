Alistair Simms is a miracle in this. He will do such a good manager. The role given to George Cole has been made for him. So casting this film was perfect. I think it was one of those rare cases where everything was clicked. story was good, comic dialogue shouted and older prefect girls joy! Every character you are happy with is even a villain. Why we can't make such movies anymore. Basically, it is very English comedy with good movement and flowability.
