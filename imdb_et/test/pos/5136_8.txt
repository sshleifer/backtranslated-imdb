I highly recommend this movie to everyone. My son and I read the book first and then saw the movie. Although the book was better (in my opinion) the film was still great. My son and I agree that if we love the version of the book, we liked it better than the end of the book. The landscape is just huge and the soundtrack is black. The fact that Jimmy Buffett has a small role and music is a plus. Luke Wilson does a decent job on his job at Delinku and there is a lot of what I mentally imagined. Delinko would look out of the book. I'm surprised that it didn't work better in the theaters and I'm looking forward to the DVD coming out.
