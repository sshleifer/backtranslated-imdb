Okay ... time to think a little. It has been 2 years of flamencine because I made my initial comments that praised this top-notch footy comedy ..... and the damn thing is still not done on video or DVD (or even on TV!) !!! !! <br /> <br /> Does anyone know why not? Is the BBC style error an original copy deleted / deleted / wiped? <br /> <br /> Hear that you are responsible for ITV - now hit the DVD !!! Do you even realize how fun this program was? This makes "Mike Bassett" as bad as the current pants of the Spurs team. <br /> <br /> Rant over. To date.
