Although this film destroyed the career of director and screenwriter Michael Cimino and bankrupt United Artists, it is still one of the best films ever. There are many reasons for premature rejection of this movie. Among them: its length, technical problems, the dignified abuse of animals - the list goes on and on. And yet this is the movie that captures something. This is a classic example of natural storytelling similar to Strindberg - its moments last as long as they actually happen without being amazed at the good cinema. It is a real moment in your anger, love and war (and hopelessness). Anyone who appreciates film and storytelling should see this movie.
