The Scandinavians are pretty good to laugh at my empty breath, huh. <br /> <br /> Making a movie here was incredibly careful, every framing, every death observation, an element of every color palette, every entry into the street cleaners who took it to the peaceful emptiness of this world. <br /> <br /> In fact, I think I would have found that the general feeling of emptiness is overwhelming if his absurdity was not really funny and relatable. Like when Andrew tells his boss that he misses the kids and looks and the boy laughs and half-door, it's a sort of sad but real reflection of working with people, spending 7/8 hours a day with them, seeing more of them than the people you love, but ultimately knowing deeply, they do not give you the same concerns and yours. <br /> <br /> It could have been a movie that Coens had done when they were born in Oslo and not in Minnesota. I think their humor is more aggressive and surrounded by cinema in the past, but they have the same technique and their movies have the same feeling that life is quite irrelevant. <br /> <br /> I'll stop before you talk to take the bus to the winter in the desert.
