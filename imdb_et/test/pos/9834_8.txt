It is true that there are some goats for who wants to find them. However, they are not important. <br /> <br /> The main feature of this movie is watching veteran experts. Kristin Scott Thomas is beautiful and plays a good part of a strong woman, but hurt. The same goes for Harrison Ford, who is the same boy as Kristin for women. They hurt our spouses of adultery, but they are uncomfortable, but one where they support each other. How they create their hurt feelings and humanity on the screen is why they are such searchers. The viewer cannot help but feel what they feel, nor can anyone help if they are together to rejoice. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are a number of activities involving angry corrupt policemen, but they just spice it up a bit and are not an essential part of the movie. <br /> <br /> For the music lover, Dave Grusin offers a great jazz-based trumpeter with Terrence Blanchard. Like actors, Grusin shows why he is one of the most sought-after music consultants in filmmaking. Blanchard shows why he is one of the premiere trumpeters on the scene. <br /> <br /> Not for film lovers, blood and gore lovers. But for those who want to see a lot of what binds us, look at a beautiful English actress with big expressive blue eyes who can act like Harrison Ford, Dave Grusin, and Terrence Blanchard's endless soothing show, it's a move to see someone you love . Preferably in bed. <br /> <br /> I thought it served at least 8.
