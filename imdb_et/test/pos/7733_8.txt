I saw this movie like Skywalker02, but when I was able to see it again and through formal film training, psychology and life, I have time to take my hand and start beating me. with the film. I remember that the charge for the service cable TV channels almost died like a polterge when it first came out, and many other popular films. I felt it was not worth the noise and the constant "airtime" (I know that the cable is not really in the air), but I was very young and there was no drama about the adult situation and it shouldn't have been working. But the movie's recent viewing has enlightened me on film. I think Susan Surandon and Molly Ringwald probably learned the script together and I would be surprised if Surandon had been instructed by Ringwald during this project. Other ringwald projects, albeit good, are not his potential depths in this role. Surandon laughed, as did Raul Julia. Cassavettes and her husband gave acceptable performances, but I sometimes testify to becoming a mediocre actor. Effective movement and constant movement occurs during many scenes, but generally I see why the story may require a more subtle change of dynamics. <br /> <br /> All in all, I can't find this movie "take me out and drown me" as Skywalker02 would have believed. I think maybe the right psychological training and a little more difficulty in strategically placing your home life, along with some film courses, this film looks different. I would say that if you feel a bit melancholy and want a simpler life, and you have had a part of your marriage's mismatch between dysfunctional families, perhaps this film can provide more information and entertainment than you think. I think it's classic and I find it much more fun than conventional movies, which should share many of the same elements, such as the conditions that concern me, what I am interested in, some extraordinary performances by Jack Nicholson, then burned ceremonially until something not left. (How can such a film be given more attention. Talk about boredom.) The best thing, don't take my word or anyone else, watch a movie and support our industry.
