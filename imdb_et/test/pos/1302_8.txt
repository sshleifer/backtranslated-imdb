It's nice to see a romantic comedy that doesn't have a prissy man's leadership that has both male and female leadership, and although the story is a bit long and a little clichÃ© that you can't help but like. br /> <br /> I think this story was a bit hasty, but it prolonged what would have made the story even longer. Better for other romantic comedies, such as 100 days with Mr. Arrogant, and perhaps associated with my supervisor. <br /> <br /> This would be an interesting introduction to the Korean cinema, not as big as my sassy girl, but still good.
