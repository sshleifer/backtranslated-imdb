Ironically, such an entertaining sci-fi movie by John Carpenter's "The Thing" makes it a mysterious, sacred and dense plot of land. It makes people such as "foreigners" or "Armageddon" disgruntled to look at the special effects of the viewer, while their plots rotate around the tricks that muscularize the laws of physics, single-sided lined with testosterone, heroes with enough artillery to conquer Iraq and pathetic attempts to inject "meaning" into the screen barrier with "emotional sequences" that only help to further listen to the viewer's intelligence. Of course, the highest tragedy is that such lobotomized films are also the most popular. I think there is a reason for this, although it is not very comforting. In our culture, there is an increasing trend to "give up" to the media passively - we put ourselves in the pictures we see without separating the single brain cell, in order to understand the work that the job is trying to do. This way of thinking is becoming increasingly dominant in all arenas; even once the sacred print media is diluted thanks to the nasty reader's response theory that passes through our schools and the "tabloid brigade", which unites our magazine shelves, whose mentality seems to be invading the once-respected mainstream press. Nowadays, we just turn off the switch and think about "pause". Is "The Thing" a "good" movie? For a rare person who still evaluates his / her faculty, the term "entertaining" would be more appropriate. His plot keeps one thought, its end is uncompromising and has some redemptive statements about human paranoia. In the following observations, a noticeable lack of depth is exemplary, but the tense story remains overwhelming. Of course, "Citizen Kane" it is not, but again the sci-fi was never a thinker genre ...
