Why is it better? Because it's a real comic for dark vision. Since the images are inventive and unlike the first, it is the moments of real fear and sin. The first was too much Jack Nicholson shticki, too much Prince music and uncomfortable "romance". There are three instead of one villain. Not Robert Wuhl and the leading lady are more than just a beautiful face. In fact, Pfeiffer is the # 1 attraction of the movie. His transformation is what drives the current theme, talks about peace of mind and madness, good and evil. It becomes really frightening. Costumes and makeup are great. Danny DeVito Penguin is inspired and upset, not just a nut. His circus gang is one of the comic strip elements (in addition to this gigantic party). Max Shrek is the only sign I would have softened, Walken is a pretty hammy like a ruthless businessman. Danny Elfman's score is perfect, as usual, and Siouxie's and Bansheese's song ("face to face") is easily one of the best songs of any film, perfect music artist and film music. The least comic movie, it's horrible, doesn't look like and requires a second and third view like a fun park. Bravo Tim Burton and Cast!
