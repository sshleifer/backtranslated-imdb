I just watched it early on Harold Lloyd's short film with his "Glasses" Movie DVD "The Harold Lloyd Collection". He is actually a partner with Snub Pollard as his partner who discovers Bebe Daniels who fills himself. What he discovers is that Lloyd and Pollard tend to drop fake rings that are "lost" to many customers. I'll stop and say it was pretty funny, especially when Harold and Snub entered Bebe's work and encounter some creepy contractions and put on costumes like Snub to try out Bebe's outfit. Not too much slapstick, but what was there was pretty funny. So with this comment I recommend Crooks Dishonest?
