John Huston made many remarkable and memorable films. Those most frequently and easily reminded were released long before his passing in 1987. It was, however, the year that reminded us that Huston was still on the front of his game, as demonstrated by the faithful customization of James Joyce's acclaimed short story The Dead. "<br /> <br /> A long time ago, a very wise man, called Doc:" Didn't the dead "seem to be particularly lively and brighter than any other Dublin story?" I think it is. The story and the film both contain some of Joyce's social comments and criticisms, but mostly paint a warm and loving portrait of Ireland's Joyce, so he was often kidnapped and would soon leave. <br /> <br /> Huston's behavior, Gabriel Conroy, protagonist, understands the world when he sees it, nothing else is an illusion, is just remarkable. To claim that the film has no plots, this point must be abandoned. As with any Joyce Dublin author, the plot is not necessarily - The plot is just a means of delivering the protagonist, but in addition to the seemingly inadequate action, there is little honest dialogue in the Joyce Quick Guide to support the director, Huston's ability to translate what Joyce puts into words is probably the biggest triumph of the film. d, thoughts ... Gabriel's discomfort during the dance ... all of these intangible assets jump into life and come to the viewer's grip on Huston's imagination. To argue that Huston has softened his writer's criticism of society, he misses it again. Although "dead" can be painted with a cheerful tone, the satisfaction and pretense of the film's characters is only a comment on the lesser extent of society: we are the old aunts of toddlers; embarrassing drunk; sore throat; the sad sadness of the husband; even a self-disappointed middle-aged man. <br /> <br /> But The Dead confirms its title. It's not a dark story. Nor is it really nice. For a moment forget the lively and dead snow and the symbolism it contains; forget the dreams of the life that Gabriel wakes up at the end of the movie: only Gabriel has the illusion of destroying himself and his world that he can really go ahead. This is the centerpiece of the film. This is the center of our lives.
