For the first time I posted the first user comment on this movie and said it was nonsense and it didn't make sense. I'm not doing it. Campfire calls are a thoroughly enjoyable film (now that im 2 years older and I watched it last night). Artists were famous but not too famous. The action itself was more than acceptable, it was quite good. I appreciate the film for every movie segment. <br /> <br /> 1) Black and White Scene (AKA- "Hook") It was rather useless, it seemed good, but didn't hold at all, the only disappointment, I don't think it was even in the segment. Here's a scary-meter. <br /> <br /> --- --- (Poor) <br /> <br /> 2) RV Story (Forest Honeymooners) It is possible that all the stories are the most entertaining and well done by breaking conventional caravan scenes. But it was intriguing, you think, "Where did I knock on the door" .It was intercourse and not too scary. --------- (Very Good) <br /> <br /> 3) Little Girl Meets Psycho This was a smart addition that left EXTREME to a minimum of fear. A few minutes were the most fun, dont get me wrong, it was still fun to watch. Real horrible and can happen to someone, so see who you are talking to. <br /> <br /> --------------------------- (very good) <br /> 4) Ghost Tale (Man can with rubber)? Not the best, it was not too atmospheric for a strange story. It was strange, the aspects were pretty good, playing music and screaming, but everything was too real to be terrible, even though it was good, it was quiet and bloody, and could have been a better idea. <br /> <br /> ------------- (Acceptable) <br /> <br /> 5) End (4 missing teenagers) These are 2 attractive guys and guys talking you talk through the movie. The best thing about the movie is final, it gives a great impression, the end was completely unexpected. Look at it, it was so well done, realism was remarkable. <br /> <br /> ----------------------------------- (TOP NOTCH) > <br /> 6) FILM GENERAL The campfire calls were more than I used to, I really like it so much now that I buy it on video, making it a really fun scary movie. the trash you see these days, like many, im dissapointed that it didn't really go anywhere, it was a direct video, it was better for me than all the leap "ho rror" you see these days. Overall Price for Campfire Tales <br /> <br /> ----------------------------- (Very Good) > 8 out of 10
