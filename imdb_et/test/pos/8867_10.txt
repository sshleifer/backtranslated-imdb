Throw the mother is not out of date, it's as funny as it appeared. A truly eccentric comedy that doesn't try to be too pleasant and is better off, full of memorable laugh loud lines. Even small characters are well-written and beautifully played, such as Billy Crystal's best friend of friend and Rob Reiner, a beautiful companion to Crystal. A little crazy and a lot of fun.
