Without any good details ... as a somewhat provocative ... TV movie, there seems to be a consensus among users that there is no "blame" here. <br /> <br /> I don't agree. Yes, the young male lover of Beverly D'Angelo, played by Rob Estes, may be young and horny (and good looking) because she doesn't get as much as she wants from mother, it doesn't mean she can climb to bed and have sex with her daughter. OK, he can use the excuse he just wanted to watch on the TV, but I don't buy it. People must be responsible for their actions. Not only did she go through the line when she was having a very vulnerable job when she was allegedly "responsible adult", she said, "Your mother never needs to know about it." How Responsible was It? Yeah, that's a good flick, but he got what came to him. Don't joke yourself that what happened was "someone's fault."
