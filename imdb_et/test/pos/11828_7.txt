I don't think this comic was as bad as some think. Of course, I was only five years old when he came out. But I found it very entertaining at that time and still gave him the opportunity to watch. Batman and Robin, whom Adam West and Burt Ward expressed, had a nice touch and gave him the feeling that I felt familiar because I also watched the 1960s campy live show "Batman". This comic also introduced some of the new twists I had forgotten, such as Bat-Mite. Looking back, I'm sure he was as annoying as many think, but he didn't bother me much. The best I remember, his voice sounded like a cross between Dumb Donald and Orko. Gee, I don't know why? :) Anyway, give it a look if you can and your own mind. You may be surprised.
