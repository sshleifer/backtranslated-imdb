While reading some other comment, I have to agree that some (very few) shortcomings found in this genial documentary about one of the twentieth-century twenties (Billie Holliday, Bessie Smith, Edith Piaf, Judy Garland and Mercedes de Sosa) are justified. Because it was originally a 6-hour plus TV documentary about your career ("ESTRANHA FORMA DE VIDA" (V) 1995/1999). Amalia's inner world is much more and more understandable. As for the subtitle of his songs, I am for that! Although music, voice and performance can be - is! Universal, in words that are just begging, has so much poetry. I think that was the conscious choice of the producers. They were aimed at 200 million Portuguese speakers in Brazil, Portugal, Mozambique, France, Timor-Leste, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Canada, the United States, South Africa, and St. Petersburg. Tome and Principes, Goa, Daman, Diu, Venezuela. Luxembourg, Germany and the rest of the Portuguese-speaking diaspora around the world. As for a woman, she did not live to see this shorter version of the DVD, but was given a preview of "Estranha Forma de Vida". And it looks like it's been pleasant to her. Very much.
