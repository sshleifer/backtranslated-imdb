One of my favorite movies, when it is turned on, though I admit it once in Foxtel last year. <br /> <br /> Despite the age of the movie, it doesn't seem like this and the story, even when it was made thousands of times before I felt fun. The story was one or two little niggles for me, but I watched them and enjoyed the movie that it was. <br /> <br /> Generally, I give it 7/10
