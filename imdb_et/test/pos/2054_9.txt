I had never heard of this movie until it appeared on cable TV and I don't understand why. Gene crosses Arnold as a movie hero! Geena is a former CIA assassin who is brainwashed and gives her identity as a school teacher in a quiet family life in the countryside. She continues this life for 8 years with her husband and daughters. Clues will come to him that he may be someone else, especially if someone tries to kill him. His former employers seem to have discovered that he has never died and wants to make sure he does it. He hires former police officer Samuel L. Jackson. Together, they form a pair that is as fun as Mel Gibson & Danny Glover. When Geena finally recycles her memory, she goes through a killing machine she's ever had with the song "She's Not There". Next, Geena and Samuel must go after the bad guys and hopefully stay alive. Throughout the rest of the movie, Geen must decide who she really is. Is killing an unknown machine? Mother / school teacher with quiet family life? Or a combination of both? Especially since bad guys grab Geena's daughter. Big scenes set up with any Die Hardi movie!
