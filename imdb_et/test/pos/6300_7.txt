The film is really well done, big and searchable and passionate. You can say that every shot is thoughtful and perfect. For cinema lovers, this is a particularly good time and they should especially be able to appreciate its beauty and passion for the cinema that is placed in it. <br /> <br /> It's hard to put one label on this movie. It's not really a drama, it's not really a thriller and it's not really a comedy. Instead, it is more of a film of its own style that does things in its own way. This may not necessarily follow the cinema rules and the combined elements of many different genres. <br /> <br /> But as the film's main character, the movie gets partially slow and boring. The artistic style of management tries to hide that the story is actually quite simple, and it is rather that the film relies solely on its style and the overall atmosphere created by the film. It does not make the film terrible or anything, but it just prevents its true absolute vision. Partly knows the film as he tries to be too poetic and tries to let the pictures speak too much. It just seems a bit of an attendance, though for most movies it works beautifully. <br /> <br /> It includes some great camera work and unique storytelling that makes it both original and a great movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 7/10
