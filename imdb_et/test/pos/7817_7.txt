There are several comments that comment on this movie. Suffice it to say that Alex Cord plays a strong lead against Robert Ryan and Arthur Kennedy. I am interested in the fact that many of you may not be aware of the (at least) two existing versions of this movie. In the US version, Clay McCord's Governor receives an amnesty from Lem Carter and then redeems him out of town. I agree that the end is less than satisfactory. But the original Italian-cut Clay McCord rides out of the city (arms-free when he has turned the pistols to the governor) and is busy with bounty hunters who have slowly destroyed the bandit city of Escondido. Bounty Killers are excited when they share a $ 10,000 reward, but are disappointed to find a McCord amnesty agreement in the corpse pocket. When they go away, they hear they comment: "If this amnesty continues, I'll start hunting for the buffalo!" . It alone takes time to pray ... the second to die and put it on equal playgrounds, such as Keoma and The Big Gundown. Finally, the Italian section says "FINE".
