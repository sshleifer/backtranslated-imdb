Wow, Stella's shorts are great! Many patrons of the state and Stella, TV show. I never knew that Stella could have been better if they were on the TV show Stell or even on the Comedy Central Presents: Stella. I also didn't know that short comedies could be good. My favorites were Pizza, Racking Leaves, The Woods, and David held a meeting with their long lost cousin Greg. I think everything David was most fun about. His funny if he doesn't make sense. I like short music. This is something that I pay close attention to. They always had a good music taste. I wish they still made shorts, either, or brought back. I hope they will continue to have a good and funny comedy.
