I just bought Zhan on DVD (outdated) and it was a great movie I have to say. Not really exciting, from a gaming point of view, but definitely exciting and witty. I don't think I've seen Andy Lau's better form. And the editing of this movie was very good. Check it out now when you are a fan of a Lau or HK thiller / action movie!
