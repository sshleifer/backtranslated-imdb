But not too clean. And not too messy. "Judas Kiss" cries a new noir thing just right. The high-paced and nuanced score rounds up a complex story full of sex, betrayal and solid lining. Inspiring work around. Partially HalHolbrook (his best work), Gil Bellows (Ally Mc-what?) And Carla Gugino (the best of the family fatale ... smart, funny and ultra HOT) ... I'll give it 9 (out of 10) and that's because 10 should be reserved as Humphrey Bogart and Coen Bros.
