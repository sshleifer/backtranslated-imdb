This movie is not just a big title, it's just the biggest drama I've ever watched. The viewer is pulled back to a movie with 5 young men working together to overcome the impossible odds, Sean Astin like Billy Tepper is great with great supportive roles from the Terrier, Wil Wheaton and Shawn Phelan, Gosset and Astin's characters make the movie so much better. As time goes on, the film keeps the accumulating momentum and the discomfort that no young actor in the film world made after this wonderful movie.
