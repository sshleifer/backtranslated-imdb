What a joy. It's really a parody. Only the French can do it without coarse. As a result, you spend a really good time watching Jean Dujardin, who plays a fool. Most of the film stands on its shoulders and it is wide enough for this film to be good. He has the perfect way for a James Bond guy who doesn't match Mike Meyers at Austin Powers. The dialogues are also good enough to keep an eye on the spectator with lots of stupid jokes that are really perfect. Both women, who have the main parts of the film, carry the comparison with the main character and this was a challenge. There's really no graph in this movie, but it's not expected in such a movie. You just want to smile for one hour 40 minutes and that's just what the film can do. It deserves success in France
