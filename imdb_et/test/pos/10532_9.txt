"Wax Children", which is also shown as "Killing causes", is an interesting mix of genres. Some may think that genre purity can only be good, but for me eclectic symbols are a lot of fun. It is also a combination of thriller and popular action, and a combination of historical masterpiece and ethnic tolerance. This movie is built on the star of my favorite actor, the perfect constellation of Armand Assante, but it is also marked by the shooting star action? Hal Ozan. We saw him recently in the HBO TV series "Sex". "Wax Children" is an audience entertainment, but at the same time it is an eternal moral for ethnic tolerance. This is a good way to organize well-being. Discussions about the current concerns of our days can be made with attractive tools, as this is a very positive aspect of the "Children of Waxes".
