What can I say about this band, I was 68 years old, I was a ten year old boy, I grew up with Blues, though my dad, those guys from Midlands, Country Rock, Heavy Rock and Blues, I wish I could see them In the early years, I was lucky to be there in 79 (Knebworth), which was the best concert I've seen so far, I hope this hot full version at night is most likely. This CD gave me the opportunity to see the boys over and over, The Song remains the same, but this CD gets down to things. <br /> <br /> Long live Zepp.
