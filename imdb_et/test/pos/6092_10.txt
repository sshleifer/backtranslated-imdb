I've seen a couple of movies, but it's exceptional. You have to look at it more than once to really understand it, it is emotionally very complicated, explores love and passion in the most extreme and his cinematography is just breathtaking. The character of the count is very passionate and tragic without having to raise his voice or leave his bed, the film is completely cast and fully functional. The film has such mathematical accuracy and perfection that is rare on these days. It combines action, love, tragedy, drama and politics together. This movie is impossible, the whole jump and all the prizes can't do that justice. Hats for Michael Ondaatj to write an incredible book based on it.
