It's halfway to be the best movie. The opening part of Hollywood's "social message" films is totally brilliant. It's a rebellion from start to finish. The second section, which introduces us to the main characters of the story, is also very large. We get a lot of great comics, top performances and dialogue is really dynamic. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler Warning!) <br /> <br /> The one who thinks that the movie is very disturbing is the end that I find to be in conflict with everything that went before. My interpretation was that this film took mickey out of all the foolish prejudices and small town rumors and national tabloid sensations. I loved that the film won that the person's sexuality was NOT determined by their hobbies, peculiarities, fashion or anything. And then all the movies and stereotypes that the film first illuminated will end and end. It turns out that everything was 100% right !!! It was very disappointing what really was a great story.
