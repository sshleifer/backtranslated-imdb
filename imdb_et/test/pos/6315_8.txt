Consequences of Love: There's really something special about this movie, but it's hard to put your finger on it. It is a love story from different but never seen before. It has several love themes through the film. One man loves a younger woman, the younger man loves his older brother, mafias love money at all costs. These are just some of the intertwined stories that you probably have in the assumption or not, where and how it ends. All the great Sophia who is a tempting balm who is a central tattoo of the film is cast. The simple but emotional work of the camera collided with an ever-changing soundtrack that mixes low-fixation horse and lush orchestral works. The style of the movie changes beautifully, using multiple styles without ever being full. Love is never as diverse and powerful as talks about different conclusions. The director is married to an old and new rich Italian classic.
