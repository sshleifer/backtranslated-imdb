It has been a few years since this movie has been seen, so forget most of the details. But I loved it at the time and found the plot intense grabbing, top of the heart stopping. I remember that in 1979 there was literally a place in the theater. <br /> <br /> Jane Fonda plays a Los Angeles reporter, Kimberley, who steals a local nuclear power plant accident. He wants to publicize this story, assisted by his hippie cameraman (Michael Douglas) who has photographed the event, but the embarrassing conspiracy is trying to cover it all. Jack Lemmon is absolutely wonderful in the role of the controversial central manager of the nuclear power plant, which has broken his company's loyalty and "right things", reporting a dangerous situation. His facial expressions speak of volumes here. <br /> <br /> In addition to being an appealing and nasty tension, this film speaks of Jack Lemmon, his character and his great performance. As for Jane Fonda (I was a big fan of it at that time), I suspect she went on from her anti-war protests to the nuclear industry. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to be a nuclear tactic. Despite Chernobyl and Three miles of the island (they are different types of reactors), our Canadian CANDU reactor is safe and well respected worldwide. I'm not hesitant to live near a nuclear power station in about an hour's drive, where my friend works as a highly competent engineer. Obviously, they shut down every small problem, regardless of the financial loss. I sincerely doubt there are any conspiracies there. You can hardly imagine any of the leaders or highly trained entrepreneurs who are willing to risk any collapse or anything ... it's absolute manor maintenance. Of course, the moral here is that it does not save costs or efforts to build a facility or ensure its continued safety. <br /> <br /> If we want our Western lifestyle, we need to get our energy. For those who claim that nuclear power can never be made completely safe (of course), they may have to work voluntarily as a coal digger or return to electric horses and foolish days. <br /> <br /> Enjoy all this fun and very intense movie, probably based on (loosely decorated?) true story. This is a real cooler, a thriller and perhaps a (?) Killer, but please do not take your attitude towards the operation and safety of nuclear power plants.
