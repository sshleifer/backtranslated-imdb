Falcon and Snowman are a true story of two college-aged L.A. children who become Soviet spies. One that Penn played was already a drug smuggler to his eye. The other one, played by Hutton, puts the position in a space industry company, where its task is to build the ultimate secret cable for man. There he learns from some of the black tricks used by the CIA for foreigners that America does not like. Don't forget that the movie was set in the early 70s, according to Vietnam and Watergate. The Hutton character decides that he learns to betray his country and persuade his friend to join him. Neither of them is long in the brain, it won't be long before they do against their heads. <br /> <br /> It's not a thriller and it's a pretty slow pace. If this is not a problem for you, you should rent it.
