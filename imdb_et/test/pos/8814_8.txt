Every time I watch this movie, it just makes me go out and a good night! My husband uses a "weekend landed" call to go out psychologically before! and so I ... sometimes. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great debut for a writer / director - a well-made companion! <br /> <br /> Actress is great, all characters are plausible and bigger than life! "Strange" scenes are a pleasure to watch, Jipi running Mr floppy flashbacks / explanations / visualizations are all great! The Huuuuuuuge pub scene, where everyone stands and starts to sing a national anthem, is also ridiculous. Here's a lot of comedy - Howard Marks' spliff politics call is fun! <br /> <br /> Oh God, you just have to see it. Think of you, I felt the film made the use of ecstasy somewhat surprising, but hey, is it the truth? At least the film is not ashamed of this fact. I think the film also has a good message for it - don't take life too seriously, you'll ever have to shoot down your hair. And of course the conversation in the pub, when Moff tries to explain to his companions that he has come out of drugs, is a definite reminder that when the good times come down, you know that the party is over! <br /> <br /> This is sometimes a very clever movie when using this camera, lighting, etc. It was a real cinematic element and a great feeling of companionship, love, clubs and drugs. <br /> <br /> Get out of the 'rat race' !!! <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
