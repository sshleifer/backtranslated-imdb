"Hoppity Goes to Town" was the second and last full-length animation film made by Max and Dave Fleischer, who create a parallel universe for Disney. Although Disney movies are well remembered today, both Fleischer movies "Gulliver's Travels" and this one are forgotten. <br /> <br /> "Hoppity" is an enchanting original, not an adaptation like the first picture. This is a big plus, you might think. No, critics, rarely on Fleischer's side, started to do this. Yes, the story isn't as dense as "Gulliver", but how can you hate a movie that captures yourself so joyfully? <br /> <br /> It's full of great musical numbers and a very inclusive story that would be a crime that reveals. The characters are loving and charming, and there are hearts in this movie. <br /> <br /> Indeed, Fleischer has survived here and never did it again. Most of the time would be dedicated to one reelers after they have been refueled. It is a shame that they did not continue to function. Who knows? Their next attempt may have become the masterpiece they wanted. <br /> <br /> **** from the four stars
