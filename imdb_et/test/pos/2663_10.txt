I'll write this review right after listening to Stanley Kubrick's death. This is a big loss and I write since 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY because I feel it's the perfect Kubrick movie he most remembers. This is a picture that is not another, not just revolutionary scientific literature, but a way of conceptualizing the film. This was probably America's first "art" film and it has inspired George Lucas and countless other writers and directors. <br /> <br /> In addition to visual superiority, the reason why film produces so many discussions and analyzes is that so many people have so many different interpretations. Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, his co-author, saw, but we never found what went through their minds. Of course, this "message" is skinny, how future technology takes over humanity and decides our lives if we are not careful. The end of 2001 is the hope of our revival version of a star-child flight back to earth. For many, it is pointless, but the attentive filmmakers understand. <br /> <br /> Although in 2001, DR is not an evil, dark humor. STRANGELOVE or CLOCKWORK ORANGE, or contain strong, eccentric symbols that have filled their earlier works, such as PATH OF GLORY or SPARTACUS, still feel he would have mostly remembered it. If anything, HAL is his most memorable character, dangerous, murderous and artificial. It was half a decade ago when Hollywood was still rubbing dull music and just waking up to the French and Italian cinema New Wave. Kubrick was a manager who made great movies on his own terms, his time and admire everyone else. He misses.
