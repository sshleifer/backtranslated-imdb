Haggard: The film is a real story of life with Ryan Dunni and his girlfriend who cheated him, with the help of his two friends. 1. Skate boarder who lives in something and 2. trying to be a funny scientist (which doesn't really work), played by Bam Margera and Brandom Dicamillo. <br /> <br /> Haggard The Movie also has a lot of Jackass characters, etc., but to say it is written by Bam Margera and Co is a very weak test, it seems to me that it was written when he was bored or if did not pay much attention to the project. <br /> <br /> Movies also stars Bam girlfriend Jennifer Rivell, who plays Glauren, Ryan's girlfriend who basically deceives her, again very bad Jennifer, another actor that some people may be interested in, is Steve aka Hellboy, played by RakeYohn. Be a story, again bad behavior, nor does this character really have a lot of features on this film, which basically makes it very boring. but the worst thing is that the Raab character, the voice sounds like a smoker who has basically sore throat, and I think he could have improved! In general, I think that the characters in this movie are not a story, as in one scene, it would be a single sign, a minute later, a different scene, a different character. <br /> <br /> Let's say it should be a movie, a kind of documentary that hasn't been played as a documentary with players, shows it's an inexpensive attempt to make a movie in your free time. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the movie, we are losing focus on the main character Ryan Dunn, though much attention is paid to Bam and Brandon. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is OK, if you laugh at things it's not very funny, stupid stunts, terrible action and occasionally naked scene!, I also think there are too many scenes with no just talking and just music! 7/10
