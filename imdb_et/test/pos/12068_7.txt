This show is actually pretty good. Like all TV shows, it also has good episodes and bad ones. <br /> <br /> I have read where people compare this example to married children, and I think this is a similar exhibition for a new generation. However, thanks to what was expected and promised to be married to children, this exhibition was taken to very extreme locations to show that it was actually a television show and was not to be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> At home, luxury is a bit more realistic. Parents talk to each other, as parents often do, tell their children one thing when they turn around and do the opposite. <br /> <br /> Of course, some content may be considered controversial. But I find this exhibition really trying to maintain a sense of honesty. Like it or not, there are many families like this. <br /> <br /> Each episode teaches a "valuable lesson". It's just that sometimes the lesson is that you can't find the perfect solution to every problem a family can encounter, and sometimes the solution is to choose from two of the worst. We all know that in some cases, the only purpose for your children is to keep your children from the big problems and hope that they learn directly from the wrong. <br /> <br /> I respect writers to show life to life, rather than having some magical ending, as the Cleaver family had always been.
