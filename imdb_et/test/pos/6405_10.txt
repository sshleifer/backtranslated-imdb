Such a shame that this wonderful bright spot on a small screen was for writers and actors such as the wonderful scenery that was the ultimate escapism for those who were locked into the land, the sunshine. Many actors went into bigger things ... another indicator that there was something strange missing. I lived in Columbus, Ohio, with a very large family of "NO NO !!" with all my (now ex) husbands. every time it is taken over via baseball transfer. <br /> <br /> Someone who wrote here was against "Rosanne" ... all of my ex and I noticed that BASEBALL !!!! Yes, FOX is wasting something wonderful what one and nothing will ever equal ~! Thank you for your memories.
