"Showtime" falls somewhere from the critics somewhere north and slightly south of what I waited a month ago when I first heard of comedy about Eddie Murphy and Robert Di Niro. Generally it was pretty good! Like "real life" crime or police going - and the plot, for that thing - it's quite illogical, but DUH --- it's comedy. Even when the special effects, moves, air races and skyscrapers blew, were the lower keys than the Schwartzenegger movie, I found it to be a bit tiring and redundant. 9/11 feelings aside, for me, all the pyro-techno hyper-effects were really old in recent years. Characterization, story, and tempting emotions seem to be sheep. I hope that a smaller amount of this in "Showtime" is a figure in Hollywood. Going down, decreasing the use of stupid and less used explosion buildings. <br /> <br /> Di Niro and Murphy are two of my favorites. Their screen presence and charisma - and even the depth of their character - has been a "joy to see" for years. This cannot be rejected here - they deal with the actors and are entertaining and attractive in this movie. I can't put my finger on it, but maybe explosions, excessive FX and all that reduced the end product? Perhaps perhaps it was something else or a combination of factors that suggests that the film did not achieve its greatest potential. Whatever it was, "Showtime" was entertaining - I probably buy a DVD when it comes out - but I felt like it wasn't all that could have been. At least not everything I was hoping for. <br /> <br /> Very good movie, but not a great movie. I gave it to 10 out of 8.
