The film opens with a director who talks to the camera and says she shows the story of the children of the Brazilian street whose families live in poverty and have to steal and kill for survival. In fact, the main character (Pixote) was only a 11-year-old street boy. The following was one of the most brutal, frustrating and terrible films I even saw. I saw it about 17 years ago (double count "Black Orpheus") and never forgot it. I think I never want to see it - it was just too much. <br /> <br /> SPOILER AHEAD !!!! The scene that does not leave me is when Pixote meets a prostitute who has to interrupt his hope. You can't see him do it ... but you get a quick look at what he brought out. It's almost 20 years later and just remembering that the scene is bothering me. SPOILER END !!!!! <br /> <br /> The film becomes more brutal as it passes and ends with the only option. What's more, in Brazil in 1981, there were stories like it was in 1989 ... and it is still today. <br /> <br /> Terrible brutal movie ... but it should be seen if you can handle it. . I'm surprised I got an R rating - I've seen an X movie that's less graphic. A 10.
