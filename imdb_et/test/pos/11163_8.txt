He is currently playing at the 2007 German Film Festival in Australia at http://www.goethe.de/ins/au/lp/prj/ff07/enindex.htm thanks to Peanutqueen and especially AriesGemini for showing his band's actors. <br /> <br /> In Australia, these films were in English, and French films often get the mainstream, while German films have still gathered such a commercial audience. But like BMW and Mercedes, when the Germans get that right, I like their movies. Like PQ, the time went so fast, a lot of people laughing at the public, as all 9 men and 9 women moved in 5 minutes of speed dating. <br /> <br /> Although many movies are over, one that I would have watched much more. It had the character and character development of the series. Given the time, I read through the AriesGemini100 review and refer to the participants I liked and their other work to keep track of them. I agree .... most of these participants go for bigger and better things. Some very good characters in this fine movie. I saw it in a program listed as a mockumentary. Mock or else it seemed very real. And it's pretty romantic. <br /> <br /> Viva la Deutcsh!
