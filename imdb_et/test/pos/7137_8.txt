Based on a true story. . The prerequisite for this film is to illustrate that through fairly common events, it is possible for an externally "decent" mother to become heroin addicted. <br /> <br /> *** semi-spoiler *** Some scenes are quite inaccurate - while others almost want you to "fix" yourself. <br /> <br /> Computer technician / graphic artist who has good relationships with young teenage boys spiral addiction after co-worker who is "drill" (- who can take and enjoy it now and again) - Then spirals addictive, leading he finally assessed the "street" dealers after he lost contact with his permanent dealer. br /> <br /> The scenes that show him that they are coming down and getting sick are often very real - especially the first real "night sweat" before he started to communicate with a man who just happened to have lost his wife in a bottle and insists that he has an internal radar to prevent such women. Some radars! But after some late start-up and strange behaviors, the boy puts him out of "what's going on". His radar is going to handle it more and requires him to empty his bag; he hits the roof and storms. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the excellent and open relationship he had developed before this tragedy, he was the first to find real evidence in his bag; then he looks around for a hose on his "clamp" - apparently his sensitivity to school hours is drug use - and when he discovers a big bathroom, he sweats it! DO NOT HAPPY WOMAN when it takes its next bath and its "lost". <br /> <br /> The child holds one back and puts it on the dining table - he goes on to deny - admits it and says it is no worse than a dope. <br /> <br /> The Thge boy does all the right things and calls his friends and generally puts him in a position where he has to come clean - when you give a penalty. <br /> <br /> The film takes the viewer through some rather difficult situations where the threat is not far away. <br /> <br /> Eventaully gets help from a professional organization and makes a cold turkey - you need to watch a movie to see what happens. . . .
