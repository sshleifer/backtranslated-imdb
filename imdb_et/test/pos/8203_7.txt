When "Net" was first advertised, the ads were ridiculous. When I saw it, it was really pretty good. Angela Bennett (Sandra Bullock) spends her day working with a computer and has never known her neighbors. Then, through a series of events, his identity is erased with the mascot of shady people and he cannot prove that he exists. <br /> <br /> Some parts of the movie are a bit far removed; you probably know what parts of the movie you saw. However, it is good to look at the existence of the Internet for unsuspecting people. I recommend it.
