Hayao Miyazaki has captured the imagination of young and old audiences all over the world, and her latest cinematic art is "Ponyo", a children's fairy tale lending from children's mermaid stories. Of course, like other Miyazaki classics, such as "Breathed Away" and his latest film "Howl's Moving Castle", "Ponyo" is full of creativity that adults can truly appreciate, but it is obviously a children's story as a recent effort. It is a magical story that is best described as beautiful and lovable, which aims to conflict instead of charm. <br /> <br /> "Ponyo" is a story of quiet fish of the same name. an underwater witch who wants to escape from the sea and become a little girl. When he does, he quickly communicates with a young boy named Sosuke. In the process, he enjoys strong magic and unknowingly throws the world out of the earth and the sea, and a giant storm sinks from most of the rock-top town where Sosuke lives with his mother, and it threatens to end the world. <br /> Like "Howl's Moving Castle," Walt Disney picked up America's "Ponyo" and copied it with an impressive western voice, even picking domestic products from the Disney band's Jonas Brothers younger brothers. (Frankie Jonas) and Miley Cyrus (younger sister Noah) spoke to Sosuke and Ponyo, respectively. Also Liam Neeson (Fujimoto's father, Ponyo's father), Tina Fey (Lisa, Sosuke's mother), Matt Damon (Sosuke's father), Cate Blanchett (Ponyo's goddess of the god), and fun elderly women trio, Betty White, Cloris Leachman and Lily Tomlin . It is certainly an effort to pull this film to an American audience and Disney is going. <br /> <br /> But the voices of Miyazaki film are of little importance, which is visual creativity. The fan of the transformations and the movement of fluid and fluid, the creation of a partially underwater fairy tale, must be Miyazaki's pleasure to work and perhaps even his entire motivation to choose this story. Highlights include the water droplets that Fujimoto sends after Ponyos, which move like living waves, as well as various other great sea animals and breathtaking storm scenes that make "Ponyo" like any other Miyazaki movie awing. <br /> <br Children's story, however, brings Ponyo's efforts to divinity. Discovering true friendship and love between Sosuke and Ponyo is warm-hearted, even if Noah Cyrus screams childishly when Ponyo enthusiastically involves human life, it may be a bit annoying. But as pleasant as many imaginative elements and loving relationships are very small. Earlier Miyazaki films have clear villains, but the "Ponyo" conflict actually shrinks when the story goes. Sosuke believes he has lost his mother at one point and has the idea that the world will go loose and that people should be ashamed of the sea, but "Ponyo" is mostly relaxed. Most prominently, this climax is despite all the common pleasures. <br /> <br /> "Ponyo" will definitely satisfy Miyazaki fans with their imagination and newcomers will still be captured by his simple but visually ambitious storytelling, but this is clearly more childish, the best for families and others who love fantasy regardless of form or target audience . It is not exactly what Miyazaki expected of his recent work, but it is definitely remembered as another of his beloved stories. ~ Steven C <br /> <br /> Visit my website at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
