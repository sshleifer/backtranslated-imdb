OKAY. Who ever invented this film hates humanity and wants to see them all cracking their throat. This "film" was absolute and perfect filthy. What the hell was the eye of strange old bags? Seriously, was he in some terrible drug and then he thought he could just control people? She ran around her evil eye and it was like? Do I have a nose hanging booger? What are you looking at? Do you like the sea witch or something? Everything and everything, though I thought the graphics were the upper border in the old trap. Because that alone would give it ten. But cover your ears when you look at it. The pure and complete evil from this film makes your ears bleed and the eyelids fall off. Who knows? You may even have a small small intestine. You're better fools.
