Hey, you're not alone! I remember Nicholas! I was only 17 when he was. I remember James Garner was one of the coolest actors and Nichols was such a big show. I couldn't believe it was in such a short time, I want to remember the last episode, I probably didn't see it ... there wasn't any vcr, so when you saw it, and if you missed one episode had disappeared forever, unless it came in the summer. Anyway, it would definitely be good if it appeared on the DVD, but I don't think many people even knew it. What a shame is. <br /> <br /> In a few years, Garner struggled with Rockford Files and brought Nichol with his friend Stuart Margolini to play his sidekick Angel.
