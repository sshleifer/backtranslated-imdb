Friz Freleng's "All Abir-r-r" is one of the best Sylvester and Tweety cartoons. Unlike many repetitive cartoon series that simply translate the same tired gags into a new setting, "All Abir-r-r" uses its concept. Tweety and Sylvester are domestic animals sent to the country after the train without supervision. Both the watchman and the witch bulldog are dealt with by Sylvester in his work. Sylvester and Tweety cartoons have always benefited from some additional participants and "All Abir-r-r" is a good example of how much these additional characters will help. Though they are not particularly memorable creations, they still place more obstacles on Sylvester's path and make a more interesting battle. This early Sylvester and Tweety short presses much better buttons and, although Tweety has often been forced by its forced shine, Sylvester and the dog are nicely violent angry, culminating in a surprisingly brutal climax, which sadly kills the final awkward non-quip by Tweety.
