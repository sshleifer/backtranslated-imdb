Normally, I am cautious about the films around the 6/10 mark of IMDb. I like to think that people know what they are talking about and know what they want. I think the trick is with an overview to approach "Hey, if I liked movies like this - would I give it a higher score than I currently give it because I don't like this type of film" Then people meet again differently, relying on greater value action or maybe a story or leadership. Anyway, I landed the plane here - I had rented this movie earlier and I had no time to watch it this morning. <br /> <br /> Wow! Watch this movie. I am personally interested in paranormal / reading a bit of deaths, so I was automatically hooked. I'm not sure there are some comments here saying that the cast quality here is wasted - I do not agree - it was great to do it here - I think it's the only time I didn't stay with Julia Roberts that it was good to see 24th Kiefer Sutherland (currently under review, serving DUI prison sentence) and Kevin Bacon for an interesting hair style. <br /> <br /> Overall, I liked the direction, the atmosphere, the actor, and most importantly the story, especially the karma idea, and Nelson Wright quoting "Everything we matter" so true. <br /> <br /> 10/10!
