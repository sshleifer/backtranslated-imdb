It is another western who is a greedy cattle baron who wants to displace small shepherds and farmers. It's definitely all done before and after. But violent men are something special. <br /> <br /> This is a special Barbara Stanwyck, who plays the role of vixen, as she often did in her later films. She's married to Edward G. Robinson, a dead man, who's a shepherd's baron, but Robinson is exhausted and there is a hint that his injuries might have left him impotent. Not important for Barbara, whose needs are fulfilled by her brother Brian Keith. It doesn't fit well with Dianne Foster, who is Robinson and Stanwycki's daughter, or Lita Milan, who is Keith's Mexican girlfriend. <br /> <br /> The infidelity sub-platform takes over the movie, but Glenn Ford is a tiny little caretaker, a veteran of the civil war, turning to his health to keep his own. She is a quiet western hero of every inch who makes a mistake when she repeatedly pushes. I almost hope that Wild Bill Elliotti's famous words will come out of Ford's mouth, "I'm a peaceful man." Vioilent would have been very suitable for men. <br /> <br /> Fifty were adults in the west, and the items were in horse-breeding that hadn't been studied before. Next year, Glenn Ford would make another West Jubal, one of his best, who is also investigating infidelity as a primer. <br /> <br /> Violent men have enough traditional western stuff and lots of addicted soap operas.
