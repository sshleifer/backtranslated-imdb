Then I like Rachael Ray. She is fun, sweet, fresh and joy to watch. I have to change almost everything he does when I'm a vegetarian ... but it's nice to see him with a program that shows more of his personality. After all, he is a television personality. I think it's cool that he is so welcoming to his fans and still seems to be on earth. The studio audience seems to be quite small, but it just makes for a more cozy environment. Some people have posted that the exhibition sucks. I think it depends on you and your own interpretation. If you notice previous episodes of a 30-minute meal, you will see a completely different personality than in recent years. I'm sure he'll find his comfort zone with this show. Good luck Rachael!
