it is about a murder detective who fights against a couple of young rich children who have nothing better to do than planning a complicated murder and covering it, they seem to see a seemingly police force. they attack the detective with planting tips and take them to the wild goose. it has a good plot with a few good twists at the end of the film, Sandra Bullock does a good job in this area than a woman, she is not sure and fights her inner demons, she doesn't seem to hold a man in her life, especially in partners leave him for some reason. All in all, this is not a bad movie, it will keep you from being very shocking.
