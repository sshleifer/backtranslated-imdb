A low-budget but memorable shocker that turns out to be a weird theater. A vulnerable, naive sister, Charlotte Beale, arrives at a lonely mental hospital and is fully aware that the only reasonable people are murdered, despite the red flags that are constantly being raised all over her. The lack of a decent budget really does give the filmmakers a little more work than a sense of style, but also some cursory signs. The joy of this film does not come from the shock of the film, which is quite annoying, but from a strange atmosphere. First of all, we have a misleading woman who thinks her baby's doll is real. There's also a careless judge, a war-shocked war veteran, and old Mrs. Callahan like grandmother grandmother. A young patient named Allyson gives a new meaning to the term "nymphomaniac". A big boy named Sam is a bit slow after a patchy lobotomy and Jennifer's veins suddenly between catatonia and violent outbreaks. The only other sensitive person on the ground seems to be Dr. Masters, but does he have a secret? <br /> <br /> "Don't Look In The Basement" is a great example of low budget movies. There's not a lot of land, but it's cheap for the movie. Several cast members turn to memorable performances, especially Betty Chandler and Annabelle Weenick, and the way the director adds little strange details to the film can really hold you. <br /> <br /> "Allyson's" Phone Man's Scene "" is classic all the time, and especially the Dr. Masters facial expressions when he goes over the edge of the movie finale. Brownrigg also uses a very cheap soundtrack, where there are several musical hints that really prove the signs that accompany them. My favorite language is a "crazy" chip, a sitar that twangs, if one of the patients does something pathological. <br /> <br /> Also, the wonderful way Charlotte himself hysteria in hysteria, where patients reveal Dr. Masters is just another detainee, and then suggests that CHARLOTTE is also a patient who is allowed to commit his disappointments (he has a little grip in reality, why would he not doubt his lack of telephone service or outside the community?) The scene where Charlotte manages to stop hardly in life with Dr. Stephens with the toy has to be one of the biggest moments of low budget horror. Yes, "Don't look in the basement" can be a very good "Zadia Z" trash "American Beauty".
