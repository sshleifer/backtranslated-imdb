I loved this movie almost as much as the original version! What kind of teenager does not go through what Scampi wants, seeking independence from his family away from the distance? .Lady and Tramp look almost exactly as they did in their original function. They did a good job with these two voices, also considering the fact that the original vocalists are probably dead. But I think they should have given more lines to Lady, Annette, Colette and Daniel Oh, at least they had a sense of keeping the same landscape in the original film.
