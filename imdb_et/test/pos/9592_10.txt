For all interested I have managed to get it from eBay DVD (not yet received - any day). <br /> <br /> I have desperately received it, even if it doesn't like the quality of the VHS DVD. So please contact me and maybe I can help you. <br /> <br /> Frankly, it is ridiculous that I had to wait almost 7 years to see it again, but the boy is worth it all. <br /> <br /> All my companions are desperate to see it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'll post later on quality. <br /> <br /> Just do a search on eBay if you want these guys. it is there to buy
