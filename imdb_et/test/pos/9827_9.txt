I really enjoyed "Random Hearts". It was shocking to see such a low rating in IMDB, but it was the son's gout and all that. I'm a big fan of Harrison Ford, but I have to admit that he was badly cast in the movie and the reason I gave it instead of 10. However, Kristin Scott Thomas was great. He was plausible and beautiful, despite being half a movie as he wept for days. Have the "random hearts" been better? Of course, but it's very worth seeing.
