I turned to 13 when Elvis hit his first RCA hit in 1956. A year later, Buddy Holly stepped in to give the king some races. One of Buddy's greatest talents, in addition to her unique singing style and her singing ability, is often shrunk. Buddy was also a qualified guitarist, developing his unique rockabilly style for his Fender Strat. Gary Busey is trying to catch this Buddy personality aspect. There were other modern master caliber guitars like Chuck Berry, Carl Perkins and Eddie Cochran, but Buddy's talent is often overlooked. <br /> <br /> As others have pointed out, Busey's leading force is the success of Buddy Holly Story. Not only does the script play with the life of Buddy, but it even includes several anachronies for the popularity of two-year-old Buddy, basically 1957-1959. One thing to remember is the scene where Buddy and Maria watch a 3-D movie. Buddy is embarrassed and tells Maria that it is never the last. It's just a fad. In fact, 3-D movies were not in circulation at that time. The 3-D flowering period was in the early 1950s. By 1955, the fad had already faded. Another example where a bit of research would have been enough to make the story more plausible. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it is difficult to distinguish what actually happened in the city legends surrounding Buddy's career. The story of how the crickets got their name may not be apocryphal, but it certainly didn't happen as the movie shows. Another problem with the film is how the Buddy's parents are depicted. The Buddy's parents certainly supported his musical career. "Maybe a baby" is credited to a friend's mother and has entered the song into writing. <br /> <br /> It is good that Buddy's biggest hits were used in the movie, but I miss my favorites, "I'm looking for someone to love." I'm proud that as a result of this movie, Buddy's music was released to listen to the new generation. Her legacy is one of the best from the role of rock 'n'. Rave on, Buddy, rave.
