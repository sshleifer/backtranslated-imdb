We all enjoyed the movie. This is a very charming family film with lots of fun bags. It was fun to see Austin musicians, Charlie Robison, Joe Ely and Robert Earl Keen, as well as the actions of famous actors Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis. Emma Roberts is especially cute in the movie, but all the kids are good. The West Texas landscape is great, as is the full music of Texas artists. The last half seemed to me a bit far away, but my son was interested in the whole movie, which is not so often with him. Something about the story was enchanting for the kids. Having shown calves as a child, I really liked the end. This is certainly not the way it actually works if you don't have the bladder.
