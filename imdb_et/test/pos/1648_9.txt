Shtrafbat is a story that only Russians could talk about in World War II. The biggest conflict in the whole conflict has been ironic that after the war, the silver screen is the least visible topic. Although the Western Allies' war aspirations have been shown in almost all possible details and ways, the East has been omitted or the work has been left for only a few old propaganda films that are little more than the historical value of the material. <br /> <br /> There is no way that Shtrafbat can compete with the Band of Brothers in every detail, but does not want to look at the screen when examining small visual effects. The fact that the soldiers are Russians is a big enough reason to forgive less striking battle scenes and you can focus on the most interesting story. There was so much difference between the East European War and the nature of the Russian army that you might want people to produce more dramatists from other fronts and armies. <br /> <br /> Shtrafbat is by no means perfect, but it has some rare specialties that increase the overall rating. It tends to break the myths that humans have about World War II, the true heroes were the Russian people and not their leaders who sent them to missions where they could only die. Another big bust of myth is that it depicts an enemy who does not take his weapon as an equal human being - a progress that is hard to try in many recognized films. Shtrafbat shows how the war in the east was a war of survival, and how-a-clashes crush people.
