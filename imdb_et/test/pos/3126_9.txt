Wagon Master (1950) Dir: John Ford <br /> <br /> Production: Argosy Pictures / RKO Radio Images <br /> <br /> John Ford Brings Public Company to Utah Desert to Filming West and Reaching it with a Little Classic . Not John Wayne, there are no contradictory anti-heroes, no psychological research, no fireworks, but picture gem. <br /> <br /> This piece of the band stands for Ben Johnson (like Travis) and Harry Carey Jr. ). They are horse traders who come to town to do business, as shown by the Mormon group led by Ward Bond. The group starts the track in their settlement, but they know that the probability and the harsh terrain are against them. So they hire Travis and Sandy as masters of their wagons for their journey. Last year, medical vendors and his two female cohorts (Alan Mowbray as a doctor, recalling his appearance as a "daughter" to My Darling Clementine and Joanne Dru) are traveling. Tensions are added when the murderous Clegg gang reaches the wagon train. And there is also an atypical (Hollywood) meeting with Navajo. <br /> <br /> Most stories and humor are driven by the clash of ideals / cultures; first between Travis and Sandy and Mormons, between Ward Bond himself (he is constantly trying to push his desire to curse and be a reformed man), a doctor and his ladies and mormons, a wagon between train and laws, and finally, everything and Navajo. There is also a classical Ford scene robbing a dance that expresses one of the themes he has signed for civilization coming to the border. <br /> <br /> Again, there is no duke here, but I've found Ben Johnson, especially the young ones win Ben Johnson to have his own interesting screen. He comes with his backdrop, with this drawing, and also when you see him riding on all the tricks. He is great here in one of his early credited performances. Harry Carey Jr., although it has been around for some time, is still quite raw. Ward Bond is his usual wonderful, spooky self. I found Joanne Dru under the shock I see him, but here he is mercilessly unnoticed. Other familiar faces include Jane Darwell, Francis Ford, and Hank Worden, who play "stupid" as he starts searching a few years later. It's no longer amusing here. <br /> <br /> There are some absolutely remarkable photos by Ford's partner Bert Glennon. Not only are the typical master classes of landscapes and horizons, but some bloom in shade and a handful of scenes with (sun) light. Soundtrack has a legendary music group Pioneers of the Pioneers. Can't get more cowboy than it is. <br /> <br /> *** Â½ of four
