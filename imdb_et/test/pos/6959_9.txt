I saw this movie for the first time on the day of illness from school about ten years ago. Compared to lifetime movies that I usually watched, it was an amazing favorite for a moment. <br /> <br /> I've seen it twice since then. I think some parts are a little cheesy, maybe the plot could use something else. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it is a fantasy and reality for children with uniqueness and warmth. Magical realism is similar to Amelie and the heart of Wonder Years. In spite of the special development of your taste, I still find the subtle magic of this film, the affectionate signs and its simplicity.
