Like most people who have been watching James Bond 007 movies. Most people never knew that Thunderball was originally the FIRST 007 movie that appeared, but after Ian Fleming wrote this story with kevin mcclory and jack whittingham. The other two authors took Ian Fleming to court and WON CASE provided evidence that ian fleming introduced the idea of ​​SPECTER (Special Rapporteur on Combating Opposition). So instead of making Thunderball, they did (fleming, broccoli, saltzman) dr NO. <br /> <br /> This movie was the best because Sean Constable could come back again. paid more than 5,000,000 euros for NSNA. Irvin Kershner and Sean Connery had a set of problems that was true. But this movie was all where I think (Thunderball, the license to kill, Dr. No), these are the favorites of my bond series. David Dryer was hired for special photo effects while working at Bladerunner before he ever said anything. A $ 100 million yacht makes disco volante, looks like a canoe. This movie played the best foreign movies just dr no. Klaus Maria Brandeau held this neurotic business with a peaceful way, with little enthusiasm for his power. Barbara Carrera was great as a blush of fatima. <br /> <br /> Music was better than any score that did not include John Barry, making background music in most of the bond films. Michel Legrand has not played in the US compared to the Europeans, he has been playing miles with Davis and many other great jazz musicians over the years. It's a bit boring, but the 007 theme, which happens about 3 or 4 times in the movie NO MAY NEVER BE SO FAVORABLE, I like it more than the original. <br /> <br /> 007 is once more <br /> <br /> Timothy Dalton explained it correctly, I thought YOU MAY BE SUPERMAN or SUPERHERO, he must be human and have feelings. He was the ultimate BOND EFFICIENCY. But Sean Connery proves that he can still play the role that follows him and others, I put him in 75 so that he could still pull out the role of the villain in the MCCLORY 007 movie.
