I believe I share the same psychological prospects with Kieslowski in the world. He's a Polish, I'm a Dutchman, but we share a synthetic mind: the world is not empty of a metaphysical central coincidence. Hardly man or poet-prime minister, so that Poland could play its role as a social and cultural "low-pressure area" during the Second World War, being critical, but against Christians, but often not less critical of itself. In Kieslowski's worldview there is innocence and guilt as symbols of Catholicism: White and Black Madonna. In Rouges, this black madonna judge fell in love when he was a young man. The rebounds are magically realistically intertwined with the present, though completely random, for example, the camera just slips across the street or to a young judge who passes by a young woman's car when she accidentally hit her dog. What we are going through in the same camera over time is what we will understand later. His love was unanswered, so his life was not as he planned it. He lost the ability to love other people and animals. As a judge, he feels that he is actually spying on other people's lives and, when he retires, he will continue to do so by creating neighbors this time. The younger woman's innocence and sense of righteousness (literally), which inadvertently came to her life, restores her better judgment and precisely because she spontaneously admits her spy behavior to her neighbors and the police, accepting and even holding down the stones that are out through her windows thrown out. In the process, history repeats itself between this man and his beloved wife, although this time she is old and the woman is not the same. Kieslowski could twist it a bit, because the old judge was his ego ego and was told to be hit by Ir√®ne Jacob. Both women play an equally important role in their psychology, one (!), Who has their own heart and soul, and that is why they can do or break even if the old man! Just as "air in the air" is or is God, bringing them together. Coincidences are also * casual or just luck. There must be a mystical, supernatural or theological source that affects these senselessly profound vows. The research book dropped and another example was opened on the exam question page. Or the moment the old judge spoke to his young woman, suddenly the doors outside the opera street open and cut off the windows. The gigantic picture of a young woman predicts it on television, after a drowning accident over her channel. These moments are effectively emphasized by the liturgy with the human voice or with it (Van den Budenmayer).
