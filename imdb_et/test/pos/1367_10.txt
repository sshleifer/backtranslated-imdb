The story includes an ancient demon that is released at Halloween night in a small town. Throughout my life I have never seen such a cheesy movie, but it's so d ** m entertaining that you can forgive your bad behavior, influence, direction and script. This is the best movie created for the Halloween season from the original Halloween. And when they introduce Linnea Quigley's character for the first time, she's naked with a 5-minute shower. The goodness they just can't get is better. Rush and buy this tape right away. 5/10
