Musical bios are all cut from the same fabric. Hopefully the struggle will succeed and the girl will eventually win, but this - the Irish tenor's life, Chauncey Olcott / Jack Chancellor - is more than just an ordinary effort. It is a great charm and great sincerity and it is played beautifully by all involved. Dennis Morgan is in a good position as Arlene Dahl for his love. Andrea King's supporting force Lillian Russell is much better than Alice Faye's leading bio show on her career-dedicated film. William Frawley touches an aging tenor master William Scanlon and Sara Allgood is beautiful like Olcott's mother. George Tobias, Ben Blue and Alan Hale support the good. There are over 25 songs (real treasure chest): come down with your evening star; My Nellie blue eyes; You tell me about your dreams; Wait until the sun shines, Nellie; Do you love me in December? Silver moon by light; Minstrel Days; Polly Wolly Doodle; Natchez and Robert E. Lee; Miss Lindy Lou; When I've Dreamed; Wee Rose of Killarney; Press your hand; One little girl; The small sky; Mary; Sweet Innescarren; Tiddely Um; When Irish eyes are smiling; Mother Machree; Kerey mess; Room in My Heart; My wild Irish rose. <br /> <br /> Although the film earned only one Oscar nom - and earned it earnestly, he also earned a gradual design of artistic trends and costumes - it's great and lovely at Technicolor. <br /> <br /> The reasons why this is not on video may be due to the fact that the time spent in the Minstrel Show atmosphere is at least one quarter of the film, which is highly political with a large number of materials for the contemporary audience of INCORRECT. It's historically accurate, but it's a real gem and it's worth looking for. It leaves one warm glow.
