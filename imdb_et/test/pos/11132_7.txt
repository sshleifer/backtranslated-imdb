A recent study in the UK about children confirmed the concept of this film 27 years ago. It is more than anything else, young people want to grow to be someone famous. It used to be a doctor and a firefighter that the kids wanted to be. Now everyone wants to be famous. Celebrity is the story of a group of children from the New York High School of Performing Arts. We saw them for the first time, then we took classes and learned about life in the next four years. The film has a lot of fine features, but ultimately you will feel a little unhappy. <br /> <br /> Alan Parker's bold style of production is pretty good. The film is classified as musical, but more than anything is a drama. Musical numbers and dance routines break out here and there, and Parker keeps them as realistic as they would be filmed. The action is with most exceptions with some exceptions. Stimulation is a bit away, especially at the end of the movie, but by that time the story is already wrong. <br /> <br /> First of all, the hearings at the beginning of the movie should have taken a couple of basic characters out. It seems unlikely that someone in the department would stay and listen, it would hit the road. Some of these people just don't look to be gifted or interested at first. When the first year of classes goes, the film lives in a nice groove. Communication between students and teachers is very good, and it leaves you with more desire. The film will eventually lose itself when we see more and more pupils' lives out of school. Some of these people are not just looking after. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake in the movie is to make Ralph Garcy's character so outstanding. This guy is awkward; self-centered jerk. "Professional holes" when proudly announcing their comedy during routines. The audience should somehow feel this man and his tragic personal situation, but I just hoped they would throw their ass out of school. Irene Cara, Maureen Teefy, Paul McCrane and the late Gene Anthony Ray are the people that this movie is over. Try it the way I could, still can't develop such a movie like Gene Anthony Ray. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is good. It is memorable, interesting and full of bold scenes and performances. It may run a bit too long and maybe some wrong characters will develop completely while others will move in the background. Musical numbers are great, and even waiting until the end of the movie is a surprise or two waiting. Although it is not perfect, the celebrity gets a movie that lives in one way or another over many years. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The Hound.
