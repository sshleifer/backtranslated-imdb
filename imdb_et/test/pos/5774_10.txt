Hi, I was wondering if anyone is Broken Promise? I loved to grow this movie and looked at it every time it was. It has been for years because I've seen it and love to get a copy. I've checked the whole internet and haven't found it. If anyone has a copy to call for sale or sale, please send me to NoelGypsy@Yahoo.com ... Thank you and enjoy the great night! Christine --------- "Broken promise" was made to eleven-year-old Melissa Michaelsen, whose parents have left her and her siblings. Michaelsen, taken by the county, had to look helplessly when her brothers and sisters were shared and raised for different families. One of the children is even institutionalized. Juvenile Justice Officer Chris Sarandon joins Michaelsen for his family reunion under one roof. Broken Promise was originally presented as a General Foods Golden Showcase. It was the first TV show on May 5, 1981.
