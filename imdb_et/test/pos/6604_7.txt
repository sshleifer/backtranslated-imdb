Dogtown and Z-Boys are a documentary about the Zephyr skateboard team and their impact on roller skating. It also focuses on the history of roller companies. It was directed by Stacy Peralta, a member of the original Zephyr team, and was written by another team member Stacy Peralta and Craig Stecyk. The documentary marks the members of the Zephyr team and is spoken by Sean Penn. <br /> <br /> The documentary talks about the beginning of roller skating and how it came from surfing. It discusses the popularity of skateboards in the late 60s and 70s, its decline in the 1980s and its "revival" in the 1990s. Skateboarding was introduced in Dogtown, Santa Monica's poor side nickname, California. The Zephyr team comes from the Zephyr Surf Shop, which made the first modern skateboard. The documentary consists mainly of the original members of the Zephyr team who talk about the past in the Zephyr team, the races and their popularity and prestige. It focuses on three crew members; Peralta, Tony Alva and Jay Adams, three roller-skates and probably three best team members. <br /> <br /> Documentary interviews were usually on Dogtow's archive material at the end of the 60s and 70s. Very rarely do you see people actually interviewed, but if you do, they are black and white, while the archival material was colorful. I think Stacy Peralta used this technique to show that the documentary was from the past (i.e., the Zephyr team's award days) and not from the present. The documentary is a very fast pace, because we often see impressive skateboarding music from the era of resurrecting music (such as Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and David Bowie), and interviews tend to be fast and points. Knowing the skateboard (i.e., even knowing how to ride one directly on the ground), I was very surprised to find this documentary so interesting. The reason is that this dock was more of a Zephyr team than the actual sport of roller skating, so if I couldn't deal with roller skating, I can associate with the boys. Because it is done by the actual team members, it gives it a bit deeper and more authentic. <br /> <br /> All in all, I have to say that this is one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. This gave me a whole new look, not just for the Zephyr team, but for roller skating as a whole. For those who love skateboarding, I can only imagine how it should be even more interesting. Ten and a half stars out of ten.
