The masterpiece of Francis Ford Coppola was an excellent end of the golden decade of American cinema. In the 1970s, studios had an atmosphere of tolerance, openness and progressivity, which allowed some of the best directors of the United States to make big films. I am not a historian, but all the events before the decade (some are the violent deaths of American political and cultural scenes, racial struggles, the emergence of the 1960s counter-culture, the rise of violence and death in the streets ...) influenced the vision of filmmakers who were willing to dare to be different and create entertaining and intelligent moving movies. Coppola's film is a strange mix of humanistic thinking and skillful filmmaking, following the parameters of war and adventure film, and at the same time digging them with the value of life, the cause of death, or the war of ethics. It is also a passionate work done against all the odds, crowned in the 1991 documentary "The Hearts of Darkness: The Filmmaker Apocalypse"; a film that went beyond any earlier reflections of the Vietnam War to reach the screen. It may not be Vietnam's definite film, but dealing with it Coppola ignored the formula of the classic melodrama found in two simultaneous Vietnamese films, "The Deer Hunter" and "Coming Home", or the last "Plato" and "War Victims" before Vietnam became starting point for making any kind of products of the genre, as fear of "Jacob's ladder" or comedy "Good morning, Vietnam". Coppola had the courage to take this economic and political conflict as a background in which every person was searched for answers every day in his life, without the dramatic consequences of this war being betrayed.
