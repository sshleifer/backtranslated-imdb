This movie will hit me emotionally at the end. Although the film's questions - interracial romance and adultery - were contradictory at this time, this film goes beyond the narrow parameters of the uniqueness of the novelty and trace of the near ground. Here we have a true love story written by this love-affair woman who speaks of a brilliant aggressive style that extends the virtues and glory of mad passionate love. I love the only confirmation of emotion that makes life truly alive. Jennifer Jones is full of grace and William Holden is just in the role of a reporter. A great movie that only such loving people can really understand and understand. And for those who are not yet in love, even with the hope that one day your lightning will hit you, life is worth living - because love is worth it even when for a short time - even if you lose - because love is "things" - The nature of life. This movie works for me. Warm feelings!
