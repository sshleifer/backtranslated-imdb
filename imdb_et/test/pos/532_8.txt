Sorry, "Star Wars Episode 1" did not give Natalie Portman's talent (and unquestionable comprehensibility) any justice. She was completely unused under Queen Amidala's name and when she was used, her makeup was terribly terrible. For "Anywhere But Here", he puts his godly man and acts normally. And not only can he do well, but looks good. I'm a little older than him (he's only 18 years old) and I have little or no chance to meet, but hey, boy can dream, right? <br /> <br /> While taking a good step in the film, this movie is entirely part of Portman. I've been a Portman guard from "Beautiful Girls" (where he was younger but cute). There will be great things for him in the future - I see it.
