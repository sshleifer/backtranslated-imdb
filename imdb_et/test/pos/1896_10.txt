This movie is funny more than one. It has action. It has humor. It has an attitude. That's all Dolemite girls, kung-fu hos! And that's exactly what the movie offers as a movie. Some of them are also bad, the microphone makes more than one fire and some "shocks" lie between the legs. But when you make this movie, who has the time to pay attention to these "details"? This movie tends to. Rent it today if you find it ... I had to see it, but I don't regret it!
