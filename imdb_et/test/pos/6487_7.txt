Society's successor Susan Fletcher (Hopkins) and his rich father, Simon Fletcher (Henry Stephenson), are scared that their young brothers Joan (Betty Philson) and Katie (Marianna Strelby) live in the Bohemian lifestyle in Greenwich Village with their uncle John (Milland) after their parents death (Susan's sister and John's brother). Simon has given up, trying to convince Johanna that he and Susan will take care of the children and use the use of private detectives to catch him either without entering into behavior or being unemployed and therefore unable to care for the children properly. Finally, Susan decides to take her own hands and go to the village of Greenwich by acting as an actress to try to get information and / or to convince her to understand. What he discovers, however, is that he not only likes a free and artistic way of life. John and his friends live and the girls are well-bred, but he falls in love with John quickly. Inevitably, his true identity will be discovered and he will face the challenge of persuading everyone on both sides of the custody debate, who should be with whom. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this movie and found that his very short running time (70 minutes) was the perfect length to turn this simple but loving story. Miriam Hopkins, one of the biggest in the 1930s - 1940s, is an actor in this film. His energy, style and healthy beauty are really capable of creating a pleasant character, although you know that he quickly draws the people he communicates with friends quickly. This is an earlier film I've seen in Ray Milland, and he was actually young and non-patriotic. (And probably three years younger than his co-star) His energy and carefree way to "wise girl" was a refreshing change in the behavior that he influenced on his usual, darker film. To be honest, although I am not usually a fan of children's actors, I really enjoyed two young girls playing Susan's wicked. They were confident and were really the gems of the movie. Unfortunately, I can't complain about any of the other films that both of them later were after, which is a shame because both exhibited a great deal of natural talent. <br /> <br /> "The Wise Girl" was a movie that was made three years after the Hollywood code was installed, and to some extent it was a fairly clear quick, happy ending and the supremacy and simplicity of the kingdom that the characters lived on. The alleged bohemian was actually a great devil where the artists lived freely or for trade and everything was very well connected. Fortunately, it was a light enough film that was charming enough to make it fluff and weak and just took a "smart girl" for what it was; a good old-fashioned love story that was as fun as it was pleasant. Unfortunately, today's romantic comedy / drama genre films are far less intelligent and entertaining, or I can't find myself in the classics all the time. 7/10
