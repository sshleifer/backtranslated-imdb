Maybe I'm one of the most terrible fans who thinks that the Asian overwhelming shockers in Asia are so redundant! Movies like "Ring" or "The Eye"? what is praised all over the world? just didn't convince me and they seemed more boring than scary. Well, this blunt opinion does not go to the South Korean gem "A Tale of Two Sisters". This is a stylish and completely complex psychological terrace that really gets under your skin! The plot underlying the local folklore story may be too confusing to make this film the greatest ever achievement in the genre, but the atmosphere and the increase in tension will certainly create a great sense of respect. This is one of the few films that it is impossible to label: "Two Sisters" qualify for both peaceful and intense drama and deep psychological portrait. In addition to the mesmerizing story, the "Two Sisters Story" also includes all the great elements that I feel that Asian horror films, such as weighty music, well-functioning and innovative camera work, usually do not exist. The house was a family event that is perfectly illustrated as a truly creepy place, where secrets and dangers lie behind every door. Several sequences (like dinner with relatives or appearing at night in the girls' room) are quite a lot of ether. They really made me feel uncomfortable and I believe I've seen my share of the horrible horror. "The Story of Two Sisters" is a terrible movie adventure and must be seen by Asian film fans. A small warning for people with a brief attention: this film always forces you to focus on your eyes and ears. It is also a film that requires repeated viewing, although no one can ever get 100%.
