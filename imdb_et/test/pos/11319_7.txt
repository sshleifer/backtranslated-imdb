I lived in London for most of my adult life before I moved to the state, so this movie was out and now seen in HBO. I disagree with anyone who thinks it should have been a Hollywood production, the UK team gave him a cooling and predictive atmosphere from the first day, and I was on the edge of my seat for the last 30 minutes, thinking what would happen to my home town. And, of course, nine months after the movie is released, 7/7. Yes, the truth is stranger than fiction. Having lived in both countries, it is also clear that in the UK it is likely to be much higher than in the US, Muslims live in the ghetto and isolate themselves in the UK, they are much more likely to embrace the United States.
