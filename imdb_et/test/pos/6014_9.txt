I'm not a big fan of the musicals in the movie. "Annie" was the stage I loved, but the movie was a flop. "Opera Opera Movies" (and I think there were three) didn't respond to Weber's production. But I loved it. The DVD is an honor for my "keepers". Although it is a customization of the film, it somehow captures the taste and atmosphere of a living theater. Bette Midler, always healing, is only an exception in this role. There's great music, a lot of laughs and even a tear or two. I've seen most of the great musicals of the eighties and nineties. Somehow I missed this one, so there's no comparison. But if it revives, I'm the first for tickets! But this movie is so good, I'm in a strange situation to think if the stage production measures the film.
