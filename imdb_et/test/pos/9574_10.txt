This is a more fun movie I've ever seen. But I've been laughing at a lot of movies. The reason for this is that the shine of Best In Show is not covered by impact or single-lining, but in complex and layered verbality. Improvised dialogue is so fast that you end up laughing not at every single joke, but only after several jokes rely on each other, each disarming your senses until the jokes run and you can't help to let go. <br /> This is a well-filmed movie, but what makes it extraordinary is an actor. At first sight I was impressed, but when I watched it after I learned that almost every scene was improvised, I was surprised. It was a great pleasure to see comics working from each other, out of jokes and completely symbolizing them. <br /> <br /> I imagine the Golden Days of the Second City were such.
