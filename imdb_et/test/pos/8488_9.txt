A few days ago, I saw a fantastic "Sand and Fog House" and I was impressed that Ben Kingsley's amazing power was in the lead. I decided to see "Ray" trying to understand how and why Ben Kingsley didn't win the best actress Oscar. After seeing Jamie Foxx in the role of Ray Charles, I agree with the Academy: she has really deserved the award. I like Ray Charles, I wasn't his fan, but it's an amazing Jamie Foxx similarity to him. The film is fully supported by Jamie Foxx, who participates in most shooting games, and her movements on stage seem to be like Charles Charles's reincarnation. In the story section, I saw an extended version of the DVD, too long, but also very nice, with many beautiful songs and scenes that mainly show Ray Charles junke. My biggest surprise was finding Ray Ray to be a heroine dependent and how he treated his family. Presenting her childhood through fragmented setbacks was a boring part of the film. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ray"
