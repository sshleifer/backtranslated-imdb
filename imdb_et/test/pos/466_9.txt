It's really a movie you have to see twice. When I first saw this movie, I really pulled that story. While most of the story goes inside the hotel room, there are stories that Buddy (Nick Drake, a wonderful hint) and Daphne share, take you outside your space and your world. Through your conversations, you feel the feeling of loneliness and pain that everyone knows. The music comes with the film perfectly, in the dark, lo-fi and intriguing. When you see the movie a second time, you get all the hints you missed for the first time, one of the best times I've seen for a long time. I hope that this movie can be found on DVD by a distributor to make it more accessible. Great movie, you don't have to be disappointed.
