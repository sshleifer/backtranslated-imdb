Peter Lorre turns his best performances to a Hungarian watchmaker who arrives at American Staes to make a new life for himself and one day bring his girl a big pond to be with him. Lorre's infectious optimism and brilliant outlook come out very efficiently, making the performance better when his face is burned in the hotel fire and if no one gives him the opportunity to work, he reluctantly turns to crime. Lorre's actor as an actor is rarely as obvious as in this film to her distinctive, good-natured immigrant, her depressing, melancholic, despised self, seeking the truth behind what she believed was America, to her understandable, intelligent, right than your average hood, his sympathetic communication with the blind woman he falls in love with. The story is well paced, has interesting turns, and gives Lorre many opportunities to shine. Director Robert Florey does a good job behind the lens, and all the supporting casts help Evelyn Keyes make a particularly good turn as a dark girl. I loved the end - and the truth - that shone with Lorre's character, despite all the negative things society had done to her. For a small B-picture, the man behind the mask is good at making this movie.
