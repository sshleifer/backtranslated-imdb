one of the best and most inspiring films of the different culture I've seen in the years. tragic and touching. worth a look. maybe a couple of times. We all know how brutal children can be. I know my and my brothers' experiences as children and this film hit my nail head. perfectly! Kite works amazingly and I have to do some research on the validity of this event. although this is done in cgi, it is still amazing and very interesting. to maneuver such a dragon so that it would be impossible with one string, but they make it credible. anyway, this movie has many turns, that is, i'm sure many, probably easy to understand, but they hit me before i got. which makes me a great movie! if you think of the whole movie in the first 10 minutes, it will destroy it. but it does so so smoothly that it's hard to guess even when it happens ... I'm a man and I don't mind tears flowing at more than one point in this movie.
