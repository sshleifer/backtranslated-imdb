This result leaves you with no desire. We saw it in Offenbach, Germany, and it's breathtaking. We only got cheap tickets far away, but we still had everything that happened. If you have the chance to see it, GO! It's worth traveling and if I was you, I'd expect a good half an hour after the sample to cool. The performances are breathtaking and there are colorfully dressed performers in the tent to disrupt, help, smile and make the whole tent alive. Music - Live Music !! - is as good as the CD version: perfect! I bought the DVD later, but there were less colored costumes at the filmed show. This is the tent atmosphere that sweeps you off your feet. A great trip for the old and young and a great movie
