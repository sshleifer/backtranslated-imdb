Yes, this movie was just fun and the actor was all over the top of the cast. Except for Shelley Winters, the German accent was not so big, but then it doesn't matter because she's barely in the movie. So if you're his fan! The two main stars of this movie are Laurence Harvey and Julie Harris. Now, before this movie, I saw that I was with James Dean only in the eastern part of Eden, Miss Harris, and I have a glass tape from The Glass Menagerie, which she made on stage with Monty Cliff and Jessica Tandy, so I wasn't sure how she was to be in it in role and boy, did he impress me. How was he? I love ham! ;-) Mr. Harvey, he knocked my fiction! I am now a full-time fan of Laurence Harvey! This hair !!! * cackles * OMG! It's almost like Burt Lancasters, this crazy messy look, it doesn't heal. He's young in this movie and so innocent. SEE THIS NOW! This is definitely my top ten! :) I'm so glad I found a copy that's all mine! Unfortunately, this movie is printed and very difficult to find in the video. : (<br /> <br /> Btw, look at the hospital room room scene !!!!! This is one of the best parts! Or if Mr Harvey himself is convinced that he is sick and he is trying to get his knee to kick, you know how doctors do this with a little rubber hammer ;-) Well he does it himself and his feet strikes and it strikes the table * hitting * Check your face, so innocent !!!! I can't describe it, but for all those who say he can't do very well and other cockamamie comments, check out this movie and see what he showed. You can over! If you don't, I'm afraid I can't do anything for you, you're hopeless. ;-)
