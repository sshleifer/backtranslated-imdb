I was watching this movie while reading a movie in Berkshire under a special preview. Michael is surprised to find someone who can finally understand him, because so far his brain palsey people think he can't communicate. <br /> <br /> Rory introduces Michael to the life he has lost. Rory is a weak person who does not let his condition (muscular dystrophy) reach him. they could ever dream. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie when you're in for some "entertainment". Watch this movie when you're ready to see something a little different. /> <br /> I strongly recommend it. Although if you are like me and tend to cry - take the tissues as you need them!
