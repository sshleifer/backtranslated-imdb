I've seen three Animatrix episodes and this is my favorite. The second renaissance already gave the weak universe a modest setback. The program was a stylistically impressive number, it just seemed stupid. I think this gives a special touch to this is the direction of Shinichiro Watanabe, the incredibly popular (and good reason) Cowboy Bebop leader. It has some of the best Bebop elements: slippery, sci-fi adventure, no-nonsense, a slightly apathetic hero who works for hire, head-to-head (more or less), and chase, all packed in an excellent film-noir package. Watanabe Tarantino-style slippery comes through all the gas.
