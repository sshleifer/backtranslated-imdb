It is a beautifully made film that balances weak human results (both before and after 1945) and the indiscriminate war on war. The use of the British Battlefield (a film that does not nearly represent the 1940s!) Increases, but does not reduce. This is a deeply impressive job that lived in my memory two years after I saw it, and I just bought it to look at accessories. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie (movie). Like Aces High, it alternates between viscerally exciting (or frightening) sequences of air strikes where the viewer can experience the real signs they want to take care of, as well as the unpredictable interactions on the ground, where a skilled writer and real life experiences inform some inclusive and moving events. It also highlights the fact that many people not only saw the end of one conflict in 1945, but the beginning of another, and even today we still do not feel the loss, bravery and sacrifice of so many unnamed heroes, or even worse off, without being able to to be human beings with all the emotional weaknesses that lead to the victimization. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is an experience that will bring you friendship from the heights to the depths of jealousy and back to love, even after death. If all the war films were such, we should never fight again. <br /> <br /> Did I mention it's worth checking out? ;-) <br /> <br /> 10/10
