OK, OK, I have to say I was impressed. It's hard to say what I have been more impressed with: my ability to choose the right romantic comedy to see if I can't see or film myself. In both cases, "Hitch" was pretty darn good. Hey, I was good enough to look twice. Will Smith was funny and good. Kevin James was just fun and indispensable for the film. As much as this film focused on Hitch (Will Smith), without Kevin James, it's not just the same. <br /> <br /> The story is: Hitch is a game maker who helps a boy with a girl. His job is to give the girl a chance to mark this man if he hadn't. After the meeting, the rest of the relationship is to make or break a relationship. It only works on delivery and remains largely unnoticed during the process. Albert (Kevin James) is this time Hitch's project, and Albert has eyes on Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta) for the Paris Hilton. Although this plot opens, Hitch has eyes on Sara (Eva Mendes), a sharp, independent, fanged rumor of a columnist who does not want to have kinship relationships. they tie a little noise. Of course, the love story is not complete without obligatory misuse, misunderstanding or accident to send the girl behind the sons. Fortunately, they make it short and unhappy. Hitch was a fun and funny movie that flowed very well and rolled out without a truck.
