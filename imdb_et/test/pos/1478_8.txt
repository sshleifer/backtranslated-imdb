I appreciate it quite well because of Sam Elliott. I could have done without a woman's nudity, but I sit with almost no sense to see Sami's things. She can admire wonderfully cynical witicisms, many of which I agree with, and it is a joy to see her in a role where she actually starts emoting, rather than just moving around and looking for the virus as much as possible. My boy saw that the film was a couple of ways in a movie where Ed Harrisel was a Spanish partner (a term for the police!) Who had proved himself. You can make your own conclusions about this score, but if you like Sam, you like it. Could I say that I am biased but not in any way? I bought it with a heartbeat on a DVD!
