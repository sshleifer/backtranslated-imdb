You can say that this is the director's first offer (who also wrote it), but you also see the potential that this man has. This is obviously a low budget movie in the spirit of the Boondock holidays. Of course, Boondock Saints came out a few years after that, so you could see it as a diamond that needs some Polish. Action was good - if you are looking for DeNirot or Michael Madsen in a criminal drama, remember that these are young boys who play young boys trying to be criminals. They're not going to be a "supercool" (tm) like some veterans. I would love to see Justin Pagel (Joe, the main character) continue to create films - he was great at it. Good movie - 3 stars out of 5.
