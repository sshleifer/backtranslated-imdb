Karim Hussain's dreams must be feared. If the right hemisphere of his characters exceeds the left, shocking picture of blood, breakage and various abomination. Religion does not save you, nor does Mother Nature nor your family. Hussaini's dark poetry, because that is what this film really is, destabilizing all the institutions of the sanctuaries. <br /> <br /> "Unconscious cruelty" is the current crowd's joy in the fantasy festival of fear. Opening a movie about meditation madness is as well written as deep. The refugee's desire to force the birth process that brought him to hell opens up with a terrible and unreliable logic. Here the film goes deeper into the subconscious and deals with the mother. Hussain offers imaginative pagan fertility and twisted fungus madness. Nature is blood-colored and violent in Hussain's scary light. <br /> <br /> "Unconscious cruelty" disturbs everyone and pays for those who see the shock of mature life, the lust and the madness in the subject of a very worthy film. CJ Goldman deserves his affection for his special make-up, as well as David Kristian's sound design and Teruhiko Suzuki.
