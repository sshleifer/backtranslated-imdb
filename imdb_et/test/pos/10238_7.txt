It is fun for Barker Nightbreed that it is a story of kidnapping, a deadly threat to monsters everywhere. Here are the monsters (title of the evening) "good" guys. It shares its feeling to celebrate the diverse, twisted and dark of the first Addams Family movie and much of Tim Burton's work. It's also goriness that one is waiting for a piece of Barker. <br /> <br /> Cronenberg is especially entertaining as a truly evil human physician bent on destroying Nightbreed. Like most classic monster films, villagers surround the monastery with a burner and knees. Only this time the modern place will replace the castle's old mausoleum and rustic weapons and bombs. And this time, the sympathy you felt when you saw the Frankenstein monster in a burnt windmill at the center of the movie. <br /> <br /> This is not a masterpiece and even Barker has made the most interesting and definitely more chilling work. But it's fun, it looks good and stays white without blinking. Worth checking out!
