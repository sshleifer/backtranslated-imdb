Don't watch this movie while eating or soon after. <br /> <br /> Having said that, being born will stay with you for the rest of your life, like it or not. From a nihilistic philosophy, life is nothing more than a person spying on the ground (paraphrasing the title sequence / introduction), which probably contains more intense and harsher shapes you will ever see on the film. <br /> <br /> There is no dialog, just a picture after the image that describes the life cycle. The film's combination of harsh black and white photographs, accompanied by genuinely horrible background noise, is home to the message of the rider. <br /> <br /> The film begins with God (portrayed and obviously mad), which refers to its finishing. torso with a straight razor and then dying in his mess. After her death, Mother's Nature appears from her body to impregnate her with blood and sperm, and to give birth to a person represented by man, worshiping on earth. <br /> <br /> Landscape is a barren waste with stray shady humanoids that eventually happen to the mother and nature. After attacking violent scenes depicting human rape, these humanoids continue to trace the remains of the corpses back to the ground, and the life cycle begins again. <br /> <br /> I actually rented it out of Blockbuster for one night, based on cover art and leap content, but this is certainly not a blockbuster-type movie. Do not wait for narrative, dialogue or any kind of distraction. This is an intense image based on a dark object. <br /> <br /> I give this film a high level of footage and sound, but I don't think I look at it too often again. I like my movies blind and unique, but it's exponentially more than I expected.
