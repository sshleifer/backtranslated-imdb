The future visitor speaks of an exciting journey of time, friendship, good and evil battle - all with a small budget, with children actors and with little special effects. Something to learn about Spielberg and Lucas. ;) The sixth grade Kolya "Nick" Gerasimov finds a time machine in a burning building in the basement and travels 100 years into the future. He discovers an almost perfect, utopian society where robots play guitars and write poetry, everyone is kind to each other, and people enjoy everything technology. Alice is a well-known scientist's daughter who invented a device called Mielophone that allows people and animals to read their thoughts. The device can be used as good as bad, depending on which hands it gets. If two evil space pirates from Saturn who want to steal the universe steal Mielophone, it will come to Nick's 20th-century schoolboy. When the pirates get hot on their tracks, he rides back to his time, followed by pirates and Alice. Chaos, confusion and funny situations follow when unhappy pirates try to mix with land. Alice enrolls in the same school. Nick goes and demonstrates PE class supernatural abilities. Catch it, Alice doesn't know what Nick looks like when the pirates do it. Pirates can also change their appearance and literally change someone. (Hmm, I don't know if this is where James Cameron got the Terminator idea ...) Who gets Nick and Mielophone? Great plot, non-stop adventures and a great soundtrack. I wish Hollywood made such children's films ...
