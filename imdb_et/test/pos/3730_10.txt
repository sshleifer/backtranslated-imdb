Great movie. Post-apocalyptic movies set. This is no exception. Maintained pace and interest without dialogues (mainly through the development of some good character). The fight between Reno and the hero was tight. I also liked using cave paintings and medieval weapons to show how primitive and wild humanity had changed without their technology and guzzling. The connection between the beginning and the end was a bit cosmic, that is, it was difficult for me to understand the distances between the hotel and the opening order. All in all, the kick ass character advances, the design, the story without softening the dialogue, and most importantly, the post-apocalyptic womb house always appreciated atmosphere.
