This movie surprised me. The box is misleading, the labeling is misleading and the costumes and tone of the film are misleading. The film is quite good-natured, well-acted and beautifully photographed. Special effects are top-notch and seem to be ahead of them until you realize that this movie was released in 1979, not in 1963, as it would be. This is a unique Dr. Moreau story and one of the best filmed movies. The first fifteen minutes are highlighted and most shocking, but the film is never really breaking down. Be sure to see if you are a fan of dramatic costume / horror and gore-fests.
