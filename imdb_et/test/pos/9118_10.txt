I saw D's new movie today with a special idea and I was so thin that I felt I had to come to IMDb and take the word out. Of course, I was already a big fan of D work - I loved the HBO series and listened to my music weekly (there's nothing better to sing there), but this appreciation made me even more worried about going to dinner tonight (for us) everything is disappointed at one or the other the way we love when he tried to jump on the big screen). That's not the case with Tenacious D's The Pick of Destiny. <br /> <br /> Simply put, this movie is tougher than anything I've seen and is more fun and majestic than anything Peter Jackson, Pixar, and Will Ferrell could produce. It tells the D-story before we got to know them, creating the intriguing history of Kage and Jabel's uprising, their adventures together, and how they were inspired to write songs about things like Lee, Sasquatch, and Dio. Most importantly, they show true inspiration for the world's biggest song, "Tribute", and how it was (which is different from the HBO series). After you've seen it, you probably can't remember it (so Tribute), but your mind has changed forever with your genius. <br /> <br /> I often do not move to movies anymore because of the high fare and parking facilities, the payment of embarrassing concession prices, etc., but I usually make exceptions when I celebrate someone I really love, or something about the same variety. The "Achievement Choice" was so good that I didn't have any wins to go back when he released the country, and I plan to convince all my friends to go. Last week we saw "Borati" and loved it, but it is honesty for the goodness of TEN TIMES BETTER. For anyone who truly loves rock music and comedy shine, watch this movie. These boys' talents are so great that you should not hesitate in their cause. You don't have to be disappointed and Rock Lords smiles at you.
