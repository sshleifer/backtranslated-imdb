Excellent editing, outstanding performance, especially by Epatha Merkerson, and a very enjoyable musical soundtrack. This movie comes back to the 40s to comment on the differences in racial lifestyle and some of the effects of desegregation, while it stands out as a true story of a truly admirable and fantastic lady. <br /> <br /> An actor who portrays the young character of Terrence Howard is a great work that reflects her life and times in the small town of New York. The audience laughed, shouted and fired in applause for the film and its leader. Coming soon in HBO (February 7, I believe) - come up with TIVO and enjoy the great story!
