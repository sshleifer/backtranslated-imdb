Fine film. They just don't make them any longer! In the early 20th century, we discover the upper middle class family in Dublin. They organize dinner for their friends and relatives after Christmas. Their board call is just idle, but it is so well written that it has crashed. Outside the dinner table, there is a subtle gameplay that helps create an intimate atmosphere like one guest. Perhaps a bit too perfect for an amateur player, a strange mistake here and there would have added the magic of this movie. There is no real story, but real entertainment and a lesson in objects and upcoming filmmakers.
