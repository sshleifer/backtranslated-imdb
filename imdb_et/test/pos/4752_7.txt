This film does not concern soda or quite a French connection. The seven tops are a group of elite policemen using tactics that are not in line with the NYPD protocol. The Scheider leads the group with its positional or regularly looking joy. They are watching the local costra nostra cartel and things go crazy when the police wire is known. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Richard Lynch, the most miserable man in the film (Invasion: America, Little Nikita) and his partner finally kills the cop in an accident and escapes from the coolest back of what I have seen from Scheider, the Bullitt and the French association are not so good if they are from the west side of George Washington and New York. Jersey. <br /> <br /> Stunt drivers are terrible and Lynch makes it free, even though it sees fearful travel. Roy Scheider is almost killed when his car hits the broken back of the Mack truck, covering his car roof. <br /> <br /> Things come in the head and one has to watch out for such a queue. Fast moving and intense, fresh for thirty years.
