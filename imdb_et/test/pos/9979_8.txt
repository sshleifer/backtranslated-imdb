A rainy day, not much to do. We surfed the film network channels and found it just the beginning, so we gave it a chance. <br /> <br /> The more we looked, the more we started to get into the story. This is an old story about a workgroup subtype that tried to do it in sport, which at that time (1913 I think) usually played a rich upper class, but this movie was a bit as interesting as Seabiscuit and it is also based on a real story. <br /> <br /> Operation is plausible and casting is great. AND. . . . we are not golfers, so please do not just leave it because it is related to golf. Every single sport would serve the plot because it concerns people. Golf works well for this story because of class differentiation and snobbery that seem to involve some who play the game. <br /> <br /> Bottom line. . . . This is a good movie. It is well put together and it is not always fun to see those who think they are better than others.
