This movie is everything! It has a good story, good plays, great landscapes, adventure and some brilliant gags! Chris Farley plays Tommy Callaghanhe mega's successful "Callaghan Auto Parts" must go on the road to stop the company that happens after Big Tom's death. The problem is that Tommy doesn't know anything about breakers and needs Callaghan Auto Parts Richard (David Spade) to help. From the moment the two dorks passed the road, this movie is a lot of fun. If you love slapstick with big talk, you love it because the gags stay thick and fast, and the movie just laughs out loud! It was so sad for Farley's premature death in 1997, but the credit for his genius is Tommy Boy. Get it, cool and enjoy this brilliant blow!
