So I turned on the television today at 13:00, waiting for you to see a mess and info tag, and this great movie was just the beginning, didn't know what it was, but pulled me almost immediately. The film was great. <br /> <br /> There were a few things that didn't make sense, because I don't understand why a dead man talked about things to get out of a bad situation, but then Jimmy doesn't do anything except the basic things to survive stay somebody in their own situation, in other words, it was not his initiative that left him out of his bad situation, was just luck, the other thing was about a girl who killed gangsters at the end, because the whole thing was partially hidden from previous people stealing Panda money, and then the second thief finally kills Panda, so they steal his money twice and kill him how good it is?
