In September 2000, I saw a two-time sister betty at the international film festival "Movies by the Sea" in Vlissingen, the Netherlands. It made me so much impressed that I had to smile all day after I first looked at it and almost all night again when I took the film to the final taste of the festival. What I knew about "sister betty" was briefly that the renée zellweger played a girl with a girl in love. But what I saw was much more! Great role for morgan freeman, chris rock ànd renée zellweger. A strange mix of romance, violence and roads. And all the story that takes different instructions every moment you think you're on the track. Many soap opera lovers love "sister betty" - both movie and character !!! - But they can bring in all the non-limiting friends because they enjoy the story for even harder and humorous lines - the free man and the stone - for cruel scenes, thriller aspects and beautiful pictures. And I'm pretty sure that all sister betty will finally love her for her enchanting and innocent charm!
