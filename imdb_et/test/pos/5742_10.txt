GRANNY is the best movie EVER Ganny is the best movie I've ever seen. The plot was like something that has never been seen or done before these people are really blessed with the talent that doesn't love this film. I have to buy it, but I can't find it anywhere. it is a dream for me to go and meet with actors and try and make my grandmother 2i rented GRANNY on Broadway video and kept it for a week longer than I should have and asked them if I could buy out of them and said they were not a big disappointment and even bigger week a week after I came back, I wanted to rent it again, but I came to find out that Broadway video was out of business. if anyone has a movie or knows where to buy it, please tell me to write at iloverot@aol.com
