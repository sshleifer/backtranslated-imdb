I have read the comments about Las Vegas and I agree with some of them, it is not a brain surgery television, but again I had the impression that television was mainly for escapism, especially in today's world. Let's face it, the show in Vegas (which is not a reality-based program) doesn't come to reality because Vegas is a pure fantasy! This is the place where we can go and do a lot of what we want, if we want to (financially obvious!). it all reflects money in my eyes. If you don't like it, don't look at the fact that we have millions of channels! <br /> <br /> We come here in the United Kingdom for a third episode and I know you do it to watch it again. I hope it is not canceled, something that seems to be taking place in most of the exhibitions coming to the UK, which is half-decent! (Firefly and Jake 2.0 anyone? !!). <br /> <br /> It's harmless, good looking, and whenever I look, I want to go back to the real thing :)
