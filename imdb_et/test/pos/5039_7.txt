Angels are a bit of an American obsession, but are often quite boring. They are the messengers of God, and the angels of the arch are great warriors (Lucifer is the harshest and best view until he was kicked out of the sky). <br /> <br /> What happens if you do not believe anything, not to mention angels, and you are sent to study the angel's story to meet only one wing and less than an angelic attitude. <br /> <br /> Perhaps America needs it because Puritan is different from how good it is. Michael is a rude, reluctant, feminine, and heavenly messenger who fills your desires and takes care of what you touch the world. <br /> <br /> Funny, but not very big, touching, but not too sentimental, intelligent without wisdom ... it's just a good simple, little comedy. Watch the lazy Sunday afternoon.
