Very tightly written, acted and filmed. Violent, but not too much. Who edited it knew exactly what he wanted to portray. There's no wasted scene in this movie. "Ordinary suspects" was a great actor in the ensemble; it is a collection of outstanding individual performances. I rarely buy movies, but it's worth it.
