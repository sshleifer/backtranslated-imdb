Apparently, this movie is based on a real story. I'm not sure how accurate it is. But it really reminded me that when I see the news being murdered, it's amazing how much it doesn't affect me. Of course, I think it's awful, but I don't care honestly. I'm moving on. It seems that the murder is currently negligible. This is shown by River's Edge. No one seems to care about this girl and her death, not even the killer. Then what's the point? <br /> <br /> The killer of this story is John, and for a big movie he hides a second killer called Feck, played by Dennis Hopper. Feck is older and you see a generation gap. She says she loved her a killed girl. When he asks John if he loved her, she just replies, "She was okay." Film seems to be just one solution: life is more important than death. The life of a character is saved, people get a second chance and one hopeless case is killed. <br /> <br /> Actress is very good. After watching this movie, I concluded that Crispin Glover is either a great actor or a terrible actor. I have no idea yet. He was my main reason to see this movie. But the best result is Dennis Hopper. <br /> <br /> While fashion is really 80's and characters sometimes mention current issues, I still think that River's Edge is as important today as ever. > <br /> My rating: 10/10
