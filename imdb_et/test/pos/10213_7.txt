I saw it a year ago and it's fun, but not deep. The main story is from young men who dream of Midian, though he is not sure where it is or even if it actually exists. <br /> <br /> Spoilers Watch: He finally visits it, turns into a nightclub creature bites another. Then he has to help other night club members because they are attacked by Canadians. (Except accents, they all work like good Ol 'boys. Not much in line with Canadian psyche?) No one observed "monsters" or "nightlife", "replacing" Jews and Canadians / people, substituting "Nazis" and you should get an overview monster struggle against people. Well, maybe. <br /> <br /> The big objection I had was that when the underground city was interesting, it was rather dirty and frankly dirty. It must be a convention on underground films. One might think that if the monsters were good guys, some would have at least a little furnishings. <br /> <br /> The story is thin, but it is a demonstration of the characters. But it is fun enough for a recurring view.
