I saw this movie at the 19SEP2009 Cambridge Film Festival. <br /> <br /> Beagle has only a few short setbacks, the whole thing is about Darwin's life from 1841 to 1859, when he had grown up in Kent with a growing family, the 200+ Origin pages had already been compiled and he was wondering if to upgrade the book. The script is based on Randal Keynes' book Annie's Box (Annie, daughter of Charles died when she was 10 years old). This is mostly a family drama, but also includes sexual scenes - the participants are married both on the screen and outside. Not too exciting, not much science, but a well-made film that is pleasant to watch and push the right emotional buttons. A little romantic joke, actually. I think the conclusion is that you can be an agnostic scientist from an atheistic family background and still be an emotional romantic and wonderful father. <br /> <br /> Some characters and Darwin himself say or don't know if he "killed the god", but the viewer can suspect it. Undoubtedly, given the deadly struggle for survival and the network of predators (known as Darwin and completely contradictory) and the failure of Darwin's prayers, the idea that loves is divine who is gracious for his creatures to be unacceptable. <br /> <br /> I really don't see many Americans very much against it. Some may have a problem with the title, which is probably the most controversial thing in the movie, or the fact that Bettany has no horns, no tail and no peak.
