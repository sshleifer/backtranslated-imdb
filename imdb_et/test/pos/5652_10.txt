The main achievement of this film is that, although racially unipolar, the film still shows out the charts of war drawings that leave permanent identification to anyone who watches it, and who was present. Although good films can have the universality of their themes, which is often difficult to do; The big films are capable of making the universal material more universal, what this film does. <br /> <br /> Instead of the unity context, the movie depicts the Japanese in the finality of the Filipino disease in February 1945, noting the pacifism or war, but noting the feelings of war, death, destruction, winning, and illness, defeated hands. Especially different and better movies like now and full of Metal Jacket, both of which needed the satirical methodology of trivializing and depersonalizing American troupes and using all races as one fight that is good, but not as big as a film that uses a single race and view that would look fascist When it was created in America to pass the horror of war and show what it really likes. <br /> <br /> The only way the main character leads to the end of this movie is sick, irrelevant; so we see through this character our film, through a sustainable face, in February 1945, and the way Americans, Japanese and fillipins came into bloody warfare, where you live <br /> <br /> The film is probably influenced by the neo-realistic way of depicting a film, What is original and useful to the viewer, whether it is now or as it is, because the neo-realistic techniques he uses are all the fears of war in the picture. in the form of an exhibition on pacifism or "militaristic responsibility". Roberto Rossellini, like Germania Anno Zero, shows the story of nature and the associated conditions. <br /> <br /> Opening a movie with two Japanese soldiers in a bilateral discussion will favor and repeat events. Through this opening, we feel that the struggle is between man and man; it shows that they relied on each other's enemies in the battles of the past, but now, in this opening or in the pivot of the Japanese philippines' experiences, new information is passed on to the main character Tamura. Submitting cannibal dependence to each other if they want to survive. <br /> <br /> The jungle is sharp, wet and thick, and the sky is rarely cloudy and pouring. We plunder with fools and swamps, both sick and the land around them. Untitled shots are open everywhere. Every time and then you cannot say whether they are bodies, stones or corn. Apparently, there's no difference here, everything is dead and sick. Everything is dying. All they have is rare monkeys and dead comrades and / or name enemies. <br /> <br /> Often, Tamura feels like a fallen man near death. Although they have been crushed and crushed, some offer their bodies to eat, but they refuse; he still, like Hiroshi Kawaguchi as in Nishi's giants and toys, would not die of dignity and Japanese morale; for it is all that he really must withstand his survival, his dignity. So, if Nagamatsu has accused the soldier of consuming him, he will let him in on that. Tamura can kill to kill, but because of sickness and looting he can't decipher. He's not a good man or a bad man. He wants to survive, but it does not go beyond the simple destruction of war. He himself was dead on the battlefield, he is not happy here to destroy his weakness for his survival. <br /> <br /> The illness he is suffering is everywhere, everywhere; and unfortunately he has no ethical reason to think completely about others, because he cannot give up his body because he is from his infectious disease, or I was completely thinking about myself because he sees the disease in everyone, though he still kills them even if they do not harm them. Looking at his attack on two Filipino hunters. He doesn't see anyone. No one can see anyone. The only one sees the reluctance of malignant and health abnormalities as the heart of instinct of survival. <br /> <br /> Often, the hand that points to the left of the screen will appear toward what needs to be there, that Thule lies in their freedom. But it has been blocked by American soldiers, leaving Japanese attackers slowly dying in this insecure dirt. Even the church tower appears, reflecting the light of the invisible sun. But on closer inspection, the crows fell wildly; also religion is poison air. <br /> <br /> Nobi, the movie's Japanese title, provides more evidence of film themes or feelings: the destiny of destiny, the difficulty of existence between leaders and leaders. in life that others control. Its correct English translation is a serious debate among historians, as non-Koreans turn it into a "slave" and "slave", while many Koreans claim not to be a slave system, but a system of servant classes that do not meet the criteria of slavery. An opportunity to escape from poverty. It improves on the subject of war and the symbolism of the army. Should we be comfortable if we let it change without any conscious effort? Isn't that what we fight, the question of the history of this age, but rather why we fight? Plain has fires with Eiji Funakoshi, Osamu Takizawa and Mickey Curtis; based on the Shohei Ooka novel. Japanese with subtitles.
