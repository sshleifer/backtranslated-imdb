This movie changed me more than I expected and I was completely ready to cry. Mainly acting on this film, with great performances from Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellweger, and supporting pains. These actors so intensely depicted the human signs that they stayed with me for the rest of the night, and I had trouble shaking that drama of war. Costumes and cinematography were also magical, but could not come with them. They didn't focus, but added the whole effect. Cold Mountain never became my favorite movie because this title always belongs to an English patient, but it is the top five. The story itself was well developed and was quite unpredictable. I didn't find myself guessing what line came. A story about humanity and war close to the heart. In fact, the film was so strong that it was hardly noticeable, it happened in the 19th century. It seemed to be true all the time.
