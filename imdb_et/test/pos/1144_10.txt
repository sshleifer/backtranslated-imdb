I saw this movie in school and loved it. Based on the real story, this movie is a perfect masterpiece. Seriously, I didn't find it wrong. One sure plus is how it was filmed. Morrocas' wind and lion in 1904 is full of distracting images, such as Raisul in particular. The film was flawless, editing was crisp, costumes were proud, and the landscape was breathtaking. And I have to mention Jerry Goldsmith's music, it was phenomenal. I've recently used this phrase, but Goldsmith is not my favorite movie caller. His score here is so embarrassing and exciting, it shows a man's real musical gene, and this gem comes from where Goldsmith's best results are Legend, Rambo: The First Blood, Patton and NIMH's Secret. <br /> <br /> Action is inspiring and the scenario is intelligent and experienced. The direction is also treated sensitively. The performances were also amazing, with Sean Connery, ever with charisma and covetedness that was great as the Great Raisul, he almost dominated his entire picture. She is one of the entertaining Candice Bergen, cunning John Huston and the amazing Brian Keith in one of her underrated performances. History is quite accurate in some areas, maybe thin, but it is so good for actors, music and visuals that I am caring in the past. 10/10 Bethany Cox
