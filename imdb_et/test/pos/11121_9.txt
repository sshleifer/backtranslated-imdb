I saw fame when it first came out. It deals with the 1980s high school class, which was a random year for my graduation. I saw a movie between high school and college in the summer and as a performer I was a special place in my heart. <br /> <br /> The biggest criticism of Fame is usually associated with continuity and there are certainly some story lines that either aren't finished or don't make sense. But these problems are more than the passion and emotions of the characters and the incredible music. <br /> <br /> I saw it recently and was surprised that I still loved it as much as I did for the first time. Celebrity is often compared to Flashdance, which I don't think is fair. Although Flashdance has great music and Jennifer Beals is proud, I think Fame is significantly better in developing her characters and the complexity of her stories. For anyone who really loves art, this is a black film.
