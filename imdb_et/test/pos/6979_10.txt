For Avid Sci-Fi fans, this movie is just what you've been waiting for. Watching this movie loses its character, especially Riddick, the bad films. This is a case where you have a bad man and you want to live and win. Looking at how the survivors fight to stay alive, you see who lives and how to survive those unknown beings who have taken over this planet. A great movie, Vin Diesel did a great job like the convicted Riddick and acting and intercourse were scary
