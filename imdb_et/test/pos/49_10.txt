Lackawanna Blues is a very moving film that depicts an era full of different emotions and symbols that are seen by a young man. The film clearly supports "growing a village to raise a child" and reminds us of the important time in black history and culture. I got an incredible amount of respect for Macy Gray as an actor. His character was a little crazy but lovable; clearly we all know someone like Macy's character. S. Epatha Merkerson is absolutely fantastic as Nanny. I've never realized that Epatha was such a big actor. Law & Order never showed the depth of Epatha's ability to act as Lackawanna Blues. I was pleasantly surprised and surprised! Music and characters remembered my childhood ... it was a sweet nostalgic walk. I really enjoyed the movie and was looking forward to adding the DVD to my collection.
