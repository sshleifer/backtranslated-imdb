When will ART go beyond racism? I believe that the American people have grown up since the film was completed. Porgy consists of letters and music. This movie is a great adaptation of opera. s. Miss Saigon is based on Madame Butterfly, Les Miz is based on the classic book. Recently, an opera based on The Fly has been introduced here in Los Angeles. OPERA! So be it!! <br /> <br /> Disney hesitates to release the song. NAACP has not announced competitions and do not forget that Amos N Andy was a huge hit TV series in the 50s. Ethnicity is our legacy in the US and we should embrace all forms of ethnic artistic diversity. <br /> <br /> COMPLY WITH PORGY ON DVD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> hartz
