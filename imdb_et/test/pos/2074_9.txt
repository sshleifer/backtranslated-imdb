Let's face it, Hamlet has no perfect production, it's just too long and diverse, and the brain is perfectly perfect, especially with the challenges of Elizabetan's English and Shakespeare's violent dialogue. Certain moments, scenes, or intonations with which one disagrees are certain at every stage. I've seen many filmed Hamlet productions: Olivier, Gibson, Branagh, Scott and now this BBC movie with Jacob. For the faithful, full-length productions, this is the best. <br /> <br /> Most Hamlet productions are drastically cut because it takes four to five stages to play the whole game. This production seems to be complete - that is, all the original Shakespeare dialogues are healthy - and that is important for scientists and Shakespeare lovers. And while the lines seemed to rush in rare times (for those who aren't fully familiar with the text), the script is usually well-functioning, well-spoken, and well done. Subtitles are available and very useful, although sometimes they are a bit behind. <br /> <br /> Jacobi does a pretty admirable job with the longest and most impossible role of the theater. I actually cried when Hamlet died, and I don't think I've done it before. Patrick Stewart (Claudius) and Claire Bloom (Gertrude) are excellent, as are Lalla Ward (Ophelia) and David Robb (Laertes), and the rest very cast on the spot. Sets are minimal, so we can fortunately focus on the game without distracting or paying attention to non-essential elements. <br /> <br /> For 3 hours and 45 minutes, this full-length hamlet is long distances, but again, if you want a real deal, it's 100% worth, even if you need a break for yourself. I recommend this production to all Shakespeare lovers and scientists.
