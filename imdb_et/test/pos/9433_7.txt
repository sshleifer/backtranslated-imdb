Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote a large number of Sherlock Holmes accounts, but the popularity of the famous detective made sure that both the printed and the film's after-effects went beyond the author's works. <br /> <br /> "Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon," Holmes, Basil Rathbone, is patriotically serving British intelligence to provide the Swiss scientist with the necessary bomb vision. The film has been around since 1942 and I do not know whether producers and writers understood the importance of bomb-like secrets (the American Norden bomb trace was almost as enthusiastic as the new radars that would change the course of World War II). <br /> <br /> Holmes and his faithful but expected worshiper, Dr. Watson, Nigel Bruce, Battle of Dr. Moriarty, Lionel Atwill. As bad as Moriarty has always been this little shock to see that she has joined Hitler. Isn't the man dignified? I don't think so. But Atwill is delicious evil. <br /> <br /> The story is reasonably fast because Holmes and Watson are trying to restore the stolen bomb components before they can be delivered to the U-boat. Rathbone is his usual suave himself and many Holmsia disguises are well done. <br /> <br /> This and other 1940s Holmes stories are now available on DVD and oldies.com has released very nice four discs. Wooden Box: This movie is included with a bonus CD interview with Elder Doyle. The set will cut around $ 26 in major DVD and CD stores, but I found it and other kits from oldies.com in the warehouse for $ 14.98. Transfers are very good. <br /> <br /> Very pleasant and relaxing late night. <br /> <br /> 7/10
