Just one of my favorite dramatic TV shows, in many ways beautiful, but sad, heart-warming and thought-provoking, it's a great dramatization in a few years for C.S. In Lewis's life and in his relationship with Joy Davidman. I found it perfectly and "realistically" absorbed by dialogue and situations. It all seemed very "real" but there were also "magical" moments that almost leave you breathless. Ackland and Bloom, as average characters, were excellent as well as supportive cast. This is one of those dramas that I find difficult to criticize, simply because I am not criticized, it works so well on so many levels. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
