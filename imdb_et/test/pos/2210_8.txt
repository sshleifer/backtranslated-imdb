I was surprised at this movie because I'm "check your brain at the door and enjoy watching a movie school". But this film touched my heart. I have friends like Emily mentally retarded. I have such friends as unrelated Evie. And I've been in Evie's shoes, sharing the opportunity to give up fear and other dedication. <br /> <br /> Amy Madigan's disappointment in her daughters was almost sensitive on the screen and the uncomfortable moments she tried to bridge the gap with Evie was raw and painful to look at. And maybe I'm mostly denser, but I didn't see Evie's father coming. Usually cotton for these things quite quickly. <br /> <br /> My reservations are similar to those posted here. I thought Christopher Lloyd's wonderful, sympathetic character (he had a very different role, I thought) was too little. What happened to him when he realized what was going on with poetry? Will he, like James, try again? Secondly, the end didn't seem to solve or achieve anything, as it was. I didn't expect the pieces to be picked up and all the ends were properly tied, but I felt I was in conflict with the characters that there was no real improvement here and no real remedial action was taken. otherwise, subtle and lyrical, and disturbing and for some very, very true.
