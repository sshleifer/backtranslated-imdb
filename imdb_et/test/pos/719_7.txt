To film this movie: nice for TV but too small for theater. I enjoyed watching this movie at home, but I don't see it for the second time. The concept is good, but what comes to the movie is just a summary. The end was "nice" with twists, but still not satisfactory. Maybe it was the director's intention, but it didn't work as it should be. But then again, it's OK.
