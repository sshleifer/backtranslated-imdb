This black-and-white film reached the spartan house of my frisian village about 18 months after its release. In those days, a big part of our full-length comedy price from Denmark (Nils Poppe someone?), So this movie hit like thunder - it was a helpless miracle for me, as we did it now. Okay, so some of the sightings were actually recycled vaudeville 'schtick', but how was this "barefoot boy with brass cheeks" to know it? In any case, my favorite scenes were Jerry's unique frantic clown, as is Hawaii's boxing game. <br /> <br /> Seeing "Sailor Beware" again fifty years later, I was still out loud. Granted, without a nostalgia component, it would probably be another fairly average comedy. But then, another movie that was still sewn helplessly with me, Spike Jones "Firefighter Save My Child", is now odd with short orchestras and Doodles Weaver scenes. There must be a certain ingredient that makes Martin & Lewis product fresher for longer. For me it is at least ten out of ten.
