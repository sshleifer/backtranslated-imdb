Dekalog Five was an interesting viewing experience for me, as Kieslowski's question seems to be finely questionable to the public. This chapter focuses on three men and Kieslowski presents both murderers with both good and bad features (in one case almost no bad). With such weak characters, I found myself almost happy that they would get any punishment. But when the time comes for the murderer (and this is later the impact on the murderer), Kieslowski takes an interesting angle and seems to ask them who shared my view: "Are you not as guilty as this man?" This indirect address of the audience makes the five finals of Dekalog, which is much deeper than Kieslowski (as usual) does not fall within the grammatical boundaries of his theme. Just like the other parts of Decalog do not take the subject of their command literally or the Decalog Five. It asks us what is the murder, who is guilty of murder and what should be the appropriate punishment, if any? This is a fantastic movie and a typical stunning thing for Kieslowski.
