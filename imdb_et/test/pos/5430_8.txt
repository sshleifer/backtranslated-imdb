Robin Williams is a national treasure, especially when he relaxes and sets aside his maudlin approach to drama. He succeeds in reviving Barry Levinson's usual restrained pace, and there are moments in this film when he really looks. <br /> <br /> As a funny American president, "The Man of the Year", Williams will be having fun again and the annoyance that was related to him. What makes her so attractive is its humanity and attractiveness. Here is a man who can slip into his audience but also loves them. His humor is like a barbed wire, but it is still cathartic. It makes him a movie and very attractive to people in real life. <br /> <br /> Laura Linney is once again an intelligent woman in trouble. He is a fabulous and very talented performer, but I think he has made a stereotype and, unfortunately, it would have been more interesting if there were less recognized performers. Walken walks a lot through his ungrateful role, and the climatic scene of SNL is barely moving over the water. <br /> <br /> Go in for some fun moments and they are invaluable. Enjoy Williams and forget some of the deep moments that slow down this otherwise fun movie.
