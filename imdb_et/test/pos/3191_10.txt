I believe it ... after all these years finally followed it. It was meant for the "Great Pretender" stage. I was in Oz at the right time and my friend looked through the film with one place in the house. It was me who showed these men how to talk about Scott and all this time, I only understand that one was Russell Crowe !!! It has taken me all those years to follow it, it was even sure if he ever went to the screen when I left Oz next month after the party. At that time Russell Crowe was not a required actor he now has, and I had no idea that it was for him until I saw the previous comment, then I thought back to filming days ..... amazing ... Really happy now! !!
