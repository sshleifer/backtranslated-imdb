Witchery or sorcery as it is known in Europe, beings with Jane Brooks (Linda Blair) awake horror. Jane's Mother and Father Rose (Annie Ross) & Freddie (Robert Champagne) are interested in buying an old abandoned hotel on the island about 50 miles from Boston, renovating and reopening it. Together with Jane and their young son Tommy (Michael Manchester), Rose & Freddie are planning to travel to the island with architect Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland) to check what needs to be done. Agent Jerry Giordano (Rick Farnsworth) and hire a local fisherman named Sam (Stevens) to bring them to the island. As soon as they enter the hotel and start looking at the property, then return to the boat. Sam is killed and the boat is disconnected from the distance. They discover two unexpected guests in the form of photographer Gary (David Hasselhoff) and her virgin fiancée Leslie (Leslie Cumming), who happens to investigate the book she writes about the terrible legends and superstitions surrounding the notorious island and hotel. As the night shines outward with a great storm, they isolate them from the mainland when the mysterious black (Hildegard Knef) opens because the ancient evil in the hotel is looking for fresh sacrifices for demonic possession, human sacrifice and satanic ritual The director of this American Italian co-production film is somewhat hidden because IMDb lists Fabrizio Laurenti Martin Newlin, but there are rumors that Joe D'Amato made prizes in both ways Be honest, despite being a bad reputation, I found Witchery quite fun with both bad and good cheese. Harry Spalding's and Daniele Stropp's re-credited script in IMDb is also confusing because the movie's real credit is Daniel Davis, but the one who wrote this thing did a decent job, please stop laughing. At the heart, it is haunted by the horror of the house, but adds to the death and surreal feeling. Different characters have reasonable motifs and did not reach my nerves as much as I thought they might be, it is not very well drawn, it doesn't make much sense, and dialogue isn't exactly the top drawer stuff, but the whole Witchery entertainment for me in this 95 odd length plain and simple. It is quite fast, a little slow to go, but there are many surreal, bizarre and bad deaths to keep them entertained. One part of Witchery that destroys some of its credibility is the so-called storm, no storm sight, and the sea is probably calm enough to swim. Witchery's supposed "twist" didn't work for me really, and just look at Cummings' vision of this final freezing frame. The hotel offers a good isolated location and adds to a certain atmosphere a film that has a world-wide, unspecified "horror" feeling, cheap. Technically, Witchery is not too bad at all, it was probably shot at a location so it looks good all over and though not exactly the top of the movie making finesse, this overall output values ​​are a little better than expected. Violence & gore is a typical Euro-vocabulary, a woman has sewn her lips and hung in a fireplace so she can't scream when others illuminate it, someone is crucified and then burned alive, a swordfish, someone in the veins & pop & a woman is raped by a man without a lip. Witchery was shot in English, so there is no duplication as far as David Hasselhoff & Linda Blair is in the same movie, what else to say? Yes, ladies Hasselhoff does not take off his shirt and the boys Cummings takes away. Both Hasselhoff & Blair are looking at this, but the little boy is very annoying and can't do anything at all. I'm sure most of the sensible filmmakers disagree with my opinion, but I'm still saying I liked it and would like to see it again, Witchery is pretty fun, and definitely worth watching if you're a "bad" movie or horror fan in general.
