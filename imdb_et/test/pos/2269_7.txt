"Everything is Illuminated" is a simpler interpretation that is more than half of Jonathan Safran Foer's novel. This version is more about changes in Eastern Europe since World War II after the Cold War and how the younger generation is related to this history as a family memory. Debut director / moderator Liev Schreiber retains some humorous and linguistic collisions of the novel, mostly through the wonderful Eugene Hutz as a Ukrainian guide to the US. He is so striking that the film changes to his homeland and his family from his odyssey, because he goes from his comfortable milieu in the heart of a sophisticated Odessa to the cynical, isolated land that the conquerors have destroyed by the Communists and now the capitalists, both Jews and non-Jews as a detective. As funny as his opening scenes are when he puts out a bravura, we later feel our own fish-out-of-waterness when he tries to ask for directions to local yokels. Shreiber uses Elijah Wood as an American tourist as a visual panorama because his character is less verbal than one of the book's narrators. He and Hutz play each other well to a conclusion that becomes more sentimental in this sentimental plot. When the grandfather's story goes to the last quarter of the film, which has been received wonderfully and unpredictably by Boris Leskin, the younger generation does not seem to undergo any catharsis because they simply clean up the closure. <br /> <br /> Schreiber does a wonderful job of representing people's desire to document the history of documents. One of his advisers is Professor Yaffa Eliach, and his style of memorizing pre-Holocaust life was inspired by looks and is very powerful and effective. <br /> <br /> The Czech Republic is Ukraine and production design workers found memorable symbols of change in cities and rural areas, as it is now mainly a movie, and long driving procedures are dragging a little. Schreiber retains part of the book, especially the symbolism of the moon and the river, but by extracting the parts of the book that explain them, they simply see the atmosphere as being real or ominous and no longer representing time and destiny. <br /> <br /> Like W.C. The fields would have predicted, the dog steals most of his scenes to laugh. In general, Schreiber goes more towards the book. It is irresistibly touching, especially for those who have not read the book but are less morally and emotionally dirty. <br /> <br /> The film has been immensely boosted by its wonderful sound ranging from songs and instrumental Hutz Gypsy to Paul Cantelon's Klezmer fusion score for classical stories for contemporary stories. <br /> <br /> This is not in itself a Holocaust film, which is a kind of mirror image of "Train of Life" (Train de vie), like a memory of a time that has now been marked with meaning, but is resonating more with those with emotional history connection.
