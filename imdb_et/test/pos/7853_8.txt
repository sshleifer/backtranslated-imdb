I thought Eastwood's most unusual role was on the bridges of Madison County, but it was until I saw The Beguiled. He can pull it out, giving a very good result and so the rest. The direction is imaginative, given that the film was made in 1971 and there were some plot holes - which the director sometimes effortlessly does - we're talking about a great movie. However, it remains strong. <br /> <br /> 8
