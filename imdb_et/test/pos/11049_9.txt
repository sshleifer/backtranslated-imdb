And with these words, one big movie campaign came to an end. "Garbo Talks" and he spoke these words in his first soundtrack, Eugene O'Neil's Anna Christie. <br /> <br /> Unlike other players and some other studios, MGM took care of finding a suitable vehicle for Greta Garbo. Many players who were good in the universal environment in a quiet movie would lose their careers because of their talks. Their heavy local accents get their way, some knew no English. <br /> <br /> It was no coincidence that Anna Christie was chosen for Garbo. First of all, it was written by one of America's leading playwrights, a literary asset that would have appealed to him. Second, because the title was someone who was Swedish, the accent could be explained. Finally, many strokes of early talk were developed, although Anna Christie still used title cards. <br /> <br /> Like most of O'Neil's works, it is a short but long and deep characterization. The story takes place on New York Beach, where Garbo as Anna has lived with her father George Marion. Marion returned to the sea years ago when Anna was a child and Marion gave up her wife. Anna has had to do what she can to survive in the adult world and also includes prostitution. <br /> <br /> Of course, Marion is happy to see her, she even strikes Marie Dressler, an old water area where she lives for years to make room for her meat and blood. Of course, both Marion and Garbol are adapting to each other, not easy when they give shelter to Charles Bickford sailor who takes Garbo's fiction. <br /> <br /> Marion repeats its role in original Broadway production. Give a role to the stage by Pauline Lord. Anna Christie traveled 177 shows in Broadway in 1921-22. This is one of O'Neil's most famous works and one that has often revived. <br /> <br /> Of course, Garbo was recognized for his perfect dictation even with a Swedish accent and his future in sound films. Greta Garbo became the best actor for the Oscar nomination and the film also became nominee for Clarence Brown as Best Director and William Daniels for Cinematography. Daniels should especially get a lot of costumes for taking pictures of his water scenes. And Brown created a mood around the water area where the film was set. <br /> <br /> The work of Eugene O'Neil is timeless, so Anna Christie, even with the traps of many early sound films, is not making much movies ever since. Garbo also shows that he has learned the subtlety needed to work in the sound environment. Anna Christie is a classic.
