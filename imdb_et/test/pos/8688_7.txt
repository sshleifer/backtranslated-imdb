For the most part, I only enjoy a movie that allows you to escape to the future or the past. This movie is pure escapism. Dancing starts almost immediately, and Debra Paget's "purple harem" bikini dress does not seem to me to be equal in the film. His dancing, at home, crosses his dance with Fritz Lang's tiger of Eschnapur, available on DVD, where he played Temple Dancer Seetha. <br /> <br /> One movie problem is a closed device. There are few outings, and both others and other scenes are a bit claustrophobic. The same locations are used over and over again, but some interesting secret passages and waterways. His secret double identity is absolutely unbelievable in this size of beauty. Debra even uses a sword and holds 2 enemy soldiers at the staircase, she can do it. <br /> <br /> What makes Debra Paget a princess? With her beauty she would definitely be the focus of attention at any time in history. This movie, if hopefully it will be available on DVD, is shopping. All in all, I loved it with a little humor. <br /> <br />
