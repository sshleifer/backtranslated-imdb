Bridget Fonda has been disappointed many times over the years, but BREAK at UP was my focus. It is true that the story has disappeared from critical details in several places, but I just looked at the Fonda to get clues about what the story was meaningful and he didn't let me down. The vision in his eyes in the last scene, when he accumulates courage, literally, placing one foot on the other side of his uncertain future, is one of the most dramatic and important examples of how the face works. I believed him completely, probably because I have felt and admired several "harsher" people who lived on similar abusive situations. And they did it without becoming human-enemies, but it's my own hopeful display of Fonda's character BREAK UP.
