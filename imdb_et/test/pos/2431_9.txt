Anastasia: Anna's mystery was a two-part, fine-tuned historical T.V. film based on Peter Kurth's book Anastasia: Anna Anderson's Mystery. It keeps a lot of history, the names change, etc. Omar Sharif and Claire Bloom are doing quite well with the Russian king, Tsar Nicholas and Czarina Alexandra. Rex Harrison and Olivia De Havilland showed that I think they are too short. All in all, it was a pretty stylish production with some exquisite action. I was quite amazed at the value of the product when he first gave it to NBC at the end of 1986. German actor Jan Niklas, who had previously played NBC in another Russian epic "Peter the Great", was also the most important. I felt part 2 of Anna Anderson's important details about going to America. It is also important to know that in 1986 the story of Anna Anderson was less known. It was not yet known whether his claim that he was the Grand Duchy of Anastasia was genuine. In the late 1990s, more was known and Anna Anderson is now known as a fraud. It is too bad that networks no longer make such films made on television.
