Kooky, but funny a little deviation. You have to see it from the very beginning to see what's going on, but every report on the earth is your little joke. Pretty good special effects with very low budget sci-fi to show. Have a nice look. Sorting in a red dwarf vein, but an even smaller budget. Someone who is just in the middle of one episode must realize that these men are all incompetent because they have moved the ladder of commands because other officers died. Also, the main boys are in the laundry casing, so there is a laundry in everybody. If you like Red Dwarf, you probably like it. Slightly different t.v. the notion that everything you see is a commander's report every day. <br /> <br /> It would be better to explain this more, not just at the beginning of the first episode, but then it was quite difficult to find out what happened to Red Dwarf if you hadn't been told.
