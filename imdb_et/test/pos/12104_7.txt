Akin's award-winning 2004 Head-On / Gegen die Wand depicted the chaotic world of self-destructive but dynamic Turkish-German rocker Cahit (Birol Ünel). This documentary is Head-Oni's attack and explores the music that can be found today in Istanbul if it were as energetic and curious as the German avant-rock musician Alexander Hacke of Einstuerzende Neubauten (who organized the soundtrack and made some libraries on music) and helped filmmaker Akin. and Turkish speakers. You get everything from rap to the most traditional Turkish classic song, rock, Kurdish music, and Turkey. It's as chaotic and open as Cahit, where the east is in the west and west is in the west, but there is something under both sides. <br /> <br /> Like Istanbul, at the edge of Europe and Asia, and both worlds united with the survival of sui generis, it is a Turkish pop, Turkish traditional songs, Kurdish sheep, Roma jazz musicians and a street busker group (Siyasiyabend), a lively and spooky picture of Istanbul's street life, and some singers and musicians talk about camera synthesis and some personal and musical history. Working at the Grand Hotel de Londres in the Beyoglu quarter of Istanbul, where Cahit stopped at the end of Head-On, when she was looking for her beloved, Hacke rides around the city with a team and equipment that interviews people and records their music. /> Does he start with some loud stone "neo-psychedelic" band Baba Zula? these are the musicians whom he joined at the time of compiling the Good-On score and he is standing here with the missing bassist and Turkish (including brave female) rappers? thus, some old people walk early from the theater and remain predominantly loud and easily audible, making up the majority of the film. (Head-Oni's narrative superfluous temperatures were periodically mitigated by traditional Turkish orchestras who sat outside in the second half of Bosphorus.) Hacke gives us the opportunity to meet and listen to some of the well-known Turkish singers, including Müzeyyen Senar, who at the end of his eighties, elegant musicians resemble one of the great Egyptian singer Umm Kulsoum. Hacke gets a songwriter-film star Orhan Gencebay to make a little necked oud that he has written all his songs, and now convinces the hard-to-understand Sezen Aksu to make one of his most famous songs "Memory Istanbul." It's a coup and a beautiful one. the loss of a Kurdish singer Aynari, recorded in a bath with remarkable acoustics, if only they could have slipped heat? singer and musician face flowing sweat. There is also a young Canadian, Brenna MacCrimmon, who speaks Turkish, who sings Turkish traditional referendums with expression and passion. The quality of sound is of all quality. I would like to see a sequel; many of the great examples of popular and classical music in Turkey are necessarily excluded. <br /> <br /> A film released in the summer of 2005 and shown at the 2005 and 2006 festivals. Opened on June 9 at the Angelika Film Center in New York. 2006
