Again, I have to play a contrastist. Most of Ab Tak Chappan's comments have been very positive. Mine is positive, but only slightly. Of 10 out of 7, I have a C letter. <br /> <br /> There are two factors that seem to have been praised: one that Ab Tak Chappan is more realistic than a typical Bollywood movie and two that he is trying to do things differently. <br /> <br /> The first point I didn't care less about. I'm not looking for a reality in the movie, so I don't appreciate a movie that shows the story and symbols closer to how I believe in the real world - I am a big fan of surrealism, fantasy, absurdity and so on, although I don't like realistic movies just because they are realistic. <br /> <br /> For the second point, I agree that it is advisable to try things differently. But I do not believe that "originality" versus formulating itself changes a better or worse film. The film can be "original" and poor, as the film can be formal and excellent. What matters is how well the film does what it is going to do and how enjoyable or aesthetically profitable it is for the viewer. <br /> <br /> Ab Tak Chappan is based on Mumbai policeman Daya Naikil. . Naik was a "meeting specialist". Respondents who could say that they are dealing with the real-world early "Judge Dredds" are trained to act as criminals and gang members they seek, and are in principle allowed to kill - acting effectively as a police officer, judge, jury, and subscriber. Ab Tak Chappan follows the story of Sadhu Agashe (Nana Patekar), a meeting specialist based on Naika. We see him at work, communicating with his colleagues with professionals and dealing with violence. We see her at home, trying to live in her normal life in a less than luxurious environment. We see that he is trying to adapt to a new "Commissioner" towards the film. And we see his strange relationship with the notorious Indian gangster, Don Zameer Zafar (Prasad Purandhare). <br /> <br /> All this has the potential to make a fabulous, sharp film. I agree that it is nice to give up typical Bollywood musical numbers and novels - not every movie needs this stuff; Ram Gopal Varma, a producer of Ab Tak Chappan, is famous for leaving music and novels in the background or on the road in many of the films he has directed or produced. In addition, Ab Tak Chappan has good results - Patekar almost quits Death Wish (1974) - Charles Charles Bronson vibe. It also has amazing cinematography - hand-held things at the beginning of films, for example, were particularly effective. It has a high score that mixes more fickle Hollywood-like action / crime scores with traditional Indian instruments and modalities. Violence is well done and sharp. <br /> <br /> Also, proper study of the subtext, including the professionalism of the professional, the idea of ​​the following orders, etc. Visual specialists need to show that they have to divide to a great extent from the right and wrong ideas. Even more sharply, the film doubts blindly the value of the following orders. There are parallels between the meeting specialists after the orders and, for example, the members of the national military, and we have shown what the corrupt situation it may bring. <br /> <br /> But (you knew it was) But "Come on, isn't it?" Director Shimit Amin and his scriptwriters have created a story that has too many characters, too much expansion, and it is moving too slowly. All these problems can be caused by Amin and the team watching the godfather movies, which Ab Tak Chappan has some (at least superficial) similarities, though from a police point of view. <br /> <br /> Most meeting specialists don't know very well - these are the minor features except for Agashe and Jatin Shukla (Nakul Vaid). One, Narayan, I didn't know who he was up to at least half of the movie. His name has been mentioned several times, but I only look at him until the scene changes. Then all the clothes changed when they appeared again, and I should start all over to find out who Narayan was. <br /> <br /> The same happened to Agashe's first Commissioner. The film was already a long way from becoming a new Commissioner before I understood the relationship. It seems that every scene has new characters. We mostly don't learn their stories. Although it may have some artistic value, meeting people usually kill people they don't know (because they do it mostly on orders) because we don't learn much about most meeting professionals. it's hard to find the characters you care about, and it doesn't make a captivating film. <br /> <br /> The primary villain is Zameer. But until the movie is halfway through, there's no sign of it. She doesn't get much more screen time than other enemies through the movie, and she literally "calls her performance" - she is in another place (Dubai) who only interacts by phone with most movies. We don't really see Zameer much. To some extent, the film depends on a few "twists" that do not require Zameer to be shown in many ways, but we can see him with other things, and many other crooks could have been left out. <br /> <br /> It would have made the film a bit tighter, making it more focused and shorter for about half an hour, both of which would have had an effect. It is in no way a pre-packaged film. For at least the first 45 minutes I found the remarkable style of Ab Tak Chappan, but saying, "Okay, create a story already".
