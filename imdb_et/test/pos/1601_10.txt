I saw this movie many years ago and hated it - I couldn't wait until it ended and I would have walked out, but there was a girl who was sleeping on my shoulder. You know what? I've never forgotten this movie, and I would say it will continue to haunt me over the years with my pictures and music. How many movies I've laughed in the movie and then smiled, then I forgot when I hit the street, like ... you see, I don't even think of one! Less often are films such as Death in Venice that enter your consciousness and work at sea. The French want to say that film is art and such films prove they are right. I'll give her 10 stars, from 3, I gave it at night when I saw it.
