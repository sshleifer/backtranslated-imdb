One of the best horror / temporary movies I've seen for a long time. Wow, it was a great surprise and stunning how good this film was, sometimes a pearl like this surface, but is rare. I was expecting a popcorn monster flick and a slightly deviant way to spend the late evening, but a very well done and staged movie with great effect and passion and heart. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that makes you feel like characters and what happens to them, and it's filmed like you are and it really happens. I know some people in another review compare it to "open water", but I disagree because I thought Open Water was pretty boring and mediocre, while this movie was the opposite, although superficially filmed in the same "realistic" style. <br /> <br /> Participants are at least unknown to me, but they are all very effective and deliver a terrible situation with intimidating intensity and realism. The story is well done and flowing smoothly, the graph is logical and seems to be something that could happen, all the actions and thoughts of the characters are quite what the person would do and think. Very credible and it makes the movie more real. <br /> <br /> I finally had tears in my eyes. I have to say that the film rarely has such an effect on me, that is how powerful and emotional this film was made and I have impressed the director and the actors of this great film.
