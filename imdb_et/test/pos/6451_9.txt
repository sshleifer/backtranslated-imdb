If it had been done 2 years later, it would have been BANNED! The first number must be in the day's recommendation. The best Rouben mamoul movie I've seen so far (though, but haven't seen J + H yet). <br /> <br /> It's no wonder why this movie received less than 200 votes. A larger hallion that does not care less about what is right does not see up to the 60s again. As morally vague and dark as the 70s, but also a certain charm. Of course, it had to be low in the 1930s and unfortunately it doesn't seem to have been rediscovered. <br /> <br /> Seriously. It got it all. Big Actors: Gary Cooper, Sylvia Sidney and not so cute Guy Kibbee this time. And a powerful good director. So far, I have not been the biggest fan of RM, but I have liked my movies a lot and this is where he is entering a new league. One of the best 30 movies I've ever seen! This is something I have never thought of! 9.5 / 10
