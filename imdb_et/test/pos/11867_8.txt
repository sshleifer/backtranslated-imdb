Liv Tayler in your sexiest movie! <br /> <br /> He adds an amazing "Femme Fatale" role while being able to appear as a super sexy woman while keeping a "sweet girl" and not too frustrated as other similar movies (eg "Femme Fatale" with Rebecca Romijn) ) <br /> <br /> Until this movie, Lord of the Rings was the only movie I ever saw (Im Fucking with LotR) <br /> <br /> Point: According to LoTR I had shaped the opinion that the role of a pure sweet woman was the only role that Liv Tayler could interpret, but when I saw "One Night in Mc Cool", I completely changed my thoughts. She's the sexiest woman ever! <br /> <br /> The film is therefore a mediocre common comedy "messy" plot
