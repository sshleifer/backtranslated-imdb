Ghoulies 4 is a pretty haunted sequel. Ghoulies are very different from the first three ghouls, but there is still cool. Ghoulies is the first nice flash back. Jonathan is here again. However, he wasn't in Part 2 or 3. The film is a low budget from time to time but fun to watch. You have Tony Cox as Dark Ghoulie and Arturo Gil as Light Ghoulie. Ghoulies in this movie are really good guys, not as bad as the first three movies. Both Ghoulies are pretty funny characters in the movie. Then you have a very hot Alexandra! It's a big dark comedy and funny! Every ghoulies movie fan enjoys a view of Ghoulies 4. DVD has finally come out in July 2007! Hopefully one day will be on Ghoulies III DVD in the US. I'd really like to see the sequel of this movie one day. I doubt this will happen. It is now 2007 and there is still no sign of success. Once there is a sequel, I hope Jim Wynorski does it. <br /> <br /> I'll give Ghoulies IV a 9/10
