I saw this movie as a child and loved it. I loved how funny and full of energy Nikki is and how she mostly conceals the perfect silver life of Louden and ruins her and makes her crazy. As a child of the 80s, I saw in New York exactly as it was depicted in this film, the Madonna character, where wild animals run on rampant and terribly knocking people who seek people and cause devastation. Now, as an adult, I find that I love the film for the same reasons and even more so that the love story that is woven into Nikki Finni's crazy hero. Although I would still love to go somewhere and find a movie like an indoor room. Clean beauty and genius.
