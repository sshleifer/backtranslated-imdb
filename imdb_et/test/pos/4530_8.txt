This movie is a fun little private eye detective story, as they are no longer done. It's all there: Tom Conway is a forged Falcon, Goldie Locke (which is in the name) is his steadfast bumblebee, Louisa Braganza is a girl in trouble and of course there are also girls, a professor with a secret formula, a bad guy who wants a formula, and a police inspector who is after The Falcon. There's a murder and Falcon is involved. The countryside is nightclubs, expensive hotel rooms, luxury train, suburbs and beautiful cars. Go look at this little legacy when you see it in the afternoon on television!
