Eight people who found previous FIERCE PEOPLE comments "Psycolicious Me" and "Topdany" "helpful", as well as future site visitors who see them before deleting their authors: these negative criticisms are not only shorter than the site's authority, but they are completely false, uninformed, inaccurate and false. For example, Blythe's father is in a coma, NOT dead - Maya and Finland even visit him in the hospital. Besides, it was deer poacher Dwayne - NO Blythe - who knocked Jilly's maid etc etc. So if you have ADD, which makes it impossible for you to focus on the simplest details, please keep your position in the pretending Siskel or Ebert. Otherwise, add your disclaimer to your comments!
