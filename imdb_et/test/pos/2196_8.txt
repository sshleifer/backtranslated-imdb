Last year I fell in love with Tim Burton's version of Sweeney Todd, so I wanted to see other versions of this music and found it at the library. Although I think Burton is the best, probably because I like the movie much better than the theater, it's still a big story. I haven't seen any other version, but I'm trying to get them. <br /> <br /> After seeing Johnny Deppi as Todd, I find it hard to imagine anyone else's role, but George Hearn is doing a fantastic job. Angela Lansbury is great, as always and all the songs are fantastic. I found myself under the song. This is a game you don't want to miss, but try to see it before you see the movie version so you don't have a biased view like me.
