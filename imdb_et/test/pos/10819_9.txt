First, a careful word. The DVD box describes this movie as a comedy. I don't think it was someone who's involved with the film except for some marketing moons. Although it is light and a bit funny in places, it is not a comedy and if you think you are disappointed. <br /> <br /> I had never heard of this movie, or had any expectations in any way. other. Considering that the other two DVDs I took were very disappointing, I was so happy when I saw this movie. Action, writing, and direction were excellent. The story is certainly of interest to me, because you usually don't see films from the last six months of France before the Nazis took over in 1940. This gave some insight into the parasites that gave up so quickly and agreed to share their beloved country. Along the way, Isabelle Adjani has played very well as a selfish and weak actress who looks marvelous after all these years. She kills the former lover and then finds the bad juice in the fall. This juice escapes from the prison and finds it - with another lover - a high government official and Gerard Depardieu. In addition, the sub-block is introduced to the Jewish physicist who attempts to smuggle deuterium into the country, and eventually becomes the main plot. The story is a lot of nice, light sense of humor (without trying comedy) and some real tense moments. Together they create a nice package that it definitely wants.
