This exhibition came to Canada in the mid-1990s through PBS and really loved it. Even 10 years later, looking at different news networks, I can help but think about the cynical manipulation that takes place in the ratings and the various "show ponies" we all see on television, as depicted in various Frontline episodes. Scripts are tightly written and all actors are impeccable comic timing and none of them are loaded with an idiotic laughing angle. There are a lot of funny materials that are really well done and we don't have to say when to laugh and laugh. I don't understand why this exhibition ever pulled out of North America as a real pearl! I was very excited to see DVDs, although they are in PAL format. I thought I would hang them on my computer and then look at the converted files. I took the opportunity and ordered it from ABC? 6 to 8 weeks later I had all 3 seasons. Even better, it worked with my NTSC DVD player. I suspect that every player who has bought xvid / divx during the past 2 years will play them. Good stuff! 10 years later, all episodes are really good! You don't need to know Australian politics to get humor because it's all familiar to Western countries. My husband and we had a 10-day Frontline Fest and we still see weeks after watching all 39 episodes
