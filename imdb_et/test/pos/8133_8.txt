OK, I'm not kidding myself that this is a typical gay-love life, but since then, in real life is a straight romance as they are on the screen? This film is a balanced comedy and drama and I enjoyed it thoroughly. Hugo Weaving had a rebellion that he was playing a sex-obsessed gay property salesman who uses his clients with his burning Darren (Tom Hollander). And, having seen him in Priscilla, the queen of the desert, this day was probably one of the most solid actors of masculinity before that. :) Anyway, the plot flowed smoothly and male binding scenes were hoot. Thumbs up! 8/10
