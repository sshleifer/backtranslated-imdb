This movie was intrusive and fun to watch. As a fan of this type of film, I enjoyed it. The premise is such scary, but the fact that I did not rate it to 10 was that the film was up in some areas. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS: <br /> <br /> Cmon: NOBODY could identify this girl? I understand the concept of independence, but I find it hard to believe that SOMEBODY-ANYBODY would not have been able to identify this girl as Angela Bennet. It was up and so was the scene where he walked on someone's desk and began to write. It was usually a really good movie, pausing and keeping your interest. Dennis Miller was great as Allen, really believable, Bullock was good when the lonely reserved computer worker bad guys were undervalued. <br /> <br /> I think the PREMISE movie was very different and scary. Nowadays, who knows what can happen? However, some of the top scenes prevented this movie from 10 out of 10.
