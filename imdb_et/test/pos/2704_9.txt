Looking at this film, I was amazed at how media perception can shape people's perception of fame. Karen Carpenter was a carefree but very insecure young lady whose wonderful voice helped her and her brother Richard to admire the songs with wonderful songs. Like all modern celebrities, they were often criticized for their music as well as their appearance, styles, and so on. It had a tremendous impact on Karen, who kidnapped the fight with his eating and sudden loss, which eventually led to his death. This heart initially felt something that I should have seen. But when I started to look at it, I was hooked. Like Tina Turner's story, this film will enlighten you and allow you to see the lives of young performers. The actor was great, and even after nearly 20 years after it was done, the direction and dialogue are still fun. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone who hasn't been watching it yet. It is amazingly accurate and emotionally charged.
