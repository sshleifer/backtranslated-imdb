The queen of the devil was Akasha (Aaliyah) sexy and had a bigger and more demanding presence, she just hit your eyes and attention. now the film had mistakes, like not explaining Akasha's past. What I did not like was that the film didn't really explain or show what the relationship between Lestat and Akasha was, or was like, the role of Akasha (Aaliyah) in the film was limited and he didn't appear until the second half of the movie and then down from his bottom. (Akasha) Death came quickly 2. But I liked how Akasha fought back when the ancients tried to kill him, because the book's last struggle with Akasha and The Ancients was quite boring (they killed Akasha in 2 seconds). and Lesta became the world's largest punk. <br /> <br /> Aaliyah played Akasha very well and Stuart was perfect as Lesta, they couldn't have chosen a better Akasha or Lestat. "REST IN PEACE AALIYAH"
