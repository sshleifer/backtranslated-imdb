Emilio is a successful businessman, a perfect father and a good husband. Or that's it. The perfect story he has carefully built over these years will suddenly close him. Can he keep up with his lies? <br /> <br /> This is a very well-designed drama that has a great working and lasting direction. Even if the plot tension is increased, the film will be picked up by our worst fears ... Do we really know the people we're dealing with? Can we be so sure? <br /> <br /> The story is progressing faster as it reaches a point where Emilio no longer controls her lies. Many Spanish films have interesting stories, but far from technical skills. The perfect rhythm and well-captured scenes make the actors so trustworthy, we get into Emilio, hate him and carry him because his situation is becoming increasingly desperate. There is no need for Spanish folklore, nor is it an attempt to create a Hollywood-style flick. This is a real Spanish, 2002, and despite Emilio's real life's unlikely probability, there are good chances that someone we know is not exactly what he claims to be. Not only a big commercial product, but lets you think about where the lies are going to get us. Can we keep up? <br /> <br /> Well done.
