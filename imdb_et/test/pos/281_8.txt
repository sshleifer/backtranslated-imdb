Excellent and moving story from the end of a uniquely intimate thing. And again, the point of the film, to paraphrase another parameter, is that each relationship can be unique and intimate. A really high quality short film that pulled me into my most active, but still had the ability to pull me fixed and quiet on the couch and the clock. Bobby and Tessa are vigorously moving characters, and anyone who has suffered the end of love finds this film a cathartic exercise. In addition, the idea of ​​"movie in the film" plays very well with this pain and is quite riveting, though somewhat melancholic.
