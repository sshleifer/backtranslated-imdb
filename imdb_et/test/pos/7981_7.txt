This movie is where Batman's franchise should have stopped. Although I admit that the ideas behind Batman Forever were excellent and easily understood by the competent director, as it turned out to be not. <br /> <br /> Obviously, Warner Brothers' leaders were disappointed with the darkness of Tim Burton's second Batman film. Besides the fact that something else is expected of Burton, and the conservative coward of their later decision, which makes the franchise a tribute to the sixties television series, I do not understand how Batman's return can be disappointed at all. True, it is not quite the same as the first movie - although it improves all the minor flaws in the style of "Batman", which is a weaker script that divides not only two, but three characters. comparisons with the masterful tying of Keaton and Jack Nicholson as Joker in the first film. But all this remains a gorgeous dark film, true to the way Batman was always supposed to be, and very satisfying. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton returns to Batman and his alter ego as Bruce Wayne, tangled by Nouveau Riche's grandmaster Max Schreck (Christopher Walken, 1920s German silent actor in honor), his partner-in-crime Oswald Cobblepot, penguin (Danny DeVito's great make-up, reminiscent of Laurence Olivier's "Richard III" and Selina Kyle, Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), whom Wayne romanticizes both Batman and her. Four principals are doing great results, especially Walken and DeVito, while Keaton and Pfeiffer are exploring the darker side of double identity. <br /> <br /> There are some intriguing concepts in this movie. The only weakness I can really point out is, in some places, some script weakness, which I think is mainly due to how this film is a quadrilateral struggle. Just not enough time to properly investigate what is happening. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it's a fucking good movie. I would recommend it for the first time and then cry for how good it would have been if it had to continue under Burton and Keaton.
