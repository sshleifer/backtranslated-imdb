As a local speaker, I thought "Grease" showed what Broadway producers are looking for, and this highlighted a small portion of the working population. Although my favorites didn't win (but came second), I enjoyed comparing them and seeing what I liked and where I can improve as a performer. <br /> <br /> They brought Olivia Newton-John as she has a clear link between Broadway production and television audiences. <br /> <br /> They sang the song ("Hopelessly Devoted" and others) because these songs are added to the new production. <br /> <br /> I agree with the earlier comment that B'Way casts so much older, but you have to remember that these are people who have been in Broadway and worked their tails. If the whole cast was green and fresh, then I believe that it would have jeopardized the casting process by which manufacturers choose their talent.
