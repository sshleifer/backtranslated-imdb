The real eminent episode from the 1st season is what Ice is. Artic's location, claustrophobic conditions and the general feeling of paranoia that threaten the freezing air make it a must to watch the episode from one season. Scully and four other people are killing or killing each other. The virus brings out the aggression of murder and is responsible for causing lethal paranoia and fear. TMulder and Scully actually start questioning each other's mind. writers must have great hope of creating a scenario where the atmosphere is so tense Mulder and Scully come into direct conflict
