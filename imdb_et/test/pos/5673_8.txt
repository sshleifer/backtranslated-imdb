The film begins with three people who play it as an ear rest, who first decide to visit the crocodile farm and then go on a little lighter, "fishing" tour. <br /> <br /> Interesting information about crocodiles during farm visits and information adds enough to boost the film's momentum when you remember what was said before. <br /> <br /> Time in the movie is timely and not over. The thrill is built on "what if", "unknown" and sometimes intestinal decisions that the characters make in the film. boat, not red. <br /> <br /> The quality of the movie was really good and its effects were realistic, believing and not looking up or in the comic, as you sometimes did with CGI. /> <br /> Like every movie I get, almost every genre is like a horror buffer, and it is one of the best "crocodile" horror movies, if not the best I've got to see. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie and you won't be disappointed.
