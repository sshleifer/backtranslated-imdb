I watched this movie since there was nothing else. The movie quickly grabbed me with the depth of symbols and a fine plot. I was quite surprised that the rating given by my satellite provider did not show any stars. <br /> <br /> I don't give spoilers to the plot line or result, but most of the characters had at least some value to redeem. Until the last moment I didn't know how it would develop. Often you can choose and predict the story. I couldn't do it with this movie. <br /> <br /> I recommend this as one of the finest films in this genre.
