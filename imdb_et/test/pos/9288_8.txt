A very funny look at some of Australia's current events and political events. The Chaser boys look really fun with this show, and I like the fact that they all have their own strengths; some of them are brilliant (Chas) who make themselves perfect idiots, while Julian is able to pull all "I interview a famous politician and I want to assume he's hiding himself as a fat jam". br /> <br /> They have large segments of the exhibition that take mickey out of all aspects of Australian culture, such as our current events, our ads, and early morning TV shows. Some materials are a bit tired and predictable, but in general it is fun to watch and leave a smile on your face.
