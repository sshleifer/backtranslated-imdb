Sometimes it is difficult to define what separates a successful, delightful comedy from one flat comedy. In this case, the promising plot is not about a corrupted rich girl who plans to take her brothers from the "bohemians" of Greenwich Village, who raise them, but to fall for her. And nothing in the filmography by director Leigh Jason suggests that he would be ignored by the great talent. And yet he had to be responsible for creating a relaxed and happy atmosphere that was faithfully recorded on the film. <br /> <br /> He was also wise to throw this movie right. One small mistake is Miriam Hopkins in that Ginger Rogers would have been ideal. Hopkins are effective but brittle, it lacks heat and sexuality. He still hinders a few strange long and tireless eyelashes that are sometimes disturbed. However, the very young and very beautiful Ray Milland could not have an amazing, unobtrusive comic result to be a better charm. Better than this, especially for the people of New York, is the Hollywood imagination. Greenwich Village in 1937. Although it is completely synthetic and ideal, it remains recognizable to today's viewers. Artistic director Van Nest Polglas created friendly back-rooms with mews-apartments and ramshackle, the perfect backdrop for a collection of artists, leaders, smart alphabets and wannabets. Guinn Williams is the best supportive pain that brings the role of sweetness and light to his prizefighter-sculptor-seamstress, which refers to the inventiveness and flow of the village life itself (sexual and other). More refreshing is Betty Philson and Marianna Strelby, who play small girls. Simple, intelligent and full of humor, these girls seem like real people and are not like professional child actors. <br /> <br /> Some memorable comics are of particular interest: Ray Milland's demonstration of a vacuum cleaner for a smiling woman is played with more spontaneity than one expects (the child and his contradictions are wonderful "moments" found) and a fake home "game" in the department store that breaks down for free - it's also fun. The film slides down slowly with a straightforward custody trial, and it never gets back when action moves to Long Island, but the film is still worth it.
