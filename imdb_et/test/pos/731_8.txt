There are many films I've recently seen and forgotten as a patron of recent riders (1970-80). This is one I will never forget. Despite its low budget film making style, STORY was very well done. An isolated therapy shelter where patients make their fantasies to help cure their physique, accidental assassination of a chief physician as a new nurse arrives, a (presumed) medical assistant, has taken over various crazy revelations that a helper is actually a patient, and finally rescuing a young man with simple thinking By Sami, who killed all the others in the house so he could escape unharmed, he made a big STORY. kept the movie together. I stressed the word STORY because it makes a good or big movie. No matter how much blood, gore, nudity, sexual material, or outrageous behavior you put into the movie, if STORY is not good, the film is not good. Movie credits show clips from all the actors, including the old ones, the last line of which says you have to come out and never come back, which is the big end of this movie. If it's on a video / DVD, watch it and enjoy it.
