I remember the events of this film, the Donald Crowhurst bad cruise in 1968, the Golden Globe individual who gave the world a yacht competition. I was 13 years old, living in England. Last year, Francis Chichester (later Sir Francis, he had attacked his exploits) was the world's first solo circuit. I remember it mostly because we were given some free time to look at his return (black and white TV!) And then by the queen. This caused a huge outflow of patriotic passion in the UK. Everything now looks so weird. Chichester became a national hero, but he stopped halfway in Australia so he could re-install his hunting, so the next logical step for hunters was to catch a trip without a stop. <br /> <br /> It is important to remember that this was the world's pre-GPS when communication on land was still rather uneven, never in the middle of the ocean. Now, with GPS receivers that fit the keyhole and calculate the location of the meter across the earth, it's hard to remember the time you could go to the sea and literally disappear. As Donald Crowhurst did. <br /> <br /> Several hunters registered (all men at this time), including the mystery man, Crowhurst. Basically, the Crowhurst sailor did not make any progress with a successful company, including a career in the British Army, Air Force and electronics company selling navigation equipment. He wanted to make a big deal with his life and he saw the five thousand pounds first prize (over $ 100,000 in today's money) and the resulting public as a means of starting his own business. He signed a deal with a sponsor that proved to be more waterproof with his boat and that meant a failure in bankruptcy, and soon found a popular figure among journalists when he was ready for the race. Now, the British always love the idea that the amateur accepts the "pros". (Guess Eddie Eagle loses the endless Olympic jumps and amateur cyclists who regularly start Grand National horse racing.) The public was queuing to see her, but her boat wasn't really ready and even when she started (the last competitor leaving the UK) ) Crowhurst must know that he has no serious chance. But too much traveled with him to give up. <br /> <br /> The great archive material is the suspicion that has been written on the face of all his poor wife. Her four children left behind are interviewed with the whole film with one of Crowhurst's sons. He was in a situation where there was no victory. Had he tried to stop him, he would have been considered a spoiler, but after that he was questioned whether he could have saved his life if he stopped him. Faced with a certain truth that his boat was leaking and never going through the oceans of the southern sea and could not turn around and ridiculous, bankrupt and innocent, Crowhurst saw a plan to cheat. He opened a radio contact on the high seas from Argentina and Brazil, where he waited for a circle of drivers on Cape Horn and started off at the Atlantic Ocean, thinking he could go in at the end of the line and pretend he was traveling all over the world. He fooled his logs thoroughly and made 16 mm films and sound recordings to back up his plan. But as other rivals abandoned, he realized that he was actually 2nd and his logs were checked. Against a certain discovery, his press cannot be reversed by losing the reality and eventually suicide. His hunt was found. He was never. <br /> <br /> This beautifully edited movie also follows the journey of an experienced and enigmatic French sailor, Bernard Moitessier, who was second best and confident of the fastest prize when he suddenly left the competition and revealed he knew he would face standing and sailed into a wide blue building, eventually pulling into Tahiti about 10 months later. Some seven years after working at sea (though on very different ships) I understand pulling the ocean. There is standing water, looking at the water towards the horizon in every direction, knowing that you have a few miles of water, between you and your dream, but with a thin metal body, without access to television or radio (even nowadays on most working ships), you feel quite isolated), it is possible to truly escape the responsibilities of everyday life. There is some thoughtful analysis of what drives people to strive for such a very long, lonely journey and its impact on the human mind. Most people think that 4 child rearing experiments are enough for adventure, but much is needed for self-discovery at sea, in self-search. <br /> <br /> I firmly suspect that former rival navy man Robin Knox Johnston probably knew quite well who he was before he went, so he managed not only to win the race, but also to maintain his peace of mind. Those who were looking for something deep may not have liked what they found. <br /> <br /> Great archive material from the UK in the late 1960s is almost enough to look at it (did it really look so bad on the worst aspects of the past?), but in general it is a wonderfully made and enticing film. Highly recommended.
