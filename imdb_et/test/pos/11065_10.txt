I gave this movie to just 10 of my illnesses with Ingrid Bergman :) lol. I really think he was the best actor who has ever fallen in love with this talent and all his films are absolutely wonderful (even if they are terrible) because SHE is in them. If it hadn't been, Vivien Leigh (as it had originally wanted me to hear) would have given him 9.0 Just because I love Vivien, but probably not as much as I love Ingrid. And all the other actors would have done this. 6. That's a good story, two natural people who fall in love with a society where it's bad. Reminds me of a little GWTW, except for the elevated attitude. Gary Cooper is very beautiful as usual, and of course her voice doesn't change the whole movie, but Mr Ingrid makes him feel so amazing and embarrassing and 20 times hotter than he should be.
