By using the boat, Jack and Sayid will come out against the plan "Others". But when Jack, Sawyer, Kate, and Hurley follow Michael's "to others", Jack is forced to reveal Michael's deadly secret when they are somewhere in the middle. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Locke decides that time has come to know when it's time to find out what happens when the "button" is not pressed. But Mr Eko's decision to continue pressing the button is surprisingly strong. So, when Locke makes a plan to close Eko with a hatchet with an ally, Eko is going surprisingly desperate to stop Locke from doing what he thinks is a big mistake. <br /> <br /> The classic is lost, full of secrets, intercourse, and very few answers to many of the questions he poses to his viewers.

One thing is guaranteed, it will keep you out of the end, and you will still be disappointed with more amazing questions when you are awake to start the third season.
