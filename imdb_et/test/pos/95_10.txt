Animated shorts just don't get much better than this great Canadian film. This short feature falls on Canadian references, which is why Canadian films appreciate this movie the most. But the main story is universal and is lovingly spoken by Roch Carrier. This is a fun story I've been feeling for quite some time and I was recently happy enough to see it again, so I just wrote him a cheerful recommendation. It's a masterpiece and a must-have for Canada.
