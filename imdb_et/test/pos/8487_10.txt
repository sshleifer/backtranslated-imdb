Jamie Foxx was a Ray Charles uprising. In a few moments you will end up seeing the film and see the biography played by the big man himself. Ray Charles was indeed a genius of music and the film showed it perfectly. No one has ever written, played, or recorded music like this musical giant. When he passed the flesh, the world lost one of the world's greatest heroes of the world. As for the film, the fact that Jamie Foxx received a classical scholarship for college and could play as Ray would benefit the director. What could be better? You don't need to "double" play the piano and then try to share the screen from someone else's face to Jamie's face. It worked beautifully. I loved the fact that he also took on how hard Ray was. He wasn't always a nice man. You didn't root her. He was a drug addict, female and sometimes just plain. But I think it made him a genius, so I can't blame him for that. I choose Jamie for the best actor!
