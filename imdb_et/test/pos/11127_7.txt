If you are looking for a movie with fantastic music, a nice lie and story that is hard to understand; FAME is for you. <br /> <br /> I have several scenes that I love in this movie; some make you laugh, others make you wonder. In my opinion, editing is wonderful, really fast and often funny. Shure, maybe the whole thing would have had more potential, all the story would be on the surface somehow; maybe a little too many characters are involved.But I don't care because the real stars are ... <br /> <br /> The musical scene! One of my favorites: a hot lunch sequence. This piece is just as raw, funky and filmed in a special way (handcamera-style "music-hell-loose"), it's just electrifying! I miss this raw energy in today's music clips; the only similar energy I found in the Bette Midlers "rose", all the concert materials. It means something "natural" that is "really" happening, and does not just make it perfect; So FAME is a great nostalgia trip, as synthesizers, where hard and walks are not available. I recommend it once a year; certainly not everyone.
