This impression of the film was impressed by its impressive performance and powerful message in the script. Susan Sarandon plays a part of a flying, irrational, and overwhelming mother who constantly gives her daughter a message that they must abide. She removes her daughter from a dynamic but loving family in Indiana to continue her exciting acting career in Hollywood. The daughter is suspicious, but first she has no choice - the maternal ties are pathologically strong. <br /> <br /> A time when a girl sees her as a fantasy flight and she doesn't have her feet on the ground. She sees her mother going over the head with a nice, seductive guy who loves and leaves. She sees her not getting it. So how does she see her mother's guidance? <br /> <br /> Mother directs the girl to a drama test and sees the daughter acting out of the mother's part, so that the shockingly painful mirror is held up to the mother at night. It causes a period of depression and the girl scares the effect on the mother and is excusable, but the lesson will last. <br /> <br /> There is an increase in character, because mother understands her selfish claim about her daughter and finally persuades her to let her. It is a relevant scene and a valuable lesson that parents who are emotionally dependent have to go to the child and become their own.
