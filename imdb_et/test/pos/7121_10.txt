Players: DR is not a fictional film, it is rather an amateur video. Terrible magic effect, really fake fireball, terribly made prison dungeon, castle, village ...... sword, ax, shield, bathrobe, plate ..... okok ... everything. You need about 10 minutes to visually adjust your expectations, you get 105 minutes of fun. <br /> <br /> I'm from Hong Kong and it's really hard to find RPers, none of my friends played RPGs and I always want to be one of the D&D worlds. Viewing Players: DR shows me what it would be like to be a player. You'll see rules books, dice, game sets, etc etc .; You hear terms like "fighter", "wizard", "hit place", "level", "sign", "flaming hand", "chaotic evil". <br /> <br /> What the RPG I like is to let you do something you want, not software RPG. Players: DR offer the same element, you don't know what's going to happen, and it probably just makes you laugh. The film goes to both the real life of the players and the world of D&D. You hear how the player plays the dice when the character in the game is acting, which makes you feel that you are actually participating in the games. <br /> <br /> I don't want to spoil anything, but in short: Players: DR is a must watch movie for RPG lovers. For people who have never played RPG, I'm sure you'll get a lot of fun.
