This is absolutely one of our 2007 favorites. <br /> <br /> The two shops that come from different worlds, but close to the brothers, are perfectly spoken. <br /> <br /> Scripted - From childhood to adulthood it never disappears. <br /> <br /> An excellent overview of lost culture and a great way to understand Farsi's cultures and traditions is an exceptional story in itself. It is so compassionate and exciting, exhilarating and full of enormous sadness, joy and depression. <br /> <br /> The film is the best in terms of excellent self-expression and great technical skills behind the camera. <Br /> <br /> Highest recommendation: a real piece of life that raises and informs.
