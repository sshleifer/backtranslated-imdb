this is the movie is probably one of the best I've ever seen. I just put it all around Lily Chou-chou because it gives me the same vibe .... "9 souls" are about 9 inmates who have just fled from prison to go and find the time for counterfeit money. capsule at Fuji Primary School. Later, they discovered that there wasn't much and left on their roads. The first side of the movie is just the deadline for the characters to be entered and the main points to be marked. this is a comical but serious part of the journey. on the other side I moved to tears. as the film progresses, each sign goes up and tries to fulfill its dreams, but unfortunately it ends somewhat badly. in the end, there are only two out of 9 refugees. The way every character left the scene was very sad and you probably feel tears in the eyes. beautiful movie fantastic. this is a movie for people who have enjoyed Toshiaki Toyoda's other films like Blue Spring.
