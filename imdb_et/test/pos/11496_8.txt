This movie could be compared to the "comfortable food" with the soul. Anyone who has ever tried and tried to record a relationship can be related to this movie. So many of its parts are so fun and so many parts are so heartbeats. It is not perfect in its production or even in dialogue, but the story is unique, which tells a lot about modern "romantic" comedies. Luke Wilson is the best, but I think Heather Graham is doing an extraordinary job. Try it - despite the trickling DVD covers. Joline's character brings many questions to our service culture. He asks us if the commitment is really for another person or for himself. Really, it is itself. Adherence to promises (no matter where the marriage is to the spouse) is a great feeling. What's more, our word is nothing more than a smoke change. Joline is like an alarm. We need to be aware of our words and responsibilities, they mean more than we think. At the same time, we must not allow anyone who is unable to do so.
