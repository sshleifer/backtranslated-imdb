This is one of Julie's biggest stories for music, plus her "Trapped in the White Girl" album. Quoting the great Medusa "Dare to go bare, just wear your underwear, you can get home forever" - Wow !!! Now this is good advice. "You can dance at my party! Yes, explain your dance shoes! ..... You're invited to a party in my pants. Yes, come boy to dance, party in my pants" Julie Brown is fun !!! It is almost sad that this video is only 51 minutes long, but every minute is awesome!
