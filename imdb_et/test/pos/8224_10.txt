Bill Irwin's written and conducted flight control is a real classic theater work that was translated fairly well on a small screen. The quick and sparkling dialogue and some of the best physical comedies of the decade are over 99% of "comedy" headlines and shoulders, as it is being presented today. I am sure that one day will take its fair place with such excellent examples as "The Fantasy" and "Wototing for Godot". Why it's not yet available on DVD is a mystery and tragedy.
