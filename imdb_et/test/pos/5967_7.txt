I was stuck at the beginning of the movie. I came when the partisan was a farmhouse. I can really say it was terrible. The moral consequences are incredible. <br /> <br /> My fear of pain and torture will not allow me to see myself as a coward. I see Christ as an ability represented by a brave patriot, and I can only pray that I could or would have moral integrity to follow my example. <br /> <br /> I see that the main theme of the movie is to show tortured weakness / strength, but what is the bad decision to face. All because the human soul can be distorted so that the pain and suffering that comes with humanity are somehow satisfactory. Be it spiritual or physical. <br /> <br /> I found the film very provocative.
