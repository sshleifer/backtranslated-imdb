In the veins of Jeepers Creepers and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the Monster Man is surprisingly well done - albeit pointless - with little horror. Throw a small comedy comedy, nice gore and intense intimidation. It's hard to say that Monster Man is really fun. The low budget seems quite obvious, but it does not affect the overall presentation of the film and shamefully shame the bigger budget horror films. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot is somewhat common. A friend, Adam (Eric Jungman) and Harley (Justin Urich) are driving to the country to interrupt a woman's wedding Adam has always loved. Although Adam is more nervous, Harley is in itself proclaimed a lady and a very offensive loudmouth. Adding a bonus to the plot, they started a sexy hacker, Sarah (Aimee Brooks). Things become a nightmare when a frightening truck with a frightening face stands behind them. When the dead body begins to count, they must fight the race with the time before their life. <br /> <br /> The plot is obviously reminiscent of many of the earlier famous horror films, but Michael Davis, as a writer and director, managed to keep tension. Fear is built well enough, where characterization is never the best, but quite okay. The script is also full of comedies that work for funny moments and are quite fun, not annoying and waiting for the finale to turn. It's fun and shocking at the same time, which is quite fun. <br /> <br /> Monster Man is surprisingly fun. It deserves more attention on the big screen. This proves that a big budget does not make an effective horror film, but skill does it! Something that the director has shown and edited.
