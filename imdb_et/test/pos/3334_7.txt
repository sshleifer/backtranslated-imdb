The above summary is not really meant for this film because the series followed a very similar form. As usual, Simon Templar ("Holy") will meet the needy and get help. He also gets help from a police detective, who was framed for bribery. Along the way, he meets some interesting characters (this time Paul Guilfoyle as "Pearly" gates), and with this unconvincing secret (none of them actually), Templar is extremely erudite and just cool! George Sanders is again the perfect complicated British guy and he will once again succeed in making an excellent B-Detective series. Nothing is particularly special, but familiar and windy product for fans of the genre.
