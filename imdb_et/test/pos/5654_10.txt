A frightening masterpiece of war madness and despair is not on the surface of the fire (Nobi) for everyone: it is a war movie in the most meaningful sense that is not patriotism with flags and sentimentality of saccharin. The nose cuts deep, it is ugly, stubborn and gloomy, because the few things that have ever been put on celluloid are ever. It is behind war cannons, without triumphs or heroes, moral victories or defeats, but a handful of fear and terrible men who have fought over the war-devastated land, as big disasters flee. The characters defy the moral judgment because they are stolen creatures with great distress, an affliction that does not allow moral questions. War and survival. Fighting the will of another will on the battlefield. The castle is simply lost from existence. <br /> <br /> Tamura, a Japanese imperial army soldier, was released from his team and ordered to report to a nearby hospital because he was rope with blood and he didn't like the rest of the competition. He has said he will never come back and commit suicide manually with a grenade when the hospital rejects him. What is he doing. The hospital is nothing more than a drawer made of wooden platforms, and the hospital surgeon just tells him that if he can walk he is just good. It is in this hospital that one of the most harrowing scenes in the film is excusable. Since the area is a bombed carpet of American aircraft, doctors and those who can walk and keep themselves escape from the hospital and the forest. Moments before the hospital blows into pieces, the frustrated and corrupted figures of the sick and injured climb out of any posture dressed in their sick white clothes, as if the building had some beast viscose and gentle. on earth. <br /> <br /> This is Nobi's greatest success; a harsh and despicable image of the suffering of war in simple but awesome images, without melodrama or pseudo-arousal. The soldiers pass through the swamps, rebellion the knees, move over to the opposite side and into the field to discover the enemy tanks in the woods, their lights appearing maliciously in dark scans. Damaged, dirty and dirty soldiers, crossing the highway with the sound of enemy planes. Symptoms bloom on the corpse pile. Abandoned village. A crazy soldier who believes himself to be a Buddha, sitting under a tree, covered with flies and his feces, offering his hand that Tamura eats when he is dead. These are the pictures that Kon Ichikawa attracts to our eyes, ruthless and insecure, but honest and raw. <br /> <br /> Nobi is in no hurry anywhere. The point is to see that Tamura travels through a war-torn country as he tries to reach Palompa's regrouping center and follow the madness and discomfort of the war. The film moves through the horror of war, slow and clotting mud, just like the characters that follow. The last thirty minutes when Tamura took refuge with two desserts eating "monkey meat," is the closest Nobi, who follows the usual narratives and are not less powerful on this issue. Nobi is a black-and-white shot with a spectacular production, and Ichikawa's direction, Nobi is not only the best war films, but also the best of the Japanese cinema.
