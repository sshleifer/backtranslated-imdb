I saw (unfortunately) Encore's duplicated version. <br /> <br /> Student Paula Henning (Franka Potente, who was also a cult favorite "Run Lola Run") stars as a serious medical student who goes to a prestigious school in Germany. But he will soon discover that some students are going to disappear and the bodies they work in an anatomy lab are incredibly fresh ... <br /> <br /> I was stuck when I saw Encore's duplicated version. It has hurt a lot (words that didn't match lips really got really fast), but I liked what I saw. The action was good, it was beautifully photographed, it was not TOO tough and I was never bored. Even more refreshing was the pleasant heroine who fights back when the bad guys follow her. (Light) nudity was a man in a refreshing twist! The previous poster mentions that Benno Furmann (who is great) showed his ass, but I can't remember it. Regardless of this, it's a well-made, scary and wonderful thriller. All I have read is the best German version (I do not doubt that one second), but the duplicated version is traceable. I'll give it 7.
