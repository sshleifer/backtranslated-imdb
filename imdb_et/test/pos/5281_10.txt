Gake no Ue no Ponyo is a beautifully animated movie and relief from many heartless breathless CGI movies. Crayons and crayons were a surprise to Chihiro from Kamikakushi (spiritual away) and Hauru was not like Ugoku Shiro (Howl's Moving Castle) so stylistically. The style worked well for the film and was done exceptionally well. The time and effort that has been made to revive it is very welcome as it gives the characters so much life that details and care make the film so much better. The film has a number of great scenes with lots of movement and action. For me, the biggest scene was where Ponyo's sisters became a massive wave like a fish when he ran on them. The story is simple, but quite well written and played. The plot remained focused on character relationships, and although it wasn't played, as well as Tonari from Totoro (My Neighbor Totoro), it's still great. I felt that each character, unlike Spirited Away, had a sufficient amount of screen time, which was so distinctive that it could have been drawn into the entire series. (The Redis Spirit. There was another movie!) My only real problem with the film was the end. So, at least in the English version, it seems that Suke is given a great test, which proves to be her promising mother of Pony that she loves Pony. While thinking about it, the idea is that the translation may not be accurate to the actual meaning, because the test is a promise and it really means it. The film, however, seemed steep. Other than that, the movie was great and I highly recommend it.
