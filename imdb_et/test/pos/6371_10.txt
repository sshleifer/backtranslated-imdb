I loved Complete Savages! Why did they cancel it anyway? They should have done another season and so on ... God! They always cancel good exhibitions ... and leave all boredom. There's nothing interesting on TV, because Complete Savages is gone. This show was a great idea. One firefighter's father who has five mad sons and a lazy dog ​​... Each of them has their own madness in this house. TJ is always a child ... always smaller ... Kyle stones! He breaks everything he touches! She's always in detention, she's always doing the wrong things ... But still she's so funny about everything she does. Sam is smart. She is always shy and stupid when it comes to girls. Eventually he gets to Angela. Chris is a sports boy who doesn't have much to do with school, learning and things like that. She's always funny. And finally ... Jack! Exhibition rock. The oldest of all, macho boy, "rock star" ... But still as crazy as everyone else. Nick is ... helpless with their help. Oh! And I almost forgot! Uncle Jimmy ... He's the man! He's like a 30-year-old child. He's just the same fool the guys do. I've always wondered how he finally came as a firefighter ... And the dog is a picture of the whole Savage family. The thing is that there was everything in this exhibition that got something really big. It was all, man! But of course ... they canceled this ...
