I like this movie. I like it not only because it is a great 80's movie with great sound, but I found it has some thought-provoking moments. They are just moments; not the whole movie. It is certainly not like "less than zero". <br /> <br /> Scenes are related to typical peer pressure and more difficult issues, such as betrayal of trust. These problems cannot be easily solved or forgotten by characters. Certain scenes stand out and invite them to reflect on their teenage experiences and how these experiences can affect the adult's character and prospects. <br /> <br /> This movie can be viewed and thought about the challenges that young adults have to face and your own experiences. Or you can just pay attention to the boys' attempts to commit themselves to suicide! :) In both cases, it's a good movie.
