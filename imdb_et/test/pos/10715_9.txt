Inexplicably, I watched this movie for the first time only a few days ago and realized from the start what all the noise was. This film kept my attention from beginning to end and ran through all the emotions (and maybe I helped some that I never knew). <br /> <br /> Dustin Hoffman absolutely looks like Ted Kramer. He is completely convincing as a person who has to challenge at least three different challenges in his life: a husband, a carefree advertising manager, and a loving father. Meryl Streep, because Joanna Kramer was less central to the film because Joanna wasn't good at it, but when she was on the screen, she gave Hoffman a run for her money. The real standout (in my opinion) was to be a young Justin Henry Billy Kramer. Children are always the innocent victim of a break in marriage, and Justin seemed completely natural and completely credible in this role, as he deals with contradictory emotions surrounding his mother and his father's adaptation to life, but it is confusing why he should leave his father if he mother walked with her. Young Justin didn't seem to play in this very difficult role. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is an excellent, Oscar-worthy film, whose only weakness was what I thought was a really disappointing decision to go to a happy and happy ending that had gone through a totally unrealistic Ted and Joanna crash. But there is not much more to complain about here. <br /> <br /> 9/10
