This is by far the best film I've ever seen. This is a completely original and beautiful plot. It is neither boring nor too dramatic. The characters are tangible and realistic, but it doesn't take the story. A non-English fact is probably the last touch. The end leaves you unfulfilled as I have ever experienced the film. <br /> <br /> I wish I had found this movie before. <br /> <br /> More lines. <br /> <br /> More lines. <br /> <br /> More lines a lot more rows of c'mon, I've done
