I like to show Surface very much. The show is very fun and it's a clean show. Show a similar surface is interesting. This keeps my attention. It has compassion and intercourse. I love all the members shown. They are all very good choices. I think it is very important that all exhibitions are correct, because what makes it any success and of course scenes and exhibitions itself. Television has changed so much over the years. It has changed in good ways and bad. I love watching comedy, action, intercourse and romance. And scifi. But the surface is an exhibition that I hope it will be back in many seasons because it is a great show and what families can see. My kids have been raised but my husband and I like watching this type of show. I appreciate your time and let me comment on your opinion. Thanks. <br /> <br /> Paulette Blackwell
