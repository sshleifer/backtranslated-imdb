Much better than expected. Good family flick - catch it again. The total is more than the sum of its parts. Paul Giamatti looks at the landscape - he has so many talents as he deserves. Taking Care of the Inspector Watching the victim from the "Illusionist" goes over the top. The blue human scenes had my 11 year old stitches. The kids were especially fun for the parents - to see Lee Majors and Urkel (umm, Jale). It's hard to think of up to 10 lines for this movie, but we hear it for a film that promotes the integrity of the child and their parents! Amanda Bynes does a good job when she gets part of the sting. I usually can't stand Frankie Muniz, but he's fine here. Hats for the lover - if you only rent Giamatti!
