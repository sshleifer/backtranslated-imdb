"Putney Swope" is a unique, low-low budget gem in the late 1960s that would probably have been forgotten over time if there were no two things: Paul Thomas Anderson (who named "Don Cheadle's character" Boogie Nights ") Buck Swope Watching "Putney Swope" is like listening to hardcore punk rock: it may not make much sense (at least I didn't see it for the first time), but you have to stick to the film's passion and shamelessness "Putney Swope" I didn't understand a lot of things, but I liked it mostly. The more I think about the movie, the more it grows me. <br /> <br /> The movie is promoted as a parody of New York's Madison Avenue which is best known as the world capital of advertising in the 1960s. Members of the X and Y generation may lose this concept, but fortunately "Mad Men" on television offer us this otherwise lost piece of US history What you need to know before watching this movie is that these advertising agencies were mostly men and even mostly white companies. <br /> <br /> In view of this assumption, the film opens at a board meeting of an advertising agency. The members are predominantly white, except for Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson, who in this film is surprisingly similar to Dick Gregory), an African-American on board. The members of the board are so absorbed and soulful that when their chairman is dead before them, their only concern is the chairman. Even if the body is not taken off the board, they start voting on the next chairman. <br /> <br /> Putney Swope is chosen for landslides, but not because other members think Swope is qualified. Voting by Swope was an unsuccessful attempt by their board members to sabotage the possibility of any other member being elected chairman. In the event of a rebound in its plans, Swope will accept and "throw the boat" by burning all but one original member and recruiting all the people in the color. <br /> <br /> After this point, the movie changed (for me) very strange and hard to follow. In fact, not even the plot has been. The whole idea of ​​the movie seems to be a "as" scenario, resulting in a new "Truth and Soul Inc." the company would be unusual but still successful. The company gets so much money that members build a huge glass bag to keep cash for inexplicable purposes. This may be because Swope does not trust banks, although this point does not touch or explain in the movie. It may be somehow metaphorical, but who knows. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie takes place in an advertising agency, where the White House has random scenes with a president who is dwarf for some unknown reason. My premise here is that some political jokes have been made, but I can't understand. Did the filmmakers say the president is a small, insignificant part of American life? Did they say that the last elected officials (Nixon at that time) were irrelevant candidates? I do not know. However, I found it a bit terrible that the President, who plays the President, had a striking resemblance to the future President, Ronald Reagan. It's funny to make this connection 40 years after making a movie. <br /> <br /> This movie may be useful to show how consumers outside the advertising agency responded to new ads. Of course, the advertising material had a strange, funny complaint about this unusual creativity, but did these ads convince people to buy the product? If so, how? The film referred to the idea that the new advertising campaign was successful in communicating with customers and with the White House calls. However, it would have been obvious to see middle people because this demography has always been the most useful for advertisers. <br /> <br /> Although parodies and political messages made by this film may not have heard of time, this film still has many unique features. Arnold Johnson had a magnetic factor X for him, who greatly helped him in this film. Swope's harsh voice was, in fact, the voice of director Robert Downey, Sr., dubbed, sometimes badly, but so characteristic that it was an authoritative outsider. He hires and fires at random, but earns respect for all, except one employee, for revolutionizing the ad group and finding new ideas. <br /> <br /> The film's premise was and is still incredibly risky, especially since the film was written and directed by a white man (Robert Downey, Sr.). However, this film does not fall victim to negative black stereotypes, which would result in the blaxploitation genre later rising and falling. While some sexual scenes may be somewhat overlooked by some viewers, the main message is that a black-owned and acting business can develop through innovation and risk-taking. Many people may not get a positive message away from this movie, but I just did. <br /> <br /> "Putney Swope" remains a strange era for a neglected movie, and Downey, Sr. (despite his son's return to the latter) never became the right leader he deserved. However, if you find the DVD on this movie, buy it and watch it. If it is Netflixis, then ditto. This is a film that can be confusing from time to time, but it's worth looking at, thanks to its contemporary film standards, for its enjoyment, ambition and non-conformist situation.
