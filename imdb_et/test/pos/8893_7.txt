Billy Crystal is Larry, a writer who hasn't written and suspects the murder of "Mommi's mother on the train," says Danny Devito and Anne Ramsey. The phrase "black comedy" was invented for the insanity that Hitchcock's "Strangers on a train" start. In fact, Owen (Devito) gets the idea that Larry will kill his mother in return for Owen who killed Larry for watching this famous movie. "I saw a movie. Criss-cross," says Owen Larry. Not that Larry knows what he's talking about until it's too late - like "strangers". Writing teacher Larry claims that his former wife, played by Kate Mulgrew, stole his book and put his name on it. He has become a great celebrity that appears in "Oprah", where he refers to Larry as a "beast". Owen is in Larry class. He lives with an abusive Neanderthal mother (Ramsey) and has visions of his poisoning, being caught with scissors - you call it. It is not long after it is seen that "Strangers is a Train" is in Honolulu, pursuing Larry's wife. While he is inclined to boat trip, trying to get an earring, Owen stands behind him and slips up ... Soon the police are looking for Larry to question him, but he is at Owen, where he is encouraged to live until he finishes, that he did. You know, "Crusade". "Strangers" have copied several scenes that are fun. Especially I loved Larry's confession to sleeping Mrs. Lift, Owen's mother, as Guy thinks she is talking to Bruno's stepfather. <br /> <br /> Crystal and DeVito are full of comic and timeless masters and leave you laughing, often out loud. Ramsey is funny funny - completely "there". Kim Griest and Rob Reiner also have roles - Griest is a Crystal girlfriend, and Reiner has it, which means it's terrible.
