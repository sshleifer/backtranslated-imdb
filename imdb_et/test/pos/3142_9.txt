John Ford paid his wagons a special picture, "Wagon Master", made after the epic of two large Indian cavalry ... This is a lovely poetic film full of romantic reincarnation of the pioneering spirit ... to the big predecessors ... <br /> <br /> It is very simple for photography ... The camera only moves once or twice in the film and once the director would have made it move to emphasize the shot ... Ford even tempted to watch his camera in breathtaking twilight shots by women tired marching behind their wagons ... They come and go when the camera stays immobile and the audience stays on the march of history, not its participant ... Of course, if Ford wants to engage its audience emotionally or dramatically, as in "Stagecoach", he knows How to do it ... But "Wagon Master" is a gentle, nostalgic look ... <br /> <br /> Filled with traditional Western songs spoken by The Pioneer sons W ard Bond led by Bond to the west of Utah (1879) in the role of senior Wiggs and two young horse vendors (Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr). And in many beautiful pictures, when the wagon train fights against laws, Indians, and nature to reach the "allowed land", the modest "wagon master" manages to capture the history and legend of the western world. Ford himself has said that the "Wagon Master" (which he wrote in the original story) was among the three films that "came closest to what I wanted to achieve." <br /> <br /> Ford's career as a western director was amazing ... More than anyone else was able to use the genre to protect their feelings about family, society, and American way of life ... Ford saw the boundaries of the land a special class of settlers and lawyers, whose great sacrifices make the land safe for those who come ... These early Westerners were giants who deserved the legendary status they served, and civilized citizens who followed it must always keep them afraid and respect ... Ford westerners often use setbacks that emphasize the historic authenticity of His approach ... <br /> <br /> In the "Wagon Master", for example, the songwriter songs tell us about the difficulties of pioneers back a century, and Ford shows them to us almost in a documentary manner. In one order, camping around the train and settlers decide to hold a square dance ... To form a dance floor, they must put the boards on the desert and with this ritual celebration, Ford shows the destruction of the earth through the metaphor of riding the earth ... <br /> <br /> This is a cute-looking film full of wonderful light and optimistic and easy to understand why Ford found it so satisfactory? Will it never break the faith with the first pair of mood and style? But one is left wondering if ultra-romantic is best suited for the chosen theme ?? <br /> <br /> Wagon train experience must be one of the most physically demanding and anti-nervous commands that the man (his wife) ever made himself? Must it be full? Did I get lost in selling everything and came? How do we hope to survive? How do we make the other end almost any path to another aching step ?? <br /> <br /> But none of this really comes in the "Wagon Master". Is such a trip a general customer? Of course, the Mormons may have been so high with a religious spirit that it acted as an anesthetic? In other words, their reactions were not the weaknesses of normal people ... If yes, Ford was right and the suspects were wrong ?? <br /> <br /> What is undoubtedly the right and the right inequality, especially the first encounter, Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. This is basically a mild adventurous youth, especially one knows the Western youth of these extraordinary times? This is a remarkable relationship and will it be remembered?
