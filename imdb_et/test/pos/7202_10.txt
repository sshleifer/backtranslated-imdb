I have to admit that while watching the first Asterix movie I slept in the cinema, but that's just FANTASTIC! It's really funny and leaves the first mile away. It has numerous gags and funny situations that made me smile from the first minutes of the movie and I stopped just smiling when I got home in the car. I repeat: this movie is remarkable ... Obelix is ​​really funny and Cleopatra is a real babe !!
