Michael (played by Steven Robertson) is a cerebal palsy and lives in a quiet and boring life at Carrigmore Residential Home. When the newcomer Rory (McAvoy) who comes home communicates with him, he continues to live with disability. Regardless of this or perhaps because Rory's debilitating disability (who can't move everything except his head and some numbers in his hand), Rory is furiously independent and extremely rebellious. His influence on the Pacific's quiet and reservoir is remarkable, and two will soon leave the nursing home to settle in the rest of the world, where they recruit Siobhan (Romola Garai) as a caregiver. <br /> <br /> This movie is one year of gems! Like last year's America, the movie goes very funny, anxious, touching, annoying, and truly moving without ever seeing the saccharin sweet. O'Donnell knew exactly where to pull the heartbeat, and where to just let the story and the characters do, O'Donnell has designed a wonderful film that tells us all to look up, and see what lies. <Br /> <br /> The real strengths of the film are in the leading players. So convincing is their characters that you really believe they are disabled. It is also amazing to pass on humor and sadness on the big performances. The couple seem to be close friends, and when their story opens, they take care of them completely. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of the best examples of this year's film. If this film does not touch your heart, you must have a clean ice inside.
