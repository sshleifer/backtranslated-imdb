The "Children of Railway" book is a children's literature published in 1906 by early British socialist Edith Nesbit, who had very strong views on the importance of family values ​​in raising children, and the story he said was probably modern. Somewhat surprisingly, it seems to keep a significant appeal to today's children a hundred years later. <br /> <br /> Edward's classical children's story, whose main roles are for children, is not very exciting. most movie visitors this day and age. But Jenny Agutter's real great performance, who (at the beginning of her long and outstanding actor career) played part of the oldest girl, Roberta (Bobby), with the remarkable work of scenario and director Lionel Jeffries and outstanding photography Arthur Ibbetson has made this film that is still not need to miss and most of the viewers are quite memorable. It is noteworthy that this book, created in 1905, was filmed five times between 1951 and 2000 (four of them by the BBC on British television), and all of these versions are not only highly admired but also highly valued (something that the user has comment on the database), although it may seem almost unthinkable for nostalgic history, which is primarily for children. Since I haven't seen four BBC television versions, these comments are only related to the 1970 film version of the movie. Unlike most children's books, Children on Rail can appeal to more adults than children. The structure of family life has changed so much in the last century that many children feel completely lost in the film, while many older adults may find it has a significant nostalgic appeal. Perhaps they compensate for the fact that the children on the film are full of life and vitality, while adult characters are well rounded, mostly “stuffed shirts”. The story is mature, about love, support and encouragement, not only timeless, but also appealing to all ages. This can be pretty much called sentimental and more than a bit ideal, but it is never in some way clever, and the rarely justified adjective "uplifting" fits with it like gloves. <br /> <br /> Spoiler front. <Br /> <br /> The film begins with the upper middle class Edward family who celebrates Christmas in a comfortable and relatively spacious London when two unexpected visitors invite and take the Father (who is a senior government official) with them. The mother must move alongside the railway to a very small house in the far part of Yorkshire, and the children are gradually building a new life, which is mainly related to railways and few trains. This life in small ways is quite eventful and the older daughter Bobby is growing fast when she takes more responsibility from her mother. At one point he keeps an accident on the train when his sharp eyes see that landslides have created a natural threat. The Father's story is never put to high pressure, but it will never be forgotten and it will gradually become clear that he is imprisoned and a coup is suspected. Ultimately, these doubts (we're not talking about how or why) will come out and unexpectedly appear in the local station to join their family. <br /> <br /> For many years this movie was not available in any home video format in North America, but Anchor Bay created a DVD three years ago so they clearly admitted that this fairly simple movie hasn't lost its complaint yet . For anyone who has not already, I would strongly advise you to rush to buy a copy of this DVD as long as it is still available - you would probably not be disappointed if you have not become completely cynical or your minimum requirements for the film include lung blood and / or intense sexual scenes .
