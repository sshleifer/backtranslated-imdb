Fast paced and fun noir located in Vienna right after W.W.11. Donald Buka is a refugee who cannot find a legal job because he has no papers. Paper does not mean that there is no work permit, which means that it is not possible to get a passport. He lives under the guidance of a friend's cab at night. When he gets stuck, it means three months in prison. One night, he picks up the price of a big hotel and goes to the airline's office. Buka takes the man's luggage and returns to the car. There he finds that his client has acquired an unnecessary hole behind his head. What to do? Call the police? Without a work permit, they let him get really fast. No, he needs time to think about it. He drives to a secluded place, empties the man's pockets and hides the body. Now he has an American passport and a lot of money! He falls to the contact of the underworld to change the passport photo. Now he just has to go to the hotel and collect a man's flight ticket. His ticket to freedom! Needless to say, it would be too easy. The hotel is waiting for a dead man's lover, Joan Camden. Camden is a rather disgusting wife of Francis Lederer, of course, Lederer is a pig that had fallen out of a man in Buka's cabin. Camden calls the police because he believes Buka has kidnapped his lover. Buka shows his new passport and manages to talk about it. Camden breaks down when a husband, Lederer, appears in the police station. Lederer persuades the police that Camden has suffered mentally and is being released. He escapes again, finds Buka and the two decide to escape the country. Lederer looks back and Buka has to decide if Camden's help is worth his freedom. This movie is much better than I call. Buka is best known as a low-life policeman killer in the 1950s "Midnight and Dawn". The film was composed by actor Turhan Bey.
