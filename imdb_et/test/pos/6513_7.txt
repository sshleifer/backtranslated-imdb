"Miss Cast Away" is a fun trif that develops a serious plot or character to pack as much as possible. It is best to enjoy a large audience who is open to such entertainment and perhaps has had some drinks. Most jokes are the basis for current events, so in the years to come, this film may become the time-lapse of references to pop culture in the early 21st century. <br /> <br /> The 30i to 24p conversion of video footage creates a jerky look in some respects, with the most open-looking shots. But I find it encouraging that Mr Jackson has shown a useful interest in one of his defense forces, even after he has passed the cute-preteen boy stage. <br /> <br /> The effect of the job is not as bad as one review. Most of this was done by one man's team in a short period of time, including the animator William Sutton, whose name seemed to have been excluded from IMDb credits. His work is an extraordinary achievement and really helps to fill the gaps in this movie. I hope he's finally paid!
