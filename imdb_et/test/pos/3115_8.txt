In 1950 there were two very different and interesting West: "Gunfighter" by Henry King and "Wagon Master" by John Ford. "The Gunfighter" was historically significant as it clearly influenced Zimmerman's "High Noon" (1951) and later the revolutionary West. <br /> <br /> But personally I find "Wagon Master" in front of this modern colleague. Ford's small masterpieces are not much about storytelling; it should be understood more as a poem that describes old western concepts. Although we are optimistic and warm, we deserve naivety because it is completely free of pretentious stress. The border landscape is well used because it supports poetic narrative perfectly. Add the work of a naturalistic camera and we transport western folklore spoken in cinematography among Mormon travelers.
