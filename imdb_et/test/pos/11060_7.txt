Perhaps this film is too long, but it has a charm for 45 years later. For Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh, the main roles are more appropriate. I could take less care of Gary Cooper, but Ingrid Bergman is fine, especially in dark hair. The film is worth seeing for supportive casting: Flora Robson is a terrible servant. She is a white woman on a black surface and can express an evil or voodoo lover. Jerry Austin as a servant dwarf has an amazing role that keeps you stupid despite some long scenes. When talking about scenes, Florence steals most of Bates in Bates as a co-author of a social woman. At the end of the movie I didn't understand the result of the rail fight and the last scene was pure Hollywood. This is a strange feeling when you realize that the title of the movie refers to rail rather than luggage!
