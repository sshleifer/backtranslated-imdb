Spending is a very beautiful film. I put it directly into a wonderful short film: Cosa bella Fiona MacKenzie. It does not only concern departure, but also tolerance and acceptance in general. I look forward to working with Laurel Himmel in the future. Actors, Angie Redman and Nina Landey are pretty good. The relationship between the main characters could have been somewhat strengthened, because we understand that there is a very strong relationship between them, but maybe it can be explained a little. I'm surprised that Angie Redman doesn't appear in other movies. As the leader of Laurel Himmel is a great first step, I am sure his skills will be more visible.
