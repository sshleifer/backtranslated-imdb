Renee Zellweger is a Betty, Kansas speaker who wants to be a sister who has liked the soap opera actress (Greg Kinnear) and who is married to Delhi, cheated, stupid, male, trying to sell some stolen drugs. Unfortunately, instead, he gets brutally murdered, while Betty is secretly guarded. It leaves her unhinged, believing that Kinnear is really the character she plays, Dr. David Ravell, and that she is the former bride of her RN. He leads LA to find his lost love without knowing that stolen drugs are in his trunk. His pursuit is Charlie and Wesley (respectively Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), hit by men who inadvertently died in Delhi before they discovered where the drugs were hidden. They continue him all over the country, while Charlie loves his image gradually. <br /> <br /> <br /> In LA, things get totally odd because no one understands that Betty is wrong. Alternatively funny and touching, this movie is almost perfect. Stop reading and review the comments.
