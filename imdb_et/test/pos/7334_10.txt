I just saw this movie in Austin Texas at the Austin Gay and Lesbian Film Festival and it was my festival's favorite. A gymnast is a film that you don't miss. It is an honest "reconciliation" story about relationships, self-discovery, aging and the courage to change and move forward. Not only is it a good story, but Dreya Weber and Addie Yungmee's famous aerialists are taking their breath away! Watch this movie! It will soon come to a festival near you. This movie deserves when the main network or studio gets up right away. I will definitely buy it when it is available on DVD.
