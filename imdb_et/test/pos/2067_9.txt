This is my favorite film. But what makes it work is not complicated by Renny Harlin's explosions and fires. This is the Shane Black script and its dirty delivery by Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson. <br /> <br /> The chemistry of these two directors is precious. Thanks to God it was never done. The risk of the original moving too much. <br /> <br /> "Long Kiss" checks the discs for the scene to be quoted from the scene to be quoted, and back. Never a boring moment. <br /> <br /> It must be Jackson's most fun role and the amazing thing is that he plays the most common signs of his career. There's no exotic Tarantino hit-man, super cool Shaft or border-area soldier. In TLKG, Jackson is the eternal one we know. Poor schmucks are drawn to the odyssey of this mad woman to discover the dangerous secret of her past. <br /> <br /> Although the story claims that Davis's character, Samantha Caine suffers from amnesia, writer and director treats Samantha Caine is not just a new identity taken by Charly Baltimore's amnesia - she is a separate personality . In the first half of the film, the traumatic sufferers of Samantha will help the Charly underwater dissociating person to come up again. <br /> <br /> The material from his earlier life, extracted by Jackson's detective Mitch Henessey, facilitates Charly's recovery. Good timing also, given Samantha's target. <br /> <br /> But Charly has to fight to remain the dominant person. One collects a dialogue about the bits that the warrior's personality (Charly) developed after his father's death, and he was recruited in the chapter. <br /> <br /> For eight years, Charly was buried in the psyche. Samantha's identity became the dominant personality. (She's even more fun than Charly.) This was probably due to her mother's coming because she's a reunion with her daughter, who breaks Charly's fight against Samantha's blockade, resulting in their obvious integration until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> "The Best Movie Quote" is impossible to choose: <br /> <br /> "Now you're a good-looking guy?" <br /> <br /> "I saved your ass. It was great!" <br /> <br /> "Continue Dying. Off." <br /> <br /> "I jaw jaw and sweetheart" Pop goes nuts ". <br /> <br /> A couple more than a dozen, there are too many to quote here. <br /> <br /> Geena Davis looks good, and it looks like a acting hero without going over forty. (Listen to the history of Charley, do math). <br /> <br /> Also a fantastic soundtrack. Santana, Muddy Waters, Elvis, LaBelle, Marvin Gaye. <br /> <br /> I only give "Long Kiss for a Good Night" 9 just because I don't believe in the perfect 10. I'll get it a dozen times and will stay fresh. "It's a wonderful life."
