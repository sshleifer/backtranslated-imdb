Starting from where Doctor, Rose, his alternative father, Mickey, his alternative opponent, Ricky and Mickey's small rebel forces, is this cyber-men's reality version, this second episode of Cybermen arc feels more like an episode of a PhD, compared to the previous episode that honestly felt, that this is an episode of the most expansive exhibition "Sliders". The arc as a whole was quite enjoyable because I am the one who agrees with the maximum that is NOT WHAT IS GOOD Who, but at the same time it is inevitable that it will be compared to the previous episode of the Dalek episode. And these comparisons would only make it less than it is. I just feel this story could have been done in one episode. I remember in the first part of the review that such stories dealing with alternative realities do not usually have lasting consequences, but that is not the case, but what general traits are labeled and which does not really correspond to the character. /> <br /> My class: C +
