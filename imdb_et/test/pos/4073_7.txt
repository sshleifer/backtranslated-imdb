I went to watch this movie that didn't wait much, but I was pleasantly surprised by the joining of Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy. It was a fast paced movie and one and a half hours went fast. It certainly won't win any Academy Award, but it was a change in Mr De Niro's pace. He's good at comedy. In general, I enjoyed it.
