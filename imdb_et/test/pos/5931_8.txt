Probably the best Royal Rumble over the years. <br /> <br /> Match 1 sees Edge's battle with Shawn Michaels in a good but very long match. The next task is one of the worst wrestlers - Heidenreich takes The Undertaker to a dull cup. Match Number 3 shows that Bradshaw is surprisingly defending his WWE title against Big Show and Kurt Angle in a good competition. The next meeting will see Triple H, who will defend his 10th heavyweight title by fighting against Randy Orton in a great game. <br /> <br /> Royal Rumble continues with 15 raw superstars and 15 Smackdowns! superstars hit around to try and fight to fight and fight a master who might be Wrestlemania 21. Highlights Tough Enough 3 winner Daniel Puder got his ass kicked by Chris Benoit, Eddie Guerrero and Hardcore Holly! All superstars who beat the mess of Muhammad Hassan and the raw superstars vs Smackdown! superstars! <br /> <br /> Not a bad PPV at all. <br /> <br /> Edge vs HBK - 8/10 Taker vs Heidenreich - 4/10 JBL vs Angle vs Big Show - 7.5 / 10 Triple H vs Orton - 8.5 / 10 Royal Rumble Game - 9/10
