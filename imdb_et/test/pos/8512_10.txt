People criticize NSNA because it is a low Bond god of Sean Connery's career and as it is unofficial. *** May contain spoilers * First, this film is better than any other bond that includes some other actor, then Connery, all the sub-wannabs in my book. Sean Connery is the only real bond, no one even comes close to his toughness, good looks and sex appeal. Yes, this movie is a low point in Connery's Bond career, but it's still the 80's best bond. Sean Connery is the only bond actor who is good in old age. he did not become as confused as Moore, but kept his good looks and strength, but acquired some gray hair. So what? he is still the only real 007 and he is as cool and tough as ever. Sean Connery is one and only 007. And this movie is definitely worth whatever one says. Opening a pistol accessory, but you don't get everything, isn't it? great theme song.
