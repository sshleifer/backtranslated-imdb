I still can't describe what I feel when I got this fnac from the site. This rare film, so little spoken and known, is hard to find for fans, but the contrast between the past and the current is devastating: now I keep the movie DVD with the best quality. As I did in Atlantis, another rare Besson movie I bought from the Internet, I saw it at home, all DVD and TV lights turned off and wondered about the experience. I didn't know what to expect. Wickedly was always looking for some disappointment when I saw Luc Besson's movie I've never seen before. But it never came. This movie was no exception. From the outset, I realized that such a film-making person would be great in the future. And so it happened. It has won many awards (including the highest prize at my country's film festival, which makes me proud) and it shows that this film is doing much bigger things. It may be the most original postwar movie I've ever seen, beating Mad Max's originality and artistic feeling. There is no problem with this film: his cinematography is genius, as well as the power of the actors. I am also proud to say that I finally saw all of my favorite director's films and I have almost all copies of them (Joan of Arc is still waiting for me to buy a DVD). This film is first and foremost a style and dedication that makes it clear why Luc Besson is my chosen director: good taste, beautiful framing, great music usage (I also wondered about Eric Serra's first full-length) and promise of great achievements. Gaumont contributed to his boy-genius, a man who later changed the attitude of France and Europe between films and their publicity. We hope that Besson will start working on a new management project. I'm the first to be happy about it. So far, I recommend this movie to anyone who needs to learn how good movies are made with little money. I loved the atmosphere of the film, which, with its black and white cinematography, gives us even more oppressed worldviews after the Holocaust. This film works with the thin magic of films: showing images that we cannot explain in words. And I'm with all the people who write and liked this movie: a good choice! A great tilt for everyone who sees it, and feels that a small part of their life has changed.
