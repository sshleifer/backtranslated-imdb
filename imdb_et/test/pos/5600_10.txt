In the Book of Life, Martin Donovan plays Jesus, who on December 31 will appear at JFK Airport in the new millennium, fighting with Thomas Jay Ryan (Satan) and deciding on the fate of the world. David Simonds (Kurt Accountant Amateur) is also a compulsive, homeless player. <br /> <br /> As usual, Hartley creates a surreal world where ordinary beauty is strange and artificially flowing across the world with framed scenes and urban / industrial landscapes full of dazzling light and shadow. As usual, he introduces seemingly random details early on, then brings them back in fun and unexpected contexts - humor is simple but terrible and irreversible. Hartley has an amazing ability to build concurrent everyday and unheard of small and powerful moments. As usual, he creates a tone that is exhausted and tired of the world, but at the same time vulnerable, open and honest. In a few minutes he moves from amazing humor to metaphysical and poetic language - a letter that is so dead and perfect that tears are hard to keep, despite the lack of obvious emotions. Another fantastic and very entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> Curriculum vitae (digital camera?), the effect of which is blurred: heavenly hand in hand with thinking and hyper-awareness of the last moments are uncertain and short. All Hartley films have the opportunity to highlight, but this unique effect combines it, as pictures wash the screen as it first breaks, but becomes more and more beautiful. The last shot is remarkable. All this may seem expensive, but the movie is comedy and it makes itself fun even when it makes Armageddon, the Day of Judgment and the "urbanization" fun. Although it is actually quite deep, moving and confirming life, it is usually light and playful. Action is flawless because Hartley has a weak tone in his films (the tone that some people don't get and that forces them to appreciate such hollows - the same people who have a negative response) to Peter Greenaway). As always, there are definitely people who respond to this film with cynicism and intimidation - people who are Hartley's sharp shifts and what they see as pretentious or methodistic - but everyone who is a Hartley fan will love this movie (if they have the opportunity to see it, is). It's hard to say what would be on the video.
