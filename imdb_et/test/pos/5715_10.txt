This one exhibition can be the most fantastic exhibition I've ever seen. Naming it simply as an act of ascension is to make it a great injustice, it's a sure reason that it was a Broadway show. John Leguizamo is a master who makes people of every culture home by listening to his story of growing and dealing with his family and life in general. I would recommend showing it to anyone if they can handle that language.
