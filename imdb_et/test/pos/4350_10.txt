Little Dieter needs to fly is another remarkable body of Werner Herzog's filmmaking. Recently reviewed on a DVD, nearly ten years after the US published its original publication in 1997, it has not lost its power and its impact on documentaries is as diverse as Herzog's recent Grizzly Man and Errol Morris Award Fog War. Like the first one, it describes an American life that is too short for 74 minutes. Like the latter, it gives little sight to the war. Yes, we see violence and heroism, but because the fog of war led us to one of the most important insulators of the last century, this film allows us to peek into the life of the tortured, tortured bull. and finally triumphs. Except in some way, this shape and shape are not as simple or enchanting as my short description. Likewise, Little Dieter does not need to fly his title, Dieter Dengler and the immigrant German who lived through the Nazi ruins (see, for example, in his hometown of Wildburg, his only grandfather who was not voting for Hitler and brutally suffering from this billboard) after World War II in Germany and his own imprisonment in Vietcong when his air strike hit Laos on February 1, 1966? The title of the movie and the idea that Dengler's passion became a pilot was mixed with the impression that Allied fighter jets made him, when they kidnapped his city, as a child, to believe that Dengler was the central theme of the film, it is not true. The theme is Dengler's survival, more specifically his human will, the whole human will. The details of Dengler's romantic life are too Hollywood and they are related to Herzog's interest. Nor is it that he won the purple heart, the medal of the prize, D.F. and the Navy Cross. The thing that pushed Dengler so much to survive and remain so rejoicing (though there are blind spots) is what is at the heart of this film and in the whole Herzog canon. Dieter Dengler's "far-off barbaric dream" is a fully thoughtful use of Herzog Country and Madagascar song, Oay Lahy E, during many jungle scenes, among other great touches, shows Herzog, perhaps with Martin alone, Scorses, best picture and music manipulator on film . How long can he join!
