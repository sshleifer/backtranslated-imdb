Oz is one of the most pure and addictive TV experiences. <br /> <br /> Having taken part in SBS, I was skeptical at first, but now I have finished the fourth season, I regret to know that this brilliant exhibition is approaching its end (6 seasons) and still can't get enough OZ. <br /> <br /> You want something that raises your senses and stomach to the limit ... Oz fits the bill, hands down. <br /> <br /> It's not a child's stuff, people, its violent, brutal, and not beautiful. Why, its an experimental unit within the maximum security prison. <br /> <br /> Tom Fontana Oz is great in all the right departments, actors, writing and management. <br /> <br /> HBO's Oz It is also recommended for new users to get information about this series. It was the first one-hour show produced by HBO, which proves the masterpiece and what others follow. <br /> <br /> Thank you to HBO
