I have to admit that I was surprised how good this film was when I first looked at it. I had planned to see it in theaters in the summer, but I found it unpleasant that it had already been and gone. That's why I expected it to be removed from theaters because it was bad. Then I rented it today and watched it and really enjoyed it. The speed at which the events occurred was questionable, it could have been a little longer. I found that it was very true to the book, but missed some important parts: Mullet Finger's real name, and so on. I felt like I hadn't read a book that I didn't really understand. The action was pretty good, the other thing I was bad about, but the policeman, sorry I didn't remember the name of the actor, it could have been a little better. All in all, I found this to be a very entertaining movie and would recommend it to all audiences!
