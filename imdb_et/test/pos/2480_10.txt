First of all, the whole script is mostly improved, adding to the fantastic illusion that what we look at is a real documentary. Secondly, the participants hired by Watkin were chosen to represent their true political alliances and backgrounds purposefully. Imagined hippies are real hippies, government officials (though not necessarily in government itself) are at least really conservative conservatives in the system, and many police officers are real police officers. The interactions of these actors, given Watkins' freedom of text, eventually end up in a violent head where even Watkins himself is convinced that the cast member has actually shot. (We hear him shouting "Cut! Cut!" In the background.) <br /> <br /> AMAZING film, although American critics were quite harsh in their comments, one of them said it was "the most offensive film" ever seen. It is not completely unexpected, because the opening of this oppressive communist-like American mentality in this era would certainly attract some cages. This pseudo-documentary film certainly requires an open mind, although if you are serious about the exact depiction of the 60's culture, it would be a movie to watch.
