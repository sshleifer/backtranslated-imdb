Dramatic license - some hate it, although it is necessary to rewrite any biography. "Lucy" is all about Lucille Ball's main points for teenage years, early careers and 20-year-olds Desi Arnaz, though in a cut and redesigned manner. <br /> <br /> Key Emotional Points from Lucy's Life: Lucille's struggle to find her niche as an actor, finally flourished with the brilliant comedy that made the mark Lucy Ricardo's legend; his uneasy, romantic and finally impossible marriage with Desi Arnaz; Lucy & Desi creates the first television empire and forever secures its place in history as the most memorable pairing of TV. <br /> <br /> Like Lucille Ball, Rachel York is commendable. Don't wait to see quite the same wonderful change as Judy Davis when he played Judy Garland, but York makes the ball strong and pleasant and is very funny. Although his comic timing differs from Lucy, he is still plausible. The film will never be perfect for her perfectionist behavior in the set and her abuse with Vivian Vance during the early "I Love Lucy" years, but looking at York to portray Lucy's practice privately is a nice engagement. <br /> <br /> Daniel Pino is thinner and less charismatic than the real Desi, but he has his own charm and he mostly does a decent job with a Desi accent, especially in the opening plan. Madeline Zima was decent, if not too memorable, as teenagers Lucy. <br /> <br /> Vivian Vance and William Frawley were not much, fortunately, because Rebecca Hobbs and Russell Newman were not very convincing in their roles. Not that they are not good actors in themselves, they just weren't all that fit to play them. Most of the actors were from Australia and New Zealand, and repressed accents are occasionally discoverable. <br /> <br /> Although the main structure of the movie is historical, there are many deviations, some for seemingly inexplicable reasons. Jess Oppenheimer, editor-in-chief of Lucy's "My Favorite Spouse", which began in 1948, is depicted on this film to reach "I Love Lucy" in 1951, ignoring the fact that he was the main creator! This film also depicts Marc Daniels as the main "I Love Lucy" director of his entire run, ignoring the fact that he replaced William Asher after the first season! Also, although I think it was due to budget constraints, Ricardo has shown that they live in the same apartment throughout their stay in New York when they actually changed in 1953. also original. The Connecticut home looks pretty close to the original, except for the right and left sides of the house are condensed and rebuilt. <br /> <br /> There is also Desi who talks about buying RKO in 1953 during Lucy's red intimidation, although RKO did not hit the market until 1957. These changes could have been for a dramatic license, and the film wouldn't work to convey the main facts, but would it have harmed them to show a little more respect for Oppenheimer and Asher, who are two important figures in the history of "I Love Lucy"? The biggest gaff comes from "I Love Lucy" vacation scenes, at least some of them. It is always risky to revive something that has been captured from the film and has been seen by billions of people, but even more so with the CHANGES OF ATTENTION. The style along with the giant bread biscuit was cut and everyone who is familiar with this episode would immediately notice the differences! Also, "We are a child" was shortened, but it was almost dead. The best thing was the "grape-stomping" scene where Rachel York really laughed like Lucy. Manufacturers made a reasonable decision not to directly recreate the "Vitametavegamin" and the candy factory bits, but show that the actors are practicing them. Because of this approach, these scenes were effective. <br /> <br /> The main guilt of the movie is that viewers are already very much aware of Lucy's life because much has been lost or omitted. All in all, however, it gives Lucy & Des a proper portrait of the marriage, and the real mistakes can be ignored if the character development works effectively.
