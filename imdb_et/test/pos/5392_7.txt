Gary Cooper and Marshal are changing identities because they both agree that Cooper would be more effective against illegal people. In this movie, there are remarkable costumes, both Marshal and Steve Cochran, who is a bad guy. Cochran is carrying his arms upside down, apparently to be able to cross. The film starts with a lot of fun with Wild Bill Hickok. Ruth Roman, looking very beautiful, is a Marshal's groom. There's a lot of action, never a boring moment, but you have to concentrate because the story is a little tricky. Good entertainment.
