I think I don't have too much to add. I found comedy still funny for more than ten years after it appeared. <br /> <br /> One thing I noticed was during the music dialogue that it would distract and often make the movie very hooked if it had been. The use of songs is good during the film, but the background of the orchestra is too busy, too contrastive, and if a movie is ever edited on a DVD, I would strongly recommend that background music be almost unheard of. It has reduced the overall sense of the film and I see subconsciously why many people have gone through it. <br /> <br /> The film had many levels of script, plot, and comedy levels. It is too bad that the producer and the director felt they needed musical schlock to improve their mood. Now, knowing this, I find it hard to look and I quietly cursed who participated in the musical editing of the film. It had all the nuances of the teardrop.
