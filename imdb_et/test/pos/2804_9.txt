There are some things in life that we cannot experience more than once and the college experience is one of them. Especially when we live in a foreign country and an apartment with 6 wackos from 6 countries. The main character, Xavier, leaves her clean life in Paris, her former hippie mother and her beautiful girlfriend, and goes to Barcelona to learn Spanish to work at the embassy. She falls in love with a French medical spouse and makes friends who make her look differently. When Wendy's brother (Wendy is one of the companions of the room) comes from England, the film begins to become much more fun. Anyway, Xavier will look at things differently from all his new friends and will probably live something he will never forget and change his life forever. All in all, it is a very nice nostalgic film that becomes even more interesting because it is international. I thought it was very interesting that you see all those children from different countries, all of whom speak different languages ​​and have different cultures with each other and have fun. I gave it to 10 out of 10 because I left the theater with a smile on my face and thought about things I haven't done yet when I'm still in college and want to do before it's too late.
