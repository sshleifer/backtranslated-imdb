I just finished the American American werewolf double night in London and Paris. Let me start by saying that "London" is still after all these years and the transformation order is quite impressive by any standard, the movie was funny and scary, also a little gore. its nice, some scars, a lot of gore is not as exciting or eerie as the original, but it has a few laughs about what has become quite fashionable in the movies today, so maybe in that sense it was before time, changes al "CGI, though the technology of this time is good, not nearly as impressive as the original .I gave this movie 7 because I have to admit it was enjoyable, I laughed a lot and found that Tom Everett Scott is so stupid that I wanted to dislike my performance first ... .Julie Delpy was competent, as was the script, which lacked some shine and fineness, and I read here that John Landis had to mislead that he wasn't quite sure it would have been a completely different film. also some discussion queue "What if" and no one has seen the obvious that it should be American and here is my title "American Werewolf Comes Home" or DC, which would be fun for all these political dogs need to be intimidating.original in your new DVD with dolby 5.1 sound, and see both on HDTV with upstream ... nice !!!!
