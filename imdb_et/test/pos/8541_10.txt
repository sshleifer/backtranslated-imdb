You know those movies that are horribly awful, but you can't help them, but do you love them? Well this is Evil Ed, perhaps the best terrible movie in the world. Sound is garbage, dubbing is nonsense, the scenario is meaningless and special effects are the priest. But I can't help this film honestly, but I've recommended it to at least 50 people over the years. Sam Campbell (or the man who plays him) should be an actor in the studio series because he is memorable. Perhaps the biggest film villain who is not called Tony Montana. Seriously, if you don't expect much, you won't be disappointed. Keep an eye-catching approach to watching this movie and you will appreciate it soon after ten.
