Warner Brothers, a great American-style Big Trail, broke Raoul Walsh's first-rate western "They Died With Boots", a somewhat inaccurate but completely inspiring biography of the cavalry George Armstrong Custer. The Chronicle of the Movie Custer from the moment he arrives at the West Point Academy until the Indians kill him in a small Horn. This is one of Errol Flynn's signature roles and one of Raoul Walsh's greatest epics. Walsh and Flynn joined quite often and "They died with their boots" reunited Olivia de Havilland as Flynn's romantic interest last. They appeared in a couple of seven previous films. This 140-minute black-and-white ocher is nothing dynamic with dynamic sequences, humorous romantic scenes, and stern dramatic contradictions between our hero and his opponents. One of the notorious mistakes is related to Colonel Philip Sheridan, who was shown at West Point before the Civil War. Indeed, Sheridan was a lieutenant at that moment. In fact, Commander Robert E. Lee, as shown by earlier Flynn movie "Santa Fe Trail". Another historical expiration concerns Lieutenant General Whitfield Scott; Scott was not the Commander of the Union Forces during the military. Warner Brothers introduced Custer as a drinker (probably because Flynn had a reputation for drinking), but in real life Custer does not drink or smoke. Nonetheless, these and other historical tombs do not harm a truly excellent film. <br /> <br /> "They died with their boots", opening Custer's riding to the West Point Military Academy. an African-American who carries his luggage and takes care of his dogs. After the guardian sergeant realizes that he has come to honor the future plaque instead of a high-level foreign state, Sergeant Custer turns over to ranked cadet Ned Sharp (Arthur Kennedy, "City for Conquest"). Sharp plays Custer's practical work by placing him in Major Romulus Taipe's (Stanley Ridges of "Task Force") quarters running out of Custer. Of course, Custer attacks on Sharp's public strike. General Phil Sheridan (John Litel, "The Sons of Katie Elder") is ready to release Custer from West Point for behavioral disorders. As it turns out, Sheridan cannot be expelled from Custr, because Custer has not registered. When he enrolls, Custer creates a mediocre academic reputation capable of fighting and accumulating disadvantages. When the American Civil War breaks out, West Point graduates will end up cadres who have not completed their education and are attacking. One of the last soldiers occupied by cadets is Custer. Avid, if he has to fight, Custer meets his future wife, Elizabeth 'Libby' Bacon (Olivia de Havilland, "Santa Fe Trail"), and they promise each other despite Mr. Bacon (Gene Lockhart of "). Carousel "), who discourages Custer's eyes. Bacon seems to have run over Custer's cabin and sacked Buston of one of Custer's friends and our hero. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, in Washington, Custer is desperately trying to go to the regiment, but major Taipe Custer communicates with Lieutenant General Winfield Scott (Sidney Greenstreet "The Maltese Falcon") and has a common appetite for the Bermuda onion, which is one of Custer's qualities, and not only sees Taipe giving Custer another cavalry but Custer separates Taipe's horse in order to get his command. During the Bull Rune battle, on July 21, 1861, Custer does not take orders other than Sharp, hits his chief officer and keeps the bridges in order for the infantry to cross it. Custer instead of being sentenced to a hospital, Custer receives a medal instead of a trial. If General Confederate General Jeb Stuart threatens the military of the Union in the Battle of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania, Scott is shocked the chance that the south will win. If the Brigadier General is not found, Scott will go to Taipe to promote the first available officer. The mistake has been made and Custer is being promoted. First of all, Custer amazes the moment and breaks down Stuart. After the war, Custer attacks and starts with boys at the local salons. Sharp appears as a curve rail promoter, and with his father, they try to get Custer as their rail president so they can get money. Finally, Libby intervenes with General Sheridan, a commander of the army in his name, and returns to active service as the 7th Cavalry Commander. When he takes the command, Custer finds the seventh cavalry drunk and is not surprised that Sharp orders the fort liqueur. Meanwhile, Custer has the first Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn, "Navarone Weapons") and he takes him to custody. Of course, Crazy Horse flees, Custer becomes an opponent and they fight. <br /> <br /> When Custer is abandoned by Crazy Horse and Indians, Sharp with Taipe as a government agent conspire to destroy the peace treaty with Sioux and other Indian nations. They also make sure that Custer is lifted up for charges that arise when Taipei is hit by a cabin. His way to Washington is discovered by the perfection of Custer Sharp and Taipe, who has dragged the golden strike on the holy Black Hills. Settlers rampage and Indians hit warpath. Custer sacrifices himself and his 600 men at Little Big Horn in the slam-bang showdown against 6000 redskins. "Stagecoach" lens Bert Glennon captures both grain and glory. The 7th Army's long-lasting fire, leaving the fortress at dawn, is remarkable. As an additional pretext for Custer's imminent death, Libby captures after he leaves his small horns. "They died with their boots" will benefit from a top-notch Max Steiner score that includes the regiment "Gary Owen".
