This is the best movie I've ever seen. It is all love and hate of tragedy and happiness. And a deep friendship that doesn't even war can be destroyed. <br /> <br /> The most beautiful casting I've ever seen. Patrick Swayze and James Read were top performers in this film. <br /> <br /> If you see Part 1, you want to see it all. Some of my friends looked at some of my home, then went out and bought a movie. <br /> <br /> I am a civil war, but this movie got my grandchildren interested in history. All the films that can teach children history are great. I have books I, II and III, and when girls come from Florida every year, they want to see North-South.
