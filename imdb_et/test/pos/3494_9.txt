i love this movie !! maybe it's my generation, but I can really communicate with what he's talking about and how to do it. it kept me laughing by then. movie duration, next day and after. I think this movie is not one to look at when you mainly care about the development of land and character. this movie is pretty much for the generation that understands it. there are a lot of things you just know that you have grown up in that generation that you wouldn't be if you said 40. I think Sacha's Cohen shepherd was great and I mean very good. he is a genius. and the reason he is such an idiot is that he can make people believe he is a complete idiot and makes it at the same time funny !! <br /> <br /> Very good movie. strongly recommend !!!! (not as strong as you are over 30 years old)
