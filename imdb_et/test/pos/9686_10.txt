.... but at the same time, some of you think, "Am I ready for what I see?" <br /> <br /> Finally you are happy when you saw it. I was at least. Jackass Number Two is twice laughing and twice as big. Some stunts leave you breathless. In addition to Little Miss Sunshine, I think it was the best movie I saw this summer. Maybe even this year. <br /> <br /> All of the cast items are in addition to some like Chris Raab and Rake Yohn. I don't think any cast member would have a boring moment. Each stunt was either funny or dangerous or a combination of both; stupid. The beginning was as funny as the first and the end was interesting fun; cast musical number. <br /> <br /> Jackass Number Two is the perfect movie to see with your friends. Stay on credit, it's pretty funny moments. One is related to Luke Wilson.
