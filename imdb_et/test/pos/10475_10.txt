Some have commented on subtitles that are not a problem in this movie - I ask differently - the disorder between facial expressions and subtle interactions is such that you can't afford to take your eyes off even in a fraction of a second. To overcome this problem, I tried to watch the DVD in English to resolve this issue (do not make the mistake if the result is a traverse). The only way to get the full benefit is to watch it two or three times fast one after another, so you know it and ignore the subtitles. An acting master class - not in dialogue, but in body language. <br /> <br /> This is a small thing - the postmaster / shopkeeper pulls out his chest and goes to get his cap before he sends a letter from France! ! The confused joy of the General, as a joy of perfect grapes, is the biblical reference worthy of "Be there." <br /> <br /> Cinematography is a fantastic and trivial minimalist village whose color is washed, telling the feast of celebration when it comes. I have a friend who claims to be from Borgia and who is the motto of the family "If it's worth it, it's worth it if it's worth" - Amen. <br /> <br /> I laugh out loud and cry every time I watch this movie
