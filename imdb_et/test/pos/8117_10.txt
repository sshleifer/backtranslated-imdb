I saw this movie at the Boston Women's Cinema Festival last night and was sad to hear that Mrs Troche tells us (her questions and answers after screening) that she does not think she would see too much US distribution due to her demand to include the whole so-called "gay content". It was a FANTASTICALLY fun comedy, and it seems to me that the American audience may like it as much as they liked The Full Monty, so it's really unfortunate and somehow ridiculous that a few shots kiss the two boys. it's away from the usual theaters. Wonderful cast, FABULOUS script and, of course, Rose Troche's direction makes it one of the more fun movies I've seen.
