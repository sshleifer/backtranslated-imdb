One of the early myths of the Early Sound era is that they could not do the Western peoples because they had problems recording sound on the spot. In fact, at least the financial constraints on depression, at least on budget line A, were temporarily killed. In the years 1929-1931, before the recession, "A" was indeed a flourishing, remarkable example, including Virginia, Billy Kid and Cimarron. The Big Trail was perhaps the biggest of all of them? The gigantic pioneer in the West shot an early widescreen process that is adequately mentioned with greatness. Thanks to the recent DVD version, we now see the widescreen version taken simultaneously with the full screen. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> The director was Raoul Walsh, the man to whom the adventure spirit was outdoor. and in many ways is an ideal choice. She uses a very broad frame to show the western landscape in the most breathtaking way. It is very typical for Walsh that there are many frames in the beginning, such as where the woman starts firewood. Most of the screen is tightly filled with wagons and other clutter, but in one corner we see a desert that pulls out. When the wagon train goes, we will gradually open a plain, where wagons will pull out like curtain blinds. These images are not as effective in the full-screen version, but the broader canvas was never better than outdoor in Walsh. <br /> <br /> But it is unfortunate. In the dialogue scenes, Walsh tends to place actors in the middle of the picture as if they were an imaginary full screen. Additional width will change just that? Add. At first, it may seem logical because it means that we see so many participants at the altitude as we would in a full screen. But does it make the players small and insignificant while all back-end programs dominate? and Big Trail has many backgrounds. When the widescreen formats re-emerged in the 1950s, many directors would make the same mistake before finally realizing that it is better to bring actresses around the chest, losing some of their height, but allowing them to fill the screen. It is a pity, because the Big Tra has a very well balanced and finely written effort. Romance and revenge subplots are simple but well defined and do not endanger the crossing of each other's or pioneer's story. It could have been a very intimate epic, but it loses its dramatic weight, because every time characters speak to each other, we have herds of flocks, drifting wagons, or anything else that fills every spare frame. At the same time, Walsh's sensitivity to deep emotional romantic moments is still visible, and he can make the final scene effective and memorable. There are also some nice comedies that are largely "comic Swede" in El Brendel. <br /> <br /> Big Trail is also remarkable for John Wayne's first leadership role. When Wayne is the second victim of the frame shots, we see at least his strong physical presence and hear his warm but confident vocal delivery. He misleads his lack of experience, but the potential is clearly there. Unfortunately, at that time, the potential was not widely realized and he spent the remainder of the decade sliding it in B images before he finally hit the start. This picture also includes Wayne's friend (and later a fruitful character) Ward Bond. He's not credited, but you can see him in many scenes, most prominently at the 80-minute mark where he stands to the left of Tyrone Power. to win yourself in drama. And that was the amazing scale that made the west (and the wide screen) sleep for a while. And while the 40s and 50s are now considered to be the golden age of the West, it has become a genre created by the adventures and heroism of the West? not better or worse, but different. Early talk time was the end of the era, where Westerners could be truly gigantic.
