This is my favorite movie and I think it's perfect. Unlike virtually all the other films I call, I never see this movie and I think it would have been better if they had changed it or that. Is this a definition of a work of art? I think so. Every Mishima brushing is perfect and everything flows from the Schrader script. I've always liked Paul Schrader's work (taxi driver and Light Sleeper can't challenge the amazing movie), but although his writing seems often restrictive, his leadership style is usually non-existent. I think it is deliberate because his films usually deal with redemption and are set in the real world; ugly and harsh. His style fits his themes when he presents his characters in a simple and realistic way and lets them show the truth to the audience. Imagine if Schrader had turned a taxi driver or brought him dead instead of Scorsese. But as the protagonists of these two films, while the man of Mishima was the ideal material of Schrader, the right, in vain and against society, his works were fine and beautiful. In fact, she was under the second written career of a woman's writer, deleting what she could reasonably be called romantic boilers. So you might not imagine that Schrader was the ideal person to capture the fineness and beauty of this movie. I think the movie shows he was. The script he helped to create mishima divides the man into three parts; his life, his death and his mind. Her life is represented in black and white, with a camera, with formal compositions. His death, for which he is always best remembered, is the documentary style of a handheld computer. And his mind is represented by the dramatic excerpts of his novels, each of which reveals the processes of the thoughtful man who hardly ever wrote a sign that was not a reflection of himself. These dramatizations are beautiful, looking at Eiko Ishioka's remarkable product development and Schrader's imagination. In all parts, the actor is great, especially Ken Ogata as Mishima, who strikes a person's great charm, arrogance and narcissism. Photography is great and contains pictures that the viewer will keep forever. Finally, music is just great, perfect for pictures, even though it is written and recorded before shooting, corrected during editing, and then re-recorded. How much music was influenced by the fiery, which I do not know, but it is perfectly related to the picture. I've seen a lot of ideas about what different people think the theme of the movie is, what Schrader is trying to say. You know, big things about life, death, etc. But I don't think the movie says anything. Mishima has already said this, the movie is simply repeating.
