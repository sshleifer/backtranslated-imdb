This is a film about a man who all thinks he is a Jew. This is a film about Lawrence Newman, living in Brooklyn in the 1940s, during World War II. One day, when he gets into glasses, people start thinking that he is a Jew. And it only because he looks like one. And he lives in a very anti-Semitic neighborhood. So some people start treating him like dirt. They make that decision, being a Jew, also Larry's fresh wife Gertrude Hart. The focus of Neal Slavin (2001) is a relatively good look at anti-Semitism. This is a problem that will not disappear. The film is based on Athur Miller's novel, which I admit I have not read. The movie is really good, so I'm sure the book would be too. Actors do a good job.William H.Macy is always good and her work as Larry Newman is brilliant.Laura Dern is Gert Hart and she is great. almost frightening as a neighbor who wants to prevent the Jews from being held by any necessary means. Finkelstein is the most sympathetic in the film. Paymer is the perfect choice for the role. One of the biggest scenes is finally, when Mr. Finkelstein and Newman fight with those Nazi people who are baseball bats. Christian and Jew.
