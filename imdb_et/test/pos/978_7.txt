This movie was fun! Especially if your 8 to 15-year-old Frankie Muniz and Amanda Bynes make an incredible eighth grade student who returns to an adult who really deserves it. Paul Giamatti makes a big adult whom you really want to get. My 13-year-old daughter and her friend loved it. Parents: There's really no bad words or sex that worries. Suggest it for the "right" crowd. AP
