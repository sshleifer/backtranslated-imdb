Dogtown and Z-Boys <br /> <br /> Summary: Dogtown and Z-boys is a documentary about a revolutionary teenage group that has changed the world of surfing and skating houses in Venice (Dogtown) today. With their low style, they began a journey that affected Larry Bertlemen, leading to countless progress and a couple of failures. After the Dogtown articles were played back at Skateboarder Magazine, the sport was updated and the members of the Zephyr Skateboard train crew forgot about Jeff Ho and looked at the rest of the summer vacation, joining other skateboard teams who could afford to pay them like a movie star. The original Zephyr Skateboard Team, to which Jeff Ho (owner of Zephyr Surfshop) and Craig Stecyk (photographer) put together, was Jay Adams, Tony Alva, Stacy Peralta, Bob Biniak, Chris Cahill, Shogo Kubo, Paul Constantineau, Jim Muir, Peggy Oki (female only), Nathan Pratt, Wentzle Ruml IV, Allen Sarlo and David Ray Perry. All the original members, except Jay Adams and Chris Cahill, are still good and surfing / skating. During documentary films, Jay Adams had time for drug-related charges. Chris Cahill, during the documentary, was last seen in Mexico. <br /> <br /> Topics: The themes of this documentary are a kind of read-the-lines, but if there is a clear issue, even children can make turns. Other topics could include an extensive celebration in the past that can lead to an unfulfilled future, and being careful with planning and own assets can be a very profitable future. <br /> <br /> Other Jobs: Stacy Peralta (The Writer and Director have a rather broad documentary that he has written, produced or directed. Most of them are a common theme for surfing or skating, such as riding giants, Sk8 TV, Bones Brigrades and Lord of Dogtown He has also made films whose theme has grown as a teenager in America, such as: Effects: Yesterday to Today, Crips and Bloods: Made in America, and 70s: Decade that Changed Television. boys' themes are the original members of the Zephyr skateboard team, except for Chris Cahill, interviewed by Peralta Jeff Ho and Craig Stecyk, others were people who grew up in the 1970s, reading Dogtown articles and skateboarding enthusiasts. but not with the team. <br /> <br /> Editing: Editing this movie was, in my opinion, phenomenal, so that the viewers saw who spoke and knew its character, but would be delayed who has finished the archive material that explains what the speaker has said. If the song could explain the emotions of the subjects, for example, when Jay Adams's unfortunate life was spoken, then Neil Young's Old Man song was played, which creates many emotions. Sean Penn was a narrator of the film and explained the transitions of the film. The film was presented chronologically from the time Zephyr surfed the team to create a skateboard team for all the Z-boys who left the team to join other skate companies or create their own company. <br /> <br /> Film: The film was filmed in an interesting way. The film of the talking subjects was all black and white, and all the archive materials of Z-Boys surfing or skating were colored. Of course, the 70's film material was grainy, but it only improved the film. The interviewees were mostly photographed in the same area that appeared but all were out. All the footage was very well controlled with archive material, which I found very surprising. <br /> <br /> Music: "Food Seasons" - Aerosmith's "Toys in the Attic" - Aerosmith's "Generation Landslide" - Alice Cooper "One Way Out" - directed by Allman Brothers "Lollipops and Roses" and "Foam Cream" Herb Alpert "Into the Void" and "Paranoid" - by Black Sabbath "Godzilla" - Blue Oyster Cult "Aladdin Sane" and "Rebel Rebel" - David Bowie "Fastcars" - The Buzzcocks "Gut Feeling" - Devo Money "- Peter Frampton" Funk 49 "- James Gang" Ezy Rider "and" Foxy Lady "and" Freedom "and" Bold as Love "- Jimi Hendrix" Walking the Pavement "- Jan and Dean" Achilles Last Stand " "Hot on for Nowhere" - Led Zeppelin "Six Underground" - Sneaker Pimps "Surfrider" - lively "Cat Scratch Fever" and "Motor City Madhouse" and "Wang Dang" Sweet Poontang- Ted Nugent "Us and Them" - Pink Floyd "Bad Boys" - Anti-Maggie May - Rod Stewart "I want to be your dog" and "Gimme Danger" - Stooges "Children of Revolution" - T-Rex "Bad Reputa" "Thin Lizzy" Dis co Inferno - "Hannah" trams - Rob Trower "Rocky Mountain Way" - Joe Walsh "Old Man" - Neil Young "La Grange" - ZZ Top <br /> <br /> Music in the film makes a movie. Each of these songs contributes to the formulation of the themes and creates emotions that would not otherwise be remembered.
