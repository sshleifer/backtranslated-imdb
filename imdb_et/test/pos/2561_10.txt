I decided to watch this movie for one reason and only one reason ... Samuel L. Jackson. I happen to him a lot. I didn't see previews or trailers for this preview movie, so they went without real expectations. <br /> <br /> Jackson was not disappointed with Lazarus, who is a happy blues man in the deep South and gave perhaps his most powerful performance ever, including playing and singing several great blues stories. But the real surprise here was Christina Ricci, at best a life-long steamy head, who took the role of sexually abused city tramp Rae and made her an incredible, almost even pleasant character. Looking at the decisive non-sexual relationship between Lazarus and Rae was just amazing. <br /> <br /> Justin Timberlake, the pop star, wanted to go back, to create "wardrobe malfunctions" and turn around the pop stage. His main forced force at best disturbed the real story here. <br /> <br /> This movie is raw, sharp and sometimes quite "your face". Not everyone likes it. Those who do, however, move quickly to the top of their favorites list.
