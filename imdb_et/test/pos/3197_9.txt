Awww, I love it! The story of cats and the moon does not really need to be summarized because it is what ... is behind a cat, a Spanish poem. It's artistic, which is interesting. In fact, it was an animated short called Fan and a flower that was the winner of the Academy Award last year ... yes, almost the same thing that makes me believe it might just be dirty. > <br /> But this is really a good short with black and white shapes that move and become a beautiful move and poetic seduction ... If you think the cats are in the poem, look at it and you believe it more. <br /> <br /> It also has a moving tip. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
