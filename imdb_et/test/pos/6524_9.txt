Fans of apocalyptic films enjoy this well-made low-budget thriller, which is basically a remake of the 1951 George Pal class "When the worlds come together". The comet is headed for almost clashes with the ground, and when his scientists ignore his warnings of punishment, the eccentric scientist Peter Crawford (Dennis Hopper) collects a group of private investors to secretly build an underground sanctuary. /> The story opens out in the eyes of a muscle-binding Persian Gulf war veteran Jake Lowe (Peter Onorat) who discovers Crawford's hidden shelter and then decides that Crawford has wrongly kept his project hidden for the rest of humanity. When the comet approaches, the one who should live and who should die should make an interesting drama. <br /> <br /> Although special effects are not in the same league, I enjoyed this story more than I did in the Spielberg war worlds because I feel this scenario is better. Stopping scientific reality is necessary, but developing a good story is beneficial. I highly recommend this movie to fans of the genre.
