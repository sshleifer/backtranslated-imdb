With all due respect to Joel Fabian and Rosemary Nicolas and their characters, Department S is bound forever with Peter Wyngarde's Jason King. Gray from Austin Powers, but it serves a character: He is much more nuanced than that. <br /> <br /> Jason King is lazy (he always lets Stewart fight against all the bad guys and only at the end of the passages), he is egoistic (his evaluation of people based on reading his novels or not), much of his detective work is speculation without facts to bring them back and it always closes when Annabelle is right ... and she's often. He's probably a man who has a lifetime crisis and drink, but ....... Jason King is great. Had Wyngarde played him purely as a hero, he wouldn't have worked, but he often shows the king as a paper giant led by his libido, love of love and a tendency to supremacy (and it goes to his detective work at times), but he has some of the best features and makes TV in history. And if you do not play white as white, the three chemistry and interactions of the three guides are better. <br /> <br /> Looking at it recently on DVD, you'll see how much depth Wyngarde put on Jason King.
