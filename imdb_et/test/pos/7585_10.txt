The horses on Mars are a wonderful trip that is taken by very small creatures. It doesn't have to be an effort to keep your attention and the characters are truly memorable. Most credits have to go to Eric Anderson to choose a visual style and write an interesting story, but Anuj Majumdar has also earned a credit for his story and wonderful music score. These choices were probably not an accident. If possible, look at the 35 mm maximum effect. This is a pretty beautiful movie!
