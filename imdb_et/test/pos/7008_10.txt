While most movies that carry people against terrible extreme terrestrial lands are cheap imitations of the "alien" series, Pitch Black is a fine piece of Sci-Fi and a great movie. Maybe it's the lighting of my favorite film. This film uses beautifully many different colors, shades and intensities that determine the mood and give a unique feeling to the film itself, something other than the usual film lighting we talk about generally. Vin Diesel brings his character to life perfectly, avoiding the skillful routine depiction of a hardened criminal. After all, the film is about a personal trip to Riddick (the nature of diesel), so luckily Vin won't let the ball down. The rest of the majority (except for the talented and proud Claudia Black) were unknown to me, but all turned to a wonderful performance, giving versatile characters with unique princes and motifs. Pitch Black is a great example of making an excellent movie from excessive budget funds. Special effects are more than sufficient, but at the same time they are not the only ones, as in many high budget projects. It's a great movie because it uses Science Fiction as a tool that speaks of an interesting, provocative story, not the middle story to use science fiction.
