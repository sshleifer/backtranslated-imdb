I went to the Sundance Film Festival "SISTER HELEN" for screening and didn't know what to expect. <br /> <br /> People in this documentary were riveted. Sister Helen is an incredible character !!! The filmmakers hit the sister of Helen's amazing soul and took me to an unknown world. I was completely satisfied with the trip and at the end of the film it was completely watchful. <br /> <br /> This movie tells those who want a second chance in life.
