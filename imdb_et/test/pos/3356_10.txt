If I was busy, my groom and I would often be adult bookstores. He searched for his favorite masters and sometimes a video that hit the eye. As much as I enjoyed him alone, what the media caused, there was never a video that I really enjoyed. I had only seen one other movie back when there was a satellite channel XXX (which was about a private eye that brought up the case), which actually had the right plot and was enjoyable. Everyone else was looting and swelling and blowing and doing something. There are only so many times when you can look at the bimbo fake blonde. <br /> <br /> This movie hit my eye and I moved on to allow him to shop. He noticed (how hard wasn't it? Grins. I was really interested in the video part lol (!)!) And came over by buying a slightly used copy for me. We took it home and I loved it. Here was "Porno" with the plot. I wasn't sure it would even be classified as porn, but I use that word loosely. <br /> <br /> The librarian was a sign I could identify. Alice rejected her boyhood. He was not happy with his sexuality and pride in his comments. Bill went away and continued to check the books. The white rabbit ran through the library (one book, if you notice it carefully, I believe (it has been ten years since I saw the movie) was Lewis C.) and Alice, for the same reason that pushes teenagers into the woods, followed by a manic-chain chainsaw, not in populated areas. This is the best way to advance the plot. Alice finds herself in wonderland. <br /> <br /> I barely remember all the details, but I clearly remember swimming in the lake and how he was "dried". I liked how they got Humpty Dumpty Up again, the size of Mad Hatter's member who was on his hat to proudly wear it, and the Dum and Dee brother's sister team (which bothered me a bit - then again, they might have been wife), but I can never say how many times I watched it). The knight who talked to Alice would go away and find her knight (which is a nice girl like you on this knight?). <br /> <br /> The part that really attracted attention when I looked at it was about a year or later later on one of the cards (3 hearts, I think) that reminded me of my ex-wife! We couldn't tempt him while in the movie! The king of the heart was interesting and the queen was even more. Because of the openness of the forum, I can't go into details, just say it was an "orgy" and we'll leave it there! <br /> <br /> When we shared, I was allowed to take a video - he knew I liked it - but at a time when it was lost on lending. One day I find another copy. <br /> <br /> Btw, if anyone could tell me what scene was cut from the Amazon version, I really appreciate it. <br /> <br /> I heartily recommend this movie to more than 18 crowds. It was soft, sweet and really 70's, but I liked it enormously. <br /> <br /> ***** 5th. D.
