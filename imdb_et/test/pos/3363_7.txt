Generally, the father's army film is very funny, though humor is not as catchy and glittering as on television and radio. So if it leaves us, viewers? If you have never seen a father's army, the film is a good way to bring you to the hurry and grab the wacky world of Walmington o / S. The downside is that you may not "get it" because, as I said, the film's humor is a bit hard. <br /> <br /> For Father Dad's army, there's nothing new about the movie as the story is more or less cutting down on television series, but it's a unique way to see your favorites on the "high def" level compared to the brilliant quality of BBC video. <br /> <br /> The film also has something to be flattened in the history of the universe. I can't make my thoughts if it's positive or negative.
