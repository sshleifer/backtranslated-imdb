So the first things first .. <br /> <br /> Angels and demons are a much better and very different film than the D-Vinci code. <br /> <br /> Recently killed by comic book movies and the resurrection of outdated franchises. it is refreshing to watch a very solid and fun movie that does not contain trembling camcorder filming, lens burning, excessive GCI and top action sequences. <br /> <br /> Angels and demons in this respect are almost old-fashioned This provides a good and thoughtful discussion on the age-old religion Vs, provides an overview of the parallels between the great Roman houses (the beautiful blow) and the temple of modern science, which is the great Hadron of CERN. collider facility. <br /> <br /> Hanks is Hanks, who claims to be a smart guy, and he fits the second time better than his wooden performance at Da-Vinci. rock boulders are a good support, highlighting first and foremost the Stinic Cardinal of Armin Mueller-Stahl. but the main sustainable grace of movies is this pace. Throughout the current time, I was completely gone and the film never gave me time to sit down and logically separate my mistakes. <br /> <br /> My only serious criticism is that some of the science shown is at best controversial in terms of the authenticity of the real world. But this is not the fault of the filmmaker, but the observation of old messages that you should never let the truth get good. <br /> <br /> Talking about the story of a cracking, adventure, and time competition with good intelligence and pure twists. <br /> <br /> In general, I would recommend it to fans of the treasure films of each country (which clearly mimics it, but with much more serious vibration) and fans of adventure musicians in general.
