Of the Korean films I've seen, only three were really stuck with me. The first one is the great horror of A Tale of Two Sisters. The second and third - and also the fourth - have all been Park Chan Wook's films, namely Oldboy, a sympathy for Lady Vengeance, and now thirsty. <br /> <br /> Park kinda reminds me of Quentin Tarantino when he has failed the convention. All of his films are shocking, but not for free. It's more like he shows us what we don't see - usually situations that are radically against the morals of society, such as incest or libidinous, sucking blood, but a dedicated priest. He is also incredibly artistically inclined to cinematography and his films are one of the most beautiful I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Thirst is all - being a priest and repressed, a conscience woman falls - and much more. It is horror, drama and even comedy because Park destroys its audience with many inappropriate but humorous situations. As such, it might be the best job for me, because the other two movies I've seen were missing a sense of humor that would have changed them repeatedly.
