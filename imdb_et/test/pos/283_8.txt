In the 60s / 70s, David Jason was known for his many supporting roles in television, such as "Don't Change Your Set!", "Hark At Barker" and "Doctor". It was in 1974 when he landed his first leading role in London at Weekend Television, "The Edgar Briggs Ultimate Secret Life," written by Richard Laing & Bernard McKenna. <br /> <br /> Edgar Briggs is the secret agent of "SIS" ("Secret Intelligence Service"). He really tries to do his job well, but it always seems to be confusing. Surprisingly, however, he always manages to get to the bottom of the cases, to the amazement of his colleagues - "Buxton" (Michael Stainton), "Spencer" (Mark Eden) and "Cathy" (lovely Elisabeth Counsell), all that answered "Commander" (Noel Coleman ). <br /> <br /> Briggs is married to "Jennifer" (Barbara Angell), a woman who, like Michele Dotrice's "Betty", from some mothers '"Ave' Em!" It is the patience of the sanctuary and stands with the spouse of his rabbit (but with good meaning), no matter what it is. <br /> <br /> Like "Some mother do" Ave 'Em' and "The Baldy Man", "TLOF" was completely stuck. Each episode saw Jason perform such tricks as falling down on a high window sill or falling from the top of a ladder. It was the "pudding nut" that really was. <br /> <br /> Edgar Briggs wasn't a big hit because it was badly planned for I.T.V. Shame because it was an amusing and enjoyable exhibition that was well served by its star and fine support. But the leading person did not experience the show. David Jason cited the repetitions of the exhibition because he felt that his actions were not refined. David Jason, who played "Del Boy", "Inspector Frost" and "Pop Larkin", is different from what Briggs played, but under no circumstances was his action unrefined. Most of the participants would have made Briggs a ridiculous caricature, but Jason's presentation made Briggs a credible and realistic line. Strangely, maybe, but not unimaginable. <br /> <br /> Jason's next vehicle was "Lucky Feller", where he played Mummy Boy Shorty Mempstead. Nor could it make ratings. His happy break came in the form of A.T.V 'A Sharp Inteath Of Breath, in which he played between 1977 and 1981 in a series of four series of catastrophe disasters "Peter Barnes". So, while it's not outstanding, Briggs is a simple and worthwhile watch. Nice "James Bond" style theme setup!
