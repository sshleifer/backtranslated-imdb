I went to the screening of this film's mindset so that I started 120 minutes of funny lines, a frantic plot, and a nausea action that put Postimees on one of our malicious screens since then. But I was shocked. Disappointed to find a movie starring Costner, who complained to the audience. It was shocked that Ashton Kutcher could act in such a serious role. I forgot that the film that starred in both reality and conquering your emotions. Not after Robin Hood has seen Costner: full of depth and complex emotions. Kutcher seems to have played a serious behavior in "Butterfly Effect". These two actors came to this movie with a serious, focused attitude that seemed through what I thought was one of the best films I saw this year. No, it's not an Oscar-worth movie. It's not an epic or deep social commentary. Rather, it is a story about a simple subject that is illuminated in a way that brings this audience to a higher level of empathy than possible. That's what I think good movies are and I'm impressive because of this work. Bravo!
