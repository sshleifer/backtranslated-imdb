In Moscow, the young couple Veronika (T. Samojlova) and Boris (Alexey Batalov) are very fond of each other. After World War II, volunteers in Boris volunteered to be sent to the front of Veronika's birthday and have no chance to say goodbye to each other. Waiting for news from Boris, Veronika has raped Mark's cousin Mark (A. Shvorin) and they marry each other. However, Veronika Boris will not forget and is waiting for her. <br /> <br /> "Letyat zhuravli" is an impressive and heartbreaking romance during the war. The direction is great and uses the story along the ellipses, including in the capital, when Veronika rapes by Mark. The camera's work is amazing, with sophisticated planes and corners, and long travel. Veronika's scenes in the middle of tanks or with many figurants at the train station are fantastic. Amazing cinematography has been highlighted with a DVD restored image. T. Samoylova has a very beautiful face and touching and sensitive performance. The last scene call is another great example of an anti-war movie. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Quando Voam as Cegonhas" ("When You Fly a Stork")
