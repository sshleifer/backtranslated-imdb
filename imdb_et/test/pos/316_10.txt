At the time of the completion of the Vitnam War, the CIA will send Captain Willard (Martin Sheen), a civilian population, to an illegal consensus mission to murder the US Armed Forces Commander, Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), allegedly "completely crazy" but successfully promoting his cross-border war in Cambodia. thus an unlimited country. <br /> <br /> The entire story telling what Willard sees and does as he has set up a non-disciplined and terrorized naval patrol boat on the Da Nang River to kill Kurtz is a great metaphor for the excesses, decadence and ultimately weakness of their Anglo-Saxon psyche: if we don't understand anything and we can't control it, destroy it. Kurtz had finally known it. <br /> <br /> If you don't pay full attention to every emotional gesture, then every word in the dialogue between the main characters, especially the scene where two of them are alone in Kurtz. Lair, you forget the central theme of one of this incredible movie. Kurtz's subtle deal with his executive, his one-sided "handover" in return for Willard (did he cry?) To tell Kurtz's "son" (another metaphor for us, the next generation, those who watch the movie) the truth of all the horrors they both saw In Vietnam, your mind is expanding things. Linking two men while Kurtz is investigating Willard - is embedded with some of his horror stories, is incredible, no, genius, film. The closure of the ritual slaughter of the Victim Ball is one of the most powerful symbols. Coppolla has deliberately or not made a final anti-war statement that should resonate over the ages.
