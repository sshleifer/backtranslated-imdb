I saw it in the German press. Without going too far: Most critics seemed very pleasant. After that, there was even applause, which is quite unusual for this species. From my point of view, and so far, it was a more fun film of the year. This prevents the three W + G shorts from being worn and has been expanded with many references to these and other films. Of course, there are obvious clues to monster and werewolf movies, especially the "American werewolf in London", "jaws", "King Kong" and even Peter Jackson's "Braindead" / "Dead Alive", as well as other genres. <br /> <br /> It was better to characterize in "Chicken Run", but this movie had a new "cast" where the introduction was needed. Here you already have two main characters. So, the new "Wallace and Gromit" movie is the best when you look (and liked) the shorts already, but it also works. "Chicken Run" was more convenient, but also more "storytelling" plot. Instead, this new Aardman masterpiece keeps this insane and somewhat more isolated W + G shorts. Children should also enjoy it, especially because of the sweet rabbit (if you like cute bunnies, it is visible to you !!!) and because Gromit has many examples (and loves children too) dogs ... :-)). But many jokes are for more adult audiences (there are even soft sexual hints). The film manages like "Shrek 1 + 2" and "The Incredibles" to fill the whole family with a high level of entertainment by adding a British and at least a slightly darker edge to American animated humor. <Br /> <br /> Animation is ?? as expected ?? great and they respected the Aardman style because they didn't put too many digital effects - I only realized a couple when it came to Wallace's inventions. <br /> <br /> Finally, the score works well for the movie, although one of the main topics is definitely "borrowed" by Randy Edelman's "Dragonheart." <br /> <br /> The bad thing is: it will probably take another six years to see a new animated pearl of Nick Park & ​​Co.
