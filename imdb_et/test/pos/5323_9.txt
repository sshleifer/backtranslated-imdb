It's a movie that really thinks about your life, our culture, our family structures, and our contingency measures. I don't give the plot in this position, I think others have beaten me. I hope that, despite reading the opinions on this site, you take this opportunity and see this movie yourself. I went to watch this movie with my husband and friend and I have to say that after the movie ended, the theater was silent. After a few minutes I looked behind me and all the people in the theater looked at the screen, I thought I was lost. It makes you deeper into your psychological abyss to think about several things: <br /> <br /> How much does society affect the life of my life and generation? <br /> <br /> How long has anyone paid for the mistakes they have made? <br /> <br /> If there is another way, is it ever realized? <br /> <br /> Is it better to live in a box or not to live at all? <br /> <br /> My questions are not meant to show approval or rejection of Leland's business. I don't want my opinion to dictate to them in any way what you take from this movie, so I'm not giving it. See it for yourself. I'm still losing thought, trying to answer many movie questions. I enjoyed it very much and hope you too. This film does not attempt to answer questions, accept any action, or encourage any punishment. This film tries to make us all appreciate our lives and raise the rose-colored glasses that most of us see in the world. <br /> <br /> Great movie. 9 stars out of 10
