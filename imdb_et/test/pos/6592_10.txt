It is a prominent criminal tracker and also with great pain. The best and most popular actors in Spanish cinema in the last couple of decades, Victoria Abril and Federico Luppi, compete for one of the best Spanish criminals in 2004-5. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a thirty-point focus on Ernesto (Ernesto Alterio), an elegant, attractive and sliding thief who learned from childhood friend Gitanos and recently Manco, an old experienced swindler. Manco introduces Ernesto Federico (Federico Luppi), which is also an elegant but subtle and experienced methodical thief - the best in its class. <br /> <br /> Federico's only known weakness is Pilar (Victoria Abril), his former lover and partner. She suddenly appears and offers her ex-lover, a large-scale crime, a fabulous hangover that requires, among other things, the help of Ernesto, Manco and Gitano. <br /> <br /> The script is full of twists and surprises, especially at the end of the movie. One criticism of the film I've heard a lot is that there are too many pieces at the end, but I do not agree. The film throws the audience so much that all unexpected events are not too much to follow. In fact, they make the film outstanding. I highly recommend it.
