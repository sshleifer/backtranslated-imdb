I really do not know which words IMDB allows me to use for this review because I have these short short descriptions. Let's just say there's a good homosexual sex, some necrophilia, some incest, a fair amount of masturbation, and several artificial .... members. And I loved it every minute. <br /> <br /> Not that it is high in raw humor. This is not. They are mostly away from incandescent peaks, except for one scheme called "Pizza", which they use very well. "They" are 3 / 11th of the short schematics of the comedy that spoke to MTV, a country called David Wain, Michael Showalter, and Michael Ian Black. playing yourself and the strange and unusual people, people who are often actually more common than they are. Also supportive cast is fantastic. Paul Rudd, Julie Bowen, Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis and Sam Rockwell present different sketches. They are also united by other state bases such as Joe Lo Truglio and Todd Holoubek. Musical choices are also very well placed. <br /> <br /> I have enjoyed these sketches over and over, but they are not for everyone because they are mostly vulgar. If you like smart humor who is not afraid of good taste limits, I highly recommend it. If you liked Wet Hot American Summer (directed and written by Wain and Showalter) or country, you should really enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I think it can only be ordered online. See your website and create a couple of schemes to get the idea if you really want it, and then learn how to buy a DVD.
