This film is about Violat (Amanda Bynes) and her attempt to defeat her school's Cornwell boys team after they threw the girls into the team. So she goes to the rival school in Illaria and joins the boys' team so she falls against Duke (Channing Tatum) who thinks she is a man and likes Olivia (Laura Ramsey) who likes her brother. <br /> <br /> I was in the 12th night game and the start was very modern. So I knew the game well. I was very excited about seeing this movie and when I saw it, it exceeded my expectations. It kept a lot of my favorite lines and I saw great connections with the game. Although it was like a game, it wasn't that complicated. It was also a more chick flick than I expected, but it was good. It was very funny. It draws you into a whole host of mad love stories and lies. You saw how Viola (Amanda Bynes) was thinking about what the boys were thinking and the complications she had in the world of boys. You can also see his space companion, Duke (Channing Tatum), impression of it. I liked the characters being portrayed in a modern way. It also talks about the modern theme "Keep track of your dreams", but this time it's difficult. I think this movie was a great movie about a girl who loved football and stayed with herself and her family and her dreams. I think this movie is a big break for many uplifting stars.
