Hardly three and a half years after running one month (7-31 October 1953) at Broadway's Coronet Theater (49th West, after renaming O'Neill), MGM relied on an astonishingly cast and - mostly - carefully opened success in London's past success. "The production that has been sadly trimmed from this extremely subversive boulevard comedy scenario and rewarded with a modest blow. <br /> <br /> Ava Gardner is an increasingly frustrated woman from Stewart Granger, an internationally successful and completely self-satisfied "job-seeker" (before this concept was created), using constantly disappointed David Niven to catch her husband again to restore. When the "second honeymoon" cruises to Gardner with Granger, the trio (and the Granger dog) leaves the southern island (whether there were other survivors there, a big hut and his wife, and a little Niven's title - or unleashed male. <br /> <br /> The core of the real playground can only be about half way through the movie, when Niven proposes that Granger and he alternate with a small house tenant - sharing the only woman on the island because Granger is ready to share the only pair of shoes (her). <br /> <br /> The reason (which Granger considers a strong place for him) prevails and the frustration prevails - for some time. <br /> <br /> David Niven and Ava Gardner are excellent in their determined role of surprising and seductress, and Stuart Granger - usually is invited to just be beautiful and virile in the role of activities, and a strange inaccurate specialist Lty (Apollodorus Shaw's CAESAR and CLEOPATRA 1945) - gives one of his film career as a better actor who is a husband who can ib actually be as smart as he thinks. 33 years later, he once again showed that at Gramer's first (and BOTH's last) Broadway-related event, Rex is opposed to Harrison's Somerset Maugham THE CIRCLE, which ended only with Harrison's death. We would be much richer if Granger had used these skills more often. <br /> <br /> It is promising as it is also British Boulevard comedy and Hollywood in the 1950s. that (as opposed to source play) is actually very little sex. To be honest, if you don't give up on the ideas that drive contractions, it will become a bit stupid (the same original form has developed much more satisfactorily three years later Cary Grant / Deborah Kerr / Robert Mitchum / Jean Simmons (Stewart Granger's actual husband) GRASS is GREENER, based on an even less successful game, but for some reason, an excessive gap in the ticket office failed). <br /> <br /> As much as the MGM set, it was unfortunate - the stupidity that ends up being on the island is sketchy in what should have been a moment of real excitement - a shattering yacht. Ultimately, we only get about three-quarters of the real Little Hut, but ninety minutes of David Niven, Ava Gardner and Stewart Granger, making the movie a fun deviation. Not high culture, but worthy worthy of pleasure. <br /> <br /> We even get Walter Chiar in a very beautiful decoration (mentioned as Ava's true lover). One of his best speeches is: "Boolean, Boolean!"
