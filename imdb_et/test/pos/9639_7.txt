The World War II ships and planes complement this wonderful war movie on the Adriatic. Walter Huston is great as a leader who knows his place and his place doesn't have room for personal feelings. Ship and mission safety must always be the first. Robert Montgomery is a Lieutenant who has not yet learned the role the leader has to play in the fight. He makes bad decisions, threatening the submarine and its crew, but in the end he becomes a "real man" after being a military and fired by the Navy. Robert Young plays Lieutenant Junior Class and Jimmy Durante as a chef. The parallel of the war drama is equally important between the war-love triangle Montgomery and Madge Evans, who plays Huston's daughter and a tragically injured aviator woman. Recommended.
