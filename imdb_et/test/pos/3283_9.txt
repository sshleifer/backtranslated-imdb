Well, let's have this episode fun from Al Gore. I'm sure it will show off some liberals. This thing is in South Park, which makes everyone enjoyable, like the Simpsons. If you get offended that a politician you like is kidding then you may need a better sense of humor and take the show too seriously. It is said that this episode is fun and one of the best. Imagining Al Gores is fun, Cartman's scheme goes terribly wrong and the results roll to the floor. This is basically everything you would ever want from a southern park episode and it's just one of my favorites. I don't comment too much on the plot because I don't want to give up.
