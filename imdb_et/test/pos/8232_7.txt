After cleaning Dodge City (little help from Wyatt Earp), Bat Masterson goes to Liberal, Kansas, where they have a nice little warfare. Plus a pretty interesting scheme for sharpening. Randolph Scott is Bat Masterson and, after eating, Billy House and Steve Brodie, who run their farms in their home country. The websites they are traveling to are funded by Robert Ryan. It looks like he puts the different farmers on the plot to withstand the percentage of his harvest profit. Ryan loses his shirt as a result of all shenanigans. <br /> <br /> As Scott depicts, Bat Masterson is a stand-up Western hero who has a passion to go east and become a reporter who we all know he did later in life. <br /> <br /> Anne Jeffreys and Madge Meredith take part in a romantic sub-group with Brodie and Ryan, who is a bit stupid and hurt. Anne Jeffreys sings nice though. <br /> <br /> Of course, Gabby Hayes always provides great comic relief. <br /> <br /> A great addition to Randolph Scott's Western Collection. It is also interesting because her later western films don't have her wearing a white hat. <br /> <br /> This review is dedicated to Kasey Hayes, a professional Bull Riders, a proud resident of Liberal, Kansas, a city with a great tradition of whether or not Bat Masterson marched there.
