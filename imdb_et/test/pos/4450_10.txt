I saw this movie five times and never get tired of it. It includes traces of the "giallo" genre, as well as lively Italian landscapes, where ignorance and superstition are more dead than any serum killer. This is a great location (sometimes reminiscent of Fellini, sometimes also of the brothers of David), a good characterization and some of the best actors of the genre (including the great Tomas Milian and East Lupino in an unforgettable role), it is not a non-garbage trash, but a masterpiece that should be discovered by the generation ( Recently, Paris Cinematheque received great recognition for the double recognition of Lucio Fulci)
