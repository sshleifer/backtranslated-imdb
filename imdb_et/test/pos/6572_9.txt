Anand is one of those low budget but well filmed movies. This is a "cup of coffee" entertainment that has no violence, blood, or "jump out of place" excitement that most telugu movies have. However, it has its own mass. Roopa is a young man who is terrifying and underground who is not afraid of any situation, even his offensive mother. She's even out of marriage because her groom won't stay for him. However, the air of his trust and independence is enough, that Anand, a rich gentleman living in the city, would like to be his new husband. His father accidentally kills his parents in a car accident, so why not pay him back? But Roopa is not one who falls for a charming smile and polite behavior, he puts him through a variety of situations, still being rude and painful. Only when he stands for him and saves his life, he understands that he loves him. But complications arise?
