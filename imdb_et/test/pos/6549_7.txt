I looked at Uzumaki last night and was immediately reminded of two early Peter Weir films in Australia, The Last Wave and Picnic At Hanging Rock. These were atmospheric-loaded films that were short of real horror. It seems to me that these films clearly affect Uzumaki. It has a number of quite everyday scenes that become even sharper to the deeper film. It also has more scenes from direct horror, and although I don't think the film actually measures these two movies, it's worth the time of the most thoughtful fans of the unusual (not necessarily horror). Of the 10 out of ten, it seems fair, but I have to say that one year after the last wave of vision, the film still remains with me and the unresolved end of Picnic At Hanging Rock, which makes it so haunting. ps.s. All the people who criticize action ... in this genre?
