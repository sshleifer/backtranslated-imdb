Family happiness is crumbling when the rich father's church (Michael Ontkean) becomes poor from the start and can no longer support the family. Then, mother Faye (Jaclyn Smith) has to take the role of a family nurse and start working to support the family and, at the same time, periodically manage her family life. Not always as good, but as good as he can. Family life is hardly easier when Dad learns that son Lionel (Joe Flanigan "Stargate Atlantis") is gay and lives with his lover John (Joel Gretsch "The 4400") is also a friend of the old family that makes Dad clear to Lionel that he is no longer welcome in the family. Lionel is the one who meant her to her sister Anne (Leslie Horan) the most during her resurrection because the family ignored her. Anne cannot keep up with the fact that their father has been cutting laces with Lionel, so she runs away from home. Because it wasn't enough, Greg (Chian's "Charmed") grows up for the Navy and is sent to war. The story of this movie may in some cases look a bit thin, despite the fact that it still has a lot of realism, so it's worth it. Since this film illustrates many sensitive relationships and situations, I believe it can be best appreciated by a mature audience, although it would not hurt teenagers to think about anything before adulthood.
