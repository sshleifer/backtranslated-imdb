We have moved beyond this initial absenteeism to the prohibited regional drug use in the 1950s. As such, it may seem that the film is dated. A man with a golden shoulder earned his function to peel off the lower layer of society, which was in 1955 when he opened the southern boy's eye when I first watched it in the movie theater. After some serious considerations about being too young, I was allowed to go. It was powerful and influenced and still retains some sharp, painful moments that the soul is naked. A film that depicts loneliness at the heart of being, succeeds. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra, in his best role, performs a vulnerability that makes him compassionate about the viewer. She delivers her helplessness and inefficiency in beautifully restrained performance. Like common sense in the voice of a dead-end city jungle, Kim Novak as Molly is pretty good. He is compassionate and stands on a firm surface. The communication between Sinatra and Novak is really good. Darren McGavin plays a narrow character and does it very well. Eleanor Parker is an excellently irritating and painfully insecure Zoschi in Sinatra's exhausted woman. Arnold Stang is the second unlikely survivor of the street. Probably pathetic and despicable, his character Sparrow offers sour comedy moments. <br /> <br /> Music is almost a movie-making, frenetic, desperate, frightening star. Elmer Bernstein's score excellently raises the tension between the mental weakness of Frankie Machine and the physical need of heroin. Molly's theme is bittersweet and phonetically fixes what the film represents visually. I don't know any other soundtrack that effectively replenishes tension and victory inside a person as effectively as it does.
