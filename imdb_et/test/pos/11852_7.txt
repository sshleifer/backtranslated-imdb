[WARNING: Includes Spoilers] <br /> <br /> Written by husband and wife Wally Wolodarsky (who also led) and Maya Forbes, this indie film is one of the best romantic comedies in the last memory. <br /> <br /> Jay Mohr takes a break to play smarmy weasels to be a nice boy who faces the fact that his fiance wants to put other people in bed and is allowed to do it. Julianne Nicholson, who was so good at "Tully", plays a lot and is vulnerable. Too bad he doesn't get the recognition he deserves. <br /> <br /> Well-supported presentations also help tremendously. Lauren Graham, who made last year's "Bad Santa" memorable, plays perfect ninja cynical sister, Bryan Cranston ("Malcolm in the middle" of the television) gets some funny moments, and Andy Richter plays a brilliant man who falls to one mother - Helen Slater plausible, albeit in a familiar role with a mousy-wife. <br /> <br /> What surprised me most about "Seeing Other People" was how funny it is. Here are some real laughs. Ed's first attempt at meaningless sex gets some great features and there are souvenirs that bring out one of the most realistic responses of a man when the male fantasy changes. <br /> <br /> The film's premise is not unusual, but I liked it was Alice (Nicholson) who thought it, a lot Ed (Mohr). Given the genre, you know that no matter how good his intention is, Alice's plan is doomed. We see how the couple works through this strange situation. Alice and Ed have the idea turned on, but then the human element puts it away. <br /> <br /> I appreciated Forbes and Wolodar, who didn't make it cheap for sex. Yes, there is sex and nudity, but here are real emotions. "Other People" Alice and Ed interact do not want to be random sex objects; they also have feelings. In one case, there are too many feelings. <br /> <br /> There are too many jokes on some scenes, the Richter-Slater sub-block is not needed and Alice is doing something really atypical. But it is forgiving because Mohr and Nicholson create such enormous intimacy and honesty - see scenes where Ed rides through the Alice underwear drawer or his reaction to the end of the experiment - no matter how much we could enjoy this little game, this couple will succeed. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film got little, if any, of its release and limited distribution. Hollywood studios, whose romantic comedies are often uncomfortable, cheerful and surprised, will learn from this intelligent and funny movie.
