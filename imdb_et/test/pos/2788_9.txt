As a former Erasmus student, I enjoyed this movie very much. It was so realistic and funny. It really led to the spirit of Erasmus students. I hope that many other students will also follow this experience. But I don't know if this movie is interesting to watch for people without international experience. But at least one of my friends who never went to Erasmus enjoyed it very much. I'll give him 10 out of 10.
