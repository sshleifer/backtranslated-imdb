It's the top autoclip (his artwork / YER artwork!) All classic cars are not fantastic, I've been watching it again, and again I have worn two video cassettes. A lot more young car friends or old ones love this movie and watch it more than once! so rent or buy it (see only this) I want them to make more (car) movies like this V8 power that is not gasified to a little whipper !!!! <br /> <br /> (is 351 right?) (engine magic) (a bunch of wagons) <br /> <br /> (you have to learn to feel power)
