The debut by Jacques Audiard's director See how they fall under the name of Regarde les Hommes Tomber is our old friend, a film with two different stories that are gradually approaching and just showing the same story from just different sides. This is a shaggy dog ​​story, where Matthieu Kassovitz's simulator follows unhappy cards, Jean Louis Trintignant, who has a similar dedication that even extends to his kill when he is asked to pay back his gambling debt in kind. In the meantime, traveling somewhat differently from the Jean Yanne mountain range, the salesman becomes increasingly obsessed with finding a hit man who put his police buddy into a dead coma, his life, income and relationships gradually decreasing as he gets closer to his harvest. But even though it can provide the perfect setting for today's neo-knot, the film is often more surprisingly playful, more interesting in nature and with a slightly inclined sense of humor (served by randomly ironic subtitles and Alexandre Desplat's semi-controversial, semi-controversial score) as a traditional thriller set and plot mechanics. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, one of the worst regions of the film in the last few years 1 DVDs: Picture Quality Synkronized's album is so poor from time to time that you expect the audience to have pictures like a pirate plate.
