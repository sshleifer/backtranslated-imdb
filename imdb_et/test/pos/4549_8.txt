This movie is fun. The laughs never stop. Every scene is full of fun comedy. Chris Farley is a comic genius and Spade plays his character on the road. Farley was once one of the best hit comics, and in this movie (like all his films) we see how much time and energy he devoted to depicting his character, how he saw fit. "Tommy Boy" is a great example of comedy, it always makes me laugh, no matter how many times I've seen it before.
