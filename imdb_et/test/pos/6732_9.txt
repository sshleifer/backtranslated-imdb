This film is one that cannot be seen in its appearance. Indeed, at first glance it seems that the story simply focuses on more money. But ... let's see the other side ... What do you see? You see that money is just a metaphor for the vague feelings a person has: Should I do it right, or shouldn't I? And ... what is the "right thing"? Le's analyzes deeper ... -What does this mean for a small city border? - This means that sometimes we can go too close to the boundary we thought we could not ... - What does this mean in the dry soil shown in the picture? - It means dryness, which sometimes absorbs our offended hearts ... - What does the character phrase (KRISTEN) mean: "Now I belong to him"? - That means losing our free will because of our unpredictable actions. In my opinion, this story is written and the director tried to tell us. By the way ... do you remember what another sign (JACK BARNES) said, "Nothing is so easy ..."
