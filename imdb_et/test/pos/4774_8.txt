No doubt. It is animated short, which made Uncle Walt a successful card. When Walt's older brother Roy suggested that the next Mickey Mouse short should contain sound, Walt jumped as far as possible. Result: Steamboat Willie was a hit in 1928. After all, this was the first animated short theme with a synchronized sound track (mostly music and sound effects, as the dialogue was minimal). Not like a damp deck, but the short is far from perfect. Animation before 1935 was colorful and quite sensitive (but after the devices improved and improved art techniques, the rest was smooth sailing) and the sound was primitive (Disney wanted to use a well-known RCA sound system, or Western Electric's no-noise sound system, but both companies refused to refuse, calling Disney to use a photophone system that PA Powers tried at that time). Plot (here is the actual plot line?) Touches Mickey (as mentioned by Willie) is a steamer pilot that is terrorized by Black Pete (Captain Pete to you) and decides that the ship is clogged by using several animals on board as musical instruments (ASPCA, take notice). If you don't think too much about the technical flaws, Steamboat Willie may be eight minutes of fun (and one piece of history).
