Well, this is the best comedy movie I've ever seen. Salman khan and Aamir khan shook. I hope to see Andaz Apna Apna Part 2 as soon as I hear that they will also come back with Part 2. I have a prayer for those who haven't watched it yet. please buy dvd and see it u wont feel bored. I watch this movie 1 time a week. Everything else was good in this movie. Paresh Rawal, Shakti and others Music is also good, he also has nice songs. there is some idea that kills u laugh Salman khan played a very good role and also Aamir. <br /> <br /> So you have to look at the film's excellent work by actors and directors.
