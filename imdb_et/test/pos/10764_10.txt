I can't imagine why it's not yet published in the theater. It has a great ensemble with Sutherland, Lane and especially Chris Evans who do a great job. Wake up, studio shouts! <br /> <br /> The story is based on the author / scriptwriter experience that grows as a "poor child" in an extremely prosperous community, where the class is everything and makes a difference in every aspect of life, from clothing to justice. <br /> <br /> During the Q&A movie, the author was asked about his experience and especially what we don't know about the rich. He said they were not stupid, they were very wise (unlike how they depict themselves), they have plans and they are a threat! <br /> <br /> This movie is extremely timely.
