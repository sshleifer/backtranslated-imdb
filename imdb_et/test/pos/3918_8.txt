This is one of the best horror / arrest movies Hollywood has been doing for years or even decades. Although I think this movie was partly predictable, it has everything that a good movie in this genre should be CHILL, THRILLS, AND Yeah, a lot of GORE !! BETWEEN HOUSE SURE PRODUCTS !!! In some parts it was a bit far removed, the operation was not so big, but my capital rating HOUSE OF WAX is eight out of ten ...... if you enjoy the edge of your seats, it's just the right movie for you, I have to admit it was kind of clean seeing the whole city made of wax ...... I myself enjoy these museums, but after seeing this movie, I now look at these brand new ways!
