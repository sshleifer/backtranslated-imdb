One of my favorite movies. I like horses, I like happy endings and I like Walter Matthau. I miss her and I'm glad I have a great movie to remember why she was so wonderful. See it with your children (or your horse). <br /> <br /> The story of an old hard drive horse trainer with children and his happiness. If you have ever had or appreciated horse racing, you will appreciate the rich building of the towel. It may be a bit below "Seabiscuit" but not much. The story is the same, except for the fourth horse version. Well done, proper racing conditions and equipment and nice racing scenes. Don't take my word for it, take it and remember it.
