This is my fourth review of Charlie Chan's film in sequential chronological order on these consecutive days. This is also my first comment on what I have seen before, although it has been around 24 years since I didn't remember that much. It explores the Honolulu detective, an espionage ring that was originally watched by a former Scottish yard friend who has disappeared from Big Apple ... This is the best Chan record I have seen so far in memory that combines every clue however, there may be some holes in my closer examination, although I can't think of it now). And "No. 2 Son" Jimmy (Victor Sen Yung) is somewhat helpful when he first identifies a poison that causes some murders early, although of course he'll be a little later. Among the returning supporters of the latest Chan movie Charlie Chan at the Wax Museum are blonde Joan Valerie in June Preston and Stanley Blystone, who are brother John G.'s beads lost as Chan's Charlie Chan feature fingerprint expert. Nice intrigue, especially with the thrilling climax on the bomber plane. Oh, and watch some Stooge police line.
