Alice enters the world of admiration ... but not the miracle you remember as a boy. Mad Hatter, the white rabbit, the queen and others (even Tweedledee and Tweedledum) show Alice some things about her body and other people's bodies - it can be pretty wonderful. A story of love and lust that has never been seen. <br /> <br /> Kristine DeBell will appear in Alice. I have to say that for the 1970s, this may be the most attractive adult actor of his day. I believe this is her only movie before she moves into normal work, but it was pretty much the best she could have chosen (my love for all things that Alice is not a secret). Even better than "Fairy Tales" (which is not really pornography, so much). <br /> <br /> Songs are fun but fit with the theme of the movie. One song, "What girl like you do a knight on this?" was pretty funny and others were similar. The end of the experiment was well written and well suited to Alice's world. Of course, logic and humor were taken into account. <br /> <br /> What else can you say about this movie? I know that people who are accustomed to adult movies, where it is only 30 seconds of sex for sex, are going overload and music. But personally, I think there is something very special about this movie, and I hope that it will be a nice DVD release that deals with things and specifics (if it is possible). I see this as a cult film.
