In 1983, two Bond films were made, one of which was the official Bond film with Octopussy starring Roger Moore, who played James Bond for the first time in Live and Let Die, and the other was the unofficial Bond movie Never Say Never Again starring Sean Connery James Bond played for the first time in Dr No that this movie was also the first 007 James Bond movie. Never to ever say unofficial, because another company that made James Bond movies did not. Never Say Never Again is a remake of the 1965 007 movie Thunderball, there are several differences never saying ever that will let you know that it was not made by EON. One thing is that opening is different, no weapon barrel sequence or credit pre-order, another difference is music score. Some things in this movie feel like James Bond's movie, like gadgets and cars, and James Bond, who always gives it to women and the film, is an open song song. Sean Connery is still doing a good job with Bond, the other star actor is also great. <br /> <br /> Never ever tell a good movie that is just as fun as the official James Bond movies. Look at this. 10/10
