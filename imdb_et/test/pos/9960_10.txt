Some thoughts before reaching the heart of the film: 1) I've never seen so many movies that were shown in so many non-sexual scenes - it was weird; 2) Joseph Fiennes, where have you been? You received us in * Elizabeth * and * Shakespeare's love * and then you went away for a while. America's main wants more! Okay, I'm a college English professor, I've read this game several times, and it's probably the best version of the movie I've seen. Although the individual aspects of other productions may be outstanding, this overall package is well-assembled. Pacino is not Olivier, but he doesn't have to be, so take it! The film's cinematography is stunning and not just bare. Venice is depicted amazingly, and you really feel there. Portia's residential area is amazingly beautiful and lighting is always tinted with the right mood for the right scenes. <br /> <br /> This semiotics in this movie / game is hard to see, especially at the end. The fall of Pacino's knee and the seizure of his religious artefact is probably the most powerful moment of his film since * Part III of Godfather * (when Michael's daughter is beaten in the opera). Is the game anti-Semitic? Of course. Is * Othello * racist? Of course. Take it for what it is: a comment in the age of Elizabeth, not the commentary of today. <br /> <br /> Fiennes is under-utilized in the movie, but still a joy to watch. The women in the movie are fine; no one really did differ here, but they blend nicely with the landscape. Jeremy Irons and Pacino have two juicest roles, and the opponents are perfect. I've always felt that the irons are underestimated (I still get chills when I hear his voice * Lion King *) and Pacino is Pacino.
