This is one of Hitchcock's highest films and rightly so. This is the story of two men who meet on the train and exchange the fantasies of murder. One of them (Robert Walker) takes it seriously, and this leads to difficulties with Guy Haines (Farley Granger). Another fast-moving Hitchcock movie with lots of great scenes (carousel scene and a tennis game worth mentioning). No movie to be missed - it is a shame that no one will let it off on the DVD because there are many cheap Warner Brothers DVDs.
