Yes, I know this movie is for comedy! And humor is up! But the issue of people who are less intelligent in the future may not have been pulled up! I can't say it happens, but if we can't take care of our education system, it could be an opportunity! I have noticed that some schools are not teaching the facts any more! (Like history, geography, basic things). More focus on learning practical skills! The theory behind most topics can be boring, but it is important to understand how things work! In the film, this is a ridiculous example of people who grow crops with water in Gatorade! Well, we can laugh about it! But if you have never taught that water contains minerals that are necessary for plant growth, then how do you know! For me this is a frightening thought! Now you understand why this topic is no longer funny! It may be that Mike Judge is fun, but warns people of a real disaster if education does not improve fast! Can I take this movie too seriously! Yes of course! Everyone's Fun! I loved the work of Mike judge (Beavis and Butthead and office space)! At the same time, he was critical and funny! "Idiocrat" I missed it! Most events are too absurd and, as I said earlier, very scary! I think if you are in the mood, this movie likes it!
