Not every comedy line is funny. This film takes a serious issue, the injustice of voters and keeps it light when talking about jokes. This is a movie that the Daily Show would have done if it wanted to make it into a movie. I found Robin Williams in this movie much more fun than RV. And while my husband and I share some contradictory political views, we both doubled laughing at several parts of this movie. Script writers could give Fox News some lessons in a fair and balanced way. Lewis Black, for his part, was fine, but never seemed to be able to bring out his particular comedy brand for his role. Christopher Walken was also good at playing a rather modest modest role, pushing the story.
