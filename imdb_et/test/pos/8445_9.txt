As long as you don't pay more attention than usual to other movies, this is one of the best "thrillers" you will ever see. The film depicts a case in real life; something like that doesn't seem fancy, actually. It also shows how people react in real life. <br /> <br /> In fact, it looks so good that it seems like a real life. Combine this with the absence of a soundtrack and you've almost got the best news-like movie you've ever seen. Jane Fonda and Jack Lemmon are especially good at this masterpiece of the 1970s, which is a source of concern for their end and true tragic damage. I recommend it to anyone who loves thrillers.
