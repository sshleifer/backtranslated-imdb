Prepare to meet your Messiah - they call him Masten Thrust. Men's role models are increasingly difficult to find in today's society with over-exposure. Every other day, the obvious role model is forced to apologize a bit for youthful indecision or for innocently a couple of youngsters who drunk on his ranch. The last dinosaur is the story of the last great Masten Thrust who is an old, grizzled, big game hunter who earns the ultimate role model. Despite their haggard qualities and onions, women, including Joan Van Ark, have attracted him as Meatloaf has fun words. The thrust is openly sexist and does not apologize for its advanced lifestyle that includes a red body and a private jet with a working fireplace. <br /> <br /> The thrust begins the mission of finding and sharing the last dinosaur on earth as ironically, after a rich full life, he is really the last dinosaur. Despite his tendency to worship everyone in his presence, his staff and lads are loyal to him. He can act as he is forever drunk, but does not make a mistake when he calls you "Ding Dong", being "Ding Dong". <br /> <br /> Don't ban your ballad, the Thrust song shamelessly praises her and her masculinity. Examples of lyrics include: "Few men have ever done what he has done or even dreamed of what he has dreamed of / Few men have even tried what he has tried, most men have failed where he has ruled / the world has something for him no new, and the things that amaze you and me have only borne him / Few men have ever lived, as he has lived or even walked, where he has walked. ‚ÄùEven BMTG forbade artist Clay To pull these words out and turn into a drum -kicking machine. <br /> <br /> The thrust and the team of its scientists struggle to "Polar Borer", who carries mini-bike helmets, although Thrust gives itself a luxury red body with a giant man filled with a bore well digging through the ground and ice to come to the lagoon, the air and the dinosaurs from the earth will soon fall as scientists force Thrust and the team to put their lives in. Masten will return and explode happily, not so much to celebrate l i But to admit that "the game is in progress". <br /> <br /> Shortly thereafter, it is a bit surprising that we are seeing a couple of light beats on men who are mocking their visitors. The excitement that is not satisfied with just killing the dinosaurs then decides to make the cave a wide cave. Throughout the film, a single T-Rex contradicts the belief that dinosaurs have a peanut size. Despite its enormous size, the local T-Rex is able to virtually ignore its victims. With the element of surprise, T-Rex just crushes the scientist or two and amuses the camp. Often, the expanded and chatter-like thrust is worshiped by someone shooting something or flirting with a primitive J-Lo in a manly way. <br /> <br /> The strength is like James Tiberius Kirk, not only to love his addiction, but also when it comes to making complex weapons with limited resources in a short time. The thrust and the rest of the crews create a very precise catapult that casts a big stone in the cunning T-Rex skull. Realizing that even he, Masten Thrust, is unable to complete this trophy case, Thrust decides to stay in his prehistoric environment. The ever-shrinking team then leaves Thrust to live their days with their cute, albeit a bit gamma, cavewoman, and introduce him to his personal STD collections. It's just a brief summary of BMTG's tradition of such a complex and rich film that it takes several views to receive this message and understands that Masten Thrust is the answer. The classical moment is a press conference that includes a frightening thrust, the introduction of bumpy journalists and the great Bunta. Also look at the body that resembles a dead Ricky Schroeder, lying on some logs, and the most powerful is someone called "Ding-Dong" in cinema history.
