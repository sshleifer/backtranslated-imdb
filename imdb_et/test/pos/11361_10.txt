I've been trying to watch the kings age for many years. My theater life was full of participants in this series. At the time, in 1960, I couldn't keep up with it because I was in the theater myself, with a lot of night work. Now, retiring, I have to keep it for a long time and keep it. Please, it can't be released on a DVD, I wouldn't remember what it costs. I see there are others who know the same. What can we do to do that? Something as big as it shouldn't be forgotten. I have to write two more lines. OK, I can do this by saying that I want this series more than anything in the world. Just so we can look at our best actors who play our wonderful Shakespeare's best words. Not so! Usmen
