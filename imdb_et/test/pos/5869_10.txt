I was recently given this movie as a gift on a DVD and was at the outset sure it would complain (though one of my favorite actors is a leading role). In fact, it's the way to become a favorite. <br /> <br /> First of all: fortunately this * is not * the same as the book, which I think is too melodramatic. Second: it is one of the best films I've seen during the First World War. "What?" you can ask. "It's not a movie!" True: we do not see battles or bombings, no trenches, no gas. But it shows the cost of war, the damage to the lives of men fighting in it, and its impact on those who are near them. <br /> <br /> First we see Helen (Sarah Miles), a baronet widow, waiting for a mental hospital to be released. All women in the woman seem to be starving: some of the war, but Helen's older man, Sir Thomas (we'll see him later in the photo), became ill and died when he was at the party, so his fault was broken. She's lost and lonely. The wire around the hospital creates POW camps and trenches: like many other people in the outside world, Helen is in some way suffering from shock shock. <br /> <br /> Outside the hospital, he has to find the world's feet again: a world we experience through our eyes as blind, destroyed and unfriendly. Her mother can't give her any real support. She is a widow, she has put in her emotional defenses, hiding behind her daughter's suffering. (Like many people, especially at this time, it seems that he finds an embarrassing mental illness.) dangerously obsessed. This is a great performance by Robert Shaw. Ledbetter is a former regular soldier, a former Sergeant Major who heads a boxing club and has created his own car rental. Superficially, he looks tough and strong, dependable, but under the surface there are cracks: he's not really adapted to civilian life. He complains (for reasons he later explains) that he has no family and home life; she has brutal outbursts with her colleagues and affectionate sex. Getting close to Helen? a woman who, even after the post-war social freedom, could not actually hope to marry? reveals the psychological failures that leave him. These days, PTSD can be diagnosed. <br /> <br /> The same applies to another man in Helen's life, the aspiring politician, Captain Hugh Cantrip (Peter Egan). She is ambitious, beautiful, but also very young. His girlfriend, Connie's (Caroline Mortimer) mother, punishes her hair and makes sure she has a clean handkerchief before she goes. He is known to both Ledbetter and Helen: the former had served him during the war, and Helen met him in political circles and had thought of him as "popinjay". But she and Helen are now starting a relationship, Helen is planning to support her political career financially and emotionally. Peter Egan, fresh from the progress of the production, such as Stanhope R C Sheriff's End of Trip, makes Hugh more than immature. Behind Helen and Hugh is a car-revealing, underrated scene where they cite Brooke's "The Old Vicarage at Grantchester". He asks about his war experience: "Was it very bad?" He can't answer. He says, "Well, you're back." But his softly spoken answer? "Am I? Sometimes I don't know?" ? is the key to his character. Like shaking light and shade over your face, we know that there are some horrors that cannot be put into words. Disproportionate accidents suffered by his junior officials? directly out of school or university and is expected to lead the way? is known. In a nerve call (during which Helen confirms her) to the local political people during a dinner party, she turns out to be independent, not more liberal (the party that had taken the country to war). His emotional life is as bad as Ledbetter. She can't easily get out of Connie, who is emotionally and financially dependent on her: reading between lines, she's probably a war widow (maybe a former comrade?) With a child whose drawings we see on her home wall <br /> < br /> *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> The Trio crisis is slowly building a scary scene between Helen and Ledbetter in the car and listening to Ledbetter Hugh and Connie when she rides, as Hugh tries to convince Connie even if his relationship with Helen develops, they can continue their own; that he will continue to support him. Jealousy, obsession, and his conviction that he must protect Helen from a double gold digger in order to confront Ledbetter at home and in Hugh. <br /> <br /> The end is completely different from the novel and is better: it is dramatic, but less melodic and retains an unpleasant tone. We started with one character that recovered from the spiritual division; we end with another suffering. Helen, one of the senses, is now smarter and stronger than both men who have not been able to fully adapt to the so-called "land of heroes" to which they returned from the horror of a complete war. The new end is open: it seems that it will cope with any kind of illusion without any illusions. In this it reflects well the reality of the time in which women (Helen, Connie and so many others) had to pick up parts of the world where too many men had died or came home with different spiritualities. and physical harm. <br /> <br /> "Well, you're back." ? "Am I? Sometimes I don't know?"
