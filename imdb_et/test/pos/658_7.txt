** SPOILERS ** A beautifully-photographed lifestyle home-front WWII love story with Norman Rockwell's paintings at the beginning and end of a film about how the "war hero" is not just someone who kills for his country, but is also someone who thinks and doesn't spoiled by war propaganda, which has been constantly drummed with his head. Marine Corps Marion's "Hedg" Hedgepeth, Jan Michael-Vincent's washing, will be launched five weeks after the boot camp and forced to put on Baby Blue Marine's uniform, which shows that he simply couldn't do that. Whenever he went when he went home to go home Louise and frightened by her family, whom her father was WWI in the Navy. . <br /> <br /> Hedg stops at the bar and finds that next to him is the sea-safe and deadly Marine Rider sailor Richard Gere, whom the admirable Hedge buys beer. Talking to Richard Hedge is shocked to find out that not only is he sent back to the Pacific Theater after all the battles he fought, and to fight for the medals he received, but with completely gray hair and thirty-look Richard, 21 next month! That was what was in Marine Corps and World War II! Hedge Buying Many Drinks Richard takes out a baby's blue outlet and strikes it out, taking his baby bouquet and leaving his impressive US sea uniform with money to equip Hedge. <br /> <br /> As soon as Hedge puts Richard's uniform that fits her perfectly, she faces this great drunken US paratrooper who calls herself a head of cement who wants to get a fight with Marine Rider. Hedge does everything he can to avoid difficulties, to force the cement head to strike him, after he has burst his two beer bottles on his cement head to get a big attack on Marine, Hedge and Paratrooper, Cement-Head. Hedge has extremely high floors with a large cement head that knocks him with a cold punch! "I think the trick won't hit him on his head," stunned Hedge tells his, cement head, associates G.I. <br /> <br /> The soul-hiking in this small town of Bidwell Hedge alerts this US military intervention camp to the Japanese-Americans who are there because they are considered a threat to US security. It is later in the movie that Hedge shows to all his true hero he is not the people of the city when he is risking his life to save one of the hated "Japanese" who, with his two friends, escaped to an intermediate camp where hell they thought they were still going? Hedge threatened his life by saving the fear of death from the Japanese-American drowning in dangerous rapids outside the city. In his work, Hedge taught Bidwell's people that not all "Japanese", even those who are American citizens, are bad and fraudulent banzai who scream at kamikaz like suicide magazines and films thought they were. Hedge hits the conversation with a lovely and beautiful waitress at a local canteen in Rose Hudkins, Glynnis O'Connor, who is just crazy about her, that even Hedge first thinks it's her uniform, not impressed by her. Later, when Hedge confessed to Rose that she was not her and her parents, A US Marine Raider that she had been Rose, that she had felt so well the sweet and caring washed sea so well that she wasn't important to her, what he was supposed to be, a seaman or a postman, was what was inside his heart, which was really thought. <br /> <br /> The film has several touching and beautiful scenes, Hedge and Rose, which show how the films were made years ago without any sex and misery we see and hear in the movies today, to involve two people in love with each other. <br /> <br /> How the film accurately, not counterfeit, shows the true feelings of the average Americans, then in 1943, the war in general and the Japanese language in particular could not be done with authentic and accurate taste. "Baby Blur Marine" is not best not to be too politically correct if the film does not show the same feelings and ideas of heroes or leading actors and actors, as most people have now come across as a fake as a three dollar bill for those who watch a movie that lived during the historical and important times when the film was made.
