Well, this movie took place on working day at 230am. The lovely little actor who played Billy got his attention first, and after the first 15 minutes I kept my television in captivity until the end. This is at the edge of your seat, then during the most intense sequences you are throwing smart comedies. <br /> <br /> The only setback is that the story was not important enough to fill an hour and a half with a movie, causing some sequences to drag. Nonetheless, it was still a lot of fun and I recommended it to all of my associates the next day.
