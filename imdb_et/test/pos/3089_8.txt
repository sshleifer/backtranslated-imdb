Fata Morgana, a German filmmaker Werner Herzog's documentary in 1971, filmed in the late 1960s, is one of those rare DVDs that should be commented on when the comment is turned on. This is a visual party of images of North Africa (mostly Sahara) that is timeless. You just couldn't say it was done thirty-five years ago. The soundtrack of the film, including German classical music (Mozart and Handel) and Blind Faith and Leonard Cohen rock music, is also a timeless quality. The story of three different German narrators (German film historian Lotte Eisner, Eugen Des Montagnes and Wolfgang von Ungern-Sternberg) is for sure and Herzog continues to import Eisner into this project, himself and the history of the film, but the English-speaking speaker James William Gledhill has a voice that seems to be completely deific, which gives this project a lot more perfection, although much of the text is quite redundant in both languages. Yes, the artificial tweets of the popular Vuh Mayan art thoughts in the first part of the movie "Creation" are interesting, but the text Herzog wrote the names of the other two parts (Paradise and Golden Time) with the quotations of the German poet Herzog like Manfred Eigendorf, almost seemingly terrible in the first part? The film seems to have been put together during several simultaneous photos of Herzog projects - fictitious even dwarfed small and documentary films "The Land of Silence and Darkness and Flying Doctors in East Africa", but the rejected material of these projects adds only to the beauty of this film, such as distant flamingo air scenes from mating lakes, which give one of the shameful meaningless words that Herzog hides in his commentary. This uncomfortable feeling occurs immediately after the film begins with a number of planes landing in the desert, where their images become increasingly blurry when the heat on the ground rises, and increases the distorting distortion of images. This film was influential in Godfrey Reggio Quats films. But Reggio is pleased that just capturing images, Herzog has the ability that only American filmmaker Terrence Malick has: to make a completely independent vocabulary when comparing pictures and words, and one depends on emotion - the first push. The analysis may fail if such efforts are made. Herzog often does not understand why his art is great. The best he often does is completely unconscious and mesmeric. This is why his contempt for the lowest common denominator of Hollywood is explicitly stated in the commentary. <br /> <br /> The best example of this might be when Herzog tells us that we are following a serious drought in Cameroon. It shows cattle carcasses and Herzog describes an unbearable smell. However, the viewer can recognize all of the images, the sensitivity of the animals' sun-dried parts and the blanched bones. But even in this commentary, Herzog focuses on stink, not deeper meaning. He is pleased to allow you to do and interpret your work, such as the almost erotic feminized sand dunes that resemble Ingmar Bergman's wolf hour, where Max Von Sydow heads Ingrid Thulin's beautiful naked body curves. But the archetypal image of this film, which symbolizes a large number of Herzog's careers, is a distant car that travels back and forth to the lake. It is deep, hypnotic, illusory, difficult to understand, supernatural, but real, just like Herzog, a believer from a family of atheists. But then, like everything else, ends.
