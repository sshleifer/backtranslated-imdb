It was one of the worst episodes of Columbo I've seen, but I'm just in the second season. <br /> <br /> A typical Columbo action is so fun and irritating. His pig ash, which caused him problems, has been seen earlier, and a bit where he always somewhat identifies with a murderer - in this case, while cooking, when the scene of a scrambled scene is disturbed by the main theme. <br /> <br /> It was also not explained why at the beginning of the exhibition the brother created some of the mixer wires. The reason was never explained and no purpose. But the part I didn't like anymore was the death of the bride. It was never explained and this is the main reason why I give this episode to such a low level.
