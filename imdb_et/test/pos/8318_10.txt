Walking with dinosaurs is an amazing documentary that is the education of both dinosaurs and dinosaur lovers (like me). I admit that I was very young when I discovered it, but I was immediately obsessed with it. (Spoliers !!!!!) The series contains 6 episodes that begin with late triassic when dinosaurs became the first late, at the end of dinosaur rule. When I first saw this movie, it was as I really traveled back in time. The surprise of the extension, the adventures of the Opthalmosa and the caring version of T-Rex all surprised my family and me. This is an amazing movie, and I believe the BBC was able to do exactly what they intended. Awesome job!
