If you asked you to choose the best films ever made, this movie, along with a short list with the 1951 Streetcar name, would be a movie. I imagine I discover some others that qualify, but Kramer vs Kramer is a great exercise in naturalism. So this is a very satisfying experience at this level: just looking at the admirable performances of Dustin Hoffman, Meryl Streep and especially Justin Henry. One of the best childrens shows has ever been. <br /> <br /> But in my opinion, it is a great pleasure to watch it, because it is so thoroughly involved - it always makes me forget about my problems. It has such a wonderful story. If you have arrested Kramer and Kramer and Alice Kramer leaves Ted for work and a young son, he will not tell him anything but to discover. And even if you know how things change, the moment of each journey is so wonderfully true that its joy to watch it over and over again. <br /> <br /> Do not make a mistake - Kramer vs Kramer is not an easy entertainment: it is a very realistic picture of the impact of divorce on everyone involved. <br /> <br /> 10/10. <br /> <br /> One of the best scripts (born of Benton's conversations and Hoffman, who had been divorced at this time, has ever written, executed and executed beautifully and flawlessly. Not to mention what is a great and involved story. Just, perfect film .
