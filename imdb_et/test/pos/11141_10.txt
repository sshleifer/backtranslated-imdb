I loved this movie because Bobbie Phillips can really be wrong! I always hate if the actors do not believe in the activities. It was nice to see some insult, but a woman who can skillfully fight martial arts and combat. If you compare it to most of the movies about women, then you will definitely see what I mean. They do not have to cut the frames with someone who can fight and flowing better. I was very impressed. I hope there's more!
