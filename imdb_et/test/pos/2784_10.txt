A young Frenchman is abducting himself when he becomes an Erasmus exchange student in Barcelona and returns to a better man. It seems boring? Not possible! The film is full of colorful people, all of these stereotypes (British twat and his racist brother, sexually released Dane, ultra-organized German, ...). In this case, however, the stereotypes are excellent. You feel that you know such people (I know one arrogant doctor and his trophy wife and they are like movie characters!) They feel like REAL PEOPLE! <br /> <br /> Go watch this movie and enjoy the subtitles!
