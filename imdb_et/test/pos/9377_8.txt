As a rule, there are few things that tend to be pampering than Hollywood attempts to be bold. By mixing caution with heavy duty, message clips loudly resemble on the back to encourage big problems. CROSSFIRE is not completely free of this smell; it contains a sermon on the nature of meaningless hatred, which is embarrassingly obvious, assuming that its audience has naivety that is frustrating to consider. Already in 1947, it was a big deal for the film to announce that anti-Semitism existed and it was bad. (Of course, it was inconceivable that Hollywood was dealing with the actual subject of the book, on which the film was based? Its victim was homosexual.) Nevertheless, thanks to good writing and excellent action, CROSSFIRE is still a convincing study of what we would now call hate crime. <br /> <br /> Post-war malaise was one of the main components of the film's twins and CROSSFIRE deals directly with it. The film is in Washington, D.C. The intelligent and kind Jew, Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene), explains that the end of the war has created a gap: all the energy that went to the enemy's hatred and struggle is now unassigned and put into bottles. Samuels meets three soldiers at the bar: sensitive Mitchell, close to nerve damage, deliberate Floyd Bowers, and a long, exuberant bully who jokes about Tennessee's young soldier. Three soldiers finished the Samuels apartment, where drunk Monty becomes more abusive, calling his master a "Jewish boy". Samuel is beaten to death and Mitchell disappears, making himself the main suspect of murder. <br /> <br /> Disclaimer is Detective Finlay (Robert Young), Dry and Co-editor, and Sergeant Keeley (Robert Mitchum), a thoughtful and experienced friend who knows Mitchell is murderous. The riddles include Ginny (Gloria Grahame), the hostess of the nightclub, who met Mitchell and gave her the key to her apartment, and Floyd (Steve Brodie) who witnessed the criminal holes that were terrified in a good room. Although there is no real "whoduniti" relationship, this story stops and the trap put on the murderer is extremely smart. <br /> <br /> A strong noir atmosphere saves the film from feeling didactic or sanctifying. Cinematic art is an amazing shadow with dark dark and harsh lights, spaces that are often illuminated by a cigarette-filtered lamp. World fatigue is as common as noir lighting. "I don't like anything," says Finlay quietly; "Nothing," is Ginny's toast in a nightclub. Gloria Grahame, Noir's femininity, almost steals the movie with her two scenes. Platinum-blonde, jaded and alkaline, she's the main B-girl poisoned by the "smelly gin mill" where she works ("laughs," she says bitterly), her sweet face crumbles when Mitchell tells her she reminds her his wife. Now and then, the witty departure looks through his protective cover, as when dancing with Mitchell in an abandoned courtyard, he offers spaghetti in his apartment. When he goes there, he meets a nice-chopped face man (Paul Kelly) who appears to be Ginny's sponge and whose conversation is a dense and false confession. Gloria blows off Mitchell's good girl's wife's screen, where she is asked to give an alike to Mitchell. Thin and weak, her bathrobe, her girlfriend, lets us see how often Ginny is offended and trampled. <br /> <br /> Robert Young is an inadequate actor and has no chance of accepting Mitchum's charisma, but he does a good job of keeping his smoking character by mixing the film with a serious message, this pompous side. Meanwhile, Mitchum has a nice dialogue, but not nearly enough. Yet, even if he does nothing but sit in the corner, you can't take his eyes off. The third Robert, Ryan, creates a completely shady and scary convincing unknown, unstable bigotti portrait. we see his counterfeiting, his bullying, his resentment to anyone who has the advantages of his "am I right or am I right?" discomfort; how easily he marks people and what kind of satisfaction he puts them in bad. <br /> <br /> The CROSSFIRE message now seems cautious and dated, though not nearly as much as the A GENTLEMAN AGREEMENT of the same year. Finlay's speech on the grandmothers, after a hundred years, ends up being a white victim, reminding us that Irish Catholics were once persecuted; he can say he can be Tennessee people, or men who wear striped necklaces. Or maybe black or Japanese or homosexuals or communists? The script seems to be afraid to mention real modern problems. It sweetens its message, making the Jewish sacrifice holy, as if its innocence would not be enough; and will ensure that the army is released when a higher officer declares that the army is ashamed of Montgomery-like men and emphasizes that Samuels earned honestly in war. Nevertheless, he immediately depicted some of the courage that is happier in the Nazi army and the main prerequisites of the film still exist after World War II. If Monty were alive today, he'd come out on September 12, 2001 and beat Sikh.
