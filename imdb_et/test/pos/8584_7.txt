I suspect that there is some revisionary history here, but it must definitely be felt that Patrice Lumumba was a troubled one, who incited his people to violence from the moment Congo declared independence. Bringing Soviet aid back to his army was obviously a part of the United States and led to his murder. But replacing him with Mobut did not solve the United States. Well done with excellent cinematography and exciting scores.
