It looks like a b-class and you probably don't think you have to rent this movie! But is it! I didn't expect anything from this movie, but something that was time-consuming, but I had tried from the start! Two interesting spaces - abduction of the bank went wrong, a million dollars lost and two girls on the road to start a new life - How do these two stories come together? Just when you think you know what direction to direct the movie, it will make 180 and you will be blown away by the big twists of the plot! It has a big but unexpected end, and you have left more, always a good sign - rent or even buy, you don't have to be disappointed!
