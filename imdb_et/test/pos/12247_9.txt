I am usually a comedy boy. I rented it under a comedy in a video store and thought "Albert Brooks! Awesome!" and rented it. It seemed like a romantic comedy, and I remembered that I hated them, and I was totally in the hate of this movie. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Although it is a romantic comedy, it works with amazing lead and support (Brooks, Hunter, Cusack and Nicholson), and everything works well within you. The script really sounds and is not forced, as it might happen in a night-time news program. It takes your emotions and makes you a pleasant Hunter and Brooks and Hurt, which makes the end a little fun and infertile, but shows you how to stop the movie with a happy ending. what everyone got. Not everyone's life ends well and it appears in Broadcast News. Maybe people don't like the end because it's not your typical happy ending associated with romantic comedies ... but it works, it's real and it's a genius. Broadcast News is a classic time and exquisite romantic film with Casablanca. Well, maybe not that high, but it's the only other romance I think I like. <br /> <br /> Broadcast News: 9/10.
