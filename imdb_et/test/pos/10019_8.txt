Since this comic was made in old times, Felix speaks with a series of bubble bubbles and the animation style is very raw today. Compared to its modern times, it is a pretty comic and still good. This is because, despite its age, the comic is very creative and funny. <br /> <br /> Felix meets a man whose shoe is folding because he can't sell a shoe. Well, Felix needs money to go to Hollywood, so she talks to the store store to get all the shoes sold. Felix spreads chewing gum all over the city and soon people will be stuck and leave their shoes - in a hurry to buy a new shoe store. Thanks, man gives Felix $ 500! But the owner of Felix wants to take the money and go on his own, so Felix thinks how to go. <br /> <br /> If there is, then Felix ferries into the studio and get a little discomfort. On his journey, he meets comics by comic books by Ben Turpin and Charlie Chaplin. Finally, the Felix movie contract is discovered and succeeds. Cheers!
