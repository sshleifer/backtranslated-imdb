Very funny movie. Michael Douglas "no" is worth seeing this flick, for some other reason. I would like to see that he would do more for these low-life roles. He was terrible, as did all the performers. <br /> <br /> The film hit me as an American Roshomon, just more fun and easier to watch because it was in American and didn't need stink subtitles! <br /> <br /> A funny movie with a laugh every minute or so, the two best ones were with John Goodman (not someone I'm crazy about) - 1. He tells the priest that Jewel does something he liked and says, "Ma I had to smile at my face. " Visual exhibitions that he does not smile are clearly a man who never smiles, but probably does not know it. 2. At the end of Goodman's style, everyone was fit to Jewel in their policeman uniforms and banged with leather goods from Reiser, who created a table ... and two of them protested that they were not gay in the event - it alone earned a special comedy academy award.
