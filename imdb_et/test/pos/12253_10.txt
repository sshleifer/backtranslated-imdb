TV News producer Jane Craig (Hunter) will meet with Tom Grunicki (Hurt), a novel news director, and their mutual attractiveness will bring them back to their room. However, romance is short when it turns out that Tom is "not good at what I'm successful," and Jane realizes that she personalizes everything she hates when TV news goes. Rubbish comes when Tom reveals that he is going to join the Washington News Office. <br /> <br /> Jane's and Tom's primary attraction is therefore given a second chance, but can Jane leave her professional opinion with the man she thinks she is interested in - and should she? Aaron Altman (Brooks) is Jane's highly intelligent reporter colleague and trustee. Despite her obvious talent, Aaron's career is stuck because she lacks confidence and people's skills - and the classic look good - are successful so her new, less qualified and less intelligent colleague - Tom - changes. He is also concerned that his good friend, Jane, may fall in love with Tom because he is becoming more and more aware that Aaron has romantic feelings for him. <br /> <br /> The TV news network bureaucratic trials and tribulations where moral dilemmas and ethics are being tackled quickly and where appearances and dramatic effects are becoming more common and important. <br /> <br /> This is where most bites get well-tracked comments and scenes. One of the many moments is a scene where Tom meets Bill Rorich (Jack Nicholson's cape) for the first time with the network's main anchor and focuses on his handshake. With large lines and dialogues, long and short movies, you will understand the nature of these two men in a quick picture of these two hands. <br /> <br /> Inter-character dialogue is the most intelligent and witty thing you will ever find anywhere in the movie and in such an abundance. Brooks gets the best part of them, according to his character, but even shorter conversations that are random and perhaps too audible by one or more characters when they move over crowded space should be listened to. > <br /> The hunter in this role is a tour for which he was rightly (and not alone) a candidate for the Oscar and for which he would probably have received if he had played a role in a movie that was not part of what had changed closely related to the industry - and against the strong performance of another actor in the more traditional sense of good, rom-com. <br /> <br /> Brooks is also excellent as constantly disappointed and Aaron Altman is from time to time too-own-your-own-good, <br /> <br /> Hurt, while having a look and personality of his own character, is not always convinced that he is quite the same, he noticed that he is or should be. to make the most of the limitations that can be credible, but I don't think Hurt is pulling it away, but if he tells us he's "stinking" or "not getting it", Hurt will be a little smarter about it. it is an effective force where its character is harmed by its intellect ectopic constraints, but Brooks and Hunter overshadow Hurt's performance slightly. This is the only negative thing I can say about the whole movie and who says that someone else would have done better or better than Hunter and Brooks next and their performances in this movie. > <br /> Support is provided by, among others, Robert Prosky, Lois Chiles, and Joan Cusack, and Christian Clemenson also has some of the next Boston Legal fame and short parts of Joan's brother, John Cusack, whose face you don't even see. <br /> <br /> James L Brooks has given us many great TV shows and movies and this movie should be the best. It may not win any Oscar, despite seven candidates, but it won many other awards and turned to Holly Hunter's star.
