Sometimes reading comments from users on IMDB is desperate for me. In order for someone to leave 2001 empty: Space Odyssey as "boring", they don't have to be interested in science, technology, philosophy, history or the art of cinematography. Finally, I understand why most Hollywood productions are so low and empty - they understand their audience. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, those who can't understand Kubrick's achievement are still a minority. Most viewers are capable of seeing the intelligence and purity of this epic. This is a film that puts science in scientific literature, and the portrayal of space travel and the future of mankind is still insurmountable to this day. It was so long before humanity was still catching up. <br /> <br /> 2001 is mainly a technical film. The reason why it is slow and fulfilled is because the goal was to realistically portray technology for the future (and past, awe-inspiring scenes). The greatest strength of the film is in detail. Remember that when this movie was made, the man was still not on the moon ... but it's 2001 and it's just the beginning of the trip. To create such an incredibly detailed vision of the future that is still the best 35 years later, we have no faith - I still can't work out how some shots were made. The only significant mistake in the film was the optimism with which he predicted the technological (and social) development of mankind. It is a shame for us that 2001 did not seem like a film for 2001, not for Kubrick. <br /> <br /> In addition to amazing special effects, camera work and design, Kubrick also brings a lot of food to the viewer, thinking what it means to be human and where humanity is going. Yes, the end is strange and difficult to understand - but it is the essence of the future. Kubrick and Clarke have started seeing it, now the audience's job is to continue. There is no pure solution, no final stop, because then the audience could stop thinking after the last throat. I know most of the viewers want these days, but Kubrick won't let us get that easy. <br /> <br /> I'm glad to see this movie in IMDB's top 100 movie, and I just want it to be even bigger. Stanley Kubrick is one of the best filmmakers the world has known, and in 2001 he was the best filmmaker. 10/10.
