Pink Flamingos is a movie that no word can explain. It was as good as I thought. It expands the movies. Pink Flamingos is one of the best films, starting with a "multiple" start and ending with a shocking but smart ending. Don't miss this chance to see a big movie. Rent it on video or watch it at late midnight as I showed you. But look at it.
