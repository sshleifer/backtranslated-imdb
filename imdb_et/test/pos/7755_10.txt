For the first time, I heard Haruhi Suzumiya from melancholy from Youtube reviewer. He would literally hit a big bad beach, condemning it and confusing it. Curious, I decided to look at this example (when I got the episode order right, thanks to those who made the list), and I found it to be a great and enjoyable watch. Great memorable characters full of life and full of love and fun; a unique and not overbearing plot that makes sense now that I saw the show; and the two best anime moments in history, in my opinion. Plus opening and closing topics are great. <br /> <br /> Anime based on a collection of successful manga novels follows a simple plot when you understand it. Although the focus of the exhibition is on the protagonist Haruhi Suzumiyal, his friend is Kyon. Kyon is an ordinary high school student who does not really believe in supernatural things (eg Santa Claus, aliens, travelers, ghosts, espers), but soon Haruh, who is the most bizarre in school, still prefers aliens, considering all men worthless. He even joined every school club to find something interesting but gave up as soon as he joined. From Kyon to "counseling", Haruhi decides to set up his club with the Kyoni Club. Haruhi forms the creation of a literary club room for the SOS Brigade - its mission to investigate supernatural cases (think Scooby-Doo minus dog, masked man and puzzle machine). <br /> <br /> Haruh's "recruits" three extra members. The first one is Yuki Nagato, a typeface that speaks very little and spends most of the time reading and sitting. The other is Mikuru Asahina, a shy girl forced to join the club by Haruh, who thinks they need to do some things. He is often forced into Haruh's costumes to continue his brightness. Third is Itsuki Koizumi, a friendly and sociable transition student who always smiles. Although Haruhi thinks that his group is full of ordinary people, he can't be wrong. Although Kyon is as common as you can, the other three are quite unique - Yuki is an alien, Mikuru is a future traveler and Itsuki is an Esper (a person with ESP). All three have come to see Haruh, who may have the authority of God, and when he gets bored he can discover his abilities and create a whole new world and Kyon is somehow involved. <br /> <br /> The exhibition is worth watching with great character, music and fun and wonderful moments. For parents, however, there are some sexual references, including the splitting up of Muru, which is revealed or touched several times, as well as several swear words. Moreover, this show is one of the biggest.
