It's really Broadway American Idol. She has singing, a British man, a guy who is sometimes nice, and a super-nice woman. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is different because there are singing and dancing and some actors (we just don't see some actors). <br /> <br /> I gave this show 7 because there are a couple of tweaks I know many people (including me) would do if they worked for the show. The first thing that really needs to be changed is the judges who decide who's going to go home. I know they want to find the right Danny and Sandy, but America should have the right to decide who will do it. Of course, it makes no sense. The person with the lowest number of votes usually goes home. Another thing I would change is to see them in the shows. What is Broadway without an actor? The last thing that needs to be changed is the song that the lost people sing at the end. Eliminated Danny always sings the same song and lost Sandy always sings the same song as they leave. As they sing it every week, these songs finally get annoying. <br /> <br /> I admit that I'm not a movie fan, Grease, but for some reason I'm hooked. This exhibition is very underrated. It has so many memorable performances and moments.
