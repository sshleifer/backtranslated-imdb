Killing Yard is an excellent film, though occasionally uneven. Morris Chestnut puts a phenomenal effort into a mental wounded and judicially broken prison, and Alan Alda's presence as his defender is none other than a genius. The emotions and raw reality depicted in the "rebounds" of this movie are able to place viewers directly in the middle of the pictures. I wasn't even born when the Attica rebellion took place, but through extensive research, I find that "Killing Yard" is a story about all fair judges. I would definitely recommend watching this movie for any educational or activist group as a necessary educational tool.
