Having read the book, I was more open to the fresh interpretation given by each director to his media (which is a film, not a "reproduction" of a letter) about this particular film. I was happy that the Holocaust in Russia (and its neighbors) finally became an issue. especially cruel to the Russians and the Russian Jews, if you read the history and see the monuments built in Smolensk and its surroundings, then you understand this film and why many were silent if they were talking. <br /> <br /> Certainly it was time to crown it and I I hope there will be more stories about it.
