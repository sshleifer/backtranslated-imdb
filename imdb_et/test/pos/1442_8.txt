A great little groundbreaking film (1955) on a major issue. <br /> <br /> I did not expect much of Sinatra's performance and was pleasantly surprised at it. Loved by Kim Novaki! He was fantastic! <br /> <br /> Loved by Elmer Bernstein's jazz score! As big as Lazlo Schifrin for "Bullitt"! I am very surprised that it does not seem to be available on the CD (if anyone knows about the availability of the audio track, they should post it here somewhere!). <br /> <br /> Preminger's Direction was as usual <br /> <br /> You have not read Nelson's Algrenian novel and have no idea how faithful this scenario was. Frankie's "hot" card dealer sub-block was also a bit of a surprise, as did some other things. But look at yourself. Worth noting ...
