I saw it in a theater in 1982. I was waiting for a stupid T&A movie. That's not what I got. <br /> <br /> This is basically about three teenage boys trying to have sex. We get the jokes and scenes of the expected sex - but they're really funny! <br /> <br /> Yes, they are stupid, but I still enjoyed them. There was also a surprising number of men's nudity. <br /> <br /> Then the film takes about half way through a dramatic turn when one of the boys (won by Lawrence Monoson) falls in love with the girl. Then the jokes stop and things become very dark. I'm not giving up what's happening, but I was very surprised at the sudden turn of events. The film highlights some very important topics and treats them realistically and intelligently. And it has a real heart-breaking end. <br /> <br /> I will give it to 10 because it is probably one of the best teen sex comedies / dramas ever made. It mixes fantasy and realism together and works! What more can be asked? It also has a great soundtrack.
