This is one of my favorite films. Rip Torn and Tantoo Cardinal are great and their performances with the music, landscape and reality of the movie are quite convincing. Look, tell him as it is, logging, a mountain man who refuses to give up his lifestyle for progress and development. Horseflies music is very unique and adds shame to some scenes. After seeing this movie for the first time, I had to go and buy a video and a soundtrack. In general, a quiet type of film with panic. Both the Tower and Cardinal are very credible in their roles. I put this movie in the same category as Winter People, another favorite Kurt Russell and Kelly McGillis.
