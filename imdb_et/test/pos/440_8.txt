Although it does not seem very promising for long stretching, Renoir's French Cancan comes in a fascinating film. The story is a cliché: Nin (Françoise Arnoul), a sister, is being discovered by the nightclub owner, Dangley (Jean Gabin). Danglard steals his baker's boyfriend and falls to his current girlfriend, both coming back to their former lovers. Nini must decide whether to go back to his humble life with the baker, to continue with the exhibition with his employer, or to become a princess if the prince falls in love with him at one point. I am glad that the film wasn't the most obvious choice because there would be less film. The movie ends with the new Danglard's new nightclub, Moulin Rouge, and a pair of gorgeous song and dance numbers. The first, "Sctete de la Butte", which also gives most of the musical result of the film, is just one of the most famous songs ever written, and Renoir himself wrote it. If you are a fan of Baz Luhrman's 2001 Moulin Rouge movie, you will feel its tuning as it comes up at the beginning of the movie that Rufus Wainwright sings. Although not very prominent in this film, anyone who has a sound track loves it. In addition to being one of the most beautiful songs ever written in French, Cancan also has one of the most beloved women ever to decorate the screen. It's hard not to fall in love with this girl's head. 8/10
