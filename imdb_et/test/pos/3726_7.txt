Well, I think I was in the mood for a movie that really grabbed me from the beginning. This movie wasn't it. It rose quite slowly, deliberately, during the first 40 minutes, but there was really nothing that was terribly interested in me - between Jean Reno's character and the old man there is an intriguing and mysterious, but over the first 40 minutes I was dominated by basic education I didn't know and couldn't to really deal with it at this time. He drives alone mostly, he doesn't judge anyone; I imagine that the director tried to portray the loneliness of the human situation in this post-apocalyptic world, or something that is all good, but I still want him to cut it from 40 minutes to 15 because it can get incredibly boring. things become very interesting. I think I won't say it anymore because I don't want to spoil anything. So if you've seen the movie for the first 15-30 minutes and think of turning it off (as I was), just paste it - it gets a lot better. <br /> <br /> One of the most interesting things I found about this movie was that he had no dialogue that really made me think about what was happening, how the characters felt, and what their motivations were, why things were in this post - an apocalyptic world that all gives the audience a lot of interpretation. And it's amazing how much the film's more satisfying is when the actors don't tell you exactly what's going on.
