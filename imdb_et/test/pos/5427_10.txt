"Big Snit" got into my life accident and left an indelible mark on my soul. The Love, Destruction, and Nonsense Charity Forever Into My Life. This is a story of beautiful negligence. We are helpless against each other. We are helpless against the wrong actions of the government. We are helpless choices that we all try to love. Deafs outside the world window with rebels and moves. Blind inevitable apocalypse. Overwhelming hate and greedy in the overwhelming society. It is a story of personal dedication and triumphant love that fights war ideologies. Their little beating is an overwhelming observation of human nature and how love is its pain and darkness. Everyone has some irritating aspects of their personality, and they do it in the simplest and most fantastic way. We only travel two distances at a short distance, but have, if desired, completed their simple, loving and honest philosophy to complete their trips. I am very glad I am in this "of our time". Another 20 years on both sides of my birth date, and I wouldn't have seen and felt .... .... Big Snit. William White. Sheffield.
