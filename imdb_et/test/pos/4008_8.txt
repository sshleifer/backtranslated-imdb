I look at the sample every day and it's a lot of fun. It offers news about tech news, video games pretty much everything geek. They are also the official broadcasters of E3 and Comicco. If you're a geek, gamer or something really, you'll enjoy this example. They've definitely got their game up because the boy is below my review (2006). This is the only place where I get my technical information. Kevin Pereira and Olivia Munn work beautifully with each other and there are always segments in the shows that point to things in the game, the film, the comic ... Universe. If you know these universes, you will understand jokes. A short story, aots is a fun show that gives me and anyone all the news about anything and everything you care about. I look at it now as I write, they are "San Diego", which covers red bull air competitions. Sweet.
