So here's a little background to watch this movie. As you probably know, this is the original French film that Hollywood was about to rebuild to Wicker Park. Well I avoided this movie like a plague when it was first released, just because: a) I knew it was not absolutely related to Wicker Park and lived in Chicago, I didn't see why they called it - it was filmed in the beginning of Canada! - b) It is very difficult for me to interfere with meaningless remarks made purely because Hollywood thinks we are too skeletal to read some subtitles (I am afraid to transform Infernal things) and c) I can't stand Josh Hartnett "Said nuff. <br /> <br /> But I met WP the other day, probably about half an hour, and I have to say at first that it didn't make any sense, up to about half an hour after it came together. Finally, I was surprised that I really got it, and then it seemed so good - the perfect story, passion and finally one of the greatest music I've ever seen (heard?). <br /> <br /> Since then, I've heard a lot about L'Appartement and Wicker Park's argument and looking at WP, I still say it is all about Chicago's business, but it seemed something I liked so if it was again, I looked at it again - unfortunately I still missed the first piece (I've still seen it!), and I thought it was still pretty good. Heck, even Josh Hartnett seemed good! But I was curious about L'Appartement and wanted to see what all the noise was. So I waited and waited for the l'Appartement somewhere somehow. Netflix pledged me off so I got a copy of some Irish website. And I looked at it easily. <br /> <br /> It's really strange but weird. Classic French film. Great Performance, Romane Bohringer is an absolute pearl - sorry, but she's out of Monica Bellucci on every scene. Vincent Cassel was a strange choice for drivers, but he finally works. And I've seen Jean-Philippe Ecoffey in many movies and I just love him - a scene where Alice throws her in the restaurant and she just looks like someone told her that her puppy has gone. But I can honestly say, having seen WP and pretty much been expecting to have had a scene copy scene (since about 75% of the rest of the movie was - maybe in a different order, but come, scene with coffee glasses? Word for word !!) , you can imagine my surprise when I looked at the end of L'Appartement !! I can literally say that I have been blown away - hmm, a bit like a poor old Lucien was really a coffee window! So, be prepared when you have seen Wicker Park and you look at the original, as I did, don't make a mistake to wait for an identical movie, because you're either frustrated or somewhat pleasant with French film history - a great example of how to watch a movie, think so you look at the happy end and get a hit in the opposite direction of the spin right at the end. Be sure to catch this movie. Oh and while you are, maybe not too close, but along the way, look at Wicker Park, this surprise for you.
