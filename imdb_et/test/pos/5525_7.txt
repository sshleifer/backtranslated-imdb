The title does not mean a suspicious poker hand, just six comics. They come twice: Charles Ruggles and Mary Boland as a couple traveling to California's second honeymoon, George Burns, and Gracie Allen as the second pair to share, and W.C. Fields and Alison Skipworth as a sheriff and hotel owner in a small city of Nevada. No attempt to form a single narrative, a comic book comic set. All the first couples want to spend time together, but Burns and Allen characters are not married, so men together, like women, together. There's a bit of a plot: bad boyfriends $ 50,000 in a pinky (Ruggles) suit takes out of town, but because the expedition is headed by Gracie, no looting can be found. A bad guy who appears in Nevada and Fields accidentally hits him. Lots of pleasant bits, Ruggle's confusing expression, Gracie's dirty, striking speech, and Fields playing billiards with corkscrew and doing fluttery, craven, doubling when he threatens, and his wonderfully distinctive way to switch words. And trying to remember the name "Gracie", he says to Skipworth, "Hmm. Starts with K ... McGonigle." He replies: "Oh no, no, no, no ..." "Mmmm. Wangahanky!" "No, no, no, no. Oh, Gracie." "Yes, that's right."
