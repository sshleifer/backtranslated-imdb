Do you know that sometimes you need to get it? So this movie is with me. I am almost embarrassed to admit that I like it, it is so funny in some parts, but I find that you get to it when I am left behind and I just need to laugh ... and trust me, I just don't " goofy movie "kinda guy. <br /> <br /> You can read the summary so I don't have to wear it, just be sure if you like Kelsey Grammer, you probably like this movie. Another thing, be sure you look at the final credit. You don't have to read them, just look and catch the villagers ... and the presence of friends in the "Fleet".
