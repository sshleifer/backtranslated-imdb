The twelve of the ocean are probably better than the 11-year-old ocean. I know most people don't agree, but I really liked it. After three years, it was good to see a gang return. The reason for the hunt is more inspired for the second time. I see why they stole Benedict (Andy Garcia) from the last movie. The film has more motivation for the second time. Twelve of the ocean is entertaining and cooler than 11 years old. With Topher Grace's funny advent, saying, "I just walked in this new Dennis Quaid movie" and in other things. I think the twelve in the ocean are probably the best in the series. <br /> <br /> Plot: One or two years ago, Terry Benedict (the man who was kidnapped by the last movie) returns and says that if the ocean is one to another, he won't pay the money they stole, he calling the police. So Danny Ocean and the gang are going to Europe, where Rusty meets his old police friend Isabelle. When he meets again, he begins to surround them. The gang also says they have an enemy who is also a thief who is a little better than they are. <br /> <br /> With many funny scenes like Tess (Julia Roberts) going to Europe and pretending to be Julia Roberts, the twelve of the ocean is pretty smart. It's cooler, funny and more fun than the ocean.
