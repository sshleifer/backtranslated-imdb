"Let me ask you another question" Ha! what a great soon .. this movie was a great fantastic actor, great script. The only reason why no one noticed that it was a low budget, everyone agrees with me that his cult, like "Donnie Brasco", once again shows young Joe Pesc as a mobile, this film with their cultures. it got some sopranos and some good horse chase got their idea of ​​the soprano when he looked at it, and Scorsese found Joe Pesc while watching it, which proves to be great, right or wrong. I have to admit that they showed one brilliant scene where they threw peanuts through the camp piano player "Stop friggen peanuts".
