From the first to the last scene of the film, the director Visconti stands out in his art, as long as the film is guaranteed only as a cultural treasure, but God knows for how long. It is perfection - as a film, it is, but the story has some minor drawbacks. <br /> <br /> Thomas Mann's novel is also a perfect work of art, so of course it is not possible to bring it to another media. Visconti follows the story quite a lot, and only when he allows himself to deviate a little, does the transition swell. And no matter how wonderful the landscape is, the tension between the characters between the characters, the hundreds of subtle signals and allegories, the almost intolerably elevated serving of Mahler's music - I am still disturbed by minute deviations. <br /> Maybe I'm just a victim of a person without any flaws. Nevertheless, I offer one example, which I consider very important. <br /> <br /> WARNING: SPOILERS <br /> <br /> The Mann's story is eaten by Aschenbach strawberries, which are likely to contain the disease that kills him after he left Russia's disappointed pursuit of Tadzio's boy. He couldn't get one joy, he lives for another that poisoned him. It is very fine in the book, but it does exist. Forbidden fruits, sorted out, but more of a sign that he gives up his life. <br /> <br /> In Visconti's movie, he also eats strawberries, but is quite insignificant on the beach. The chase of Venice ends in a much more melodramatic way. It also works, but it lacks some nuance and multi-layered insights that give thought to food. <br /> <br /> But it's all forgiven if the movie allows us to party beautiful landscapes, faces and constellations, and certainly many other symbols we might digest - Tadzio's last gesture that stood in the water being equally sublime and mysterious.
