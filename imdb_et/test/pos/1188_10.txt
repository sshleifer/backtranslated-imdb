I saw this movie for the first time in theater. I was 10. I looked at it a second time and I have to say it was amazing. Music, dancing, actress. This is a great story and said very well. I fell in love with Treat Williams when I was a boy after seeing in the movie. One of my favorite items was when her mother screamed her to give her pants, and then finally said, "How much do you need?" (money). It was classic. ; ). <br /> <br /> Mothers are the best. If you haven't seen this movie because it came out, I'll say it again. It's timeless. It does all the great movies; laugh, cry and think.
