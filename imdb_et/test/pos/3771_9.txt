This is one of those rare comedies you try, because you can't help but strangle, chortle, guffaw and yes, even laugh out loud. The main actor's performance as Hyde is a pure manic genius. See if you can keep a straight face during your transformation. Success. :) On the back there are times when the film strikes. It seemed longer than 90 minutes.
