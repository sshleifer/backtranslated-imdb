Double Effect is a vampire martial film available in Cantonese with English subtitles. It is Jackie Chan's production and he makes a special appearance for the guests, although it is not for those who wanted the Shanghai Noon / Knights and the other latest Hollywood ticks he has received, this movie is much more special. br /> <br /> This was originally called Vampire Effect, but the very popular Chinese female popduo named The Twins (Charlene Choi and Gillian Chung) took two leading roles, the title becoming cash in their fame. br /> <br /> The film can be attracted to three types of audiences: those who love martial arts films, those who love vampire films and those who devastate Hollywood in general. <br /> <br /> The movie presupposes that vampires are around and the secret society is trying to chase them before we all become undead snacks. This bloody work is done by some martial artists who drink some vampires to give them the edge they need, and that must be thirsty. Things go quite a bit for the course, until a particularly nasty European vamp finds that if it gets all the keys held by the vampire princes, it can move around in the sun and generally eat when it wants. Say more on the plot, damaging watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Gemini consists of one designated vampire (Chung) and another sister (Choi). It's twins who really make a movie; some fresher and more fun acting. The struggle scenes they make are fast and furious and well choreographed, consisting of real athletic and wire work. To add cherry to the cake, the twins are pretty nice to look at. <br /> <br /> The direction is sharp and the script is sharp. There are only three things to let down on this film: vampire make-up is pretty bad, Jackie Chan seems to be in the movie just because of this hell and adds something to its content, and some trying comedy tried a male vampire hunter is pretty flat. Fortunately, the twins save a day that brings the film its originality, which is usually only in European films. My best scene was one of them (Choi), who only interacted with shouting, his ability to convey his thoughts through this medium was comical. <br /> <br /> Their films are in many other touches of originality. I especially liked the coffin with a surround sound stereo and a TV screen! And this is a lot of original touches and action of the movies that stop this tired old flop and make it a movie.
