Watching "Cold Mountain" gave me the impression that his director Anthony Minghella was deliberately trying to cross himself and his own movie "he was trying to win was almost impeccable" English patient since 1996. The assumption is quite similar. a passionate love relationship between two people who have fallen into turbulent wars, and they treat war more or less as a confusion in the background, trying to return to each other's weapons, the primary difference is that Nicole Kidman's character is not married, Jude Law is a deserter, and a conflict is an American Civil War. <br /> <br /> "Cold Mountain" is a story wisely, delicious as saying "English patient" and it is more for people who want a simple love story with some kind of external turbulence that causes the problem. , which is a plus for people with less patience, but it is not as remarkable or original or truly thrilling as the "English patient". LMA hill "is astonishingly love relationship Inmani (Jude Law) and Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) between. Amazingly, their love was the least interesting thing. They have no real relationship; we do not feel the real passion from them and the passion we see is more physical than emotional. I was more interested in the friendship of Nicole Kidman and the Oscar winner Renee Zellwegger, as well as Jude Law's travel across the country, giving up the vigilants and enemy soldiers. Had Minghella increased the importance of a love story, she would have known a better picture. <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie is fun even when the love story is uninteresting. The sequences of domestic warfare are great; these are modern traditions that show war as terrible and dehumanizing. The re-establishment of the St. Petersburg campaign, where tons of explosives were detonated underground and followed by a hand-battle, is terrible. Minghella does not want to show blood and gore in an artistic and sensible way, and she is not afraid to show the victims of innocence and life in these scenes. There are times when women and men are killed, often by crossfire. And there's something else. Just movie sound design creates tension. There's a scene where Inman and the other deserter make themselves eaten by cutting the head of a dead cow. We don't see slicing, but the sound effects of the bone passing through the bone are sick. <br /> <br /> Finally, I must congratulate you on your productions. Jude Law was a terrible and worthy candidate for the Academy Award. I feel that Nicole Kidman deserves it even though her character was a bit low. Renee Zellwegger had the most personal and hidden atmosphere. And then there are those little parts that really work to complete the stylistic world that restores a terrible time in the American past. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the "cold mountain" would have been a better war image, but it would certainly have been remarkable, like the "English Patient" if his love story was activated and Church writers and director Anthony Minghella made it more passionate. As it is, it is the most enjoyable picture, I was not bored and I recommend it. Let me just say that his love story - although it is a central plot point - is a little softer than it should be, and all the things around it were really working.
