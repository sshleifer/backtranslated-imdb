This film has a decisively strange device that takes place in a school that is very old at first, but it doesn't look like any sterile medical environment. Very gothic and atmospheric. As for the film, well, the premise is a bit far, but hey, that's why we watch movies, isn't it? And it is less distant than some of these days garbage, that's for sure. Medical students are experimenting with short-term death because they allow themselves to be briefly dead so that they can experience what life is like. It is somewhat nice, in some cases as long as its parts come with the gym and start living on their land. I didn't see it in the movie years until I got it on the DVD and I have to say I forgot how good it was. And it struck me that Julia Roberts probably looks beautiful in this movie, not like today's actors who are said to be proud, but dressed and made like cheap whores. Ahh, good old days. Anyway, it's a great flick, perhaps not for fundamentalist Christians, but many others can enjoy it. 8 stars out of 10.
