I love this movie, it's great and so funny, Ben is FIT and I wouldn't want to meet her on vacation! I appreciate this movie 10 because of his gr8 and I hope they never do it because it would never be the same. It's funny that Andre looks at six, and he cries to Nicole to "come out and watch six", which makes me always laugh and never get old. Another thing about Nicole looks much older than 14 ... but she's a gr8 actor. But do I need to do something n n 1 is not the name of the song that Nicole and Andre danced at the end? Its really bugging me because I want 2 no what it is because of her nice song!
