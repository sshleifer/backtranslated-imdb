Some time ago I bought a box of Fist of the North Star, which came with all North Star knives, North Star 2 fist, North Star's new fist and North Star movie fist. Though there is an American version and some European versions, they end one and a half times the North Star fist, which is about the same as the movie. <br /> <br /> The series is the successor of Ancient Martial Arts, called Hokuto Shin Ken (North Star's Fist) called Kenshiro or Ken for short. Each generation has only one successor. This happens after an apocalyptic future, where martial art is the most powerful weapon. The two most powerful arts are Hokuto Shin Ken and Nanto's Divine Ken, as my version calls it. Nanto really has several styles, but they are all the same because they allow people to cut someone. Nanto masters are six and each has its own star. Hokuto is an art that allows anyone to hurt / kill or heal anyone, hitting his body point. Every art has its own constellation. Hokuto - Big Ripper, Nanto - Gemini. Kenshiro is going to save the world from evil, consisting of following his two brothers and three Nanto masters and their army. Each military captain has its own way of fighting, which makes each episode different and the number of soldiers bloody. Kenshiro is also looking for his girlfriend Yuri, who was stolen by Nanto's captain Shin. Kenshirot joins his brother Toki after his rescue from his brother Rao, who calls himself Kenou or Boxing King. He was joined by two Nanto masters, Rei, who are looking for their sister who has been taken by Ken's brother Jagi and Shu. Both and Toki are dying along the way. Other characters that join Ken are two children Rin and Batto who don't do much. This is as much as I can get from the time it is so long and full of details. The series is also divided into four parts. <br /> <br /> What makes this exhibition big is fighting. Ken usually rises against a group of people who think they are tough and then kill with a single blow. What is funny and bad, but makes quick struggles. Another big part is comedy / badassness. Ken hits someone and they think it's not something. Ken says they are already dead. Then they die. The other parts are when he hits them and tells them to have a few seconds to live. The counter then appears. Or if he tells them they are not worth knowing their name. Then it is when he makes a quick fire or strikes and goes open and he goes with him. One big part was when a bad man thought he knew Hockut. He went to Ken and hit him. Ken stood there, saying he was dead after a few seconds. The bad guy who was read down then died. It is not limited to Ken, who all kill the same fast. There has never been such an amazing character as ever, and Ken is probably not. <br /> <br /> However, there are some problems. One of them is a repetitive character. Some setbacks, mostly where Yuria is taken, are played too much, too many summaries, especially in the fourth part of the series. In fact, the last episode is the withdrawal of the whole thing. Another problem is the end. The last struggle with Rao was not so impressive. Ken and Rao fought then, etc., until Rao came to some realization and killed himself instead of killing Keni. But it's better than the American and European versions, which just cut off halfway. <br /> <br /> Who would I recommend? It's for older teens and adults who like it. Because styles cause people to blast or cut into pieces, violence is very graphic and there are many, but they don't show much blood because they usually kill a silhouette that looks like a human being. less colorful. This was probably to prevent censorship. If you don't like it, rent an American version. If you like, I say to go to import because you can see all the series, but they don't have the best English translations because it has subtitles in Chinese. Note: My import started with everything I said at first, some imported versions do not, but you still need to import to see all North Star 2 series and fists. subtitles for some reason, then go to the American version. Another note: in the version I got, there were no subtitles on the last disc for the new Star of North Star; although the North Star new fist is not a very good start. <br /> <br /> I'm going to show 8/10 of my big action, good story and pride for Kenshiro. <br /> <br /> **** UPDATE **** <br /> <br /> The animation of Toei published a subtitled version in English. You can also download episodes and Hokuto no Ken 2 from IGN Direct2Drive or view it on the free FUNIMATION site.
