Crushing and wonderful thriller for child psychiatrist, Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez), desperately questioned by two FBI representatives, Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) and Gordon Ramsey (Jake Weber) to use their treatment with Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Ofornio) ), a serum killer who (strange and terrible tactics of torture) finds herself in a cave. What Novak wants to get back from Deane is the location of Stargher's last victim and when he's alive. When Deane gets into Stargher's mind, having an appearance and atmosphere similar to the colorful combination of David Lynch's "Dune" or "Blue Velvet" and Wes Craven's "Nightmare on Elm Street", the adventure begins. Deane sees a variety of odd people, from Carla as a young (divine Jake Thomas) to a person like Freddy Krueger, who has been deprived of the razor's claws. I don't want to end this, but the movie is very big along with the dynamic performance, Howard Shore's creepy musical result and staging (by Tarsem who shows here that he can search).
