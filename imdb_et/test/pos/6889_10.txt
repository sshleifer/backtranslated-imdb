Hey! The best drama is now on the Gospel Music Channel! Go to your website to see the schedule and find out what number your cable or satellite has. It was one of my favorite shows. It has everything I want the TV show to be, a clean family friendly drama that doesn't break me out. A story about a man who, after losing his job, decides to go for a great scenic adventure. Along the way they meet all kinds of interesting people and find themselves in all kinds of trouble. This exhibition was originally spin off in Touch, Angel, another really good family activity. Make sure you've checked it out!
