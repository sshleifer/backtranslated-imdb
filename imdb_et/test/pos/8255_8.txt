I recently bought this movie on a DVD with a discount of less than 5 seats. Although it is on the Geneon label (not just a menu, no special features are triggered), the quality of the picture and sound is very good. The film is based on one of the greatest stories about the biggest bank robbers in history. A charming young man who had spent too much of his few years in prison and now wanted to go straight, but he can't do it! She represents America in England. David Niven plays the leading bad guy, as well as the great charm he is famous for. Bad, but disgraceful, when he refuses Pinky to "kick" his job. Shame, in England, is probably the fair part of the key and not the ball, as in American gangster movies! All the supportive pains do an excellent job that gives a very incredible movie. different characters) without any special effects. NO OR BLOOD. No violence. Not even chasing one car! Just a well written story, well-functioning, well-managed and well captured! If I had any complaints about the film, I'd ask for music. WHAT IS THE BLUZASSAS MUSIC IN A BANKING UNIVERSITY IN England?
