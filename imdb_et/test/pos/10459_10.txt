Just one of the biggest ever made movies. It is worth to sit next to European masterpieces such as the game, the ultimate gateway, nostalgia, ANDREI ROUBLEV, 8 1/2, FIRE, VIRIDIANA, HIGHLIGHTS, LA STRADA, ORDET, JUNE ARC, FOUR THREADS AND MADAME DE ... So blessing. .. and an almost perfect work of art.
