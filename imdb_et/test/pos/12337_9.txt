I saw this movie when it came to the theater. This is definitely one in mind, I had forgotten its title recently. A friend found it through an online search. <br /> <br /> One dark night is unusual for the genre of time / horror as it does not contain blood. It is a variety of teenage fears, but teenagers are honorable on their roads. This is a nice, old school film with reflections of time and scenes. Our hero, for example, is driving a brain bucket with a motorcycle. <br /> <br /> As previous reviewers mentioned, One Dark Night is currently available on DVD. In the case of DVD transfer, the original was not negative. Some reel changes are a bit harsh, but it doesn't take away. This means that the colors are viable and the lighting is very good. <br /> <br /> Adam West plays a rather small part in this movie as RayMar's nephew. Happily, as a lofty and indifferent spouse, the role is short. <br /> <br /> The story is based on the film. Unlike many era horror movies, one dark night is a great stop, giving the viewer time for what's going on. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes of one night of darkness make it memorable. RayMar's telemetric capabilities are used to open the old worlds by pulling out the coffins, opening and moving the corpses. Attention was paid to the final scenes in great detail. The rotten, worn-out dead bodies look quite real.
