If we hadn't seen this movie for a while, we'd been trying it for a long time on a nice DVD. "Le cercle rouge" is a film that owes much to other films, because it reminds us of "Rififa", "Asphalt Jungle", among others, because they all deal with capers that are at the center of the film and reproduce it in great detail. Unfortunately, we know that the old message that crime does not pay, and from the outset, the men who are involved in it, are doomed from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Jean-Pierre Melville was the chairman of a word. He did not fill his pictures with many dialogues like here. While they were not "talkative", they had their own style, such as "Le Dolous", "Le Samurai" and his masterpiece "Bob le flambeur". Mr. Melville had a sense of style that manifested in everything he did. In this film, working with his operator Henri Decae, he leads us along the streets of Paris, showing a lively city, mainly at night and in the dark winter in France. The result is Eric Demarsan, which highlights most of the jazz music that comes with the action. <br /> <br /> Although the film shows Alain Deloni, like Corey, at the heart of action, the smart inspector Mattei is the true hero of the film. As Big Bourvil played, he is a man with a lot of patience because he has understood from the beginning how to catch Vogel, and in this process he is involved in exploring the jewelery where he knows the escaped man he wants big looms behind. Bourvil gives a tremendously satisfying result, as Mattei shows equal parts of determination and tenderness, as it is the case for the three cats she loves. <br /> <br /> Alain Delon always replied with interesting performances with his performances in Mellville. Here he is Corey, the man who first leaves the prison and promises himself not to go back, but he can't do a good thing if he decides to take part in the robbery. His association with Vogel and Jansen pays off how they work, but it is also a mistake as to how they can't loot, because the fence on which they are based has changed in the heart of Gian Maria Volonte and Yves Montand is Vogel and Jansen, respectively. They were great actors who were well suited to the film. Both participants were at their best when they took roles in the film and showed. It is more difficult for Mr Montand to play when we know him at the very first moment in front of the camera than the man with many demons in his head. The film and the team filmed that although they feel a little longer, they still manage to show their style in one of the most memorable pictures of the director.
