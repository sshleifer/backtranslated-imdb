This dinosaur documentary was undoubtedly exciting and very well done. But I found myself watching many bits. The film generally took quite a bit of confidence in what he said and showed, but inevitably a great deal of animal behavior, their interaction with each other, what they saw, how they moved, what they ate, and so on. I think - sometimes guessing with reasonable certainty, sometimes just in nature. But the viewer is never aware of it, the film pretends that he actually monitors the actual dinosaurs and their actual behavior, and so on. This obviously makes for better viewing than for the public in confrontation with the mountains, but it seems to me to be a bit too populist.
