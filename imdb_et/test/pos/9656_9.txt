It is a cute and charming epic fantasy with a lot of heart. I was wrong in this sweet movie, watching it at Mann's Chinese theater in Hollywood. It's a truly romantic message. The work of art and the effects are visually striking and the fact that the director is an amazing artist is so obvious. Frames are like watching mobile art. It also has a strong and talented actor. What a wonderful surprise to see Joss Ackland is just a fairy tale king. Sarah Douglas is terrible when the villain and Christine Taylor and Tom Schultz make a pleasant romantic couple. The fact that the film was made ridiculously from the budget of a small indie film just captures me. It may not be the shiny Hollywood stuff we're flooding with, but it's really a nice movie to rent and enjoy the rain on the sofa on Saturday. Don't forget the microwave popcorn. This is my advice. Just enjoy it.
