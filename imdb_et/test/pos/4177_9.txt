The head should have been a proud moment not only for his monsters (The Monkees and Victor Mature) but also for his director / co-author (Bob Rafelson), but also for his co-author (and short comer) Jack Nicholson. As of now, it seems that most of them look like this, and outsiders are considered to be the best at the curio. <br /> <br /> Although the TV series is based on the famous Beatles' Help! ‚Äù, This film is also rated by the same agreement. But far from the tiny and painfully overestimated Beatles films and even the dated Monkees T.V series, Head has a depth layer. The down stream of man's darker nature is at work here, and although it may seem strange to say about the pop band produced, using certain themes and images (striking a woman, laughing, and Vietcong's real film material) Beating a dead body in a dot-blank range gives the movie to the edge of what many " serious "movies would not dare. <br /> <br /> There are also some fun moments ranging from James Bond parodies to "Big Victor" and my personal favorite, Mickey Dolenz by Arab soldiers on horseback. (One of them turns to Mickey and hisses 'pssst!' to make "pssst!" appear in the subtitles!) The group is aware of the picture they have produced in the movie ("I'm a mannequin, Mickey ?? I" I am always a mannequin ", Tork, who summarizes his role as a one-dimensional foil, which means Their characters? They play "themselves" and act here? They open more and are therefore less general and irritating than the series. This level of parody and self-consciousness even takes its four origins, with the finer players Maharishi and out-and-out honors with the speaker, who asks, "Well, if it's not God's gift for eight years old? Do you still pay tribute to Ringo Starr? Listen to the whistling of Tork on the" Strawberry Fields Forever "in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> Six of them were a little more psychedelic than usual, which might have sold their fanbasses, and even the Frank Zappa site would not have turned the adult audience into their charms at this time. Probably the best of this charming "As we go by", though, the first, Carol King-penned "Porpoise Song", speaks of an interesting desire to live, while the time is significantly removed and death is getting closer. With a lighter note, it seems that this "hacking of hinges" is the direct mickey-key "I'm Walrus." <br /> <br /> Continuously inventive, direct reference to silent film and drug culture, Maybe the best feature of Head is the narrative structure. Not only? but the most important? The reason why it improves with multiple views goes to the left, right, forward, backward, circular, and many levels of reality. Essentially, the sketches hanged loosely, its cohesiveness being tightened by space-time plots hanging on its internal logic with a setback, dream sequence, sensory and remote control changer prison. the perfect start and end, this intelligently written, conscious film was not what the Monkees pre-fiction audience was waiting for and later suffered a negative critical reception. Now these expectations have gone, it needs a serious serious reassessment.
