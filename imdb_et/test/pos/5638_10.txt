This documentary is the most hypnotic film I've ever seen. I have to have it all day. The selected material, contained in a piece, flows amazingly well and develops three characters that are never forgotten. The different layers of these people hatch to make a strange film of determination, loyalty and determination. These characters ended up surprisingly exciting and the film is unforgettable.
