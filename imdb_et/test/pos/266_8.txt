I picked it up from my x DVD collection when he left my best friend (enough to say), watching it for one night if there was nothing on the TV (nothing new) and got a very pleasant surprise. Very British (you have almost no budget, no face you know or have seen before), the accents were a bit thick for me, but after a worrying start (a little too close to home for me) it started to grow on me. In addition to cutting some unnecessary jokes that really did not add anything, I found the movie as very exaggerated, in very real and natural performances for all of me who wanted more of the end that came suddenly too fast. Highly recommended!
