I can't believe how perfect this film is. Great CG graphics, good story and fighting, oh battles !!! This movie was great !! Characters. They look really real. They will definitely resemble the game perfectly. The scene where .... all the scenes made my jaw fall. Fantastic 10/10 Graphics Story. Perfectly explained. In addition to how Aeris can help in many movie times. They explain it very well and make their jaws the perfect thing. But repeated struggles don't let any story, but it's just a little thing. Story 9.5 / 10 Everything Else, Great. The film was just amazing. I really don't know what else to say except that this movie was pretty much perfect. I LOVE IT!!!
