George Carlin is probably my favorite comedian. I've seen so many of her special offers and even had the chance to live her. He had some cynicism that I always liked. His last 2 specials (Life is Worth Losing especially and complaints and complaints) have been missing in a certain spirit and content. George seemed overweight, old and tired (not to mention rehabilitation). "DON'T KNOW IT!" Anyway. Life is worth Losing was particularly tragic because he was overweight, dissatisfied, rehabilitation (there we again ...) and extremely unpleasant. When there was a way to apologize to the comedian without letting him down on stage, George achieved a loss of value in his life. Just like New Millennium and Post 11/11 in America, George's spirit is driving. Bs got too big to drive. <br /> <br /> Returns are partially successful when it is bad for Ya! This particular is transmutation. George is no longer trying to revive his glory days. She fully agrees with her age, being old and dealing with deaths. He has accepted that it is a tough old SOB and is delightful about it. It's better than his previous specials, far from Jammin in New York. It's a little tragic. His observations are no longer top-notch and seem more Andy Rooney than Lenny Bruce. George is no longer George. He doesn't criticize us anymore, but he is a tall man in the castle who points out how things were and what a different modern life is. <br /> <br /> This is an improvement over the two previous features, but George has not yet reused his old prize (if any). He has fallen from critical social and political passionate comments to mostly personal peeves. If he gets political, he has something else to say. It is strongly derived (especially if you have seen some of your previous work), but it does, however, somehow, in contrast to its random beads that have no significance outside the baby boom generation. The last 25 minutes are the best that this special has to offer. <br /> <br /> For now, I am serving the sun and praying to Joe Pesc that George can restore himself as an innovative septuagar. This is a 50/50 chance. Life seems to be quite annoying for George and his "art" is now his life. This is a step in the right direction from your previous 2 special offers, but it is far from his old self. Where's he going from here? He may never get back, but maybe he can change this new ornament old man's routine even further. Heres that we hope for another 7 words that cannot be said on television or at least in a windmill that it can handle.
