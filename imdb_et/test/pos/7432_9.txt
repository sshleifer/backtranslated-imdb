i am an avid ff7 fan, for example i have a game then sell it (bad error) but then buy it again (good mistake ... erm) <br /> <br /> anyway, yes this movie is very good, the struggles are great cool, music very good and cgi what you can't get into. <br /> <br /> The only thing disappointing with the film I felt was the lack of other character, it was almost all the clouds, which is a great character, u cant win a cid and barret. <br /> <br /> But despite the fact that the film was, in my opinion, great and must be viewed. <br /> <br /> A great movie usually gives it 9/10 <br /> <br /> squaresoft, makes more of these movies and worships more than you are already !!!!
