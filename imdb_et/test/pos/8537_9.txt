Oh my God. Of course, if you rent or buy it, you don't expect to see a documentary about small rodent mating habits in their natural habitats. You are waiting for a visual blood and gore party and maybe even fear or two. Well, for those who are so sick and twisted like me, you won't find much fear, but you will start to urinate yourself. The catch phrases in this movie will remain with you and your friends forever. For the first time I showed it to my friends and colleagues over 3 years ago, but still we laugh our asses and use the catch statements. it's as addictive and funny as Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn and Peter Jackson's Dead Alive / Braindead. In the absolutely ridiculous dialogue of the opening scene, the best work of the Splatter and Gore departments, the amazing abilities of the film cutter laugh and laugh again. As for the visual feast of blood and gore, they have received it. And they're pretty damn good ... "The neck bone is connected to the head-bone ..." This film can also be made the best nightmare / hallucination / completely effing nuts. and that does not mean that it would be funny, but the person is well done (and scary.) Generally for anyone who is not against the blood and damn good times if you ever see this movie. it's Netflix, I know it for sure.
