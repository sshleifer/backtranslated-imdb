I can't feel this feeling when I got it around 20 years ago in a VHS tape. Somehow I could rent my father for me and I looked at it twice with my brother. Yes, we have nightmares. The film was originally rated as PG in the US, and in many other countries, including Finland, it was under 18 or 16 years old. The film was aimed at teenagers, but it must be the most important PG-rated film. There's nothing wrong with language or nudity. Originally produced in 1981, it remained on the shelves a few years before the release. <br /> <br /> This is a Class B movie, a true, well-done 80's horror shot. The bunch of college girls decide to spend the night in the mausoleum without knowing that supernatural evil is waiting ... <br /> <br /> You can almost smell the rotten meat and feel the atmosphere of the movie. It's campy, totally stupid, but they just can't do these movies anymore. The genre of 80's fears is definitely certain. It is still very spooky and entertaining after these years. <br /> <br /> The effect is just the quality of Ellis Burman Jr. and Thomas R. Burman. Make-up effects play a big role in this flick, otherwise it would have been just a boring servant. <br /> <br /> It is now available on DVD and is a Special Edition DVD that includes some extras. The journey of comments is interesting. <br /> <br /> (This version is not really so special. Below the average transmission on DVD, some bugs and scratches here and there) At first it came out of the Blue Underground, but unfortunately it was canceled, so Shriek Show released without restoring it without printing. Too bad!) <br /> <br /> Excellent date-film! <br /> <br /> Recommended !!! <br /> <br /> Note! I gave 8 out of 10 "nostalgic values", otherwise 10 out of 10
