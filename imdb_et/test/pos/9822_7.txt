I've read about 10 comments about this movie, but haven't taken them to any "heart". Harrison Ford is criticized for everything from his hairstyle to the earring and I really don't see what any of these things are about in the film. I remember having bad hair plus bad reviews on Blade Runner, but it's still a favorite among us. It's slower than most of his previous movies, but it's not worth what he's got. <br /> <br /> I would be happy to pay $ 7.50 to see the bare Harrison Ford mowing.
