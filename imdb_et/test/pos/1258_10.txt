Kid is a really good family from the film's in-camera consultant Russ Duritz, who has a lot of money, good work, a nice house, etc. The only problem is that he does not have much social life because nobody seems to be like he is not always very nice. One day, though, things start to change when his eight-year version magically appears. This gives Russ the second chance to make things right. Bruce Willis plays a leading role here and gives a very good result. Kid is a nice, warm-hearted film for everyone.
