This is a witty and delightful adaptation of Dr. Seuss's book, which is perfectly animated with UPA's best and profoundly acclaimed Academy awards. Particular mention should be made of excellent music scores and sound effects, which are an integral part of such memorable and enjoyable drawing. Later episodes in the series (four in total) were not originally based on Dr. Seuss' material, although all but the latter still used their familiar rhyme style. The three sequences were: Gerald McBoing Boing Symphony (1953); How to Boing Boing (1954); Gerald McBoing Boing On Planet Moo (1956) - although he also appeared in Mr Magoo's later episode.
