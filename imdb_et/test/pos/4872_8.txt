It's the same thing that made this comic book popular ..... but who complains? It is always nice to see that a bad coyote tries different rhythms to get the Road Runner, and then crushes each of these inventions. <br /> <br /> The underground cave flow was different from the usual price and was smart. It gave us a structure similar to the ground. I didn't say it was fun; it is simply different from the conventional antics from the ground. <br /> <br /> This one of the other short shorts of Road Runner is featured in Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2, and their transmissions are remarkable. The colors are great.
