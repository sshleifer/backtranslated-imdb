I don't know if I could sit through a music comedy from Russia or East Germany or other countries that for decades almost always put a propagandist film, anti-fascism films, anti-war movies (as it is documenting) that just reflected dark, exhausting times under Stalin and life behind the Iron Curtain. Then it is exciting to see that the other side of the coin, clowns with music and rebels, are trying to mass more on their masses than they do in socialist life. One small film seemed quite impressive, namely Jolly Fellows, who is the pioneer of the very small musical filmmakers Grigory Alexander. From this movie (s) I saw that I did that it was one of the only actions that really step out of itself and just go into wild, manic, make-you-laugh modes. But if this film shows that if you are a filmmaker who wants to offer entertainment, then it would be better to have a message. <br /> <br /> Through the interviews, some quasi-dramatizations (Russia / Germany / etc) image association), the censorship table and clips get a complete picture of what it was - both behind the scenes and on the screen - to make the masses entertained . Some movies (well, most of them, as apparently only 14 screened in over 40 years in these countries) made good changes, but for what purpose? At the same time, it is all about the culture, how it differs significantly from the American way, "if it works, make a mother when they are hot". But at the same time, though out of this repression, some interesting, funny and (what I saw) films were made. They might have been quite typical of what they were asked to show to the masses, Stalin's love, but also the demanding conditions, such as life tractors. It is even a more juicy story when we show what was in the 60s, the last wave of musical comedies, because rock and role and pop music eventually hit their waves. <br /> <br /> In short, some good things ... but only if it's interesting. I was shown a movie in the classical film class and half a class high. So warn one hand, though, on the other hand, if you are looking for it, it can make a truly satisfying journey to European film history.
