First of all, when I wrote this comment I had already read what kittiwake-1 wrote about this game and was confused. It's a video game, not a real movie. I mean, I would choose a good Deniro movie or play a video game every day. But the dude, what are you talking about? Now that I have this road, let's go on? Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon video game customization is the same name as the movie you thought. What is strange is that it appeared three years after the release of the film. Whether it's due to slow development or just laziness, nobody really knows. At least, I'm not doing it. <br /> <br /> The game allows the player to play the movie as four main characters: Jen, Shu Lien, Li-Mu-Bi and Dark Cloud (whose story is a secret bonus that has been separated for separate play.) All four of them have fighting styles that based on fighting the film. But the real eye candy is a process of evasion that allows every character to avoid the enemy's attack the most impossible and the level of severity that violates the ways shown for the first time in the film. <br /> <br /> The story is probably a story in the movie. The story of the game is about using CG movies and subtitles in Mandarin (a nice little touch, given that I preferred to duplicate foreign language stories in the movie.) The story goes to what may happen during other films and even (there is no real surprise because all video game movie adaptations has done this) changes the official events in the film so that more action can be taken. I've never thought Jade Fox would go so far as to actually go and get hired goons. <br /> <br /> A real bonus story is the ability to decide how the game ends. What if Jen had all the ingredients to treat Li-Mu-Bi in his possession? What if Jen didn't get his comb back? What if Li-Mu-Bi hadn't received the green fate the second time? Your action will decide the outcome of these scenarios and the fate of the characters in this game. It's really the best feature of the game. <br /> <br /> But for all its strengths, it also shows some bugs. The enemies tend to become unpleasant after a while and the angle of the camera tends to fix to the most unfavorable places. Even those peculiarities (which are unlocked after beating the game) are not good enough to even forgive such difficulties that the player is forced into. <br /> <br /> If you loved the movie, you can enjoy this game. However, this game is the only way you can dive into the playable version of such a beautiful and amazing movie. <br /> <br /> Of course you could just have chosen a Deniro movie.
