It is a threat to every teen comedy to be sophomore and obvious and fair, most of them are. There are few that have risen above the source material of the usual banal (Bring It On, Eurotrip), and they give me hope that others can join this depressively rare teen comedy, which is actually funny and not just an excuse for some asterisks or for some never-Tom Green vehicle. <br /> <br /> Enter Accepted, directed by John Cusack's Prayer by Steve Pink and Leaded by Pleasant Justin Long (a smart nervous child in Galaxy Quest and recently featured in Apple's computer ads), about a number of children who can't be admitted to college and decide as described in the trailer, fake the fake to get your parents back. If they go a little too far with the website and other children, the children have problems to solve. <br /> <br /> Okay, the setting is obviously unpleasant, but most comedies live or die in execution, and here, accepted is not quite good. The long Bartleby Gaines (mostly abbreviated "B") are accompanied by sufficiently well-conceived comically acceptable friends to help him share the burden, but probably the best supportive character of "Dean" in Lewis (undoubtedly named honorable by Rodney Dangerfield Dean) Martin), aka Uncle Ben, Lewis Black, who is wisely limited to short spurts, where he can quickly shoot with his own brand of humor. Black is terrible here, saying frankly to children what life is really pleasing (its split end result is hysterical) and offers an adult face to older fake universities. <br /> <br /> But Long has to wear most of the film, and he does it with a shovel; Bartleby is easily identifiable and we take him almost immediately. A nice twist was given by Columbus Short's character, hands, athlete who loses his scholarship due to injury and eventually becomes a de facto art school of the fake college. It is also remarkable that Bartleby's hyper-intelligent and sarcastic little sister is Hannah Mark. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film seems familiar in some places; here is the indebtedness for all places for Nerds revenge. Those who have been rejected by all others find the home of Bartleby and his cohort, and of course the conformist Master Race type is reinforced with a steroid steroid who is leading the brotherhood (well, ok, frats are evil) and trying to humiliate and bury the odds for this ?? beating? crime. But this aside, accepted is a fun material and even asks some decent questions about the expectations of college kids and higher education. Not that it is a brain teaser in any way, but accepted is not just another pointless teen comedy (or Owen Wilson vehicle). It's funny, smart for 90 minutes, though it's not a big departure from the genre, it's intelligent and creative enough to be very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The film has at least one moment when Bartleby's film controls a nearby college, trying to collect ideas for his school curriculum. When she sees that the children have emphasized the other in school (many refuse to even talk to her when they are afraid of something missing), she shakes her head, thinking that there should be a better way. When he leaves, he meets on the other side when one person moves against the human flow, while in the background there are Eleanor Rigby lines of play. Maybe the shine of the unscheduled shine is a moment, but it does shine.
