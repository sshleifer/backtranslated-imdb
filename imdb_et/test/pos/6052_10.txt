I've seen this movie and anyone who has been with Marines or any other place of employment appreciates the accuracy of this movie. It is mandatory for any collection. Jack Webb does an excellent job as a hard drilling instructor. My father went to Camp Penelton camp and says this film is so accurate that he feels back in basic training. There's a line in the movie where Jack Webbs character can kill a mad flea. Well let me put it in the camp, there is nothing but sandbirds. I've been there and I can evaluate it. In fact, the camp's exit to Las Pulja, which in English means the city of fleas. you need to watch a movie to understand what I'm saying. Anyone in the World War II movies, all battles start here with the Sgt drill. Must be a collection for you
