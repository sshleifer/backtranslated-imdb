This Buffy episode was one of my personal favorites. Also the third of Jossi's personal favorites. There was very little dialogue on the episode and despite the fact that Emmy's good people decided to name it. Unfortunately, it didn't win. When Hush first appeared, he received about 6 million viewers, the highest rated episode of the fourth season. It should tell you something. Although speaking was very small, he managed to intrigue people enough. These gentlemen (who played my mimes) were some of the most frightening creatures that the show has brought (or any online TV I've seen). Nothing slippery, a bunch of silver teeth coming with you with a scalpel smile. I think, despite the lack of dialogue, the participants did a fantastic job in the episode.
