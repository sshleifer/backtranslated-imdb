I just stopped watching it (last weekend) and found it was totally tough, with some scenes that I just couldn't laugh at! Sometimes Dennis is amazingly thick and just tells the most common things ... but at the same time he is just kind enough to impress his girlfriend (who will be arrested anyway!) The beach landscape is very peaceful ... until Robbie Coltrane goes along ...! Never made the biggest movie, but definitely something to think about renting on a Saturday night if you don't have much more to do (as I did). You may need to hunt for it - I was happy because my local video store is busy with it.
