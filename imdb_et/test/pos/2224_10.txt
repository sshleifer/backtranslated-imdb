This is one of Peter Sellers' best films. Why is it never shown on television or in the cinema? Will it ever be released as a home video? Is it too bad for the medical industry? I'd like to see this movie again. I would like my son, a doctor, to see it. Laughter is the best medicine and Peter Sellers is the best doctor for that.
