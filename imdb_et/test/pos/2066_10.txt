This is definitely a movie for people who just want entertainment and don't think about their movies. <br /> <br /> Lots of activities, lots of great dialogue (like a fun quote), a little intrigue and things that are all over the place. Samuel L Jackson and Geena Davis had great chemistry. Violent, but not pointless. The fact that the female part was a competent leader is a pleasant turning point. 3 or 4 months. For the first time, I rented this movie because Samuel L Jackson was in the movie, but returned to Samantha's quest for his memory and never looked back. Stop disbelief once, take yourself a little less seriously - you might really enjoy!
