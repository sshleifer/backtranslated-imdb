Some of the reviewers here have foolishly evaluated this silent film with today's standards of political correctness. <br /> <br /> "Battle" was a great movie for a number of reasons, which were more rational for more rational reviewers: Superb cast, lots of action, innovative editing and photography. <br /> <br /> Its letters were actually D.W. Griffith, a public limited company and fan of this silent film, is an incentive to watch and enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I saw it several years ago and looked at it again on YouTube; it was a very poor quality print, but with my memory of a good print in a real theater, I can rightly recommend it to sensible people and film historians.
