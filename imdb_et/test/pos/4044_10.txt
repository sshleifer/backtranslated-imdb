I thought the film started off a little slowly and opened in the first hour. But in the last two hours it became more absorbing, exciting and surprising. So, although it starts as a cheap horror movie, it becomes a beautiful and wonderful fantasy movie. <br /> <br /> Bridget Fonda stands out as a queen. It was his best result and it is sad that it was probably his last performance because he has not been in the past 7 years. It is winter all winter and cold. <br /> <br /> My daughter, aged 14, found the film a little scary, so if you show it as family entertainment, stay with your child and assure her or her that it's just a fairytale fantasy and not too serious. <br /> <br /> This is really one of the best fantasy films I've seen for a long time, a little better than "Eragon" or "Lord of the Rings". It's about as good as the "Golden Compass".
