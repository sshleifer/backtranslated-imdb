"In the Fire of Fire" talks about the game between the old president's bodyguard and the former government assassin. The secret service / bodyguard (Eastwood) is on defense and the assassin (Malkovich) is offended. Stakes? The President lives. <br /> <br /> I like this movie ... I saw it several times on television and recently bought it on a DVD. But it's not a great movie. The plot is too thin and attempts to thicken are ridiculous. The whole love story is not very plausible and the way they further described the story, just to kill it, is offensive to an almost intelligent viewer. Although I feel that these mistakes cannot be forgiven, I can easily look at these Malkovich's subtle execution. I've always considered him a great actor, but in this movie he's really a fire. There is a reason why he received the Academy Award nominee. Rene Russo and Clint Eastwood were okay, but I don't think their performance is memorable. They are never the best of their abilities. <br /> <br /> If you don't expect too much, this movie will definitely like it. It's not a masterpiece, but John Malkovich is really extraordinary and I don't think anyone can enjoy their activities. Really worth checking out ...
