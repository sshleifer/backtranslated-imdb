I liked this couple of reasons. Emotional confusion was sometimes confusing and imperfectly solved, but the mixture of newspaper footage and film narrative was often convincing. The second element I appreciated was the portrayal of werewolves, fanatical Nazis, who continued fighting after the official handover. I don't know the other movie that deals with them. For example, they murdered, for example, the Aachen Burgomaster Oppenhoff on Sunday, 1945, and made problems for the occupation. The film then challenges the disinfected version of victory and occupation with some sharp realities. "Human issues" are not presented through the local characters, but through the historical reality that captured Hitler's survivors - both conquered and winners.
