Although I'm a little older than the recommended age group, I really enjoyed this movie. It is a bit of a break from reality and it must be every little girl who dreams of becoming a friend with a pop star. I know it was for me! The first 10 minutes were really cheesy and middle girls said some things that were also a bit cheesy. Once you get over it, you can really enjoy it. I loved the relationship between JD and Jane - it was really lovely and you saw how much they started to love each other. The soundtrack is perfect and really fits the movie. I also liked the family for Jane, her sisters felt cute. Very well made film.
