If I only saw the sister Betty's poster, I would probably not have it on ten feet. But after I heard some positive buzz and knew it made a noise in Cannes, I decided to try it. What I got is a really enjoyable movie based on a very fun plot. Rene Zelleweger is an impressive sister of Betty, a woman who is sent to a delusional psychotic episode after a traumatic experience. I also liked Morgan Freeman (no surprise) and he was surprised by the comedian Chris Rock. <br /> <br /> The film is constantly knocking between comedy, drama, romance and thriller. Despite this obvious crisis of identity, it can withstand quite well. I found my eyes glued from start to finish, always waiting for the story of the next twist. The whole cast is strong, if not remarkable. My only real complaint is that director Neil Labute (who made a few years ago with speculation in a very impressive and dark In Men Company) relied too much on many of the clich√©s of the Hollywood Convention. The moods created by the musical effects he created in all sentimental scenes were intolerable! And he made a standard old "take some small characters and tie them at the end to an illogical and unnecessary romance" to make sure everyone is all smiling with their smile. Why do directors and writers have to treat their audience like idiots? <br /> <br /> But the movie is still too enjoyable to pull these annoying excitement very far. In a great movie, "Nurse Betty" is one of the most pleasant surprises in 2000.
