This mostly routine fact-based TV show gets Cole's excellent performance boost. This is a story of a highly educated soldier who is not satisfied with his wife and children, fools his death and runs off with another woman. To support him in the way he is used to, he robs the banks. Predictable, but not bad to look at.
