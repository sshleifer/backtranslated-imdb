After the successful success of MY NAME IS BARBRA, CBS television promised Barbra to create even more complicated follow-up measures than her second special. Streisand knowingly knew that for the success of MY NAME IS BARBRA he really needed to raise the bar even more in inventiveness and spectacle. Not surprisingly, he got it again. Even more impressive, Streisand managed to produce this big production without sacrificing the intimacy and vision of my NAME IS BARBRA. <br /> <br /> Once again, the special is divided into three separate laws. Filming at the Bergdorf Goodman department store was so successful in the first special way that Streisand and the company decided on the second law for the first law. The location that was decided was this time the Philadelphia Art Museum, which would allow Barbra to "infuse" various works of art that correspond to the songs being performed. In addition to the numerous artistic opportunities that this location has allowed, the museum would offer an ideal opportunity to use colorful filming. <br /> <br /> After "Draw Me Around", which is accepted as a credit, Barbra then crawls around the museum as a girl's costume for Kern and Harbach's "Yesterdays" strains. He ends up admiring the different lands and shapes, often changing the character depicted and singing a thematically appropriate song. Streisand performs the "One Kiss" bittersweet of Hammerstein and Romberg when Thomas Eakin CONCERT SINGER offers Chopin's "Minute Waltz" fun-filled performance, like Marie Antoinette, includes abstract art by Peter Matz's "Gotta Move" and rhythm. performs "Non C'est Rien", a disappointed Modigliani girl. The highest point of Law I, however, is when Streisand compares the profiles with the bust sculpture of Queen Nefertit of Egypt, while singing "Where or When" by Rogers and Hart. The Circus Field II of the Act allows Streisand to communicate with various farm and circus animals, singing different songs on farm / circus / animal themes. Some of the highlighted places are Barbra's singing "Was it a special face" for a baby's elephant who "has grown accustomed to this face" as a serenade piglet, campy "Sam, you made pants long", the group sang baby penguins and Barbra compares the profiles with the anchor, at the same time if "we have so much in common." Streisand also swings on the trapezoid and jumps from the trampoline to Spring Spring and then slows things down, doing "I Stayed Too Long at the Fair" when I was sitting alone on the stage. Barbra also gets the chance to show her pet bottle of Sadie in this segment and even speak a little French. <br /> <br /> The Act III concert is back in an hour. A concert segment dressed in a white wool dress is performed in a uniquely designed stage where a partial staircase does not lead anywhere. Streisand opens the law with Harold Arlen's "Anyplace I Hang My Hat Is Home" before you start a hearty version of the familiar standard "It was for you" and rarely heard "C Si Si Bon" So Good. "Streisand then astonishes the audience with amazing power , the Octave-jumping Sweet Charity Ballad "Where I'm Going", which Streisand is offering for a final transfer, Streisand also introduces the newly written Richard Maltby, Jr.-David Shire Ballad "Start Here, Starting Now", which includes a surprised vowel of Streisand, which is He is among the best songs in his long career. <br /> Color Me Barbra was more than anything more than Streisand's ever-growing mega-watts of star power. Despite the more visual glare, Streisand himself is always the main attraction. Ever before, and this special was the first one to show you how brightly his colors are shooting, as well as my name is BARBRA, COLOR ME BARBRA had another route ingu-crack and got the new Top-Five, Gold-sale soundtrack album. Simply put, the COLOR ME BARBRA violates the tradition and arises as a stage that is almost equal to the classical original.
