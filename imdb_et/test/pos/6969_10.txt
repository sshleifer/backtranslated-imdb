Ghoulies IV may not be the best in the series, but it's not too bad if you don't take it seriously, so you can enjoy it. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see Peter Liapis return to Johnathan Graves, who has given up magic and has become a detective but still thinks what happened in Ghoulies. <br /> <br /> The plot is about a woman named Alexandra, a former Johnatan girlfriend who breaks the museum and takes a red pearl using a pearl, she awakens her boyfriend Faust, which is Johnatan's dark side, but she needs a pearl so that he can enter the real world and John is sent to hell. <br /> <br /> Something goes wrong and Alex loses the pearl so he has to find a new one because he leaves the gate open and two little Ghoulies named Lite and Drak. They are not real Ghoulies because they look like boys in a Troll costume with a mask, but that doesn't matter, because they are humorous in some parts. <br /> <br /> Lite and Dark must find Johnatan because he can return them to their home so they can cause chaos when they try to find Johnatan. The other difference is that two Ghoulies are good guys, unlike the previous ones. <br /> <br /> I found Ghoulies IV to be good, but this movie may not go to everyone, see if you want low budget movies like Troll 2.
