This is one of Stan Laurel's best solo comedies, before joining 1927 with Oliver Hardy. Laurel is a very good actor in the film and offers good comedy. The best scene of the film is when Stan dances with Mae Laurel (his normal life spouse) Cafe Espanol. Stan is doing stupid dances that are funny without listening to music. I recommend it to every Stan Laurel fan.
