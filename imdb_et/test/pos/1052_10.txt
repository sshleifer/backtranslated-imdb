"Christmas in Connecticut" is an absolute pearl and is a must for Christmas! Elizabeth Lane, the predecessor of Martha Stewart, is a columnist of the magazine, and plus plus ultra homemakers - a perfect woman, mother, and home goddess. The only thing is that he is not one of these things - a complete fake. Unfortunately he is already known. His publisher Alexander Yardley (Shining Comic Book, Sydney Greenstreet) gets a bright idea to invite the famous war hero Elizabeth's "perfect farm" for Christmas. The only thing is not farm, "perfect" or otherwise. Comedy involves how Elizabeth has to pack her real identity so she doesn't lose her job. Elizabeth's colleague John has a farm in Connecticut, so this problem will be solved. But she wants to get married to Liz, but she doesn't want to marry her. She offers her marriage, although she knows she doesn't know her in the same way she does to her. He makes a bid anyway and assures him he's ready to wait. And here is Barbara Stanwyck, like Liz, one of the most devastating hopes I've ever heard. In the case of perfect innocence, he replies, "Can you wait so long?" OUCH! In addition, Una O'Conner and S.Z. Sakall is fun. They don't seem to like each other (although they are suspected to do). They are competitors in the household and S.Z. Sakall's mangled English is equivalent to Nora's worship of his name's pronunciation ("Mr. Basternook"). "My name is FELIX!" Amazingly, these black and white movies are Christmas. Excellent work by all participants. Don't miss it!
