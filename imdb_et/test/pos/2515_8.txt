In 1937, Darryl Zanuck, who recently moved from a Warner Brothers production manager, caught his newly-founded company from the ground of 20th Century Fox and on equal terms with his old bosses at Warners and the glittering palace of MGM. . "It's my affair" was an attempt to cash in on the current success of historic films at the turn of the century ("San Francisco" in old Chicago), and retrospectively managed to be quite powerful. The plot is exciting. President McKinley gave a mysterious task to expose a bank of robbers that paralyze American finance, and that is a heroic naval officer (Robert Taylor). He finds a gang but falls in love with his female mascot (Barbara Stanwyck) and has to decide between love and duty. <br /> <br /> Not all of this vintage movie works well, but generally it's a good studio movie. Kurt Vonnegut would borrow a plot trick for "Mother's Evening" (the leading role of this film was played by Nick Nolte) and seems to be quite plausible, at least within the studio's beliefs. As a fan of old movies, I am always happy when I stumble upon one that I have never seen and "It's my thing" was no exception.
