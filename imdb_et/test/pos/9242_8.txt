I watched this movie at the Dallas Magnolia Theater a few days ago. Punk! Everyone and everyone involved in the film added it to the puncture. Music, of course. But the film itself hit the whole puncture. Even grandmother and school teacher (self) can appreciate artists who can turn their ideas into reality (well, reality, film). This film takes a handful of invited young filmmakers and clearly and wisely explains why their angst "why" is the green light when finishing the Waldo movie. A (relatively) happy girl gave a good comic relief, a nice breath of a constant (but understandable) guy who continued these fears. I have to love Stut. And be sure to watch / read the credit - they are icing on the cake!
