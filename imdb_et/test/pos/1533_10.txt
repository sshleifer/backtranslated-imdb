I'm deeply grateful for seeing this movie. The action is amazing, the film itself is powerful and clear, and the issues are discussed with fineness and depth. <br /> <br /> This is an important film. It can be thoroughly transformative. <br /> <br /> I'd ever pay good money to see it again. Because it's * so good and complicated, it's hard to see it. I admit that the taste of my films is heavily inclined towards light entertainment; the visual medium can be so powerful that I tend to avoid it. Those with more certainty than I have can be easier to handle. <br /> <br /> But I encourage people to see it at least once. Preferably with others, so you can talk to each other and remind someone that the world is more than a movie.
