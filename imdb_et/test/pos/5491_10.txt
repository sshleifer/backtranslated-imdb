I've seen quite a few behaviors in my life and this is clearly one of the best ever! There are very few movies I watch many times, and that is one of them. Everything in this movie is just right: Clint is a great leading actor, Rene Russo as her non-stupid female partner (this is a very rare combination - sad but true!). Of course, John Malkowich deserves a lot of praise for his great villain, but let's not forget Eastwood's first friend, played by Dylan Mcdermott, who I think fits perfectly with his role. original soundtrack CD (shame producers!). The plot makes sense and the pace is not lost, the audience is constantly excited about the results of the duel between Eastwood and Malkowich. I'll give it 10 stars!
