<br /> <br /> An average adventure movie that took a serious story and "Holywoodized" it.The effect of soldering, made especially in the middle of the script, removed this film spot as it would be a sure classic. Why spend such a large line? Probably because it deals with "sensitive" colonial issues and manufacturers do not want to create political warmth, just a quick profit. Diverting, cinematography and soundtrack and acting were good. The charm of Connery, which was made with her false Arab accent and with all the scenes of President T. Roosevelt, was a masterpiece. Costumes / kits were very good here. Bad bad that we didn't get any more serious historical drama because it is what the story requires. Only for fans of big exotic Romance / Adventure Tree Holywood fans .....
