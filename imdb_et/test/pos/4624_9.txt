2:37 is an intense and exciting drama that has some similarities to tones and themes in movies like Bully, Elephant and Kids (although I think 2:37 is a better film for these three). my expectations were neutral, but I got a very good impression thanks to the intelligent scenario, the perfect direction of Mural K. Thalluri and the great performances of young actors. <br /> <br /> Occasionally, school violence around the world has inspired many movies, TV shows, and books that pretend to find and predict the causes of their external or internal causes of insurrection, dissatisfaction ... and especially madness. Some people may say that 2:37 is too late for this artistic movement; but I do not think so because this delay allowed the film to make a more artistic analysis, focusing more on the situation with fineness and intelligence, rather than the obvious reaction of cruelty and harassment that impregnated other movies with similar stories. /> <br /> 2: 37 characters are found in clich√©s from young cinema (director and scriptwriter John Hughes-RIP movies for teen horror films): beautiful "princess", clumsy "nerd", antipathetic athletes, etc. It would have been very easy for them to be transformed into hollow cartoons defined by their scenario function; but it is something admirable that the scenario goes beyond stereotypes to make them real people with credible problems that, to a greater or lesser extent, find their way to maturity. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is a great movie whose only failure is that the end is somewhat affected, but it compensates for it with many positive elements. It's very interesting to see Thalluri's next projects because he's on this movie very debut.
