Mr. Bean has always been my favorite. Not matte, how many times you look at the same thing, it never shows monotonous or repetitive. Mr. Bean is one of the world's largest comedians, who doesn't even have to talk to make people laugh. His gestures, facial expressions and the face himself are so funny to look at. The situations she faces in the show are just fun and the way she handles them is even greater. There is simply no reason why this exhibition should not get 10 because it is fabulous. This is something that would be even the most serious or sad in the universe to laugh. Some of my favorite episodes of all time are as follows: 1) When Mr. Bean presents a hotel 2) That's where he looks at the scary movie 3) Think about a child (especially a diaper scene). In fact, all episodes are so good that it is very difficult to criticize the exhibition. Mr.Bean can go to any height to prove he is funny, including completely removing himself from one of the episodes. the way he dealt with this situation was just a blush of mind. 10 out of 10
