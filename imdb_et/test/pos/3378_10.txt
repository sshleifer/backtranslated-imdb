I just want to say that Chris Diamantopoulos's role in the Williamsina exhibition was worthy of Emmy. It was a surprise how well he did. And so Robin Williams is so quick and casual and creative ... WOW. There were scenes where Diamantopoulos was supposed to say 20 fast lines and make 15 different characters, offering these features, while it sounds as much as ROBIN WILLIAMS, who makes these characters ... well so my friends are impressive. This is one thing to do for Robin Williams for a few minutes. This is another thing to do for a whole TV movie. <br /> <br /> I don't know how I felt about the whole show, and I don't know how much they played, but I know Chris Diamantopoulos stayed with me. So I give HIM 10.
