SUPERMAN Cartoon. <br /> <br /> When America unlocks its colonial new bomber, Japan's spy and sabotage elite force, JAPOTEURS, hits. Stealing Breathtaking, Convincing Girl Reporter Lois Lane aboard and targeting Tokyo or destroying, is Superman's time to participate ... <br /> <br /> It was another great caricature that was originally created for Max Fleischer Paramount Studio. They have great animation and tense, fast moving plots. It is thought that they will be shown in cinemas, they will be in front of miles on their Saturday morning. Bud Collyer is the voice of Superman; Joan Alexander respects Lois Lane.
