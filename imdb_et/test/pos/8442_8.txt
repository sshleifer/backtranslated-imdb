Release of this film as a hyperbole was easy during its release. Fonda, Douglas, and Lemmon were known as "lefties," but the accident at three Mle Icelands gave this fictional drama a shocking context. <br /> <br /> This movie works on several levels, taking both public utilities and TV news. 1979 was the genius of the notorious "Happy Talk" format for television news (see also "Ron Burgundy") and it is here with all its glory. The high anchor grimly reads the story of "grinding head-to-head" before cheerfully introducing Kimberley Wells (Fonda), making a story of a veterinarian doing the house (or "aquarium"). The producer and station manager of the exhibition claim that the content or lack thereof is behind the scenes. <br /> <br /> There are some technical errors. The PR flack (James Hampton) shows that Fonda and Douglas are a model of the required scale for pressurized water reactors built by Westinghouse. Later, when Lemmon and Wilford Brimley (nicely playing Lemmon's friend / colleague who have been caught between work and loyalty) are struggling with a sudden crisis in the factory's control room, they have a clearly boiling water plant (built by GE.) A small point, but curious, how much detail the scriptwriters are right about. <br /> <br /> Like any good drama, the film asks more questions than answers. TMI's real accident proves the film's main premise. The title of the film's work was originally "Power" and you see why. Since nuclear power is preparing to return these days for $ 3, China's syndrome is as important today as 25 years ago.
