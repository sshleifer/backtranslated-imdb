This movie is an exciting drama about making a movie. Actress and actor can't stand each other, but we're building a scene where they have sex - for the first time on the script. The actor has little emotion on the plot camera or camera, besides freezing it on the beach at first. The actor is in itself absorbed and is increasingly breaking the direction of Director Jeanne. I couldn't help how to drive these two dramas, how could these two make their way through their sexual scene? This drama in itself becomes more exciting than the actual nudity and foreplay of the cameras. Not that Roxane Mesquida is not cute and naked! However, there is a pretty young director who adds a scene. I think it is on the left side of one IMDb image (2/9). I don't even know if this girl is credited, but if she walks (of course dressed) in a firm indifference to her short blondes - SHE is sexy! Who is this girl?
