I cannot stand for people who comment on this program or other HBO programs "too graphically" or "unnecessarily graphically" or that they contain "free nudity / violence / sodomy, etc.". Prison is not PG-13. "Essential" graphic content with this situation is TRUE. Prison has been imprisoned for rape / killing / drug offers and showers. If you don't like it, don't look at the program. I am certainly not a fan of prison rape, but if it was left out of the show, I would be surprised and lend less to the exhibition. If the prisoners were not cursed, it would simply be silly. Of course it's free, but it's REALISTIC. <br /> <br /> The exhibition is good, some viewers .... not so much, I think.
