From any category, it is one of the most demented and over-edge, even in today's standards. The movie is filmed completely in crap-o-ramas, it captures your mind (and something else!). <br /> <br /> Fun is a bad taste and slippery. Dialogue is amazingly fast and combative. You love or hate this movie, but you pass it on. I've seen it 4 times and love it. Divine is trying to be the poorest person in life, but also his competitors in this embarrassing and nasty (but funny) and stylish little movie. The divine was phenomenal, and "he" always misses very much. Edith Massey makes unforgettable results like "egglady" and don't forget energetic Mink Stole! <br /> <br /> Above the crazy s ** t! <br /> <br /> Also recommended for your sick little puppies; <br /> <br /> Woman's Trouble <br /> <br /> Living Desperate <br /> <br /> Polyester
