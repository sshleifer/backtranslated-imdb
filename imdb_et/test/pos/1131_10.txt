I have to say that I think the Greek in the exhibition would be really ridiculous and stupid. Since I'm part of a corporation, I didn't want them to make Greek organizations bad ... <br /> <br /> But I think Greece is fun. Yes, they have a stereotypical corporation and fraternity, but it is not mocking, but just cute humor. <br /> <br /> All the characters are quite like minus Rebecca Logan (I just can't stand it), Casey and Rusty are good chemistry as brother and sister. Then there is Cappie. Who doesn't love a man like Cappie haha ​​His character shows so much. Rusty room mate, Dale, played by Clark Duke, is also fun. <br /> <br /> It's definitely fun to watch both season 2 season. I can't wait until it's back!
