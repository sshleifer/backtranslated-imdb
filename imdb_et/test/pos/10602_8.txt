When I first heard about this movie, I was very interested. The plot seemed fun and Bam Margera acted as a good actor and director. When I found a movie starring Ryan Dunn, I was even more interesting (I was a fan of Homewrecker when it was ... Yes, I'm flat). But I didn't have much faith to be good. When I started watching it, I was afraid I was wasting my time. <br /> <br /> But even just five minutes it became clear that I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I thought the comedy of this movie was pleasantly idiotic and certainly not suitable for all kinds of people. Operation was pretty good, much better than my expectations. I thought it was quite easy to associate with Ryan's character, which gave the film an incredible center. This is the key in the movie when it is terrible (and is probably why I was not a Borat fan). <br /> <br /> The film does not fit the young, DUH at all, and will definitely create more than just a fair share of the uncomfortable turtle, if followed by parents. But it's good for you and your friends on the film night.
