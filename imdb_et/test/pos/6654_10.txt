"How can a name, not even a real name, break its heart?" Here's how. There have been few film formats of the remarkable novel when their source material is better justified than Anthony Minghella's Charles Frazieri Cold Mountain film. Once you have read the book, you will feel that most of the main scenes that are breathing again. Reading the novel, I read several times personally and spent a lot of night watching the film through tears. Amazing scope, beautiful words, great acting and great music. In Minghella's conversation on DVD, the story tells of several layers. They all work. One of the best films I've seen and an invitation to one of the greatest novels of the last ten years.
