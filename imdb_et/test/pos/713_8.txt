An interesting and involved film about the "lifeguard" who just tries to live his days peacefully. Key elements appear in Michael Mann's later films, such as Thief (1981), Heat (1995) and so on. This can be seen in the UCLA Reference Laboratory - one of the only places in the country that has easy-to-access copies for the public. It's great!
