Never Say Never and Thunderball there are many similarities not only to Sean Connery, but also to story and plot. Except actresses all others are the same as hijacking atomic bombs, asking for ransom, trafficking kernels on board etc. the only difference is the appearance of a thunder ball on a plot that has never been told in the Bahamas that it is over North Africa. And suddenly, NATO / RAF itself puts the kernels on the airplane, and never saying it will never change the "Ax Rouge Hand" and the air dropped across the US and the Caribbean Caribbean. Almost 99% are the same. If someone wants to challenge it, they are very welcome.
