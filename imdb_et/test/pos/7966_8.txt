At the end of his career, Jack Arnold, a very effective director, gave us such classic 50 creature functions as "It came from the outer space", "Nature from the black lagoon" and "Tarantula", along with the former football star, changed Fred's "Hammer" 70's blaxploitation film head Williamson's pair of films, producing a friendly, unremarkable Western "The Black Bounty Hunter" and this refreshing, windy, smart and very fun 70s black race version of its 40th ordinary movie noir private detective yarn down. <br /> <br /> Williamson has a charming combination of dry, self-emissive humor and relaxed, mild self-confidence like Shep Stone, an inexpensive, friendly and forever debt erstwhile Los Angeles police officer turned into a private detective. Stone has such hard money that it uses its business bar and just makes ends meet, making penny-ante low-paying small incidents that the police don't want to disturb. With the same deceptively simple concert walking on the sidewalk (Stone is trying to find some boyfriend who hides somewhere in Hollywood), Stone finds that he is in the elbow deep in a complex, dangerous, seemingly bottomless criminal case that contains inverted Jesus in a foolish religious cult, assorted dead hippie deaf, cute porn ring, an invaluable lost gold bullion rum that belonged to the legendary silent movie star, an unpleasant underground drug trafficking operation, and an ever-increasing number of fresh corpses. > <br /> Although Robert Altman's masterful "The Long Goodbye" or Arthur Penni's "Night Moves" strange, unobtrusive ingenuity is lacking in the "Black Eye" is still highly regarded as a successful hip'n'flip 70-nd spin 40- mysterious temporary thrillers. Arnold's capable direction keeps the pace moving with a nice, steady clip, with random exciting my-a-my empty fingers fighting scenes, and great use of colorful LA-places (the abandoned amusement park that has been portrayed at the end of the movie is especially effective). The manuscript by Mark Haggard and Jim Martin provides a lot of quite complicated and often really surprising plot twists. And the anticipated number of twilight, rough edges around the edges is an interesting joke, especially Rosemary Forsyth's attractive, powerful lesbian model agency owner (Forsyth has the best line of image worshiping Stone when he met him for the first time: "I'm a lot of women "), Teresa Graves," Get Christie Love "TV Show was a member of Stone's loyal bisexual girlfriend (a casual, non-judgmental portrayal of both the Fortii's unusual femme fatale and Graves) Friday is one of its strongest assets) and Bret Morrison, who made a "Shadow" voice in the 40s as a quiet, lame porn filmmaker, all in all, a modest but firm winner.
