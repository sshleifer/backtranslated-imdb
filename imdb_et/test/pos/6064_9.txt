This is one of the best non-English series I've seen. This creates interesting one-and two-fold crime solving episodes with a personal aspect that you just can't get into the CSI. Everyone has a personal life that fits well in their day and sometimes interferes. In addition, all characters can naturally evolve throughout the episode. <br /> <br /> Casting is great and has been taped all over Denmark, giving a good example of the majestic majestic countries. Unfortunately, only 32 episodes were made, but they are top-notch TV. We hope they will weigh another episode with the same caliber.
