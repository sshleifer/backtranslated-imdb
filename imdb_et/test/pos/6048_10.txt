In today's standards, DI may seem little. The Lee Emery version is more accurate. In 1964, I finished the boot camp on the island of Parris, SC. Jim Moore is as close to real things as you could in 1957. I can't comment on the plot, but I thought the end was unrealistic for MCRD. BAT Owens is like many who found themselves in a much more difficult situation than they wanted. Like many, he joined the Marine Corps for all the wrong reasons. My drill intruders were more like GySgt Hartman than TSgt Jim Moore. Much more. DI is more Korean era and Full Metal Jacket is Vietnamese era. Today's movies allow you to see such a thing on the screen. I have a DI in my collection. I just found it on DVD recently.
