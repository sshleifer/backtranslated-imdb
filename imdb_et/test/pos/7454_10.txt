"Duckman" is a great show. I saw it for the first time when I was 10 years old and after school I went home and in the middle of comedy. I saw a drawing called "Duckman" and I loved it !! It's a funny and cool show. It's created by Klasky-Csupo, who are great cartoons. They animated some of my favorite shows, such as "The Simpsons" and "Rugrats". <br /> <br /> I have seen many episodes of this show and I think they're all really funny and sweet. Voice actors also did an excellent job of giving signs as well. <br /> <br /> I want Comedy Central to show this show with "The Critic" and "Dilbert". <br /> <br /> But this is a great comedy show. Great work, Klasky-Csupo!
