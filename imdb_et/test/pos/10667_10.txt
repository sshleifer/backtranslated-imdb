If you are a student of the film or you are one or thinking of becoming one, then Battleship Potemkin has a name or resonance. Sergei Eistenstein, like other silent pioneers like Griffith (although Eisenstein's innovations are not as common as Griffith) and Murnau, has naturally made such an impact forever in cinema history. The reason I increase the proportion of students in the film is that, at some point, whether you want to or not, the film's professor shows 9 times "Odessa Stairs". It is difficult to say whether it is even the "best" part of the film about the (temporal) times of the Russian Revolution. However, this has the greatest impact and can be seen in many films showing temporary or simple assembly (The Untouchables climax). <br /> <br /> Montage, which was not only Eisenstein's skill, but also the blood of her life at the beginning of her career, is often abused in the current cinema or, if not abused, in an inappropriate context. Sometimes the assembly is now simply used as another device from point A to point B. Montage was something else for Eisenstein; He tried to communicate in the most direct way so that he could get the urgency, the passion (s) and the final tragedies that were in the Russian people at the time and place. Even if you don't see all of Eisenstein's narrative or traditional "story" ideas to have a lot of land (Kubrick has said that), one cannot deny that the ships arriving at the port, the people on the stairs, and the soldiers who come to them every time , with weapons. Some may find it hard to believe that this happened in the 1920s; this power is like Joan of Arc's passion to overcome his time and remain important only when it comes to technology and emotion. <br /> <br /> Of course, you could go for books (hundreds of times written by Eisenstein, which is the least. Battleship Potemkin is a film and a dramatic rather than a specific story in the film. The first segment is also one of the biggest films. It is almost manipulative, but somehow very effective, assembly is used here, but with eye-catching energy rivers. At other times, Eisenstein has more content to just let the pictures speak for themselves, soldiers are tired without food and water, he is not one of the directors trying to get the story all over, he is, of course, very Russian at the beginning of the 20th century, but he is nothing but honest about how he sees his themes and style, and it will eventually win. <br /> <br /> Some may want to check it out outside the film school, because the "Stairs" order is like one n the landmarks of the great tragedies of films, showing the stupid side of the revolution. Eisenstein may not be one of the "more accessible" silent film directors, but if assembly, frame details, non-actors, and Bolshevik themes are your cup, it's really one of life's visions.
