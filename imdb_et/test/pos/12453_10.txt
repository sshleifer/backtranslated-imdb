I've seen most of the Tarzan episodes. O'Keeffe & Bo Derek, which is completely unfortunate, has definitely been rated X. <br /> <br /> I've seen this version many times since it was originally shown. <br /> <br /> All the cast items were memorable parts, great actresses of the Ape series. <br /> <br /> Last night I watched the Spanish station and another French conversation in French. <br /> <br /> Hudson does not want Andie to do anything before the end. He looked at the diaries and could have hired a dialogue coach. <br /> <br /> It seems stupid that the story of the monkeys and the man they raised who all say that Hudson attacked Andie. he was an American cousin. The last time I checked with Carolina was in the US. <br /> <br /> She was in a beautiful movie and her eyes and proud hair, the alabaster skin mystified us all. He didn't have to use Bo's level. <br /> <br /> He has stayed with LADY throughout his career and should take this movie (half of his life back). His performance, sincerity, made this movie enjoyable, believing that half the wild man can identify his inner beauty. <br /> <br /> Sir Richardson's excellent referral point, he stole the movie.
