I hit this movie right in my eyes as I went to the nearby movie poster hall. The tags were confusing, and immediately after reading it, I thought it was similar to the National Lampoon Dorm Daze. I liked this movie, besides having a huge set of such genres, I decided to catch the cinema immediately after the examinations for the relaxer. and he had the same amount of laughter bits and points. Amanda Bynes certainly made it better than Keira in Knightley Bend like Beckham. Being a male and a female actor is definitely not so easy, especially to face similar lives, with the reactions that the actor has to meet. This film requires a great deal of confusion to mix yourself and us at the same time. The only way to pull it out is through this movie. <br /> <br /> The principle is obviously seriously funny, girls are equally sexy and beautiful, and also actors. I recommend this movie to anyone who needs a weekend break and does not worry, laughing all over the film. This is a solid guarantee.
