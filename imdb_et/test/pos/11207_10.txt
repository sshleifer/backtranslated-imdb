For those who are similar to me and used to watch and enjoy more budget Hollywood movies, this film-like screen is very far away. But it surprised me how close it is when I look at it. It is so natural that you feel that no one is writing a script or that someone has not guided it. You are a director and you are writing a script while viewing it. For me, the time I spend watching a movie is the only time I go to another world. This movie is the first sample for me that shows that it is not always necessary to watch millions of dollars in budget movies, surround sound capabilities to go to another world. These movies will send you to another world (or maybe make you back) without millions of dollars in budget or technical capabilities. I felt I was reading L'etranger from Camus.
