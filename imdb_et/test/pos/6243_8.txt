"Tourist Trap" is a strange, big fear movie from the 70s. The film tells about a group of young adults, Becky, Jerry and Molly, who travel through the jeep through the desert. Their two other friends, Eileen and her boyfriend Woody, are in a separate car. When the wheel goes flat, Woody takes it to a nearby gas station - and fits some weird telecom chaos and some horrible mannequin. Friends are tired of waiting for Woody and go to the local "trap of tourists" mannequin / wax museum. In front of the entrance, the car accidentally breaks and the girls find an oasis area for swimming where they are approached by Mr Slausen, who is currently running on a closed roadside attraction. She takes them to the former western wax museum and the girls are left behind when she and Jerry shut up their car. Eileen, strange of two, drives into a nearby old house where she falls into the hands of a mysteriously masked killer and life like a dummy. After waiting for Eileen, Becky and Molly will go looking for her. It begins when a real horror begins, and telecom (which can be thought-provoking objects) hide one by one with Mr Slausen's brother, while controlling his large number of human-controlled dummies. Sound similar to the 2005 "Wax House" remake? Well, that's it. I heard about this movie, but never saw it when I saw "House of Waxi", but now I see the striking similarities that the two movie sharing - "Tourist Trap" was probably a big "House of Wax" remake. Mannequins in this film are frightening at first, with some moving eyes, some with no eyes, and some with a mouth of the song. Singing was extremely horrible when you asked me, and mannequins were designed by eerily. Mannequins are horrible from the start, they are so viable, but they are not. The film mixes closely the elements of the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (masks used by the killer like Leatherface), a bit of the original "Wax House" and the telemetric forces that appear in "Carrie". The result is quite satisfactory. The scaffold was a nice touch for the film, making the killer even more dangerous and inevitable. The masks were frightening and were really annoying at the stucco site. <br /> <br /> The film's score was really well done, if not a few scenes. Operation may not be the key, but it was not so bad. Chuck Connors was really good as a shady Mr. Slauston, giving the character a shady but friendly feeling. The film also features a young Tanya Roberts, she is best known for her role in "Charlie's Angels" and recently at sitcom "That '70s Show", playing Donna's mother. Robert A. Burns works as an art director, he made the original "Texas Chainsaw" phenomenal work, and also does a good job here, creating a foul air atmosphere for both the lost museum and the old house full of dummies. I find it a little weird that the movie's original rating was PG, it seems that the rating of this film is a bit too scary, but the movie is not really too violent. <br /> <br /> In general, "Tourist Trap is a unique, fast paced, extremely undervalued horror classic for Eerily. Full Moon gave her a decent 20th anniversary DVD edition, the comment was interesting and the picture was mostly clear and crisp, better than video versions If you like older 70's horror movies, "Tourist Trap" is underrated by the retro pearl 8/10.
