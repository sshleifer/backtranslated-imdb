This movie was amazing, it was very funny and touching. Damien O'Donnell and Jeffrey Caine have created an excellent film that complains of all ages. James McAvoy and Steven Robertson made this movie superb. Their actions were great, and there was a real viable feeling between them that really made you believe they were the characters they acted on. Romola Garai is amazingly proud and brilliant in her role. The story of these two physically challenged people and their caregiver has been well passed on, and you will really feel and feel that the films are going on, because at the end it was particularly disturbing. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves a really heart-like movie, a warning to a more sensitive viewer to make sure you have the tissues you need. <br /> <br /> Again, an amazing movie!
