Mel Brooks is a great writer, director and actor, but sometimes he may also have a clinker. Its beginning starts almost basically after only one character after another. You have Cary Elwes who is charming and talented, but she can't do comedy. His expressions in the camera show that even if he can't believe the script's failures. Richard Lewis seems bored and confused without much work, and Amy Yasbeck has remained in high school mode. Dave Chapelle has a great comedy distance and camera pull, and Mark Blankfield is mostly in the role of a blind person, but then he can show a great comedy choice. Eric Allen Kramer doesn't have much to do, but the few scenes he has are binding. The best roles are Roger Rees, Tracy Ullman, Megan Cavanaugh and Brooks when he appears. Dom DeLuise has a funny move like Mafia Don, who uses the look of Clint Eastwood, but on the minus side, some jokes aren't very funny, while some really funny Mel is stolen from other movies.
