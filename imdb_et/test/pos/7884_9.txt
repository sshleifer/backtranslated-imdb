Although I saw this movie about four years ago, before I started commenting on IMDb, I decided to review what is unusual for me, because before that I often looked right after that. What can I say? Well, the best result is that Peter Boyle is the title who, after learning to kill his daughter's boyfriend dealing with drugs, wants to associate with him, even though he is the leader of Madison Avenue, who has nothing in common with a very lower class conservative Joe. In fact, Joe's lot has a lot of funny scenes that make smart comments there. Oh, and it should be noted that the actor who plays the daughter he was looking for after the hospital disappeared after some drug overdose is nothing but Susan Sarandon, who made his film debut! It was a pretty hard-hit movie during the time it was done (early 60s-early 70s) and was a hard work for scripter Norman Wexler (later Saturday Night Fever) and director John G. Avildsen (later made by Save the Tiger, Rocky and Karate Kid) ). The package will definitely end this year after all these years! Extremely recommended for anyone who is curious about this time of counter-culture. P.S. Among the cultural objects to be considered here are the Raggedy Ann doll, the Ritz cracker box, the Heinz ketchup bottle and the unique Nixon poster for the era, asking: "Would you buy this man's used car?"
