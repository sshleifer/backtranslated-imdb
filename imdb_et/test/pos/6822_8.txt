There have been many people who have tried to create a story that is identical to the story of the Heart of Darkness. Some movies have been built on the Heart of Darkness, like Apocalypse Now. In 1993, Nicholas Roeg directed a film that was exactly like a book. The film of the heart of darkness is almost exactly identical to the book. This movie is full of action and adventure. The heart of darkness is related to Marlow, a sailor, who travels along the Congo River to meet super-power ivory trader Mr. Kurz. and setting up as a book. It takes place in a boat on the River Thames and Marlow tells the story of four other men on a boat called Nellie. The whole movie is a setback for Marlow's journey to see Mr. Kurtz on the Congo. Marlow works for a Belgian company dealing with ivory on the Congo River. She talks about her account at the company's office and all the cards she saw in the office. <br /> <br /> Marlow is on the steamer in Africa. He arrives at the Central Station where he receives orders from the Director General. The Director General tells Marlow about Mr Kurtz and the ivory trade Marlow. Marlow will soon discover that Kurtz does not like the general manager because he fears Kurtz will replace him. Marlow waits for about a month at the center because his ship has been damaged and repaired. Marlow sees harsh treatment and enslavement in Africa while staying in the center. When the ship was finally repaired, Marlow, another African character named Mfumu, and other crew members traveled to Marlow's steamer Mr. Kurtz. in the desert. Since Marlow's team is attacking African natives, they finally shoot and kill Mfumu. When Marlow finally reaches the Kurtz station, he meets a Russian who explains Kurtz's strength and glory. Marlow is then headed home to Kurtz Station. There he sees many cards and pictures that Kurtz has painted. Finally, Kurtz enters the room and starts talking to Marlow about everything he has done in Africa and telling his lover. Marlow will soon discover that Kurtz is impossible because the Africans are her gods. Marlow is angry with the harshness and slavery he sees in Africa. When Marlow finally meets Kurtz, Kurtz begins to die. When Kurtz was in his dead chamber, he called Marlow in his room. Kurtz's life begins to flash in front of his eyes and his last words were "Fear, horror." When Marlow returns to Europe to see Kurtz's fianc√©e, Marlow tells her that Kurtz's last words were her name to hide the darkness in Kurtz's life. I recommend that someone watch this movie because it is full of activities and secrets. The film is slow from time to time, but it is interesting at all. The heart of darkness really extends your mind and teaches you a lot about how to interpret different scenes.
