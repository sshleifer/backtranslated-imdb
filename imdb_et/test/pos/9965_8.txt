"The Venetian merchant", Michael Radford, is doing a tremendous job of opening games because he makes it more accessible for everyone to watch this historic horrible time watching movies. The lush production of Shakespeare's production is a feast for the 16th century Venetian rich detail. <br /> <br /> This is a story of revenge, prejudice and justice, as William Shakespeare represents. Having seen the game a few times, we weren't ready to wait. Mr. Radford makes sure that the story is presented in such detail that it is easy for everyone to understand. He has also used the English version, which makes more sense than relying on the original text. In fact, how Shylock speaks in the film is not shocking at all, being a member of a minority who is marginalized by the Venetian authorities and the Catholic Church. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino's immense Shylock portrayal shows a man who is vulnerable, arrogant, revengeful, average and completely human. Mr. Pacino illuminates the character of the person who is technically defeated in court. Her own daughter has left her and her whole world seems to be stupid. At the end of the movie, we see a man who has been reduced as a target for hatred and ridicule. <br /> <br /> Lynn Collins, like Portia, is a lucky discovery. Having seen him at lower prices, he is not only surprised, but has a role and time in front of the camera. She shows us that she is a high-intelligence woman who comes to her husband and her best friend who threatened her well-being to help Bassanio get Portia's hand. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons plays Antonio, a man looking for Shylock's "bridge loan". After all, he knows that his ships will soon return from abroad. Antonio gets a lot more if he wanted to accept the terms of the loan with Shylock. Antonio's best plans are wrong if he suddenly fails to meet his obligations. Mr Irons delivers fine performance. <br /> <br /> Joseph Fiennes looks good with Bassanio. His good looks and charm give the impression of Portia, who clearly sees a young man's soul mate when he knows he is one for him. Kris Marshall, Zuleika Robinson, Charlie Cox also help smaller roles make the movie enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, it is Mr Radford's victory thanks to the vision he has given us from Venice and the history of its humanity in a terrible time.
