I saw this movie for the first time as a younger child. My sister had told me about it and I thought it would be more of a child's picture. However, it remains an incredible movie. It is true that the subject behind the film is rap, but it is also true that this film will never end with touching your heart. <br /> <br /> I was only 6 when I first saw it and just yesterday, 7 years later, I saw it again. For the first time in a long time. Even after I knew how it ended, I knew I had seen it a billion times. When I saw it a few years ago, I finally got the idea and the seriousness of the movie. So I stopped watching it for a while. But yesterday I didn't change the channel, I watched it. Finally, I was surprised at how much it would still make me laugh, cry, think and above all believe in mericals. I haven't lived for a long time and this film got my shell out and opened my heart. This movie did not easily affect. I was so impressed by the actors. Especially Bobby. So if you want to see this movie for the first time, I suggest you see it alone. With tissues. And being ready to discover your young, sweet, innocent side and half that still have hope. This film touched my soul when I was only 6 years old, and even while I was trying to figure out who I was, I helped me understand what I didn't want and still want to be alive.
