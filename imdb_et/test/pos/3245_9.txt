Australian film film, all elements are successful. Two hands represent the ability of Australian filmmakers and actors to produce high quality popular material. The film has a fresh corner that includes uniquely drama, intercourse and comedy. <br /> <br /> I found this movie thoroughly enjoyable on so many different levels - but it may well be that it may not be everyone's teapot. The film carries a special Aussie humor because it depicts Sydney's underworld and explores the young man (Ledger) and The life of a young woman (Byrne), wipes out local crime. <br /> <br /> Two hands deal with good and evil at both interpersonal and personal levels, and look at the consequences of our actions. <br /> <br /> Camera the work is snazzy and the dialogue is humorous. Bryan Brown, who plays Pando and Heath Ledger Jimmyna, is fighting the most strange situations on this screen - this Aussie movie is definitely not capable of acting. <br /> <br /> This subtle action / comedy has changed somewhat cult favorite and one mine.
