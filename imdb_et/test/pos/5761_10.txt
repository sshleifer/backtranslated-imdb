This movie was very funny moments. The above-mentioned initial image. <br /> <br /> Parts where Rik tries to act with dignity to his guests by looking at them through the nose. Very delicately done, especially since the guest was a fur adulterer. <br /> <br /> A scene where Rik discovers that Ginal is a groom, "Ahhh. He made me struggle all the time, a tough hussy." with his 2 candle eyes. As if he really was a fan. But he believed it. That's why it was so funny. Great moment. Gino was also great. He should have used more than a bad man. "Where are the whores I ordered!" he relaxes. Brilliant things.
