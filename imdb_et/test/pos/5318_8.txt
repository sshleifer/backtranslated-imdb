It must be one of the most powerful messaging movies I've seen lately, it was completely flawless all the time, amazingly original and thought-provoking. The story is unusual and original, and the characters make this story very powerful. It's about a boy who kills his former girlfriend's baby brother, and when he is sent to a juvenile prison, you get a lot of memory setbacks through the story and you won't let him go until the end. The murder he is doing changes the life of every member of his family and the dead family, and if you look and understand that everyone has their own story and their dark side, you will appreciate this film even more, it is a full dance force, these activities cannot be described as simple words. The motive for making her murders is insufficiently explained and makes the viewers think. The operation was pretty much flawless and the cast was very good, it contains many familiar faces. If you like movies that create a mindset and just think about them (eg "Donnie Darko", "Mulholland Dr."), then "Leland United States" is a great choice for you, otherwise you should go see this movie and watch it if you are in the mood for a movie of provoking a serious thought. <br /> <br /> 10/10
