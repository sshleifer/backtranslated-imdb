People who thought that RIDDICK'S CHRONICLE was sucking harder than the black hole that swallowed EVENT HORIZON, apparently didn't see the movie that triggered Vin Diesel's skin assailant, and apparently did not intend to. Too bad because PITCH BLACK actually pulls a bigger ass. <br /> <br /> Directed by David Twohy (WARLOCK and excellent but underestimated) and written by siblings Jim and Ken Wheat (LIES, SILENT SCREAM), PITCH BLACK begins with ALIEN'-esque prologue. If the combined cargo ship / passenger ship is damaged by an extremely meteor shower (where the captain is killed), Carolyn Fry (SILENT HILL'S Radha Mitchell) is an important decision to make: passengers? Climbing the magic in the vicinity of the riders will cause the crash to land on its final path. <br /> <br /> It doesn't matter, because the catastrophic landing has taken place on the predictive rock once in the mining colony. Survivors include a few settlers, Shazza (FARSCAPE Claudia Black) and Zeke (John Moore); Imam (Keith David) and his young followers (can you say "red shirts" for boys and girls?); antique seller Paris Ogilvie (Lewis Fitz-Gerald); "young boy" named Jack (Rhianna Griffith) and the most controversial members of the group: Marshall named Johns (excellent slimy Cole Hauser) and his prisoner ... a dangerous murderer named Riddick (Diesel). <br /> <br /> How the group dynamics shakes a lot of dramatic tension, especially about Riddick and how many people he can cut and dice when he ever gets away. But no one here lives, as they say, and the greatest appeal is less related to how they come together than how they survive when they discover unimaginable. They are not on the planet alone. Things that are hungry, spoken, and fast are moving around where they can't be seen, living in the dark, where they can survive and evolve. They want the meat of newcomers to eat their appetite, but they can't eat the food they eat in daylight. <br /> <br /> Does the phrase "complete Eclipse" make things a little more interesting? You betcha. Consequently, the title is more than suitable. Vin, more unmarked than Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry on his hardest day, dropping more testosterone than sweat, here's a day that is really worth the sequel or two, and Hauser, the menacing threat and bile is just as good as his father Wings screen rusty. Surprisingly, Mitchell holds his hand and is capable of being strong and likable to Fry. You would expect Black, which he was once "Aeryn Sun", to show a strong show and he wouldn't disappoint. (Too bad that his role was not greater, but that's all I talk about.) And David makes his usual indelible impression as a holy man whose faith is indeed tried in hell himself. <br /> <br /> Speed ​​moves faster than Riddick slips behind his teeth, and when darkness falls, fear and tension never let up, much like the other classic sci-fi / horror tricks it imitates. But if imitation is really the most glamorous form of attraction, Dave Twohy and Wheats deserve the main setbacks to get this right with revenge, and giving us the end to maximum anti-Hollywood. <br /> <br /> I don't want to spoil the surprises, so I'm not saying much more, except that if you first saw CHRONICLES and were not too happy, then give PITCH BLACK anyway. And if you haven't seen it, be sure to start with it. <br /> <br /> I don't know what Vin is up to, but he can definitely make it worse to give them guys a call again. I would like to see what they would dream about the next way ...
