I don't know if it's fair to me. I'm not a fan of free violence. I have never realized that the film industry is making heroes from mobile members and cold blood killers. When the godfather came out, I thought they had shattered the mold, but decades have brought out a number of good things about mobile films with big stars and directors. This is clearly a low budget, but it is definitely well done. At some points I feel like I want to take a shower. If such signs actually exist, it is difficult for the soul. I am always intellectual that mankind rises above such a thing. Such flakes must be stopped. I hope people entering such films are more voyeuristic and less sedentary. I feel like Slasher movies. Why are we enchanting and lethal? In fairness, I appreciate it in acting and guiding, and what it is, it seems to work pretty well.
