Lucio Fulci was one of the most prolific Italian directors by the time of his death in 1996, but his career had long since fallen increasingly into a spiral of meaningless genres that barely conceals his earlier work. By the mid-1970s, in the mid-1980s, he pulled out stylistically special horrors such as "The City of the Living Dead", "The Beyond", and the brutal giallo "The New York Ripper", which fans liked myself. And while the "Cat in the brain" coincides with the fall of the filmmaker Fulci, it is a shocking, dark fun-bound track, when clearly inferior work (framing, effects and acting below para) proves that an interesting, open meditation on the ability of pop psychology and film can desensitize . Don't make a mistake: "Cat in the brain" is a complete gorefest and when Fulci divorced as earlier films, but it deserves praise for trying to be more. As for the delicious tongue, Fulci plays himself as a director who is filming another violent shock that falls on perverted / murderous hallucination; After you visit the shrinkage that puts him under hypnosis, his dreams and reality begin to break until the viewer can see the two. The last Grindhouse Releasing DVD mentions "Cat" as "Eraserhead" for pleasant heirs, and it carries the same worrying, uncomfortably funny quality associated with the best surreal arts.
