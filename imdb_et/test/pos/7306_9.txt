I think many others have already commented on this movie, but I liked it as much as I just wanted to say how good this film is. I gave him a rating of 9. It didn't get to 10 because it's very slow. I almost finished it, but I'm glad I didn't. Talk there, it's worth the wait. <br /> <br /> This is mainly a movie about relationships: fraud, trust and betrayal. <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer, Jessica Lange and Jason Robards are all making this movie work. <br /> <br /> In the Midwest Farm world, Jason Robards is a farmer whose grandfather lived there first. The character of Jason is aging and he decides to build trust for three adult daughters, sharing a thousand acres of arable land. This is when the plot of the movie really begins. <br /> <br /> Sisters turn to each other for misunderstanding rather than earthly greed. They also make some discoveries about each other's childhood and their current marriages, including adultery, while the father becomes more abusive, demanding, and paranoid - until the terrible truth about everyone finally boils. <br /> <br /> This movie really reached me emotionally, I got angry with some letters and sad with them. I can feel their pain because of the great performances that were given. <br /> <br /> The end was a surprise to me, but it was consistent with the growth of characters. <br /> <br />
