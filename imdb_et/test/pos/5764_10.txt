It may not be an Oscar material, but it was a very funny movie. I was always a fan of Eddie (Edmondson) & Richie (Mayall). "Bottom" and "Young Ones" were legendary TV series, and this was the time when they made the movie. Some of the things they get are the back of the pencil, the rubber sex pants, as well as the infamous line that Richie says when she falls and the candle she carries goes into her eye. He tells Eddie "Candle in the eye, the candle in the eye" and Eddie was the easiest that he is, pastes the candle he wears. Can't forget when Eddie is on his motorcycle and he has to urinate .... It was a great comedy, not at all serious, but the film didn't have a ridiculous end. <br /> <br /> Generally, it is a great smiling comedy and a lot of fake green vomiting. A 9/10. <br /> <br />
