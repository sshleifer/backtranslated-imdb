This movie reminded me of memories on September 9th. The first thing I remember in the morning was to see a large picture of a flying plane on television and my direct thoughts, "Must have a preview of a new Tom Clancy movie." <br /> <br /> It wasn't Tom Clancy's movie. This was certainly not the British version of "The sum of all fears". A typical Tom Clancy film or novel has a relatively small cast, linear graph and usually some resolution. There was no movie. Of course, what I saw on the screen was small casting, a plot, and a vague resolution, but like 9/11, the idea was that reality was so much bigger and more complicated. systems planning and the reality and disaster of disaster preparation itself are painfully obvious. It is impossible to prepare for such a disaster and it is no longer possible to deal with it as it happens. <br /> <br /> Police argumentation (not enough to prepare) and politicians (giving panic to all pipelines causing panic), continuous speaker announcements (you are not dangerous to your health but don't go home until you are cleared of pollution) , and (Don't eat, drink, or smoke before we cleanse you), I was on the edge of the film. Not the slightest desire to surf surf. <br /> <br /> This movie was 90 minutes long. It could have been double and did not show all possible details. Instead, it was said without saying that each of us would be a detail, each of us in our own way. It made me so much more real than any Tom Clancy movie. <br /> <br /> I lived in London once and just off Edgeware Road. And I took the train several times from Waterloo station. When I looked at Dirty Wari, I told myself that it was just a fiction. Allah and Jehovah want this film to be a fiction, and sometimes after 20 or 30 years, my grandchildren can watch this movie and remember the beginning of the 21st century and the panic we felt too much. Hopefully at the same level as I currently feel when I look at the Cold War memorials with the evil communist regime in the mid-20th century, and remember the exercises at school.
