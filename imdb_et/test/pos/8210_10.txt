Why all the negative reviews ??? You didn't expect a movie like a masterpiece? We have a movie that tried to attract us and it worked for me. Not an Oscar competitor but entertainment. You can really see how the movie is outdated, especially everything the internet has to offer today. I still remember when it was first released and the network was so new. Crazy and frightening thoughts when I first saw it; I was 15 years old and seriously thought someone could keep your information on your computer and destroy you. But who says it won't happen? I'm not a person who would die in the movie to die, analyzing it before I see your eye. It's not my style. Medium acting, pausing and having fun again. Sandra Bullock as Angela Bennett is so cute. This is my favorite movie because it is like a computer genius that I find very attractive. Of all the films that appeared in 1995, this should be my favorite, although I didn't see it until 1996. My rating, 9/10, because it slowed down slightly.
