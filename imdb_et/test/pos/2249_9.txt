Being an Israeli Jew, of course a sarcastic nature, but also a lover of different and independent cinema, I am always delighted to see a film that looks at the Holocaust, which is sensitive and respectful, while being original and unusual. Although I haven't read the book? or have you heard about it before watching the movie? and therefore, like some other reviewers, can not comment on how they compare, everything is enlightened gave me great joy, and I can definitely comment on it. <br /> <br /> Everything on the illuminated label is a Holocaust film would be a great injustice, although it is arguably the Holocaust. So mark it as a comedy or as a travel film, although it's about a journey and it's so funny as it moves. Everything is illuminated is about Jonathan Safran Foer? Elijah Wood played minimalist perfection in the most impressive dramatic performance I've ever seen before, a face of poker that doesn't show anything and reveals everything? A young American Jew and an obsessive collector of family heirs and historical items who travels to Ukraine to find a woman who saved her grandfather from the Nazis. It's also Alex, his travel guide through Ukraine and Alex's grandfather. What is interesting about these characters is that at the beginning of the film they look like a comic relief to balance the melancholic nature of Wood's character; But both Alex and his grandfather pass the entire movie through exciting changes and are at least as important as Jonathan. In fact, Boris Leskin turns out to be the evil, self-evident, obscene grandfather of the best dramatic results of the film. <br /> <br /> In addition to the surreal character of film and characters, the beautiful combination of original acoustic music and Russian folk music, sensitive cinematography and cool contrast between the beauty of landscapes and the horror of history, which made everyone enlighten a powerful and moving experience for me, was that Alex and his grandfather get very painful and initial about this painful topic; Several excellent films, such as the gray zone and the fall, have already given us a view of the lower Nazis, presented as human beings, who are not necessarily fully aware of the moral consequences of their actions, but have been detained in the reality of war. Everything is enlightened represents a point of view that is rarely processed before: Alex's perspective is a young man who was born many years after the war, who can hardly see it as a cold historical fact that has to face the horrors of his own people? and perhaps his own family? were able. Change in Alex's attitude? and her grandfather? In the direction of Jonatan towards the Holocaust and towards the Jews in general, the film makes an exciting and original study of character development. <br /> <br /> Everything is enlightened is a terrific director's debut for actor Liev Schreiber and one of 2005's most original and unique films. This is a highly recommended viewing experience, especially for anyone interested in the Holocaust and World War II.
