Edward Dmytryk Crossfire is a rare film from Hollywood in the 1940s. It was a groundbreaking territory for Mr Dmytryk and the studio, as the director and his adapter, John Paxton, decided to make the film with the novel. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen the movie, stop reading right now. <br /> <br /> Richard Brooks's novel was killing a gay soldier. In the film, the subject turned to the Jews, which was a taboo of American cinema over time. For Mr Dmytryk's credit, we have had the courage to take part in this film project. <br /> <br /> Film is a prominent feature of film, because the way it is presented by the director. Obviously, the film's noir affects style, post-war Washington. The scene of Samuel's brutal murder shows an unusual cruelty to a decent person we do not yet know or has been killed, but who do not deserve death in such a terrible way. The murder is based on prejudices, clean and simple. We understand how the ignorant man's mind, the mere fact that it is successful and different, plays in the assassination mind. Samuels stands as a sacrificial sheep, as does the gay soldier in the novel. The parallels are well drawn. <br /> <br /> This movie makes compelling views, as Robert Ryan, like Montgomery, is perfect. Mr. Ryan was an actor who always played interesting roles, but never like Crossfire. Also, Gloria Grahame, like Ginny, is a prostitute with her heart in the right look. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> </p> <p> </p> <p> Robert Young, as the police detective in charge of the investigation, is a decent person who has had prejudices in his family for the first time and speaks loudly against it. Robert Mitchum plays Gulf Sgt. Keeley, who has been deeply touched by a crime, when one of his men is accused of doing so. Sam Levene is great in his small Samuelside role. <br /> <br /> This is a movie to watch because it is probably the first to speak out loudly.
