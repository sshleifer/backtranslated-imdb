This movie seemed so real. I felt that all the emotions lived here were at different times in my life - both Rory and Michael. I have Duchene muscular dystrophy like Rory, so here you see what I felt. Some do not believe that disabled people like Rory are full of anger and rebellion. I know they exist because I'm one of them. <br /> <br /> The story is great. For drama, character-based film, the story moves quickly. I was never bored, maybe partly because I saw things close to my heart. But I think most people with intelligence are glued to the screen and care about the characters. Action is phenomenal! James McAvoy is perfect as Rory O'Shea, who has Duchene muscular dystrophy. He Steven Robertson deserves an award for his portrayal as Michael Connolly, who has brain paralysis. <br /> <br /> Michael does not love him and Rory helps him to agree. I have felt it many times and the question is, "Does he not love me because I am not just one or because his disability turned out?" Whatever the girl says, we are always skeptical of the truth. It's natural and it hurts so. <br /> <br /> Some parts made me cry a bit because it is sad and I have to face the problems myself. People with terminal disabilities cannot just start to feel how it looks. This is a film that is visible to everyone. People with disabilities are everywhere and largely misunderstood. This film brings a little light to some fact of life that the physical body is so self-evident. We want to be like you - live on your own terms, go out, drunk, be loved. Out, we can't do much, but we dance from the inside!
