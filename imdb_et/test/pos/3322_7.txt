This working girl goes to hell soap is a time capsule candidate, courtesy of her impeccable physical production, 50s costume (see all these bows and pearls), creamy Johnny Mathis theme song and oh-so bold (in her time) sexual attitudes. Rona Jaffe's novel, on which the film was based, continues to be rediscovered, and only a few years ago, Vanity Fair actually dedicated an interesting article to this film. Take a look at the new DVD transfer and you know why. <br /> <br /> Three Appendices - Hope Lange, Diane Baker, and Suzy Parker - Shows Girls "How Marry A Millonaire" or Carrie Bradshaw and His Friends "Sex and City". "Gentlewomen singers are relaxed ..." Their romantic adventures and sexual entanglements are a passion for passion: empty caramel corn calories, which are not nutritious, impossible to resist. The lange really touches his neo-Grace Kelly's way, Baker is properly dim and idealistic as a timid virgin who can (limp) cad knock. It helps that the crap is played by Robert Evans, a throat-sounding, coke-chewing film mogul who has certainly led many innocent young sheep killing in his Beverly Hills bedroom. <br /> <br /> Suzy Parker is an exciting first half of the movie with all the confident and conscious comments.

But he expresses glamor and the savior's faire, and his action is at least sufficient. One wonders why critics were bothering him, a few years later practically out of the movie. Perhaps a good-looking woman's attitude is just too big.

After all, it is pretty much a romantic grave, instead of rising to melamramic finish, like another famous soap opera maker, Jerry Wald, "Peyton Place" with Lana Turner crying and biting during rape. trial. Here, Hope Lange travels to New York's sidewalk, the spots glow, forever hung (but now of course sober) Stephen Boyd and they just walk together ... until sunset, one assumes. Otherwise, it is quite a concept of innocent joy. <br /> <br /> Oh yes ... there is also Joan Crawford breathing fire on all young girls and smoking cigarettes as he lifts over his married lover. phone. And the headlines are made with warm rose, ribbon letterings that resemble the 50's recent department store ads. Don't miss!
