I saw this movie when I saw this movie, and I was struck by the beauty of young stars, loving cinematography and the story of simple sweetness. I am amazed that Alvina has recently died that Bury has probably not worked in the film industry for nearly 30 years and both would have been in the 50s. <br /> <br /> Elton John's soundtrack is amazingly beautiful and supports the air of protected innocence, which is characterized by independence. I have seen a poster of the film, debiting it as "Deux Enfants Quis'Aiment", which probably means something like "Two children who love each other" - English speakers were reasonable to shorten the title. <br /> <br /> Paul, a 15-year-old son of an English businessman living in Paris, meets Michelle with an orphan in a zoo. Two take what they intend to do on Michelle's late father's country house on a day off, but there they get there for a year, isolated from the outside world. They fall in love, Michelle gets pregnant and have a child at home only at home. After the birth of the child, the police arrives at Paul's job and takes him away. The "blue lagoon" comes to mind as another movie that almost captures the innocence theme that is protected by an isolated paradise. So sad that "Friends" has never been published on DVD.
