I had the privilege of watching Mar Adentro last Friday and I still have a fabulous job of this beauty, the powerful work of every actor and actor, and the incredible Amenabar's ability to tell the story of Ramón Sampedro, well-known in Spain. legal euthanasia, lost judgment, and eventually died in front of a camera drinking a glass of poison, freezing all our hearts when he was sure he was not going to live forever because of an accident. <br /> <br /> Before watching the movie, I already had a strong inscription in the title, which I would translate as "into the sea" and not as some recommend "into the sea" and taken from the original poem written by this man. Then I watched the movie. Oh my friends. It is a cinema with capital C. Narration flows to bring you to the heart of every symbol: Sampedro, reintroduced in Bardemy, which you have forgotten from the beginning, is in the middle of a man full of sense of humor and full hope, and his hope is to die because he for life there is no life he lives worth living. The rest of the characters, but one dance around him and respecting his decision, because they see him as being an independent person (forgetting that he depends on everything), even though they love him so much. And that's what the movie deals with: love. It can be felt, it can breathe every character's skin. You feel that you know this movie in three women who meet her: Gené, a member of the association that protects her right to push dignity, her friend, her story in the film, is a hope for those who are happy. lives a normal life in this world; Rosa, a woman who responds to a good man in the midst of corrupt relationships and pain in all men who used and despised him; Julia, a woman who shares a tragic fate with Ramón and ultimately acts in a way we can't but only understand. <br /> <br /> But before their meeting, Ramón knew what love was, because you can't meet her without loving her, and her beloved family loves her deeply: Four characters that are unique in their humility and bravery. Your thoughts on your decision, every thought is respectable in its own way, because the terrible thing about this story is that it is not someone who is guilty of what happened. Unfortunately, life is sometimes terrible. From this familiar quartet, I liked Mabel Rivera as Ramon's sister, Manuela: great power. <br /> <br /> I would like to draw attention to three episodes that are the best climaxes I've seen for a long time and if you haven't seen this movie, read this section and read it again from the next Mar adentro start Let the movie show your secrets. I liked the following episodes: 3. The best love scene I've seen in the movie, when I felt love penetrating the screen, is when Ramón dreams of waking up on Julia's beach and kissing each other. 2. Gené, who speaks by phone to Ramón, the day before he does it, and he tells him that it is better to say goodbye at this point rather than put him in trouble in the authorities. And then he knows it's the last time they talk, and he's won his right to die ... but he doesn't want to lose him because he loves him under the name of a real friend and while he respects his decision at all costs for. 1. Best. Young Ramón on the beach, looking at her girlfriend under the sun, jumping from stones to water, which remains behind. We see a crash, we hear his voice, remembering what happened and claiming that he should have died at that moment. Bardem's face, face down, shown to us. And a friend who pulls her from the forehead and brings her back to life, which is hell for her in the next 30 years. There are many others, such as the impressive ending, despite the fact that in Spain we know that Ramon did it very well. <br /> <br /> Mar adentro will not deceive me, Amenabar will never do it, but this time he has to thank the participants who took part in the project and who could take it because it is not just a movie, it's a man, who died alone when he asked to die "legally", which meant him as Bardem noted, the people he loved and loved died.
