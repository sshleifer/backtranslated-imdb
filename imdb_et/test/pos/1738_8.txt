I've never seen a doctor who (at least not focused in any way), so I was new to this concept. I have to say that the new exhibition works very well. It is funny (it should also say "comedy" in the genre description, many plot appeals are only acceptable because of their comic value), it is well written and it does a little budget for a long way. The human dimension is very strong and interesting, which is very rare in current TV shows. <br /> <br /> I've seen the first eight episodes and # 6-8 were still my favorites. Even stories that are too easy to twist (driving time, rescuing dead parents, and things like that) are amazingly good here. <br /> <br /> Christopher Eccleston is delighted to look witty and frivolous, though occasionally a doctor - if they find him a good substitute, I'm quite surprised. But I'm ready to give the new man a chance. However, there is little doubt that Eccleston's episodes will be a classic in history. <br /> <br /> The doctor-rose ratio is especially refreshing. Doc has much more of a father than a romantic interest, but still there are romantic enthusiasm between them, which is much more emotional and more human than sexual. <br /> <br /> Good show. The biggest drawback is the low budget - such an exhibition should have better special effects. And why they just don't use some of the cheaper effects, I don't know. On this day and age, SFX doesn't have to pay for a bundle - just watch the Star Wars: Revelations movie. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
