Well, he took these 4 events, but finally it got right! In this fourth post-franchise phase of Karate Kid, manufacturers hit home! First of all, I commend them for getting rid of Ralph Macchio. I felt that he had never served the role of Karate Kid. I'd rather have seen Danny 'Ralph Mouth' the most in this role. Macchio turned out to be the best movie in the series, and see where his career is now! Instead, they put them in a girlfriend! They got Hillary Swank, the best known, because he plays different filmmakers in every movie he's on. Personally, I don't care about my teeth teeth, but it's a personal preference. But see how Karate Kid 4 started her career in orbit! He won the Oscars. Jiminey Christmas! Meanwhile, where is Ralphy? She should put out some amateur pornbands like Screech or something. <br /> <br /> Anyway, my only dissent is that they have a girl who is doing karate. As an independent karate master, I've been the owner of a white belt for the last five to eight years. The first thing they taught me is that girls have no place in martial arts ... except for Judo ... but it's a little gay. So, for the sake of accuracy, I think they should have kept a second man for this role. I was thinking of Dennis Franz. He would give the role he needs. <br /> <br /> Maybe they listen to my suggestions and make the right adjustments to Karate Kid 5. Its too Pat Marita no longer. I was thinking that Justin Guarini is the perfect substitute for my beloved Asian colleague, Miyag. He gives the "wax wax off" a whole new meaning. HAHAHAHAHAHA is funny? Anyway, if you are looking for an exciting movie full of victory over Karate and the human spirit, Karate Kid 4 is for you. Don't waste your time 1-3. It's Karate Kid for you! It's a karate boy aged!
