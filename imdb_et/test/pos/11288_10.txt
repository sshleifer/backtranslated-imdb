I want to highlight this review by saying that I have no idea what is "born" really. I really know that in the beginning God kills himself, giving birth to Mother Earth, who continues to impregnate with God's sperm. Then he was born. The rest is quite subjective and you have to interpret it in your own way. <br /> <br /> How I chose to interpret a movie; God killed himself at the beginning of a scientific revolution when people began to question the doctrines established by the Church, such as the geocentric view of the universe, and so on. Mother Earth symbolized people who began to think and reject the church. because God says "views". The tribal people were a church with them trying to force Christianity. I'm not quite sure how Earth Son fits all this. Mother Earth and Tribal Peoples seemed to be fighting for her, so she might represent people's freedom or something like that. <br /> <br /> I have no idea what the last parts of this movie should mean. Exploding the Earth and the Son of the Earth, Rape, then Crushing and Grinding the Ground Like a Mortar and Sprayer can mean something, but it's fun in the movie; You can interpret it in any way. It doesn't have to have a final meaning, you can let your mind go wrong. Sometimes you don't even know what you should look at because it is a weird angle or it is too foggy. <br /> <br /> The only thing that deceived me was that I was expecting a really scary movie. I was going to think about it, that I would call the "seven days" early warning immediately after calling. What I got was very different. It wasn't scary at all, but it interfered with my imagination. Deciphering the secret message of the film was a creative challenge. There were many scenes that were really beautiful. My mother landed right after her birth and the final shot of the forest road reminded me. <br /> <br /> So generally I have to say that I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. This is definitely the most abstract film I've ever seen, but it's not bad.
