Timely travel to the past is, at best, very weak. In this episode, a person who has thought of this possibility will find Abraham Lincoln at the date and place of the murder. He is trying everything he can think of with his predictable results in a short time. Of course he is thought to be pretty crazy. He is being arrested and finally dismissed by the person he is trying to stop. The looting was bright enough to let him come back, but is it the same? This is a kind of predecessor to the "Time-Tunnel", where weekly travelers were given the same task, surpassing what has already happened. Unfortunately, the consequences of time and future distortions always lose results. If you have nothing like Ray Bradbury's "The Thunder of Thunder".
