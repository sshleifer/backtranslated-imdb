It would be pointless to decide that this is a narrative or documentary that would be more authentic than the other. Both formats have a fictional form, and they are never a reflection of real reality, as manufacturers try to build and tell stories from their perspective. Since both forms leave some questions unobtrusive due to the complexity of the sub-blocks and the time of the screen, it denies viewers the opportunity to open discussions and explore and build true truth. In addition to being unable to assess sources (eg comparisons with written history) and the logic behind arguments, history may be distorted through narrative and documentary. <br /> <br /> For most people, the documentary may be more real as it usually involves real testimonies from the participants and real materials. These visual images are selected and edited so that the producers can present a version of reality to viewers. The story of The Real Buddy Holly Paul McCartney is trying to create Buddy Holly, which the family and friends remember and how Buddy influenced the music world. The testimonies may have been distorted because memories may not be accurate and emotions have evolved to make Buddhist legend. The documentary made improvements to the film version and included other events such as 3 cricket members and that Buddy's music was announced outside of the US at that time (he was supposed to start his world trip!). But this did not go into a deep debate about what happened to Buddy's wife after his death. Criticism and / or negative discussions may be omitted from the documentary as the producers try to make Buddy that the world should have been remembered. Finally, we cannot build the whole truth, because we are confined to the "beliefs" of the past that documentary tells us. <br /> <br /> I personally prefer a narrative film because it offers rich visual images that will help us re-create the collective memory of this era. This gives the audience a more constructive structure and leads to better memory retention for the audience when they play the story again. There is also flexibility to allow filmmakers to express their thoughts and views on specific issues. In the Buddy Holly Story, racial issues were highlighted and viewers will certainly be able to address these issues in the context of current situations. <br /> <br /> When watching a movie and using emotions, visitors to the movie consistently try to revisit some emotions to viewers to choose personal ties with the meanings that the filmmaker wants to offer. In most stories, people will probably remember selectively fighting, inspiring and ending the story. Through Buddy Holly Story, we remember the struggles of Buddy and Crickets, how Maria was the source of encouragement and that Buddy Holly was a great performer until the day she died.
