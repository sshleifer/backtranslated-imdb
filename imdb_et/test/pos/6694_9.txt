K-Pax is a very interesting film. Is Prot (Kevin Spacey) really an alien, or is he a spiritually corrupted person who just thinks he is an alien? This is a question that Dr Powell (Jeff Bridges) has to answer before declaring a deadline for Prot to leave his country. <br /> <br /> As the film appears and more evidence is discovered, both theories grow in credibility. His ability to map the memory of the galaxy where his home planet is located shows the knowledge that no man can. However, hypnosis sessions lead us to a real and traumatic real person full of devastating events that may have caused such aberration of personality. The end result seems to give a response, but it's vague enough that you don't know if you really know. Usually I do not like the end of a lady or tiger, but it is tantalizing. I have my own theory that fits all the clues, but I don't know that my theory is more correct than anyone else. <br /> <br /> Director Iain Softley ("Wings of the Dove") spins the story gently, with great skill. This is a rare example of a leader who is in the shadows and giving outstanding talents from talented actors to dominate the story. This does not mean that management is technically worse because it is great. But Softley remains unnoticed, offering great strength, using nuances, a pleasant change from today's leaders who visually grab and shake the viewer as they shout: "See how great!" <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey has great results again like Prot. This is a part that is exceptionally demanding, requiring Spacey to make a cool and logical Prot for 1 minute, and then switch gears to let his tortured alter ego go under hypnosis. Spacey is both plausible and alien as a human being, making the viewer's task much more difficult. Jeff Bridges is also a terrible psychologist who has been obsessed with the truth about Protist. <br /> <br /> It's inspired by the storyteller's thoughtful viewer. I appreciated it 9/10. If you are closed at the end of the movie, this movie is very frustrating. However, if you like an exciting mystery that keeps you somewhat after thinking about credit, you don't have to be disappointed.
