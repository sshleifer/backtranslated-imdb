The question arises immediately in this extremely idiosynthetic film: Who are crazy people? <br /> <br /> The answer becomes less clear when the movie goes on. <br /> <br /> Renee Zellweger loses a brilliant note of her voice and if her voice is still high, she is incredibly effective when shell-shocked by Betty. In fact, he was so effective that I wanted him to be just a little mad, because his reality was so credible. <br /> <br /> This is the first time Mrs Zellweger has been invited to a movie and she is more than a task. <br /> <br /> Chris Rock? though like an unpleasant mouth as usual? is relatively modest than Wesley. He can lower his mania energy only occasionally on surfaces and whenever it is most needed. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting hints: for the first time you see Betty, she's almost an adult like Dorothy Gale from Oz's wizard? then later in the movie he is compared to Dorothy when he says he has never been outside Kansas before. At one point, the song that Doris Day is best known for is Que Sera Sera, on the soundtrack and later described by Charlie (Morgan Freeman) for having a whole Doris Day thing. "<br /> <br /> This is a very original film with good results, including supportive cast. <br /> <br /> It has a surprising end, on the contrary, as it seems, is actually quite predictable. <br /> <br /> If for some other reason you just listen to this movie to the captain of the human voice, then Morgan Freeman.
