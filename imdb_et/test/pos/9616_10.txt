As a lifelong fan of Kung Fu movies, I have to say that this is one of the best I've ever seen. Of course, there is nothing special about the plot, but the man attracts it. Like most genre films. This film is packed with action and does not carry its viewers. It's so fucking fun when I see that I have a smile all the time. It also affects future movies like Kill Bill. (Many of the sound effects of Kill Bill come from this movie, for example.) This is an important viewing experience for all Kung Fu viewers. The open form for closing this movie is full of struggles that are really better in the genre. There are a few Kung Fu movies that measure the magic and entertainment of this movie. So if you're looking for a Great Kung Fu movie, be sure to check it out.
