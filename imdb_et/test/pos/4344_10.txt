One of the biggest movies ever made. The acting of Charles Buchinski (later known as Bronson) is simply outstanding. It is the crown of the director's career, which was often quoted himself, saying that it was his masterpiece. The plot has been copied several times, but it is never up. Gun manufacturer Wildey J. Moore has repeatedly claimed his brand growth since the mid-1980s, which can be fully credited to DW3. It's not just a movie, it's an art that many generations admire and appreciate. Although this film has never been fully appreciated in the US, it has been tremendously followed in Europe and Asia, where the film is regularly shown in film schools and is still a popular hit in student cinemas across Europe. All in all, it's a real classic.
