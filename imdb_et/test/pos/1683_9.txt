I was surprised at the quality of this movie, especially after I barely saw adult director pictures - all 140 (?) Pounds! Really, boy's leading film. Waiting for more Luke Eberl movies. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a little too long. There was too much time to show that Connor couldn't (and did not want) Owen to move. Caleb didn't try hard enough. Owen, being so young, would have come closer to Caleb and later decided it was not her preference. And Owen would still have learned a "valuable lesson" about corruption and politics. Instead, he did not give himself the right opportunity to know his sexuality. And what about poor Caleb? Owen could have had a good effect. <br /> <br /> Although the film is going to show Owen a hero who crosses perverse corruption, I felt sad to Owen. He was offered the opportunity to have some boy-boy entertained with Caleb, who was exceptionally beautiful. Owen was not supposed to offer a political perversion. But he could have tried the fun with Caleb and he still walked as he wanted. It was clear that Owen was responsible - no one forced him to do something he didn't want to do. But he could have been more fun and very hot with a boyfriend. I hope Luke will make more movies where tempting young characters are more fun.
