As you can see, I have made 2 comments on this exhibition since 1991 ... and not, ITV has not made it public. <br /> <br /> HOW I recently contacted ITV to see if there was a chance to copy, and that was their answer ....... <br /> <br /> publish a plan of this program via DVD / video, however, buy copies of our viewers' requests section at: viewers.requests@itv.com ". <br /> <br /> I hope you can now enjoy this classic short comedy. <br /> <br />
