One comment said it wasn't comedy ... Bug! It was a pleasant comedy of a time period that was not easy for this genre. Very busy ... and active film from start to finish. Often, the train window or car exits were just beautiful. An enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours in the theater. All of France's historical figures, such as Charles de Gaulle and Petain, and some of the French resilient people, had added a script that could be sent to those who do not know that the collapse of France is under German invasion. The characters were involved and their actors were great. Recommend it from 10 out of 10.
