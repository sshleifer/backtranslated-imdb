The above profile is written by me when I used the OldWereWolf56 nickname, which is still my email address. I still believe that Andy Devine's Frisky character is the best of the Twilight Zone episodes and I look at this episode at least once a year because I find Frisby happy because he has many friends who love him dearly. <br /> <br /> If many of you are too young to remember, I'm 61 years old, Andy Devine hosted a 50-year-old children's entertainment show. I believe in Andy Gang. It had three assistants: Midnight, a cat who played a violin, a mouse called Squeaky, who played with a handicraft and a freak donut, Froggy, who may appear and disappear, embarrassed by many Andy's funny stars like Billy Gilbert.
