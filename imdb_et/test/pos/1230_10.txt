This is a haunting short film. Both James Franco and Rachel Miner give performances that are painful, right and remain with you. Since it's a tragic story, it's not a lot of spoilers. But I wanted to change the result, even though it is the story, because I was already caring for these people. I can only think of some short films that have had such an effect on me. Beautifully shot, acted, edited. High caliber work everywhere, even when using the right sound and / or music to further develop the story. The final credit song ended the job, bringing me even more emotion. This is the first rate from start to finish. Tissue for writer / director and all involved. <br /> <br /> This is my first commentary on comments. I promised to do this for a copy of the DVD. The review may be good or bad, just my honest opinion. That's it, and that's the least I can do. I'm so glad I saw it.
