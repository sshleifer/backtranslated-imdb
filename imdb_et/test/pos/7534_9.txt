A stunning and thoughtful look at the modern life of Japanese youth, such as sand grains, burns in fine and important terms such as rape, homosexuality and puberty. It gives an overview of a youth culture that seeks to define itself beyond the boundaries of its parent generation, which is strictly consistent and facade. The typical Japanese cinema is often what has not been said, the more important that what is unknown to both Japanese film and culture is to be careful. If you don't know what to look for, it may seem boring and minimalist (pretty much like the movie coming out of every Japanese bar in Manga). I saw it for the first time when I was 15 years old and it was originally my interest in Japan, its culture and language. Given that I am 22 years old and learned Japanese to live there for 2 years, it goes without saying that it is a powerful film. Enjoy!
