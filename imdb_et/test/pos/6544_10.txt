For those who are there who have seen this picture in VHS, I would recommend a DVD. In fact, VHS is absolutely sharp. The main reason is that the film had a widescreen (2.55: 1) and the producers ran out of the VHS version and released it 4: 3. The result is that many actors are not on the screen at all and there are fewer than half of the cars in the dropping competition. is on both sides of the screen. DVD is actually a reasonable version of the movie. <br /> <br /> Many of the best scenes on the film were cut before final release. They were considered too minor for minority groups. In fact, the US release outlook in the film has made even more cuts. For example, Americans did not literally understand words like Petrol & Strides. <br /> <br /> Mike's father and mother had to be hippies. Dad lives in a movie as a wasteful doping smoking guitarist. But the next mother's scene was cut. The scene took place on the roof of the house lined with aluminum foil, fluoro lights and plants filled ... you get the picture. Manufacturers had put a lot of real plants in the foreground, and when they saw the result on a large page, they collided and the scene was cut. Cows! <br /> <br /> Yes, the film is marked by Australian cult classic. Voted # 2 Street Machines Best 100 Movies All the Time, Narrowly Missed Mad Max II. The latter had more than 10 times the ROE budget. In fact, the ROE budget was so small that the director could not afford to destroy the car ... although it would have been a public challenge if someone had really seized the real HO. (compare it with Smoky and Bandit or Blues Bros where tens of cars were broken.) So one true GTHO and two fakes are. One of the fakes was purchased from the local local community in Cobar after GTHO fell on the back of the Country Boy truck. (It was unwritten! The car was meant to be pulled out of the side of the truck.) As the budget was so tight, the car was made with ordinary brown ribbon paper, not real gold. <br /> <br /> 55 chev is absolutely real. The car started with a very ordinary 4 door and it turned out to be a great and fast movie for "55". The engine was marinated with 545, which made about 1000 hp. It dropped to about 600 for filming. The car was able to easily 170 mph on several scenes in the movie. <br /> <br /> Just for a record, anyone with $ 12,000 could get all the cars after the movie. HO, Dodge, '53 Ute, Rammer 53 Chev ... lot. Wonder where they are now? <br /> <br /> SW
