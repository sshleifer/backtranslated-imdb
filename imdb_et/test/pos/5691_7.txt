This low-budget crocodile film really gives you the goods. The fact that it is inspired by real events would mean little if you stop with a fake crocodile, bad C.G.I or obvious studio settings. Fortunately, none of the amazing, very realistic films mentioned above. Crocodile is real, there is no C.G.I. And filming on the spot is in the real Australian swamp. The participants were obviously inspired to create as much realism and success as possible in their performances. You can repel yourself, showing how realistic "Black Water" means entertainment. Highly recommended. - MERK
