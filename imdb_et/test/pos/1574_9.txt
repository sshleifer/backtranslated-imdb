Until the web search "What Alice Found", I didn't know that the movie's title was placed in one of Lewis Carroll's book titles. The full title of the book is "View the glass (and what Alice found there)". <br /> <br /> Alice comes from a background different from Lewis Carroll's Alice. His fresh and confident character is the same. Alice starts off as a young woman in New Hampshire who steals money from her ass-patty boss and takes off for Miami, designing vaguely marine biology and dolphin playing. He encounters a medieval couple in a car residence (his wife left the army) who rescues him from a stranger at a roadside stop and the breakdown of his car (possibly due to their mechanisms). <br /> <br /> As it turns out, a couple of prostitutes stop attending and see a sweet, young Alice as a promising recruiter. Spouse (played by Judith Ivey at some great prize) buys Alice sexy clothes and shows her how to apply hot makeup. At first, Alice passively accepts her services and makes several tricks with a few instructions. The most detailed meeting is different from most movies, but may be typical of what is most common in real life. The man is shy and suspicious and apologizes for too fast "finish". <br /> <br /> What is wonderful about Alice (and different from her prototypes from Clariss's sister Carrie) is that she learns from her experiences and confirms herself. This is how things really are. Prostitution is everywhere. People are not all good or bad. Alice leaves the car home with her well earned money and mutual respect.
