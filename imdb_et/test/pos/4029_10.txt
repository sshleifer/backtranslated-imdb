I always enjoyed "DOA", a 1950s that played Edmond O'Brien and was very curious about this film. Dennis Quaid (Dexter Cornell) was a professor who loved his wife and finally found that she had one of her students. Dexter attends Meg Ryan (Sydney Fuller) who was a student in his college class and at the same time had a big drunk and stopped one night and in some ways loved him deeply. Dexter learns he got a drink with bad content and a lot of health problems for him! If you like Dennis Quaid and love Meg Ryan, you enjoy watching this movie, giving Meg outstanding results and watching it!
