Shazam was okay, but Hero High was my favorite when I was a kid, I mean before it was Sky High (2005) and Zoom (2006), there was Hero High, a school where there was a superhero in school, superpower teens helping the police catch the bad Boys and other times they would get in embarrassing situations like The Greatest American Hero (1981). It was a fun comic to watch what was also fun, was a live action performance called "Kid Superpower Hour" with Shazam. Participants who gave signs, even dressed, are showing signs. Rex Ruthless (John Berwick), Misty Magic (Jere Fields), WeatherMan (Jim Greenleaf), California Captain (Chris Hensel, who also sang the thematic song), Dirty Trixie (Maylo Mccaslin), Glorious Gal (Becky Perle, who looks like Superman and the Child of Wonder Woman) and Punk Rock (Johnny Venocour). The whole majority just went with the jokes. Cartoon was a fun superhero comedy, I brought it back to live action like Fat Albert (2004)
