The greatest effort plus the best pains ever put in front of the film "Director Tim Robbins" and Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn. Someone said that this movie is good because Tim Robbins has written and written, but I persuade you that Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon gave me a really great performance that I called in my heart. Their behavior is so real! No doubt this movie is rated 4 and 3/4 out of 5!
