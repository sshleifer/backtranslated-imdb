For those who do not know what Bug Juice is, it was a children's reality show of children living in real children's camps. Bug Juice is an exhibition that inspired me to go to camp. It was full of romance, friendships, struggles, overcoming his fear and fighting for living at home for 2 months. It was an amazing show that is no longer shown in t.v. regularly, but is amazing not-less. The exhibition was never boring and always attracted my attention. It's really great for kids who have never seen a summer camp to really see what it is going on before. Plus Disney did a great job of organizing the camps because who wants to see an exhibition that is in the camp just a week. The length of the camps, where this exhibition is ideal, and the environment in which they were fantastic. They, with bearings all over the United States, provide everyone with unique activities for campers. It was a truly amazing script show.
