This Popeye comic for World War II was a very good vision and, on average, higher for this genre. It was also nicely drawn, with some big corners, good details and .... well, many interesting sights. a small Japanese boat with two men. (By the way, why were "Japanese" always photographed with large round glasses and teeth?). <br /> <br /> In any case, these harmless-looking Japanese sailors want Popeye to sign a peace treaty. Oh, boy, thinks gullible Popeye, "wait until Admiral sees it!" In one of those great works of art I mentioned above, we see slowly how this small Japanese ship is really a great destroyer ... and Popeye is deep .... um, water! "Why, Jaakate!", Punishes our sailor. <br /> <br /> How he can look out of the situation is nice to watch.
