This story of a man's 28-year-old struggle for death, which would release him from his dead body, becomes a masterpiece that must be remembered by the grace of the artists' team. Alejandro Amenabar has directed, written, edited and captured the first pictures and does not leave his eyes and hearts rested until the last credit is received thanks to Alejandro and the best actors and actors group. Bardem is an acting animal: One of the few comedians who can do almost any masterpiece, supportive actors are great in their roles, and the story is said to have the sensitivity that one laughs and cries in the same minute as we are accustomed to the great old masterpieces. The best movie of all senses of the year. 10/10
