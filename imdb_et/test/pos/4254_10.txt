I saw this movie in a short history of "art house" at the cinema '69. I found it so funny that I literally spent some of the movie on the floor, so laughing so hard that I fell out of my seat. Afterwards, years later, I thought it was Melvin Van Peebles. When I mentioned it to a friend, he said that his friend, Downey Sr., practically filled in any inactive role in the flick: director, writer producer, etc. She was right, of course, and my memory was wrong except that it was one of the films ever made. The "Arab" part was particularly invaluable.
