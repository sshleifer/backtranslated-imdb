ONE DARK NIGHT is a very remarkable and little known film from the beginning of the 80s, which deserves the audience I fear it will never, and it is a shame. I've seen this movie compared to others who have been named over the years, especially PHANTASM, HELL NIGHT and MAUSOLEUM. This is a much different film and I do not see comparisons except the mausoleum, which is a bit like PHANTASM, but not enough to make real comparisons. I'm not sure how it failed without broader approval. Maybe it's all in marketing, I don't know. Perhaps the remake would breathe life into this new life if Raymar has not let all of his life out of it. I'm not too big on all these over-re-evaluations these days, but I think they're working with less well-known movies (except the terrible GHOST SHIP remake, which apart from the opening plan and Mudvayne's Not Falling blaring) was a mess). So, if a one-night remake would go into the right hands, I think it will make a lot of people and look at the original. I know this is what I'm doing when a new movie is made that has never been seen before. So no matter what I have a remake, I'm afraid this movie won't live. Of course, if Raymar doesn't have eyes, of course. <br /> <br /> Anyway, ONE DARK NIGHT is terrible for fans, especially for the 80's horror fans (because we all know that the best horror movies were made). Creepy device. Pretty good action. Very good story. Campy. What more could you do with a horror movie from the early 1980s? What is it ... nudity and gore? Sorry. There is no nudity or gore in this movie, but it is still great! Solid 8 out of 10. Enjoy.
