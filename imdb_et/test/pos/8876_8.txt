Just think about the movie, I'm laughing at myself. Anne Ramsey plays an unforgettable part like "Momma", probably the most disgusting but fun matriarch ever hit by the film. Danny Devito and Billy Crystal make a fabulous duo, bringing the film a real warmth. Although not extremely complicated, the cute story keeps your attention and keeps you all the way laughing. It is fun to make comedy things easier and even for kids to entertain. I'll give her my complete recommendation.
