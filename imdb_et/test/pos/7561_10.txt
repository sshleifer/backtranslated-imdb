Does any company PLEASE make this movie (good +) DVD! ??? After a wonderful movie relationship and friendship, "four friends" is the only movie I've ever seen - and I've literally spent * years * watching movies! It includes the essence of the 60s experience (and I was there!): idealism, hope, freedom, confusion, betrayal and ultimately its optimistic but bittersweet denouement. And all this has been achieved, without being a story of the many revolutions of this era, although many have just touched ... as part of the tapestry. But the story is mainly about 10-15 years of character and friendship, and that they lived and deepened, despite the worrying tragedies of the decade. Absolutely joy and black film, even if there is no old hippie !!!
