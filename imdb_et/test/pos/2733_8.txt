I went to watch this movie with my family, who waited for a convincing story like 'mr. & mrs.iyer ''. And they went home thoroughly disappointed. It is also a warning to all "convincing story lovers". stay away.15 the park area does not try to answer questions or provide moral solutions on how to treat mentally challenging.if its intention is clear and clear.interviews every person, reasonable or not, a sense of reality. it even gives me some doubts about my self-expression. security, serfdom, satisfaction, what is up to me, is it really what I am or does it really create the illusion that we all desperately and sometimes unknowingly strive for the wrong console, which is in all of us in some way or not? so why does aniya do so manic that she has to show her mindset if she really is under the understanding that she is becoming a monster, are we not all who think we are "normal", really monsters and helplessly vulnerable to it deep inside? Isn't it better to be unhappy even happy to give the impression of "normality" while it weakens? Bold, mad, sincerely, that.and society marks him as "schizophrenia". Eventually confused me first, but then you realize that Meet's bravery and sincere faith took him where he wanted to go. searched, did not care what the society had to comment on its search. and it is a seemingly "real" nation - anjali, psychiatrist and jojo - who will never get anywhere. My family thinks I'm schizophrenic, trying to understand a movie that is largely "crazy" for the rest of the world.anyone is ready to believe in my reality ...........?
