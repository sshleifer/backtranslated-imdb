"Nurse Betty" is a movie that you can't describe on a poster or trailer or commercially. This is the kind of movie you walked to wait for the more mature "Dumb and Dumber" that a temporarily-anticipated waitress will go through with a cross-border adventure while avoiding the cheats that are trying to kill her. <br /> <br /> The fact is, this movie is a wonderful, heart-warming story of two pursuit of dreams. The best part about Nurse Betty is its unpredictability. Director Neil LaBute uses the brutal violence to separate the dreams from reality, and with the drama and fun comedy you can never say what will happen next.
