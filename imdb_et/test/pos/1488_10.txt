Mr. Bean has designed the face of British TV comedy. He has proven that you do not need something brilliant, that you do not need evil words or spirits, a huge budget, great intelligence, or even some intelligence. And Mr. Bean is one of those characters you just can't forget. Some of these episodes were in my stitches - yes, they're not at all realistic, and they're all pretty stupid, but to be honest, realism is one of the barriers Bean is doing to greatness. Rowan Atkinson and the cover. always manage to make interesting new ideas - and fun new gags - remember when Mr. Bean traveled from his green Mini while sitting on the couch on the roof? Mr. Bean is one of those things that will never be weak - the film was not as good as it was, but Bean has introduced a new sense of humor to the world and both children and adults admire their enormous fun factor. "Extras" and "Little Britain" may be fucking - it's British comedy at its best and original. These escapades will never get old! 10/10
