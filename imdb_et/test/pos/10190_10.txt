This program was a short while I was a kid, I remember watching it while eating fish and chips. <br /> <br /> Driving at the back of the Tron Hype was a lot of street life. manual, etc., except for more computers. There was a geeky boy who created this man's car car with his computer. He'd go for crimes and deal a lot. <br /> <br /> All I really remember was his fancy car and the little flashy cursor that used to drive a car and help him generally. <br /> If I mention it to someone, they may remember very little. Was it real or maybe a dream?
