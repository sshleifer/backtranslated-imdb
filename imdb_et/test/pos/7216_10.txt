This movie is amazing. It's funny, sexy, violent and sick, but all this together is a great Troma transfer from Romeo to Julia. If you don't mind pulling it out a bit (a lot, but it's funny), watch this movie. It's worth it! There is no level it does not offer. I've seen it three times and it's still amazing. I recommend it. Go! Get it!
