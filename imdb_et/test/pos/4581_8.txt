Mike Judge can't help but admire her hand at "I have experienced it" approach. In the "office space", almost anyone who works is associated with the signs. "Idiocracy" has exactly the same feeling. The experience of our heroes 505 years later is easy to understand because, again, the director has tried to put things on a very human level. Slightly similar to Woody Allen's "Sleeper", this movie is very funny. Don't miss out on scenes because the "Museum Museum" is classic. Imaginative comedy is a rarity and "idiocracy" is a wildly imaginative, extremely funny and solid 8.0 movie experience. - MERK
