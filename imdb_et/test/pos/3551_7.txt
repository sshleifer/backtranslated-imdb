John Barrymore plays a gentleman who is also a thief, Arsene Lupine. While no one knows for sure, the inspector (Lionel Barrymore) is confident about this, but cannot prove it. So, Lionel spends a lot of movie after John - hoping it will be a brilliant and slippery theft. <br /> <br /> Although I liked the film, I think I have more expectations about it and I thought it might be better not just a good time passer. That's because he tied John JA Lionel Barrymore and because these brothers were such dynamic actors, I thought I expected sparks and magic, but instead they only caught a glimpse here and there. Now that doesn't mean it's a bad movie - it's not sure. It just didn't rise to an unforgettable or movie that I highly recommend to see. Thanks to a sufficient script, the movie is pretty good, but I was surprised that the film did not hear any French accents, even though it was supposedly about the French people! There was no longer life in the movie until it was almost finished. The end was really great and fun - so good it made the movie from 6 to 7. It's nice to see that it ended with a high star.
