"It's not a movie" because it's so true what it says. If you ignore the plot dynamics and focus on the message, you will see a little bit of yourself in the main characters, Michael. Whether male or female, we have all come to life where we want to look back and look at the situation or relationship. Did this really happen as we remembered? What went wrong? Michael's desire to find Grace is completely selfish. More than anything, he wants to feel better about how things came out. But even so, he is a sympathetic character because everything is selfish. We wouldn't have them otherwise. When the movie ends, I'm not sure if Michael has learned something new or not. Our best relationship is through his friend Nadia. He is the soul of the film and reminds us how each story always has two sides. I found Michael to be pompous, arrogant and just plain. That's why I liked it. He's a real character. If you've ever wanted to go back and analyze an earlier relationship, it's a movie for you. Ultimately, it's a movie for everyone.
