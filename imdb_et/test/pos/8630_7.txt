I wanted to see this movie because I'm a very big Abbott and Costello fan, and when I saw it, I liked it. <br /> <br /> This movie is funny, not hysterical, but funny. I mean, I laughed at a lot of funny parts and I just enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> While this is not the best perfect man and perfect buffoon, you should see it if you really love Abbot and Costello. <br /> <br /> Of all the Abbott and Costello films I've seen, I can't say I've seen what I hated. It is decent, funny and fun. Abbott and Costello made at least some pretty decent films in their later years. <br /> <br /> Everything I liked about this movie, it's not one of their best, but I liked it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
