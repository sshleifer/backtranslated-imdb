Watch this movie to see if Shahrukh Khan says, "I love you, K-k-Kiran ..." This is both heartbreak and frightening while he says it from start to finish. This movie made him famous and I recommend it completely: D It is very entertaining, music is sad and you laugh here with Shahrukh ... You really feel that the hero and heroine and strangely feel at least one character. You feel sad and happy and relaxed while you are afraid. Go see this classic Bollywood movie for your good friends and enjoyable food and have a day. And after watching the movie, play your mind ... and forever.
