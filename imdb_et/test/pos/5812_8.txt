It was my first look at this short-lived British TV horror, but I had seen a couple of Hammer horror films (Dracula's horror, Captain Kronos: Vampire Hunter) and thought enough about them to watch it. br /> <br /> This first episode was shocking - not for horror, but for all nudity. Is this "normal" TV in England in 1980? If so, it showed much more skin than in North America. There were three separate scenes showing naked women and their breasts, one scene where a man put his hand on one and another on a man who was a woman's faking relationship. Hey, I don't complain. <br /> <br /> The story is simple: The 17th century lost witch returns to her old house and makes her husband's life difficult. The last one, Jon Finch as "David Winter", wasn't much of an actor, but his wife wasn't bad and was really beautiful. He was Prunella Gee as "Mary". Her husband was right to suspect that he had a thing and it was playing in that story. <br /> <br /> Patricia Quinn was a fun laughing witch "Lucinda Jessup" who returns to the middle. it is a good time to torture the couple until things go wrong. Like a man, I would say that it was especially fun to see two women doing it! It starts slowly, but when Lucinda starts to mix things, it becomes very fun.
