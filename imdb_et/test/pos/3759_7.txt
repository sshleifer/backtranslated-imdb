"Everything I have 5 dollars and my wedding ring ..." was a rebellion. I also defended the bar where Hyde's horse radish shook, and slipped the birds to a Japanese guy and said, "Pearl Harbor friend". I think my IQ is higher than 115, but I'm not sure I can't read that high. <br /> <br /> Funny thing, this 10 line requirement. They seem to be too long for your comments, not too short. I hope I will not do this for 1000 words before I reach line 10. <br /> <br /> I'm still two lines. Excuse me when I think and drink, or drink and think. It depends on whether my hands are faster than I think. Good, I think I have reached the line of 10 lines. Thank you for reading!
