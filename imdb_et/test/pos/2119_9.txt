Not all films are worthy of the Oscar, but to be honest, sometimes this type of movie is more fun to look at and leave a longer and lasting impression. It kept me smiling and happy and I couldn't wait for my son to hug. Anyone who has had a pet (no matter what type) knows what it feels like to lose. I believe most people would know Buddy almost their best friend, who he raised from birth. Bruce Willis was great because the tycoon changed a nice guy and Joey Lauren Adams was convincing as a good mother. The little boy who played Buddy had a cherub face and his sister and friend Edgar played terrible backups. The movie liked a lot and it was something the whole family could enjoy. Thank you!
