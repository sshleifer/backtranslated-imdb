Spoilers: this film has problems, but it finally gets the message. I liked it because it ends up in the way things actually do. A nice guy is trying and trying to break his heart several times, but in the end there is no typical Hollywood ending. It ends up in the way such things always end or at least always in your and your friends' experiences. Anyone who thinks its ending is not like it really happens, because the first comment seemed to be believing that the girl was coming around, realizing that she was acquainted with the asshole who treats her badly because she doesn't care about her at all naive or lives in a more perfect world than me. I give him 7/10, extra points just because he was not afraid to stop signing, did not give a real resolution, but the main character who stayed in the heart, confused and alone with so many people who have been countless generations.
