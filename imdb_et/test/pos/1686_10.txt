If there are people who don't like this film, I don't think they're human. This film uses all the emotions and shows the many facets of Judith Light's character. Made in 1997, this is one of the best movies I've seen and really a movie that Judith Light has played to make me a huge fan of her. This film, although sometimes you want to trust the son so much, moves incredibly. I cry at the end of every time and it takes me a lot to do! The plot doesn't have much to do with it, but the action provided by Judith Light is incredible. He looks beautiful all the time, and eventually you do not want the fate of the courts to happen to him. In general, the film that is worthy of my highest praise! Thank you for doing this and redefining your position on the death penalty. I look forward to seeing this movie out of DVD or some other form of media, because Lifetime will release some movies to customers. Although I do not have great hopes for this, it happened almost 9 years ago, which is still hard to believe, because this film has come to STILL all this time.
