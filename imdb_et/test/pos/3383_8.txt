The northern and southern parts are the "golden age" of television seminars in the 1980s, which was a time of long, great product values ​​and many stars. This is largely great for what it is, although I personally prefer less soap opera as a story and a general sense of history. <br /> <br /> James Read and Patrick Swayze offer great performances - especially Read, which George Hazard serves as an emotional anchor often in the midst of a melodramatic story. The series also includes top-notch work: Kirstie Alley, Wendy Kilbourne, Hal Holbrook, Lewis Smith, Genie Francis, Georg Stanford Brown and others. Costumes, filming, kits and music are also premium. <br /> <br /> Don't take it as a lesson in history, but take it for what it is - well done, wiping epic from the past. Year 2, which followed a year later, is also great, but I would recommend viewers to leave Book 3, which came out 8 years after Book 2, and which was almost as good as the first two parts. Books 1 and 2 are classic, even with their soapier elements, and they are worth a look.
