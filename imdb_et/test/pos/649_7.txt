In August '81, there was a huge buzz for films such as "Urban Cowboy", "Every Way Way, Loose", "Smokey and Bandit". For this reason, I suspect that the producers of this film chose "Honky Tonk Freeway" as a title that hopes that it will help the film's office receipts by pulling into the same "Urban Cowboy" crowds. Instead, "Honky Tonk Freeway" was bombed at the theater and I suspect that it works partly with a badly chosen title. Thats the same problem burdens it now with video and it's too bad because its pretty good in movie and comedy style before that time. No matter what, probably someone who remembers 1981 enjoys it. <br /> <br /> The movie was bombarded too badly. But I think it would be anyway, even if it wasn't exhausted with a bad headline. Its time for this movie. This movie could now be seen and it is obviously a father or * a big uncle for the comedies that have been done today. By day, "Honky Tonk Freeway" was full of enthusiasm and a kind of honest life that didn't become popular in comedy until much later. Although it is an "Airplane" child, it is more mature, and although it is definitely not "Knocked Up", it clearly points to that direction. The characters are "comedy mature" because they are low-key and never believe that anything they do is something other than serious. Jokes are choices to emphasize and camera views, and how to view yourself and their situations. <br /> <br /> But more than "Honky Tonk Freeway" is a real-time capsule. A great look back in the early 80s. People in this film are dressed and act like the people of 1981. It had to clearly reflect the times and be a very comedic comment about their daily lives. <br /> <br /> I don't know if my review will help you, but it's really a good, sometimes wonderful, movie to rent to see how many of today's familiar faces were when they were 30- years younger. Beverly D'Angelo is so young that she sometimes understands her. So is Beau Bridges and Terri Garr. Terry Garr was almost becoming a Hollywood toaster when his next film was "Tootsie", which eventually became his star. Howard Hessmann was arguably the biggest "current" star of the day when the film was made. In 1981, Howard Hessmann was the star of the big hit TV show "WKRP in Cinncinatti". He played his leading character, fatty at night DJ. Daniel Stern was the voice of the adult narrator in the voice of the adult narrator of almost the 80s sitcom "The Wonder Years". see Hume Crowyn and Jessica Tandy as an old couple traveling. Jessica Tandy finally got to the Oscar ten years after she was "Driving Miss Daisy". One of his final film shows is the great Geraldine page. Although he had an excellent career, he did not receive the Oscar four years later in 1985 for "Trip to Bountiful", for which he earned a lot, and he died very quickly after receiving the award. <br /> <Plus, there are many other faces in this movie, actors who are not big stars, but who have done tons of support. Many are familiar even if you can't think of your name. <br /> <br /> This movie is a pleasant little deviation. A lot of people who have various problems from different places to everyone because of their individual, independent reasons, all of which are vaguely in the way of the Altman-Esko to Floridian and fail to know that they are in the small town of Ticlaw. Florida, what happens is that it rolls out of the consequences of a recently built interstate distance evasion that did not build a way out of Ticlaw, which leads out of the city map. <br /> <br /> And this is what this film talks about, an enchanting idea of ​​the whole transnational system that was only recently completed. It had taken a generation to build, from the 1960s congressional authorization until years when different parts were built and then "went live", and by the end of 1980, most of the system was built and all united, and first connected for the first time the promise of what a transnational system was would have changed. And people admired it. By 1980, everyone was pretty much a "transnational road veteran" in the sense that everyone had used parts by then and knew how it worked and how it was different from other roads because it had no red lights or stops. and ramps, and that it went to less accessible places earlier. By 1980, everyone could travel anywhere comfortably, without having to stop anything except eating and sleeping and bathing. And it was all new. <br /> <br /> The end is anti-climatic and it is not satisfactory, although it is a remarkable moment. The great thing about it is that it is not a destination that makes Honky Tonk Freeway time-out, despite being a product of that day. Forget its title; Instead, let yourself end up in the memory lane.
