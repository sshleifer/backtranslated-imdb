Hilary was great as julie, and Pat was great again, like Mr Miyagi, but there should have been more references to the other three films! I mean, come on! First, where is Daniel! Miyagi mentions her very briefly, and that's it. Daniel was his best friend and should have appeared at least on the film. He could have helped Miyagi train Julie-San! On the flip side, however, the music was stuck, but with a little bit more instrumentation (Fretless Bass), which sent great Pan-Flute! It doesn't recognize the Karate Kid movie if you haven't heard of this Pan-Flute! Thank you Zamfir! In general, it's a good movie! We miss you Noriyuki!
