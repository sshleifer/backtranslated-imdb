Having seen only once and at dawn, I don't seem to forget about the forgetting movie. Mystery, intercourse and heartbreaking romance that resembles Vertigo. Participants, though not so well-known, are particularly good at Joan Hacket in one of his best performances. You believe in him, in his love, in his new quest for freedom brought about by his love and ultimately by his overwhelming pain. The plot is brilliant and convincing and does not stretch the credibility. Direction and technical issues can certainly be better, but they do not compromise the overall impact. And it has one message: don't let revenge go blind, you will be the last victim. It is a real pity that it has not been rebuilt, but perhaps it is a period that is better left alone.
