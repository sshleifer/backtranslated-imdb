This is one of my favorite books and I remember watching this series and loving it enormously. Unfortunately, I have never seen it repeatedly or have accessed a DVD, but it had the effect that I have never forgotten. <br /> <br /> Words were perfect for roles, especially lovely Bryan Brown, and although scenes in Australia were not fully in line with the book, they were at least there, unlike the Virginia McKenna movie game that was out of this section. <br /> <br /> I agree that Gordon Jackson's Strachan character is completely different from the book, but he is still great. For information, "MOLEY75" is "Strawn" "Strachan" Gaelic pronunciation.
