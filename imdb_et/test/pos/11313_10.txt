I liked this movie. I watched it last night in a broadcast system. The part I liked was that they were dealing with today's problems not in the future or in the past. In principle, they had some commercials taken by terrorists or two and rented them as car bombs. I think what the film might have been, people in different countries at the same time. It showed the fact that England or some other country is not ready for the attack they showed. I've never heard of the actors or actors in the movie, so I can't really tell if they're usually part of them. After the film, this group of experts was told if something could happen here in the US. It was a thoughtful debate!
