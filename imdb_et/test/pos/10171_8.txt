Alfred Hitchcock's safer saying he did twenty-one years earlier is higher than the original. Hitchcock said his first version was the work of amateurs, and although it is certainly not a bad film, he seems to be right. Nevertheless, this is not a transformation, although certainly better, still Hitchcock's best work. It does not necessarily mean that it is not good, it is just over a bit overwhelming and it pulls it down. Hitchcock seems too enthusiastic about dragging certain elements, and these are parts of the film that are not completely relevant to the plot and can become annoying. Some of these sequences, such as eating James Stewart and Doris Day in a Moroccan restaurant, are good because it helps to create the different culture that our American protagonists have found, but for every restaurant scene there is an opera queue and this is the last one that makes the movie worse. <br /> <br /> The plot follows a medieval doctor and his wife who go to Morocco to rest with their son. From there, they meet on the bus with a French man and in the restaurant some other middle-aged couple. But things go crazy when a French man dies behind a knife behind whispering to a doctor. Then the holiday becomes a full-blown nightmare when the couple's son is kidnapped, causing them to be short cut and going to London to find him and find him. The film has a very strong paranoia and it can keep it going all the time. In fact, I would even like to say that this is the most paranoid film ever made by Hitchcock. Like most Hitchcock films, it is very exciting and keeps you on the edge of your seat for almost the entire duration, only the above-mentioned opera sequence differs from the moment the tension is spread. The film also has more than a little humor that easily relieves the illness and actually works quite well. <br /> <br /> The original version of this story was an excellent St. Petersburg support for Lorre. Unfortunately, this film does not benefit from its presence, but it is made up of amazing James Stewart and Doris Day. James Stewart is a man who is always the winner for the biggest actor of all time. In her collaboration with Hitchcock, all her memorable performances and it is no different. (Although his best results remain with Mr Smith in Washington). Stewart passes on the courage, conviction, and conscience of a man who has lost his child and does something to get him back. In fact, this is one of the best things about this movie; you are really able to feel a couple of losses throughout this time and it will make it even more exciting. But Doris Day is a rather strange choice for this film. He's definitely a good actor, but he's more involved with musicals and his eyesight on the thriller is quite strange (even when he starts to bend his vocal chords a bit). <br /> <br /> As I mentioned; this is not Hitchcock's best film, but it's a lot to enjoy, and although I would recommend a lot of Hitchcock movies before, I'll definitely give two thumbs.
