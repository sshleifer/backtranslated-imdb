I remember this movie as a boy watching and I was totally scared of it, I couldn't watch the TV. This movie has all the fear for fans! This movie was not funny moments to wait for a few single liners by stooge (who was my favorite character movie) kevin tenney directed this gemstone and did a wonderful job with low budget, i thought eventually it was fantastic the only thing that could stop them was that they were surviving at night when they were unstoppable killing machines! The effects of Steve Johnson, which we are excellent, would recommend this movie to anyone who loves low budget horror films because, like the old saying, they don't make them like that. The queues were pretty good, but not as good as the original. It must be in any horror collection, buy it when you find that you don't have to be disappointed
