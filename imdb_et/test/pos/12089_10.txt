I've been away from Istanbul in the last 10 years. During this time I lived in London constantly. When I saw the movie, I realized how much I was in Istan. I am not only from Turkey, but from Turkey. One part of me is Istanbul, the people of Istanbul, the people of Istanbul. <br /> <br /> Fain Akin probably thought he'd made a lot of musical documentary, but I have to say it's more. It is a great mix of music, cultures, approaches, politics, ethnic mixing with a tasty pot ... <br /> <br /> As we all know that Turkey is accurate, it always comes to Istanbul and it is an eastern or western city. One band member said Istanbul is a bio-cultural city. But much more is the eastern city because we always tried to be a western city. This shows that we have never been. <br /> <br /> This movie will start in the first second. Music is great, people are interesting. Especially Aynur and Sezen Aksu. Singers, band members! It's nice to see you all in the small cinema Wood Green.
