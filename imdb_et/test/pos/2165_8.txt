Although it is a good, enjoyable comic, they did much better later than Carrotblanca. It is almost like the first Star Trek feature that would have been open to open hands and joy, no matter what, only for existing ones. This is really the number of old bits with some nice touches, but something special. Reminds me of some hunting trilogy in the spots and the end is invaluable. Available and definitely worth watching only for novelty and good bits. Recommended.
