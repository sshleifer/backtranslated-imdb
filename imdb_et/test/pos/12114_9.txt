Yes, I know Roscoe Arbuckle didn't like being called "fat," but I couldn't stand it. <br /> <br /> This is a fine Lloyd Hamilton, who is short of his peak, directed by Roscoe. Two works make many good gags and Roscoe's usual focus on capturing an interesting picture. Most comedies preferred flat lighting and a camera to make them more interesting. Roscoe uses a couple of long tracking frames and some nice cameras to tell her story and show her a fine actor, as well as a talented comedian. <br /> <br /> This story plays interesting topics like Lloyd's classic MOVE ALONG: here's the perception of reality and the confusion that films make of them. Or you can ignore such questions and laugh at your head.
