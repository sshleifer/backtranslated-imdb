Mike Judge's idiocracy is an interesting film and what her fans will definitely watch and see. <br /> <br /> Before starting the review, I would say this before, saying that if you have the opportunity to see it, definitely, as it is remarkable, it is not the easiest movie in the world to go down to. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the premise - Luke Wilson is a private sector Joe Bauers, an army librarian who is said to have no outstanding qualities or outstanding mistakes, making him absolutely average. This, along with the fact that he has no living relatives, makes him an extraordinary candidate for experimental cryogenic procedure. Joe also has a frozen prostitute Rita, whom Upgrayedd, her abusive pimp. Unfortunately, a few days after their freezing, the ultimate secret project has been abandoned and they are forgotten. <br /> <br /> They wake up in 2505 and find that, with the slipping of society in recent times, all the people on Earth are only somewhat more intelligent than the chimp. Just like "everyman" Joe Bauers speaks, it is considered "nervous", as someone who talks about Shakespeare would now be ridiculous and the former professional wrestler is the president of the United States (in fact this is probably not terrible) really). The best TV show is called "Ow! My Balls!", Which sounds pretty good, and not just misspelled, but the characters seem to be empty for the wording. this is a funny prerequisite for the film, but this is a problem - besides the initial assumption, not so much in the movie is really funny. What I mean is that ideas coming from reading a movie's premise are probably as funny as the movie itself. Obviously, this is not terrible, but apparently it could have been funny. <br /> <br /> There are some winners in the script, such as Starbucks, who now offer a "happy ending", and people who put blind faith in a universally misunderstood "electrolytes", but they are too little and far, so if you do not start to laugh hysterically every time one of the future idiots splits the jaw, a frighteningly loaded sentence is little or no logical and / or intelligent, then laugh may be quite well placed. <br /> <br /> It is unfair if everyone compares it to Office space because it is a very different film, but as a movie, whatever it was, Idiocracy is a funny concept that is likely to laugh much more at opening 15-20 minutes as the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> I give it to 5 out of 10 because it is enjoyable but doesn't do it to raise it in the middle of the road.
