SPOILER ALERT !!! <br /> <br /> You can listen to Wong Kar-wai movies like radio play: invisible vibrations between characters, the spaces where they are, the rhythm that pushes them, the attraction and the pleasure - the whole soundtrack plays in the atmosphere. Dialogue is mostly totally irrelevant. Talking is like a childish gracious look to a beautiful woman and a sad person whose sorrows are noticeable but helpless. "In the Mood For Love" speaks from the child's perspective, but the child never appears as a narrator. The aesthetics of the film have been developed with dramatic drama of extreme light and color, harsh cuts, unconfirmed, almost documentary camera and sophisticated, unobtrusive sound. <br /> <br /> Nat King Cole's "Maybe Maybe", whose mysterious power grows, the more often it is repeated and the melancholic waltz helps in the choreography of both protagonists. Maggie Cheung in her beautiful dresses is great, perfect with visual, stylish Tony Leung. Audience requires romance between them, but Wong just looks sad to resign. Two potential lovers rotate around each other like satellites, knowing that they never have the same orbit. You want them to find each other. They can't and the emotional power of their non-love-sex relationship makes the film tremendously exciting. <br /> <br /> This is a spoil of luck and unspoken love. All of Wong's films have these motifs. Love, whether it comes too early or too late to take one and not another person. Never longing for complacent stars, their loneliness, grief and happiness they experience when it's too late.
