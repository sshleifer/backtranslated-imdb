A great story for all families to see. The story, action and product values ​​are all the first. I highly recommend that "Checking Out!" <br /> <br /> Peter Falk is wonderful as an aging actor who wants to decide when he will die so he can continue to know how things will end and not be a "member of the audience." His three children are traveling in New York to receive him and try to change his mind. Of course, it is necessary to solve outstanding family issues and the script and participants communicate with them well and with great humor. <br /> <br /> The story tells about the Jewish family, but it can easily be about another family. Well, maybe not the WASP family. The siblings have problems with each other and with their father. I loved writing and leadership as well as actress. All in all, it is a humorous and touching film.
