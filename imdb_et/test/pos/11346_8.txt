A beautiful film, created in 1962 in Hong Kong with a man (Mr. Chow) and a woman (Mrs. Chan) who become close friends when they doubt that their spouses have a thing. Stylistically, the film is also beautiful. Wong Kar-Wai uses a lot of body movement (legs, hands, waist) and close-ups. The film has its own time duration and determination. It's sexy without showing everything. Wong Kar-Wai does not allow the audience to see what the spouses look like, suggesting that Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan should be together. Smoking has even been done to look elegantly with smoke curls. Really cute movie. Just get ready for the end. <br /> <br />
