Beautiful, emotional and exquisite. I look at this movie in an art center with a smaller screen space of 95% of the elderly. I want a bigger cinema like Lowes to see here. Great cinema Wong and Christopher Doyle. Since I understand Cantonese, I find it much easier to understand the film. As simple as the story goes, many English-speaking viewers didn't get the whole story. The three older lady's next to me hold on and have no clues about the film. They were surprised when I mentioned that Mr. Chow was sleeping with Mrs. Chen and they had a son. He went to Singapore, trying to tell him, but he didn't. <br /> <br /> Spoiler <br /> <br /> The movie's Mandarin translation actually means flourishing like a moment or a memory. The phrase commonly used to describe a beautiful and wonderful memory that was uneven and short. The whole movie often matches the title. Not to mention the floral "Cheung Sam". It looks so beautiful, the sun shines on the old and faded wall, at night in the dark, in the rain, in a truly poetic moment. I felt a strong sense of intimacy about their relationship, seeing them against the wall and talking quietly. I felt a terrible heartache when Mr Chow tried his leaving moment, and Mrs. Chen cried on the shoulder .... Bravo Wong Kar-Wai! <br /> <br /> As much as I like, Chungking Express is still my favorite. But I give it to 10. CTHD became the starting point only 7. <br /> <br /> If you love art, you will love this movie. Don't miss it.
