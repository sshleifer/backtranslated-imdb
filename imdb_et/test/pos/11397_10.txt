Boogie Nights is one of the best films coming out of the 90s and I'm going so far as to say it should be in the top 250 of the IMDb. I actually understand why many do not like this topic. Personally, however, I, like many, feel that this film has been accepted by viewers and critics, that it is a huge film making. <br /> <br /> The direction and action of this movie goes well and reaches the level of brilliance. this is not the scene in this movie that is not amazing. Individual characters reach and touch you. Given that it is a film about the porn industry, it does not mean that the sexual scene can be treated with such sensitivity, but they are. The direction is one of the best I've ever seen - and I've seen many movies. <br /> <br /> The film does not speak of one's personal story, it is about many. people who have many layers of them and who may find the alien most in the industry, but who still dream of the same dreams and who have both bad and good. Boogie Nights pulls you from the beginning and even though the movie is long (I believe almost 3 hours), you don't even notice. And when it ends, you don't want it .... <br /> <br /> I am not easy to impress, which means that there are not many movies I would give out of 10 out of 10 but this is one. In addition to a multivariate study, the use of music is in the film. I have never seen musicians have music in the story as well. There was such a flawless one, you know it's not something your everyday looks like. <br /> <br /> Burt's reynold's performance was perhaps the best I've ever seen, and Mark Wahlberg is incredible (I'm surprised that there are still people who say he's not doing well. I don't know how anyone might be thinking about it), but the person who really surprised me was Heather Grahem (Rollergirl), who is absolutely fantastic in his role, especially one memorable scene with Burt Reynolds in the limo. <br /> <br /> Also includes other IMDb reviewers saying that this movie is not for everyone. But I think it was 10.
