SPOILERS AHEAD ?? In the first ten minutes of Star Witness, we introduce a typical American-American family called the Unnamed City, another way to say the Warner Brothers NYC version. Except for the little kids, including the charming Dickie Moore, and the sly Sally Blane, they're pretty tough and their dinner table conversation is annoying and we want the story to go and take note of Walter Huston. Wait, people, wait. All of the sudden serious gangster movie actions break, pulling the family against their will, and after that the child will never let. There's a relationship, an Oscar-set script, a good actor; all you want the old movies to be here. I ask Chic sales performance; he must have a taste, but his presence is crucial for the plot. He's got a credit for a special status, so Warner Bros has really been very high in Sale, but how his dirty old man's routine fits with the public, something has gone missing for me. Maybe it's a lost time, an unknown factor you had to understand as a 1931 filmmaker. The climax is also usually melodramatic. However, it is now the best release of the studio in the year I've seen so far (but I've only seen eight, so maybe it's an unclear view). Don't miss it when TCM shows it. 8 out of 10.
