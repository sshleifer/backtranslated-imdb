I first saw Heimat 2 in BBC2 in the 90s when I was at an art college who lived and moved among artists and musicians, hoping for success in the future. So The Second Home - a group of friends made after leaving the family - strives for professional excellence - resonating strongly with my living reality. I liked the characters, storytelling, lyrical camera work and, above all, music. In this, I can worship the beginning of German electronic music, the 50th Stockhausen, Kraftwerk, Canist, Neue, the 70s Faust, John Cage, Walter Carlos, and the British Electronic Psychiatry The White Noise. Nikos Mamangakis, the composer of the soundtrack, studied with the famous Carl Orff of Carmina Burana, so I found it in the world of modern electronic pop / sound effects. <br /> <br /> I did not see Heimat or Heimat 3, so I looked at it as a whole before or after. As someone else has commented, it is both epic and lyrical - historical and artistic. Many favorite moments, including Gisela Muller (Evelyn), Daniel Smith (Juan) Bach Marimba, Henry Arnold (Hermann) Piano and Salome Kammer (Clarissa) cello piano. <br /> I can write more, but here it has been said. Why can't British or US TV produce ALL MASTERPIECIs? Wire had realism and politics, and epic sweeping in the city, David Lynch and Dennis Potter also had their own creative slings on serial television, but this is an art house and soap in the most cinematic and narrative majesty. It is never included in the selection of critics of the best films, but it should be. Still so poetic and powerful when I saw it for the first time over 17 years ago. I look at each of the 3 boxes placed in the fall setting their "fertile fertility". Inspired and inspiring.
