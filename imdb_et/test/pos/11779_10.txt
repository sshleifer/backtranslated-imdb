I killed this little pearl completely randomly in 1980 or '81. I was at a revival theater to see two old silly sci-fi movies. The theater was full and (without warning) they showed a series of sci-fi short spoofs (to get the mood). Most of them were somewhat amusing, but it came and after a few seconds the audience was hysterical! The biggest laughter was when they showed that "Princess Laia" had big cinnamon instead of head hair. He looks at the camera, smiles and carries. It made it even more fun! You have to see "Chewabacca" played by Muppet! It was very stupid and stupid ... but I couldn't laugh. Most of the dialogue drowned because of the laughter. Even if you know "Star Wars" pretty well, it's even funny - they want some kind of dialogue. It really works with the audience! Sure 10!
