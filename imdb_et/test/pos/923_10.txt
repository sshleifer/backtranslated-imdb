Well every scene is so perfectly presented. Never before have I seen such a film that has meaning in almost every scene. <br /> <br /> Well, when I saw this movie, I remember watching Amilie. Amilie is also a similar movie with more fun and fantasy. These films are based on both figures. But both of them are perfectly perfect in their own way and are able to create their own world. <br /> <br /> Red can provoke a lot of thoughts in people about fate and dejava s. And I still mean it. <br /> <br /> The story is big and the ending is a little funny. I laughed at the end. Well, it's funny how the three Red White and Blue movies are connected. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a great work of art. Master's work. <br /> <br /> 10/10
