That's why my video store box has been rented out. It seemed to the boys to see the cool side, so I had to try it. I was pleasantly surprised when I actually looked at it as an Evil Dead fan. Swedish makers must be fans as well as many references in this masterpiece. The offender is trying to penetrate Evil Ed into the house that finally made her crazy and says "groovy" when she looks at her weapon, as Bruce Campbell does when she quits her chainsaw with Evil Dead. many posters of this movie, scattered between the house and the office in the movie. They're not just talking to Evil Dead because there is a Gremlin-style doll tower located in Edi's refrigerator. My personal favorite is when he pursues his wife's house and says, "I'll come to you Barbra", which you don't know that Barbra's brothers are "Living Dead Night". This film has a lot of good land, cool signs, funny things (Gremli doll), frightening things (demonist), great effects (exploding head) and a fair amount of female nudity. I only gave it to 9 because his slow time before Ed was crazy, but it's worth waiting for. So if you liked "Evil Dead 2" or any of the other films mentioned above, you need to rent it and watch it with a freestyle, and when you do try "Brain Dead" because I hear it is similar to this masterpiece. <br /> <br />
