I've enjoyed this movie since I first saw it in theater. Some movies have the perfect synergy symbol and script that is one of them. The characters illustrate some truths about the best use of people, harmonious cooperation, team building and achievement of goals without proclaiming morality. The situation is well-designed and compatible with the opening space of the movie. Tensions are nicely built and humor is clean and consistent. The film can be pulled up from the characters and laughs pretty well. It feels like a good movie as good as they come. <br /> <br /> What is surprising to me is that a film that appears so simple can be such a long-lasting entertainment. Music is a perfect copy of music in typical serious post-war naval films that help to create humor and emphasize that greatness is in the eyes of the viewer. The credit scenes are a great music video "In the Navy" that deserves the distinctive features of your full screen. Scenes and cuts are well designed and casting and acting are right. <br /> <br /> This movie is classic as big as ever made, without any claims. In fact, the lack of a prediction makes it a lot of fun. I love these guys and gal. <br /> <br /> On the second day I was thinking about the movie and wondering if it was available on DVD. Happiness has come to us and the DVD came out in May 2004. I went to the store and caught a copy. Then I enjoyed my wife and a big night of fun in front of a big screen. I've rated this movie for 10 because it's all at all levels, much better than many high budget movies and Oscar winners. It's entertainment. <br /> <br /> Listen to Fox's home video: you have a good movie in your vaults, and it's a shame to find a cheap shot DVD that has badly broken toner colors just 8 years after release. Why not restore colors and play a movie as it was meant to be visible? I'd be happy to pay a few dollars more to get a better picture. I am grateful that I have my copy. Now give us the candy the film deserves and how to restore the credit sequence as a special feature of full-screen music video.
