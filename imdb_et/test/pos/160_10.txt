Not nervous, but because of the intricate, inventive uses of vampire mythology, beautiful visual extremes, interesting and peculiar characters, this is one of the most amazing fears I've ever seen. It coincides with the symbols with a perfect madness, but never seems to be expediently exploiting or terrible. There's a lot of bloodshed with some nasty sucking and splashing, but also the fine moments where you laugh out loud. As he tends to do, Chan-wook Park keeps a lot of time and plot in your midst and a situation where you have to complete yourself by forcing your story and signs. <br /> <br /> And there's a lot of literal leaps. They vampire myths (intended), they have supernatural strength and they can almost jump high buildings in one volume (phrase coin). The first time our heroine carries the priests of dusky vampires over the top of the buildings, he has all the magical romance of Lois Lane and Superman, but this romance is becoming more and more annoying, but is driven by a strange and controversial love relationship. not just horror. <br /> <br /> The actor is great, especially OK-vin Kim, a prestigious actor in female leadership, at 22, showing a remarkable range. The character is limited to the type of the film room of a widow. He takes care of the innocent to blame the evil spirit when he is absolutely convinced. This is really smooth and nervous performance. <br /> <br /> If you love true art in horror or are an Oldboy fan - don't wait for the video to watch it right away.
