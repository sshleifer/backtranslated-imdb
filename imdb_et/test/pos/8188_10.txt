This film is beautiful in many ways: plot, depth of characters, stunning photography and acting, colossal-like scenes of scenes (there are no computer graphics, only thousands of people). Someone said the story was related to the tragedies of Sheakespearian. I also find some links with the tradition of the tragedy in Greece. Emperor, exceptionally active, struggles between power and love, but he is forced (with greater interest, for the will of his ancestors) to choose power (and loneliness, hatred of his subjects) as his own destiny. He, like Creon Antigones, was a good man before he became emperor. After gaining power, he must be merciless and cruel to protect and expand the empire (with innocent children, his mother, father, etc.). Under the power, he carries a monster. All in all, Qin is the majestic tragedy of the Emperor. <br /> <br /> The assassin is moving in a different direction: towards pure evil and heroism and morality. Even this character is compelled for its fate through love and new ethics. This character is also unforgettable. Lady Zhao, the wonderful Gong Li, is corrupt morality, neither power nor love nor hatred. He is a morality against power, somehow like Antigone. His conspiracy (against and against the emperor) is always a moral idea. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a great movie. If you love cinema and want to try Chinese movies, you can start here.
