Giant Robot was the most popular Japanese television show ever seen on Indian TV. It was aimed at children and we saw the robot for the first time in our lives. <br /> <br /> Many Indian children have had to see the textbooks for the first time at school. The series also showed a child in an adult organization that fights against evil. There is no doubt that many of us who have seen Giant Robot in our childhood are the same for our own robots. <br /> <br /> This exhibition also featured ideal adults (referring to Jerry, Johnny's girlfriend and Unicorn leader Azumale). We grew up to respect Japan's progress and look at Japan for the ideal Asian people. <br /> <br /> BTW, at that time, in India there were no satellite TV channels and the government broadcasters did not show much of Disney cartoons. I think this was how the baby's series like the giant Robot got. Nowadays, Pokemon, etc., are not as interesting or tempting as the Giant robot.
