They say that in horror movies it is always better to leave things to the viewer's imagination to hide from the audience certain details in order to feel their imagination, beat their fears and let them give birth to their darkest thoughts. <br /> <br /> It wasn't as I watched Bakjwit under American title. Now you play in selected nearby theaters. It seems that filmmakers did not want to save you any details. There's blood in this movie and you're trying to look. <br /> <br /> Please visit http://without-terebi.blogspot.com/2009/08/thirst-aka-bakjwi for the rest of the review. Thanks and hope you enjoyed reading the above.
