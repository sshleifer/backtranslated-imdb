Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman play Adele and Ann August, a single mother who defines the work of the word "dreamer" and her solemn, pragmatic daughter. Adele, who wants to start off in the big city, moves them from Wisconsin to California. <br /> <br /> Decent, if not exceptional, or especially memorable, with some serious and sad moments. It pushes some emotional buttons, that's for sure. The best thing it offers is solid cast and Sarandon and Portman are good at guiding - even if their characters are sometimes one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> It may be better, it may be worse. > <br /> I gave it one in ten out of ten.
