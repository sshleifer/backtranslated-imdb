Darr is a great movie! Shahrukh plays an obsessed person who does almost everything to win his lady, which in this case is Juha Chawla. The driver knows in the film that Shahrukh has his main break and is constantly pursuing him. I have to admit that some of the things he did in this movie were pretty crappy ... like threatening phone calls. I will never forget this line in my life: "I love you K..k..k..Kiran!" <br /> <br /> Too bad that Shahrukh and Juhi were not exactly "with" the movie. But Driver and Sunny make a good pair in the movie. Though the role of Shahrukh was quite psychotic, I think he did this great job and couldn't imagine someone else doing that role. No wonder he got a 94 'Darr! <br /> <br /> Driver ... what can I say? She looks especially amazing in this movie! It is not that he does not always see amazing in his films, but Darr gave his public a wonderful picture! <br /> <br /> About music ... it was great! Especially "Jaadu Teri Nazar", one of my favorite songs of all time. I also thought "Tu Mere Samne" was pretty nice. <br /> <br /> Must see everyone! Generally Darr deserves 9/10!
