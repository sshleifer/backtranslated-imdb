Beautiful woman, shrubs, inbred monster man, super sweet monster truck, tea kill zombie brother and 2 friends ... one anal retentive, too sensitive nerd and another unpleasant mouth, adolescent slob. Throw them all with a Jeepers Creepers, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and a Road Trip dash and you have a Monster Man. Funny horror / comedy that never wants to say anything. It's simple, straight forward laughs. Disturbed and well done, this horror / comedy is in your heart, friend. This movie offered some fun and sick pieces. I recommend scaring it to fans who want to offer entertainment.
