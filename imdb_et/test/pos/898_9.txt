I have so much hope for Gen-X's sequel. Fortunately, my hopes have been met. You have a whole bunch of activities, comedy ... silly comedy and surprises. I think the newcomer Edison has really hit the movie, but I really think Sam 'Alien' is stupidly annoying in English. Although the film had robot graphics and flaws in the silly dialogue, this activity always keeps it strong. The action set is much stronger than the first one. <br /> <br /> This movie is more of an American lesson because 60% of the movie is in Cantonese English. This movie won't cheat you. I recommended it to young people who do not care about a clean package. <br /> <br />
