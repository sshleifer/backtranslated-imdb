It was a good actor for a good movie and it keeps your attention until the end. Maybe people are both tired and uncomfortable, so that's so much. It can also be too deep for many of the viewers out there who provide higher ratings for the American Pie series. <br /> <br /> Jake Gyllenhaal is a CIA analyst, not an agent who follows the interrogation by an Egyptian man from Morocco, not by the Egyptians. He should not be a hardened agent and so it must be na√Øve to the proclamation techniques. It's more plausible than if he were with an "old hat". <br /> <br /> The story jumps a bit and may be confusing, but it also makes you focus on what's going on until the end when everything comes together when the puzzle comes in. Supporting participants did a good job of carrying the film. I found the film to be powerful and thought-provoking.
