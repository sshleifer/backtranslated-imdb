I couldn't help the whole CAT assumption, because it explains conscientiously that the director has always been crazy about seeing people who have been killed in films made in the past. Even daily activities such as cooking in a microwave or running a water mixer in the past provide some terrible meat industries in the movie. Director Fulci plays himself, led by SODOM GHOSTS (?) And does not seem to be constantly murdered by his mental well-being. He is looking for help from a psychiatrist who instead uses Fulc's job as a line of innocent people, hypnotizing the director's thinking that he may be responsible. Fulc's reputation, while exploring the topics of such a profession that causes so much death and destruction, rarely untamed, can shape and shape the heritage. The film has a lot of switching tale about the surrounding graphic violence, where there is every chance to kill a woman, which is expressed in terribly detail. Hitchcock can never look for it and probably won't want it. Fulci Fulci (.. I know) mentally congratulates the film on the mental state during working hours. Reality and cinema are merged and Fulci can't escape. The end (... explains the old clich√©: "It's just a movie") couldn't work better than here. The Fulci boat says to Perversion (.. a great touch) and he sails off. I just want it to be his last movie because it's the perfect closeness when ever it was. David L Thompson is a frustrated psychiatrist who is going to kill his adulterous wife. Jeoffrey Kennedy is the fears of a policeman Fulc, a family murdered by fear. <br /> <br /> Ultra-violence in the movie contains many unique ways to take your head, such as the chest door, cunt, chainsaw and hatchback. The most brutal violence is due to the nasty hacksaw action, because the dead body is hacked into pieces (.. how the gardener's chainsaw works with a log in a beautifully horrible hallucination sequence) .. the most shocking use of a chainsaw is a little boy going blank! Open the scene where the puppet cat destroys, Fulci's brain, is a beater. The scenes that have been put together in the film are astounding with Fulci's view, are obvious, but I could not enjoy it.
