I remember when this movie came out and watched it a few times with VHS. I was so happy when it finally appeared on the DVD. I was hoping for a wide screen, but at the moment I took what was available. I love how they used color in the movie, the outdoor conditions are so alive with color. Trees are greens I've ever seen. Most of the movie was shot in Stillwater, Minnesota, a beautiful town in St. Petersburg. On the Croix River. They have to have really studied places for filming, because they did a great job. The story is well written and directed. I would appreciate it as one of Peter Horton's best. I am also surprised that Andrew Dintenfass (Director of Photography) has not yet done so. He did an incredible job. The operator also appreciates there. It is amazing to see that two such young players remove this type of movie. Annabella Sciorra did a great job for Dexter's mother. Who wouldn't want her mother.
