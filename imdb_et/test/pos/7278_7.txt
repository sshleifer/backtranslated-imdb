After reading the terrible reviews of this movie, including the comments quoted by Colin, I almost didn't want to add this movie to my Firth Film Collection, though I was a better intrigue of the Firth Fan I am! <br /> <br /> To my surprise, I enjoyed the movie thoroughly. It had a temporary, drama and intrigue, and V.sexy Colini's scene. The plot kept me right until the end of the credit and I felt that when Jennifer Rubens opened the scene, the actor played a convincing role. Colin was as brilliant as ever and his great vision of him playing "Dark Side", "Chill went to my back" and after watching I can't wait for Colins' latest movie "Trauma on? DVD. <br /> < br /> OK, maybe it was not a movie that was "on your face" so spoken and no one could "sleep" on the plot, especially until it was done, but that was what I liked, the actor was fine, luckily not superfluous (like many temporary thrillers), it made the movie even colder, one just couldn't guess what Colins characterizes (Ross Talbert), or that Jennifer Rubens's character (Jamie Harris) was going to do next , and there were quite a few surprises, sitting around the edge of my seat, comfortable with the pillow !! <br /> <br /> I personally am very happy to have looked at the "Playmaker" and I will definitely look again. The fan would benefit from watching this movie if they don't like the plot, just look at Colin ;-))
