Great performance. There are still good actors! Also great management and photography. Very true to Shakespeare and "keeps" for all Shakespeare fans. Macbeth (Jason Connery) brought me tears with my final monologue (out of a short candle, out). He gave the human face of moral decay and dark forces, which makes it more interesting. Helen Baxendale is a very believable lady, Macbeth, who from time to time can be very cheerful and sometimes looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in blood and evil. If you love death and disintegration and Shakespeare's words ... that's it.
