Dakota Incident is a curiosity for many reasons. From the very beginning, it is obvious that this has been done long before anyone thought of political correctness. Although Ward Bond's mark softens the edge, "maybe we can communicate with them, even after they are people," is the type of dialogue. His part stands side by side with the preacher who communicates with the soldiers of the world. Actually, it's crazy. The title is curious. The use of the word "incident" helps the film's importance and complexity, which apparently did not damage the boxoffice. The designed assortments and Linda Darnell's gorgeous dress and hat are wonderful dated touches that make the Dakota Incident a cold western object since the mid-fifties.
