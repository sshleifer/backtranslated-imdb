As a big fan of Dostoevsky, I was always disappointed with Hollywood's attempts to reach Russia's romantic aesthetics, Yul Brynner Dmitry Karamazovina. I thought the whole problem was a bad casting decision, but then I saw Yul as Major Major and changed my thoughts. If he is given a smart script to work, he suddenly came to life and was so noble, sexy and inconsistent if you ever wanted a neurotic Russian officer! So he was better Dmitry than Major Surov when he was Dmitry. But it is because the writer Tabor actually gave Yul to be a controversial Russian officer such contradictory Russian officer lines that are worth the true literature and have a true meaning and sin in them. For example, he says folk music, deliberately: "You hear a person cry in the dark. And if you listen carefully enough, you know what he's crying for. You'll be surprised, Lady Ashmore. There's always time for music. "Brilliant !! <br /> <br />
