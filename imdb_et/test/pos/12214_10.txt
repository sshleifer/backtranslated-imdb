I do not think that 60 percent of voters voted this exhibition ten times how hell is five points eight, which I can't do, its totally pathetic I mean how. anyway the show is great that the story is great and the characters are interesting, definitely ten out of ten, i think the creatures are cool, they look great and i wish i would have a great show excellent cgi. The first season was unanswered and when the names are bigger than the rest of the creatures are big, why is the rating so low when the voices were so high <br /> <br /> 10/10
