I have not seen many people who have been offering theater from Star Wars Episode III. Both exhibitions have been sold out and for good reasons. The man with the screaming brain was the best film that was seen by the crowd. (Hey, I'm a horn.) Bruce Campbell was there and he had all the crowds in the sewing! The film was the best possible way. This can be a more fun movie Bruce has done. Ted Raimi steals an exhibition with her Bulgarian hip hop and natural facial expressions, she's a laugh! Who knew Ted could be rap? <br /> <br /> I changed my mind, the person who stole the show was actually a robot. Nothing is more fun than a robot ... doing a robot. <br /> <br /> Bruce's performance: "I'll take the fifth." Thanks to Bruce. Thank you for being cool, thanks for taking the time, thank you for all the fun.
