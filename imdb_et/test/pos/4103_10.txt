It amazes me that manufacturing companies meet because they do not produce reproduction. I've been looking for this movie on DVD for some time and VHS for years. It's possible to get all kinds of movies ... old movies, new movies ... but it's all geared to a specific group. This film is very nostalgic for many. I'm not sure why I can't get a copy. Perhaps, if enough people are written, the copyright owner will get a hint. It's time for this to happen. Yes, this is the date, but so is the OZ wizard. It doesn't seem so difficult. So, I currently see those illegal copies in search engines like many others.
