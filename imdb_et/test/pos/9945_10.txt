When I grew up, Voyage to Space was my favorite movie. I remember the time when KTLA (Channel 5) ran the movie all week and I and my sisters watched it every day! I still remember every part of this movie. The end was as sad as the Giant Robot with Guillotine and then Johnny Sokko, where all the tears ran off his face, demanding Giant Robot. The film should have been continued, where Giant Robot somehow survived the explosion. :) I can't believe that space friends are so much more. I really want to buy a movie on a DVD, but my sister said that those who are there are now equipped with film and probably of poor quality. I don't know why they haven't issued it yet, because it's been over 40 years. I think Voyage to Space was created back in 1968. Only now, my second favorite Japanese monster movie all the time (The Gargantane War) has finally come to DVD and will be released on September 9th and I can't wait! :) Now if only they would do the same in Voyage's space. Giant Robot, Johnny Sokko and Voyage to Space will never forget! In my eyes and probably many others, I am always a childhood classic! :)
