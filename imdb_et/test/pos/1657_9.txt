What movie gas! "Film Noir" has always been one of my favorite music, but it's different from the rest. Only "Big Sleep", "Out of the Past", "Murder My Sweet" and "The Killers" can come near this capricious classic. I know that the four American films I mentioned are not capricious films in themselves, but rather detective stories with complicated readers, which still have a "cool", sharp quality, similar to "Rifif". <br /> <br /> It is different here that Jules Dassin moves the film's complete atmosphere, not only through the principled realism of the principals, but also by using the streets of Paris as a subconscious and co-advocate for himself! The movie centers around "le Stephano", dark, moody and challenging ex-con get pulled by one of the last shot in hefty payouts. Even if he is an uncomfortable and hard-nosed man, he still feels a longing for some sort of redemption when he has pushed his past demons (hey, he saved little Toni!). Dassin chose the right boy for this role (Jean Servais). <br /> <br /> This sets aside the remainder of the developmental style, as we drive through the disappearance of the major "perpside" possible in the famous "silent" capricious scene. Only their women live, except for East, Mario mee. They seem to understand the triviality of all this!
