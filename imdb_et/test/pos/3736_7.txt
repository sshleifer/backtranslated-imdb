Despite the fact that the aspects of the film I felt were not developed enough, I enjoyed it and suggested it to others. Richard Gere and Diane Lane are big in their role. The main premise of the film is that both were broken after marriage when they met. Both are also looking for healing. Unexpectedly, they find they can heal each other. The parts of the movie that I wanted to play more - where simple flashes offered only the themes that my mind had to fill, for example, an apology to the widowed widow and how Adrienne was not guilty of having slept with Paul to feel right after that . The chance to get a huge scene of love was lost when it was simply recommended that they start to love hurricane. Finally, the film continued to make me feel deeply grateful for the relationships my wife and I share. And there were moments that led me to the edge of tears. So I have to say it's worth a look.
