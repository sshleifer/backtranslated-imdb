Nurse Betty was certainly one of the most creative films that has recently appeared. It was funny, but it also had many touching moments. Zellwegger, Freeman, Rock, Kinnear and the rest of the cast made their incredibly strange symbols real. The story took such twists that made it incredibly enjoyable. If you're sick of recent films, look at Betty Betty for something completely different. Watch this movie in the theater or at least rent it out!
