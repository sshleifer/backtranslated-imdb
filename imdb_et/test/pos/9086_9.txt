There's not much eerier than Flatliners. That deep, dark film was pumping all over the heart. Illumination is dark and you get a mood of mood that literally means a conflicting experience. Keifer is upstairs as she is now 24. She is a great actor and she plays a very convincing and shocking role that you will not forget for years to come. And what can you say about the rest of casting? Julia is hotter than ever, Will, Oliver and Kevin shine at the thriller stage that keeps your seats closed. It's a refreshing sight to see a real thriller with top-level professional players. You will not regret seeing this 2-hour seat bender. -JL
