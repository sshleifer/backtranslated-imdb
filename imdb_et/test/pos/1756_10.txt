Hi again, I've been thinking about this movie all over my life. I saw it when I was 5 years old in California in 1942 in Los Angeles. What a wonderful story to each other about prosperity, goodness and charity. You forget that these are related mistakes. Just like they were people. I love this movie and so do my adult kids. This beautiful color in this movie. I have to watch this movie again. In the film, there is a story about an envelope, which I just can't remember "why". <br /> <br /> Thank you for listening.
