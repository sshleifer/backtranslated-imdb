One of the best war films I've ever seen, if not the best. It is very difficult to talk about such films because it is very difficult to note for every film error made. The "problem" is that it seems too real and it will draw you into the ruins of Stalingrad and make you both. The reason for this is that this film, unlike most Hollywood films, does not exaggerate the war or the heroism of the main characters. Instead, the film turns them into heroes only as a human being and is as anti-war as it can be. Extremely convincing war scenes and so impressive action, most scenes look like isolated theater pieces. The German army is also played by the Germans, which is so convincing. The film is produced and realized by the Germans, where you see their love for details perfectly. That's why "Stalingrad" is one of the movies I can watch a million times and never feel bored. I watched the movie with my father who fought in World War II, and the first thing he said was, "It's like real, just as the Germans saw the war out". This is where you can see how it looked like a soldier in the worst of human history in warfare and in the turning point of World War II in Stalingrad.
