Pavarotti and the whole cast are great in this beautifully filmed opera by Giuseppe Verdi. The Coloratura soprano is particularly remarkable for its excellent pitch. The title's role is well received and well sung. The whole production is as perfect as one would expect. <br /> <br /> Masterpiece of Film Art! <br /> <br />
