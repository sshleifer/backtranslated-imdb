One of his lesser-known movies, many horror fans are still trying to do this with Dario Argento's offer, which is unfortunate. This has been underestimated mostly because, in fact, not enough people have seen it. The film has an A-class gordo, whose usual close-ups set tough scores. While it is true that this script is not very complicated, it is not nearly as bad as the other entries in his genre or his own personal pursuit. <br /> <br /> This movie symbolizes more "fear" that he loves to record in his films. Worth a good look every night.
