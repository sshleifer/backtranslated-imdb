This is one of the best and fun comedy magazines I've ever seen! All the characters are brilliant. <br /> <br /> Mr. Slatt (David Bamber) is a very irritated person who is irritated by everyone and anyone. <br /> <br /> He wants to do things and use situations as well as he can, but he never gets it and gets himself deeper and deeper in trouble. His wife, Janet, does not support anyone trying to get her deeper and deeper, to get in on her own (and not really need help at all!). <br /> <br /> All characters are played / played perfectly. Imagine sending your child (s) to such a school. <br /> <br /> It's unbelievable that people don't like it (maybe some don't get many words that occur several times in an episode). <br /> <br /> It is also incredible that the DVD is still not released. There are only 2 series! <br /> <br /> So please release it, let it go! So fans can enjoy it and enjoy it! Try it, you can just like it !!! <br /> <br /> Just some of the series names and words: Pumpman, Man Helmet, Hot Bitch, Suzy Mountain, Travis Fellatio, Cockfoster, Arshead (and more).
