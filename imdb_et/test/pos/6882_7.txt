So the Koreans are knocking the American American horror. But they do it with style. DOLL MASTER is a close-up copy of PUPPETMASTER and DOLLS, and even a small CHILD EVENT. Several young adults have been invited to attend a special event at a gallery filled with dolls to find only those that are targets of a strong spirit. The dolls come to life and make the kids quite disgusting. The level of gore is relatively high, the values ​​of photography and design and production are first, functioning is not so bad, and fears are certainly there. The DOLL MASTER may not be in the same league with two inside or even DEAD FRIEND, but it is close. Give her a clock. You don't have to be disappointed.
