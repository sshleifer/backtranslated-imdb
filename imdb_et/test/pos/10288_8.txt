The whole credit for the writer / director Gilles Mimoun, who designed the twist of this winding, fraud and betrayal. Keeping the ultimate control, it keeps the audience at hand, never allowing them to fully understand. Even his clever pronunciation is guessing. <br /> <br /> Three average performances are in the top class, Vincent Cassel, Romane Bohringer and Monica Bellucci are doing their best to add to the mystery. Jean-Phillippe Ecoffey complements his support role. It would not be fair to distinguish the plot's details or character. <br /> <br /> Thierry Arbogast uses this camera effectively to wipe us through this mystery, and Cardine Biggerstaff's editing keeps us in front. Peter Chase's theme is his subjective script ideal for his marriage. <br /> <br /> Many may say that Gilles Mimouni is trying to face many deeper questions about love. For me, this is just a haunting, difficult to understand mystery that weaves an exciting web. Only the French language is such. Hollywood would have destroyed this happy ending. <br /> <br /> Monday, March 2, 1998 - Hoyts Croydon <br /> <br /> No one can thrill a thriller like a Frenchman. Vincent Cassell is intriguing, as deceptive Max, Romane Bohringer is obsessive as the new Lisa, and Monica Bellucci is mysterious as the first Lisa. The plot of Gilles Mimouni is the twist of wires that intersect with deliberate deception and death. <br /> <br /> All credits must go through manipulation of a smart plot and three guides. Like Lucien, Jean-Phillippe Ecoffey is strong and emotional. <br /> <br /> Friday, January 15, 1999 - Video
