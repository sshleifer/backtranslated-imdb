Darr, though a copy of a Hollywood flick, is one of the best films I've ever seen. It is not only beautifully depicted, but also great songs and beautiful landscapes. Shahrukh is his usual self. His expressions and voice fit his character. I was pleasantly surprised at the film by Sunny Deoli. He is a bit romantic and lovable in the film, unlike his other films. It seems that justice is not done by its character. Sunny was meant to portray a good guy in the movie, but eventually he looks like a villain. Driver Chawla is beautiful and bubbly. He's his usual self. In short, a great love story with passion.
