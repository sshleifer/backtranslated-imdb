Carla Gugino literally melts the caper of this crime. His sexual appeal, big assets and a sexy luncheon are more than just writing this movie again. But the film has so many "other" things to make it an almost modern classic. Simon Baker's performance is one thing. Really, it's a big actor. Til Schweiger is so perfect that makes me wonder why he is not a big "crossover" star. Gil Bellows rounds this motel team and literally steals this exhibition. Other Gugino splitting will make the film's best results easier. Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman are so wonderful ... I can't even describe it. Great chemistry. <br /> <br /> Music is so strongly eclectic that it was inherent in itself. Wonderous look. <br /> <br /> People can say that this has affected Tarantino ... I don't agree. It is clearly unique and smart in your own right. Sebastian Gutierrez does a great job of guiding this tightly knit film and plays many scenes that continued me. The end is completely bad and you never see it. All in all, a lovely movie that's a good movie definition for me.
