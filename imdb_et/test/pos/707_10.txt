I read on the web that this movie is being transformed into a theatrical. Finally !!!!! It's time for Hollywood to get his act together. Large studios are always in front of sharp material, Oscar wrote over it. Go figure !! <br /> <br /> JERICHO MILE was made before this time. It's a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> True Seer Michael Mann found a way to engage the audience without being overwhelmed. The performance of Peter Strauss' Emmy Award is probably the best role I have seen in watching my movie. Any actor with this role can never be the same (when the Academy Award is already sitting on his coat). <br /> <br /> The multi-ethnic green ensemble, backed by JERICHO MILE, makes the dynamic of our sensitive social world understandable. It concerns redemption without public validation and the ability of the human spirit to overcome all barriers. Imagine a convicted prisoner because he was a teenager for life without having the chance to fail, which does not know he is probably the fastest runner in the world. ... what would you do? <br /> <br /> This movie will make you feel like you have not been deceived at any level. Totally exciting, interesting, emotional and "Rolling Stones" soundtrack that hits the ass !!! <br /> <br /> I thought it would be on a big screen ... Can't wait ...! !! In the meantime, I have to continue copying my years of VHS.
