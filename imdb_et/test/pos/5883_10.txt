This film tells stories of several couples who survive the post-World War II life. Through many moving accounts, the viewer learns how war has changed people, while their spirit went on. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is where a young man who returns home when twice as amputee (after losing both hands to the elbow) is sure he wouldn't be good for his loved one who still wants to marry him. His girlfriend just said he would help him with things he couldn't do, but that they were together. By demonstrating this true love, the man comes with his groom's tears. <br /> <br /> The scene where the service man asked for a bank loan has also been highlighted. If he was initially denied "high risk", a senior bank officer would say, "You fought for our country and kept us safe - that's good enough for me. Your loan is approved!" "The Best Years of Our Life" won 6 Oscars, including a special statute for disabled actors who showed us that life goes on and is still viable, even with a serious disability. This movie is a joy to watch over and over again. Real classic! Highly recommended!
