A beautiful film that has been intelligently captured with warfare details and (given that it has been designated during World War II) minimal violence. <br /> <br /> A small cast worships a sensitive journey through the Czechoslovak occupation. loved ones because the pilots leave England (spaniel touches hearts), spunk scenes, love, friendship and betrayal. The topic of hate is deeply through the film, from the betrayal of love, the betrayal of friendship, and finally the betrayal of the communist regime to post-war RAF pilots, shown to former RAF pilots. <br /> <br /> The more that it is so factually accurate. I recommend it to everyone.
