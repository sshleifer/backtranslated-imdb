I thought this movie was great, not only because of its events, but because it was a great display. I read that Drew Barrymore was no exception to Josie Geller because she is beautiful. Yes, he may, but in the movie he played, which brought a simple girl who was looking for who he is in the world. The story is sweet and definitely for the desperate romance there, I'm sure. David Arquette is crazy when his brother Rob, and Michael Vartan are proud of Sam Coulson. Leelee Sobieski did an excellent job with his wife Aldysen, someone who is not afraid of himself. I think this movie should get more credits than the "teeny boppy" brand
