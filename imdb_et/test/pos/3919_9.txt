I usually give horror movies in the 6 / 10s, but it hit my eye. Wax House was by far the best movie I've ever seen ... Even better than Amityville's horror. <br /> <br /> Paris Hilton was very good at this and I have to say that it has a good future. His death scene was probably the coolest. I'm just saying how he dies ... <br /> <br /> He gets giant between the eyes and they go and everyone goes. Gory, right? Brian Van Holt was very good because both the killers, Bo and Vincent (Vincent had long hair). He usually plays the middle police officer or soldier, but he did it very well. <br /> <br /> Eliza Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray worked very well as Carly and Nick Jones. Nick took attention in the first half of the film, then Eliza stole it back, trying to get a lot of pain on the other side, such as removing the finger, beating the lips after gluing, and straight ahead. Face Bo. <br /> <br /> In general, I'll give this movie 8/10. Fans of movie fans must see it.
