This is a pretty stupid film, including what may be the least erotic that it will get on the big screen (the heroine pours V-8 all over and calls the hero lick it off - yuck!). And at the same time, it also has a fascinating Lucinda Dickey in what is far from her most erotic production. Those long ago, women, even acting heroes, were rare with real muscles and I still remember how my jaw fell when Dickey took off his shirt, revealing the most powerfully built woman and biceps. ever seen. Dickey's beauty and vitality bear the film: she could have been a female Schwarzenegger if anyone had had a vision of her vision.
