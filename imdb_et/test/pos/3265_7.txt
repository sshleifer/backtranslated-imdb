It's hard to know what to do about this strange little Aussie crime flick - on the one hand, it's an enjoyable little movie with a great sense of humor; but on the other hand, it has nothing to do with ensuring that the film never reaches beyond the boundary that keeps it in the "interesting" territory. That means Two Hands is a well-drawn film that perfectly juggles a number of stories at the same time, allowing the film to have several small peaks, which in turn helps to stop the movie from boredom. The absurdity of all the events, the thick Australian accents and the odd number of characters help to ensure the entertainment of the film. The plot is followed by a story of a young doorman who thinks he's going to work on a local knuckle after more things. He is not; the job throws him in trouble only when he sweats swimming and foolishly leaves ten big beaches that have been stolen by a couple of children who have their life time in shops. But not everything is rosy for our hero; who must find the money or face the consequences ... <br /> <br /> The film consists of unknown pains; at least it was in 1999 because nowadays Heath Ledger is a name. But he does not impress too much here, because his performance is mostly one comment and he does not take a very convincing leadership position. She fits with the film that she is Australian and sees naive; but after that he is not the best film I've seen in the movie. When you ask me, Bryan Brown gave the best result. She may not have enough time on the screen, but she steals every scene she has, and that's the one who offers the movie with a lot of humor. He has nothing to do with the best sequence that is likely to be in the form of the most fun bank robbery ever caught on film. In general, I can recommend this movie to people who enjoy original criminal films; if wonders are abundant and the way things turn strange is enjoyable; But if you are not a fan of such a movie, I can't really say that two hands are floating on your boat. It doesn't have to be seen, but if it's your thing and you have the opportunity to see it, you probably won't regret it.
