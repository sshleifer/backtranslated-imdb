I've recently seen the right couple of movies from the Far East ..... some were great (Battle Royale, Infernal Affairs, Eye) and some were not so big (Versus, Triple Cross). Then there are such as Uzumaki and Returner, which I still got faulty. <br /> <br /> The basic premise includes the mysterious and terrible effects that the ever-increasing obsession with spirals has on the community. Sound is silly? Yeah, that's what I thought. First, good things. The direction was top-notch, definitely a bit over the place, but never less interesting and stylish. Secondly, it was a story that was original and like other writers commented on love - it was interesting. What he mostly reminded me was early Cronenberg; movies like Shivers and Videodrome. <br /> <br /> The exhibition was not big, but not too terrible. Frankly, I missed a few times. I felt that the pace was slow at first. My main problem was that it was too silly and funny to be a real horror, but still not enough to be considered a comedy. * SPOILERS * below. <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * Some good scenes (washing machine =)) and I liked the last blow / voice command. At first I thought it ended too sharply, but after about 20 seconds I realized its meaning and liked it. However, because the story is not serious, combined with a top scene, such as a newsletter at school, I didn't care much about characters from the characters. The final scene, which was supposed to be small, but actually I couldn't get a girl or her boyfriend. * SPOILERS END * <br /> <br /> So in general I made this movie like that, but it cheated on me and I think there was some real potential in addition to some good scenes. A couple of other points, the main girl is pretty pretty and cute, and the song being played at the end is good. I appreciated it 7/10. <br /> <br />
