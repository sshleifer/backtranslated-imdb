This movie was very cute and a little little girl. My nephew has been watching it because they've got it, and as a result I've seen it almost 4 times. I can't get enough of it. CGI images are great to see, humor is good and ballet images are great. Although the story is with a few holes, no small girl takes them and as an adult, the film is so charming that one hardly even announces. Remember that this is a Barbie movie, and although it is occasionally cheesy, it is, according to my experience, living at a high level that other Barbie princess movies have set for it. I recommend it to anyone who has a little girl who has always wanted to be a princess. It also teaches a good lesson. Everyone is special and different in their own way and everyone can change it.
