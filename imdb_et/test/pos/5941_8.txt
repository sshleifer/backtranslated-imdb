It is true that there are some scenes in this movie that seem a little unreal. The first panic panic and then just a few minutes later he starts kissing the old man next to him. But when the film goes by, we learn that he is a small voluptuous girl (or a bitch) and this partly explains his behavior. The film's cinematography is well done. We see the elevator from almost all angles and angles, and some of these images and scenes really raise the tension. GÃ¶tz George plays his character well, obsolete and young men, such as Jaennicke's character, obsessed with wannabe. Wolfgang Kieling, who I admired at Hitchcock's THE TORN CURTAIN, is a great result, but although he doesn't say much, he is definitely the best actor in this game. One critic complained about how the film was unreal and that nothing would happen in a real emergency. But how realistic are such movies as mission impossible or phone booth. Considering the fact that we are talking about a movie here and that you always have to deal with a scene that is not very likely in real life, you can still enjoy this movie. It's much better than many of the things I see on German television these days, and I think the decade's 80-year style added something to this movie.
