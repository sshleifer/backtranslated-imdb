Is Thursday the original film? Heck not, but it's fun! I just hit this movie channels one night buried and it was an enjoyable flick. I was expecting a lot, but what I got was an interesting scene (I liked the first sight in the shop), some of the amusements that the characters are talking about, and a little bit of activity that was also thrown into the mix. Some good actors from young actresses, Paulina Porizkova, were good and I was particularly impressed by Aaron Eckhart (who has impressed her friends and neighbors and Erin Brokovich). So if you want to have 90 minutes of fun fun and check out on Thursday.
