This indie film is worth it because its creators, Wallace Wolodarsky and Marsha Forbes, have a tremendous talent. Mr Wolodarsky has been run by a young man and he is praised for his activities. <br /> <br /> The premise of the movie is a deterrent story of the danger of something that cannot. What is Alice's and Ed's story. Having lived together for a while, Alice suddenly becomes uneasy because she imagines she has no sexual experience. The relationship between Alice and Ed, although not an ideal example of happiness, is a convenient way to share one's life with each other. This means that until Alice and Claire, her sister, happened to have a second pair of sexual meetings who have no idea that she is being tracked. <br /> <br /> This case makes Alice around her sexual life with Ed; he finds that it has no content. If he proposes to "see other people", Ed is shocked, to say the least, but does not want to resist Alice, he decides to go. Next is that Alice and Ed both enter the world that is unknown to them. The people they end up with are not worth the effort. Finally, they realize at the end that they were made for each other. <br /> <br /> The movie is worth seeing to see the amazing Julianne Nicholson, whom we've liked in another indie movie "Tully". Mrs Nicholson reminds us of a young Shirley McLain; he designs a luminous quality that is difficult to take from his eyes when he is in the scene. This young actor proves that he is an accomplished performer who gets better with every new look. Basically, she wears a movie. His Alice is a study of contrasts. Alice is a decent woman who thinks she is inadequate because she doesn't like her experience. <br /> <br /> Jay Mohr is a great judge for Nicholson. Both are doing wonders together. His Ed is completely plausible. We are people like him. Deep inside is a good person who suddenly gets into a situation he didn't demand, but he just goes to find out that he is too decent and doesn't end his free woman in life who is ready for women who have no problems with hay drum, just fun. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is wonderful. Lauren Graham is doing an amazing job like Claire, Alice's yuppie sister. Andy Ritcher is also wonderful when grounded by Carl, a nerdy friend who finally comes to an end when he meets a single mother Penelope. Since Penelope, Helen Slater, is making a surprising, though short appearance, in the film. <br /> <br /> The director is a gifted talent who will undoubtedly go in because he shows that he works well for work.
