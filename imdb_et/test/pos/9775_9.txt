Sometimes CHANGI AFI lost MY BROTHER JACK prizes. The last, high-quality adaptation of George Johnston's immortal novel was outstanding - but I think it was not as good as CHANGI. I've heard many critics reject CHANGI as irrelevant, irrelevant, historically inaccurate, or even disrespectful. Who and where are these critics? CHANGI is unfulfilled. More. Brilliant. It should not be a documentary - I can certainly forgive the actual survivors of Changi (or indeed any POW camp survivors) that they are disappointed with the production, but with the rest of us, the remarkable power of CHANGI matehip is an extreme accident. It includes a part of Australian culture that seems to be diminishing when time becomes easier and less complicated, but we should never forget: Australians were respected worldwide after Gallipoli and WW2 for their competition and sense of humor. Rating: 96/100. See also: GALLIPOLI; PARADISE ROAD; LAST BULLET; SUGAR STYLE.
