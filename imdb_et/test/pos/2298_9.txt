Having read more than my fair share of reviews of many different films, I have noticed a certain trend, people rigorously appreciate what is expected. I see when you go to a movie that is open and does not expect something solid if you have a better feel for it when you try to watch it, but you have pre-established standards that you want to achieve. <br /> <br /> Since I try not to be hypocritical. I watched this movie with a very clean slate and an open mind and I was very pleased. Since this is not the title or award winning theme, I didn't know what to expect, but I really enjoyed it much more than Ninja Scroll. Lovely animation, deep story and always cheerful ninja hack-n-slashing very well combined any of my favorite anime ever made. this is an opportunity and you can come up with a pleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> - "Before talking, be sure what you say is more beautiful than silence" - Chinese proverb
