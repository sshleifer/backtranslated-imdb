In this early work of Fulci, the director shows his main side and talented encouragement of narration and reasonable explanation of the genre. Personally, I think he has been unfairly attacked throughout his career. It is quite capable of procedural and surprised me with this subtontically rich narrative showing his mistrust of a small-minded small town mentality and police inefficiency, as well as the twisted ideals of the Catholic Church, the latter that seemed to be cut off this film when it was first released, and could have given Director to the other direction so early. Gore's comparative lack of film shows the faster and psychological imperative of this film in his overwhelming "mystery", but the gore and puppet pieces he uses are best used in a place where the wrongly accused murderer is an unnecessarily dead body and a deadly hostile and obsolete vigilantism exhibition, \ t which is expertly choreographed for contemporary stories, except for theatrical radio. <br /> <br /> Another example was the last scene (which was really awesome) where the strikingly beautiful priest falls into the cliff and the used doll is noticeably revealed in the middle close, which emphasized its demonic appearance and obvious ugliness. Interestingly, in view of his later works, Fulci also refers to the way of thinking that was confiscated in a small town, keeping his anachronistic superstitions and ignorance when the idea of ​​black magic is precisely that peculiar idea of ​​supernatural evil that never reaches. voodoo dolls, making this witch something other than a disturbed woman. Another thing I liked was that he adds to these layers of characters, making the bourgeois girl an ambiguous line - is he an attacker, a priest afraid of his congregations, and perhaps more, for himself? This giallo is able to become one of Fulci's more personal and contentive films, because we actually send him the right ideas.
