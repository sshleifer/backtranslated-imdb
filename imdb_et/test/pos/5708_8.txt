STUDENT NURSES is not a typical sex animation film. Of course there is nudity and sexual openness, but it is not all laughing. Stephanie Rothman wrote a socially compelling, well-written tits and ass film that faces racism, socio-economic inequality, rape, abortion, medical ethics, public health issues, human rights, Vietnam war, free love, LSD, and drugs. testing. Four sexy college roommates simultaneously take their nursing practice. Sharon (Elaine Giftos) is assigned to the Terminal Maintenance Department, Lynn (Brioni Farrell) Healthcare Facility, Priscilla (Barbara Leigh) for Gynecology and Phred (Karen Carlson) for Psychiatry. These four beauties have many opportunities to smile and scare what they use to rejoice in the viewers of men. These are free women at the height of the sexual revolution and are as intelligent as they are horny and beautiful. The sequences of terrible but low-budget operations are one another. The Resistance Movement Headquarters has a very bloody armed force, where two police officers are shot and killed with a group of members. The (Vietnamese) war protest, which consists of spontaneously dressed young all races painted like skeletons, becomes violent, where police officers beat the protesters. An effective travel order on the beach consists of beautiful, strange and confusing sensory and memory puzzles with hyper sensual enhancements. In short, STUDENT NURSES is a thoughtful and compelling reflection of the times expressed through the perspectives of real women (as it was written and directed by a woman). But it is still fun and cumbersome, despite its beautiful handling.
