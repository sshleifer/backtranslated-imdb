I was lucky enough to see this movie the previous release last night and, although I didn't expect, I actually enjoyed the movie mostly. The rescue and sea effects were astonishing to see and provide the tense moments of the seat, probably more so, knowing that there are men who do it for livelihood. The weaker parts of the film largely rotate when using stereotypical scenes. I don't intend to spoil the film, but it really follows the traits of the officer and the gentleman, and these moments give him a bit of cheesy aftertaste. <br /> <br /> As I said about this movie, it's pretty good and it's worth watching as long as you can bypass the clich√©s.
