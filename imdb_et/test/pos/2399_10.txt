Fred Carpenter looked through Eddie Monroe at Boston College and decided to take a keen reaction, and he is thrilled. Taught, well-made Indy, impressive for this big budget. This movie has everything: a tight script that grabs you and won't let you go to surprise. This viewer didn't see it! Great performance everywhere. Craig Morris and Jessica Tsunis were especially well cast, giving strong performances. And the defendants Frank Bongiorno and Alex Corrado have created two detectives that are interesting and interesting to watch in the movie. I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. This affirmed my conviction that some of the best film films come from independent and Fred Carpenter seems to be one of the best.
