I only went to watch this movie because I always loved Kevin Costner. I felt Ashton did a great job at Butterfly Effect. Unfortunately, although these two actors were capable, if not very good, of the moments, some of them were missing here. Some scenes were not just believable and they didn't have enough story line. <br /> <br /> Although the film claims the influence of Katrina's hurricane, the film had very little (no) effect. In general, I liked the fact that the film highlighted some lives with sustainable water. <br /> <br /> Special effects were pretty good and more than a little scary. I'm not sure if I'm going for deep sea fishing again ... <br /> <br /> I had been waiting for a little more emotion in the movie than what was presented. <br /> <br /> Definitely a movie that could "see on DVD.
