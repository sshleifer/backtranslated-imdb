I recently bought this movie for three bucks during garage sales, and although I am glad that I didn't have to pay $ 19.99 for this DVD, I was pleasantly surprised at how good the movie was. <br /> <br It is built like a horror anthology, divided into 5 tales, including the "fitting" story that includes four teenagers who are in the middle of the car in the dark, lonely road at night. Probably like those kiddod like horror stories, because that's what they decide to do until the morning - say spooky stories around the campfire. Every character tells a story, after which his story is wrapped in a nice little twist. <br /> <br /> The first story, "The Hook," is a time-consuming, a bit spooky and dull. Fortunately, this is not one of the main stories and only takes 5 minutes. It is only meant to introduce the film and it is easy to forget the unoriginal nature of this work. <br /> <br /> Another story, "Honeymooners," is fine. It's about - you guessed it - two people at your honeymoon! They're traveling to Las Vegas for RV. They decide to stop somewhere at night, but the mysterious stranger warns them quickly to leave the location or when some dangerous, unknown creatures are at risk. This story is a pretty good setting, but just a "ok" delivery. Basically, it's pretty fun and mysterious until the monsters appear, it's just sure. <br /> <br /> The third story, "People can beat too," is my personal favorite. It includes a young girl who's going to the night and who is older. So, he's going to be alone - the fact that he announces his internet friend to him. The problem is that an internet friend? Not exactly a thirteen year old girl. The conclusion of this story is a little less climate than I would have seen, but still quite dang good. <br /> <br /> The final story "The Locket" is definitely the one that is packed the most into the atmosphere. In a dark, rainy night, he was in a terrible mansion, a story about a young man (played by Glenn Quinn!) Who travels around a motorcycle who stumbles across the house just as he has trouble with his bike. She meets a quiet girl who lives in the house and falls in love with her at first sight. Unfortunately, not everything is fine and dandy - and it may have something to do with the top that hangs around her pretty neck ... <br /> <br /> After the storm has collapsed, we'll get four teenagers in the car, a twist retrospectively should have been obvious, but what he did not really see, and that is a rather pleasant conclusion to the film. <br /> <br /> At all, a good movie. Hire it when you get it, because unfortunately I don't think it has a lot of re-viewing value. But the next time you're in the mood for a vaguely frightening litte, slip in the same way as "Darkside Tales" or something, grab this movie and some popcorn, turn off all the lights and meet yourself with this surprisingly little little slip.
