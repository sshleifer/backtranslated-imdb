Ingrid Bergman (Cleo Dulaine) has never been so beautiful. Gary Cooper as "Cleent" as perfectly as the laconic Texan who knows this might not be good. When two lock eyes on the French market, we know that this game is full of sparks. As they walk in their own restored French Quarter house and play the theme of love, this dream is for all of us Romans. <br /> <br /> Costumes are cute; The ornaments set for the "Quarter" would be the same. And that Sarato had this hotel with a large veranda with all the old offers. <br /> <br /> Edna Ferbert's novel is a story of revenge for old lies and a fight for who ran the railways in the early days of this industry. <br /> <br /> In Saratoga scenes, Florence Steals Bates as a big dame for every scene. <br /> <br /> But this is the Cleo scene where he takes a little lawyer New Orleans relatives have sent him to buy what is Magic Movie Moment. After Cleo has supported her in the talks, she looks at her longing and says, "I'm telling you you're very beautiful." And Cleo says with a happy, evil smile, "Yes, not happy." You want to punish "YES" !!! <br /> <br /> One of my all time favorite romantic movies.
