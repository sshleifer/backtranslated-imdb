In December 1945, a train from Stockholm Central Station leaves Berlin. When it arrives, there's not much. Not on the train and not on some passengers. <br /> <br /> This is a black comedy directed by Peter Dalle and was in the 40s and shot (b / w) as before. Participants must have done it fun. They are not many signs, as they were not in the 40s, but the story is well told and everyone has a timing. <br /> <br /> A deadly black and deadly funny movie. See if you didn't think the Swedes were capable of humor.
