Dad Hood is a fun story about an unwanted Father who is definitely HOOD! Patrick Swayze plays Jack Charles, who is always on the hood, with one big "score" look that puts him on a light street. His wife died when he was in prison and his two children were taken care of. When he "went out", he thought they were probably better off in a family doctor? besides, he still had to evaluate his fortune. His daughter Kathleen Charles (played by Sabrina Lloyd excellently) leaves a childcare institution that abuses children and abuses money that is expected to be spent on children. He hunted his father; tells her how bad the place was and that her brother Eddie Charles (played by Brian Bonsall), "just a little 7-year-old boy", moved to the institution he had just cut off and convinced his father to rob him. Three start their adventure all over the country, while Jack keeps himself that he has to get rid of the children! Patrick Swayze is very good in this comedy, playing with a "hood" (probably a bit of its criminal character), similar to his Johnny Castle's Dirty Dancing character, except Jack is funny in this comedy and more optimistic about Johnny Castle. Swayze is funny and rally makes comedy pretty good! Halle Berry plays Kathleen Mercer, a reporter who is trying to reach the truth of the care system that becomes Sawyer's ally. Diane Ladd plays the mother of Jack Charles's artist Rita.
