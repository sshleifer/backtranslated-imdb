Of course, it could be assumed that this is a typical, stupid T&A flick, and that is. But it really is somewhat well thought out humorous moments. Given the era in which it was made, and the obvious aspect of exploitation, it is still one of the best B timed comedies. <br /> <br /> When you watch a movie, you will probably see inspiration for many. "Nerds" revenge and many other movies from the same genre. Most of the actresses are terrible and WAY up, but that's what I'm expecting in such a movie. What he does not have is the way to do that, more than to completely ignore the value and value of his camp. <br /> <br /> The amazing thing about this movie is that it was obviously the money it went. Films like this one today do not have the same style. If you can turn your brain off and change your sense of humor for an hour and a half, you will enjoy this flick. I dare nobody to find this movie that they are funny, if not fun.
