First of all, I have shown that when my PBS station started showing it back in 1981, I have learned a lot from exhibitions and people who had participated in or contributed to the exhibitions. <br /> <br /> This doctoral final contribution made me feel great. The original series, the classic series, was joking about bad special effects and / or amazing sets. Well, that's no longer true. Special effects are awesome, but even better is writing. You'll get a chance to learn about your beloved doctor and maybe a little reason why he loves the planet so much. Without too much going away, this is a very valuable series. Christopher Eccelston brought to the doctor that we never see, bitter and angry, but at the same time loving. <br /> <br /> CAN BE!
