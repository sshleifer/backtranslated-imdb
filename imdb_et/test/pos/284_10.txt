Obviously, with the exception of fools and horses, I think it was David Jason's best series. <br /> <br /> Immediately after the TV's debut "Don't change your settings!", these 13 episodes of mastery showed comic timing, not seen after the old silent movie days. For comparison, porridge, open all hours and the terrible series "Lucky Man" didn't get close. <br /> <br /> I believe Jason denied repeating the series because it showed him the most recent. Shame on her. The new generation deserves to enjoy it. The series actually picked up in the ratings, but it is most likely because it was shown against the "Brothers" who at the same time presented in the BBC before the videotapes were normal. <br /> <br /> BTW, I've only noticed that Spencer, his long-suffering assistant, was played by Mark Eden; Alan Bradley out of Coronation Street. I'm surprised he's not trying to kill Edgar Briggs !!
