Where would Hollywood have been without Fredric Marchita as Robert Browning or Dennis Price as Lord Byron, famous lovers of their day? Even an actor who is usually ordinary when Michael Redgrave took turns, gave W.B. Yeats. Writers' life is an endless source of inspiration. <br /> <br /> But all the poets were Dylan Thomas, a gritty and free loving Welsh who enjoyed pint or two (and died in New York City) at the age of 39, who was closest to the film industry. During World War II, he produced scripts for documentaries on British propaganda. He even wrote a spiritual melodrama scenario, called three strange sisters, where three old servants in the village of Wales prime their murderous half-brother. All that is now forgiven. <br /> <br /> In John Maybury's love lane, Thomas has played Welsh actor Matthew Rhys. It is not full size. The film covers four years of the poet's life during World War II, when she lived with two women: her husband Caitlin (Sienna Miller) and former lover Vera Phillips (Keira Knightley), with whom she met at random during the war. He seems to have loved both of them. The relationship between these extraordinary women - Thomas and one another - is at the heart of Maybury's absorbable film. <br /> <br /> How it is done is a story that is almost as remarkable as lovers themselves. Rebekah Gilbertson is the grandson of Vera Phillips and William Killick. War hero William (played by Cillian Murphy in the movie) married Vera when he was still in love with the poet. Gilbertson was inspired to make a movie when he discovered a book about his grandparents, Dylan Thomas: a farm, two houses and a bungalow, David Thomas, describing their tangled life. Sharman Macdonald, the man who wrote the script, is the mother of Knightley. Some calls for Knightley's singing and her mother comes with songs especially for her. Certainly, the film about this couple does not deserve to be successful. <br /> <br /> We will start in London during Blitz. The bombs are falling, the sirens are shameful and Phillips is singing in the underground subway station for shelters. In the pub, by chance, he meets Thomas and finds out after years that he has a wife and a child. Phillips and Caitlin form a jealousy or a mess of friendship and will soon share beds and baths, listening to Thomas's poems, exchanging intimate secrets, and smoking their heads as they did in the war. Caitlin turns out to be more experienced on the roads of the world ("My first was Augustus John, he seduced me at the age of 15"). But it is a refined and soulful Phillips, who is bothering Thomas with deeper responses and finally giving up his charms. Meanwhile, he is reluctantly married to Killick, who has seen him in the subway station and his beauty (if not his song) instantly fascinated. <br /> <br /> This is an intense and strangely beautiful movie. Thomas himself can be the least impressive character. He was best reminded of Under Milk Wood, his streaming radio playing about a day in the life of a mythical Welsh village in Llareggub, whose name was written back by a non-wise English teacher. I once had a vinyl record from Richard Burton who read poetry (he appeared in 1971 under Under Milk Wood) and I've never forgotten my voice in creamy, seductive quality. Legendary charisma, man's magnetism, is something I missed in Rhysi's performance. Thomas lives strangely as a wage, even as a secondary indicator, compared to his surviving women. <br /> <br /> In his previous film, Love Is the Devil, Maybury painter Francis Bacon and his sadomasocratic turbulent life were studied. relationship with his lover and model, George Dyer. The edge of love is a richer and more satisfying film for me. If you ask what knowledge it offers to Thomas's sources of creative inspiration, I have to say Llareggub. But when he sees his egoism, his relaxing moods, and his general indifference to the feelings of others, it is wonderfully sad and revealing. Thomas had a good war, momentum and writing, while other men (including Killick) were traumatized by the horrors of the battle. At the end of one scene, Thomas's behavior seems to be unknown to his friends. But it's not Thomas, after all. Murphy gives us an excellent study of the killed passion and the emotional weakening of the war. Miller is charming and pathetic like a woman. And Knightley looks almost too subtle to be real (as he did with pride and prejudice). But this is probably his best results. And in every sense the film is worth it.
