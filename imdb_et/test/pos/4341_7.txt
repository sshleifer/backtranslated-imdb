LOL. <br /> <br /> The mere fact that I start with my review of lol says it all. I always watched this movie as a child. and even then, I felt that stupid. The low budget, the terrible acting and the flat script were then ever visible. I watched it yesterday and just couldn't laugh. It's so bad that it's really good lol. As another reviewer said, it doesn't take seriously. You can't watch this movie and say that the makers did it. The soundtrack is so funny, I laugh every time I hear it. "Climax" is just a ridiculous government. It's all a war zone in New York full of explosions and chaos ... so ridiculous that you can't help but be ridiculous in its eyes. <br /> <br /> Other fun moments: <br /> <br /> - Kersey and the policeman who run alongside 2 cowboys across Wild West were so much fun that it was funny. > <br /> -It killed me how bad guys could shoot at Kersey and he could even lower his knees, always aiming for a cautious (and slow) goal and not beating LMAO. Of course, he had one hit-one kill with his elephant handgun LOL. - Another fun scene was the end when he finally killed the gang leader .... with ROCKET LAUNCHER lol ... destroying the entire apartment building. <br /> <br /> - It is obvious that Kersey is all but not used to losing your loved ones ... when her new girlfriend is quickly destroyed after just a few days. It is so bad that you can't blame someone who could only think that Kersey is mad about destroying the car .... he runs down, looks at the carnage and just walks. <br /> <br /> Again, so bad, it's good. <br /> <br /> *** ****
