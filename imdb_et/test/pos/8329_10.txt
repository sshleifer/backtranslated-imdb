Walking With Dinoasaurs is a new and exciting program that uses amazing visual graphics to display live dinosaurs. The information provided here is stunning. The series is changing moods to get your attention, such as dramatic music when fighting out. Here is clear evidence of one cracking documentary! My biggest story to writers, directors and producers and not to forget the other people involved. If you get this video out of the shop, I'd advise you to buy it not just for graphics, but for extreme effort and productive work. 10/10
