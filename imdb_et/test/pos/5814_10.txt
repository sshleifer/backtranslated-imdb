I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of John Cassavetes. And for those who have never known Cassavets. This is a great movie. I really don't have time to go into the details of why this is my opinion, but if you are looking for something gutsy with lots of scenes to do, then that's for you. Cinematography is perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of the film and also the story itself. This "review" does not make the film fair. This is the experience you have to look at for yourself. Lots of stars. VERY GENUINE.
