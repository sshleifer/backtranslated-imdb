Big boxing stars in the box office are phenomenal in this movie !! William Baldwin, Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon and Julia Roberts !! This movie was also made for my favorite years, 1990 !! I am in Chicago and the situation in Chicago was very identifiable and artistically accelerated! I liked this movie and the anxiety that motivated the peak of this picture was a powerful element on the plot that was completely sensational! <Br>> <br /> Flatliners focuses on a group of unpleasant pre-med students who want to have a firm lining to achieve some sort of social justification! If life doesn't make sense, it seems very illogical if you want curious nightmares! While their curious curiosity is better than them, there is no return !! The King of the Hill (so to speak) is the one who screams shouting: I'll do two minutes! WHO WILL BE THIS! Everyone wants to try two and bad !! Ultimately, all these newly arrived and highly undesirable accusations are now a very widespread attitude towards these reviving lives! Fulfilling these legitimate or unjustified sins required a full 360-degree perspective on the issues they agonize! No matter what purpose this reckless and academic chicanery serves, it is definitely an original approach to endorse your personality! I liked this movie, 1990 was a good year for me, things seemed like this year! When I saw this movie one night in November 1990, I was very glad I did!
