I have to watch this movie in my French class as part of "saying" French culture. I was wondering how it was filmed and editing was really good, but most of the time it was interesting, especially the one who played Wendy's brother. The story was also really good and it was plausible and still adventurous. <br /> <br /> Favorite part: When William does studying from Germany and when he starts flying, how does he fly! :) <br /> <br /> My French is not so good, but I could get a lot of subtitles. <br /> <br /> Watch it!
