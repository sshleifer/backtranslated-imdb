It was a joy to open up to listen to "Chevaliers De Sangreal", but I wanted more to buy Hans Zimmer's piece. Perhaps the most inspiring and beautiful 4 minute music ever written! This movie is an exciting thriller masterpiece even with religious considerations. You can get acquainted with the parts of the Vatican and Rome with excellent cinematography. Opening the CERN, where "God's Part" or the greatest amount of Antimatter is created with STUNNING's visual images, is an immediate clue that predicts the excellence of this film. Who doesn't love Hanks? The story and twists of this movie are just great and well drawn to the amazingly twisted climax. This film refers to a satisfactory compromise between science and religion, although there are many closed heads on both sides. "Science without religion is flat, religion without science is blind." A.Einstein
