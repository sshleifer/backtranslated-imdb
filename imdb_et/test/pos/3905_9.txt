I remember watching an Elizabeth Montgomery movie when I was maybe 5 years old (if it is) and I still remember that movie (only in bits). it was a movie I remember all my life because I was so scared. I think I remember this story and the house is always dark. the main part that was the most dropping for me was Elizabeth, who walked around the house with all the darkness and then there was someone out there. At that time I thought I was an old witch, but its memory is now damp, so I don't really remember who it was, but it was someone who was definitely in the field that lies ... and this part is what I was most astonished. I really wish I could see this movie again. if anyone knows how to get a copy, email me at valid908@yahoo.com
