This show is my fault of joy all the time! When I first tuned America to the next top model, I waited forever and found it very stupid. I didn't. This exhibition is actually a lot of fun. I read from another review that it makes you wonder if you have to be in America for the next top model. And so! Who doesn't love the glamor and excitement that comes with the model? At ANTM you can see what it really likes. And who does not love girls' bitches and fights? Or do you want to throw something at Janice's lady? <br /> <br /> Give this opportunity. Don't expect anything intelligent or an exhibition that you can watch for a sense of life. Just enjoy what it is. Serious fun!
