This pleasantly perverted and oddball flick of teenage body weight in the early 1980s may never come out of the astonishingly bent, deeply surprising and undervalued murderous moped "Devil Times Five", but still it is the average killer boy. <br /> <br /> A thin, but usable primer is equipped with a drift that has fallen wrong - two gentle boys and one buggy eye, although a little English girl - all born during the sunshine on June 9, 1970. When a strange antisocial trio sticking tightly into an independent and exclusive circle reaches the age of ten, they suddenly become ridiculous and proclaim an open season unhappy, unsuspectingly local Meadowvale in a unique and peaceful suburb of California. . Writer / director Ed Hunt, usually an incompetent, irresponsible hacker who is responsible for such incredibly pathetic clunkers as the admirable "Starship Invasions", the terribly ugly Jesus Christ vigilante parable (!) "Alien Warrior" and amazingly silly "The Brain," doing pretty much here solid and capable work: kill scenes are abundant and reasonably brutal (arrow-through-eye-gag is especially disgusting), there is a significant smell of nudity and soft heart sex, pretty much tension is nicely created and maintained, some beautiful dark humor dolls Drag and drop the arresting twisted chaos and the surprise that has ended is really a hit. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the upper drawer processes further enhance perfectly observable and absorbent: Jose Ferror as a small town doctor, the future "Jake and Fatman" TV series star Joe Penny as an amateur astrologer, "The Prey" Lori Lethin as a happy babysitter's heroine, Susan Strasberg as a mother school teacher, "American Ninja" by Michael Dudikoff as a chowderhead jock, and Cyril O'Reilly (lonely misantrope vampire in a ghostly melancholy "Fucking Dance") as a libidinous teenage guy who spits, doing just what you think with a naked hot chick parked behind the van. Billy Jacoby (who noticed the recent 80's direct video videos like "Dr. Alien" and "Demonwarp"), Andy Freeman, and especially the eerily divine Elizabeth Hoy, are really horrible and convincing as a terrible troika chilling and evil rugrage. And yes, this is nothing more than Julie Brown, a brass comedy who surprised me with the Top 40 hit the fun of the "The Homecoming Queen's Gotta Gun", like a cute, empty, inflatable redhead bimbo, who takes a very long time, completely alien, but still sparkling and highly appreciated nude striptease dancing in her bedroom as a cheerful and devastating rock song! All in all, this baby's size is a strong and satisfying slasher product.
