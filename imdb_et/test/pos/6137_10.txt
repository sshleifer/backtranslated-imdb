I agree with so many other reviewers here. It was a great movie and even better for Robert Fish. Unfortunately, I believe the author died before he saw this movie. The performances are top-notch, with the three principles (John Glover, Ben Cross and Veronica Hamel) seemingly playing their roles. Both the European and Israeli looks very authentic, and the 4-hour minisaster's length was right to tell this story. Luckily, I did DID tape it when it was on television and enjoyed it ever since. I can say that it is up to this day. I gave him an estimate of 10. If you haven't read a book, you should really find a copy. This would be an outstanding movie on a DVD, whose extras could easily include interviews.
