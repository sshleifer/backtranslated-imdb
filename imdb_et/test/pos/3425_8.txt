I saw this movie at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival. I went on the assumption that when he celebrated Chiwetel Ejiofor and Hilary Swank, it had to be at least decent. Well, after some slow start, I was far from disappointed. In fact, I was very happy with the end product. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that some of the actors in the Afrikaans and Xhosa (?) Highlighted English were difficult to understand, but as the "Waking Ned Devine", "Trainspotting", or some other film with heavy accent characters , I corrected after about 15 minutes, and I tried to find out why Hilary Swank was supposed to be South Africa and sounded like he tried to emphasize, but it sounded very American ... as if he had made a weak attempt to put pressure on. More about his character, and how he moved to the United States as a teenager, you begin to understand how he may have lost some or most of his accent. > I know that using a film under education is a bit weak, but one of the biggest things about this movie is that it was interesting to see the drama of truth and reconciliation trial. ie, the fall of apartheid, but I didn't know how it worked. <br /> <br /> The final decision is that while some scenes felt a bit it was generally a very strong film. The final order where "truth" appears, was a strong finish for each film's hope. Everyone who cares about what is happening outside their boundaries must be sure.
