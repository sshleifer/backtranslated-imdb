Following the tremendous success of Nick Park and Aardman's team with the short animation of Wallace and Gromid, we now have the first (hopefully many) with so many lovable plasticine characters. The movie DVD has proved that my two kids of Christmas gifts have been the most durable and best used for a long time. The plot is quite simple, but for me, W & G is the beauty of movies. Kids and adults have plenty of front panels and strokes, but the background is a killer for me. All the classic in addition to the stylish movie Nick Park, and I would often like to see fans and new observers.
