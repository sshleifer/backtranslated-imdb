I don't see this movie much wrong about it. It is allowed that the main singers may not be Luciano Pavarotti and Maria Callas, but they can certainly hear. Burt Bacharach and Hal David are talented songwriters and I love my songs, especially "The World is Ring", "The Things I Don't Miss" and "Ask Me the Answer". Some people argue that the Hermes Pan choreography is terrible and that the snowy mountain set looks like they are made of plastic; I disagree with both counts. I've seen snow before the snow and seeing the snow in the mountains is realistic for me. And first and foremost for the protection of this film, it is suitable for the family audience (at least I remember it was when I saw it on Christmas Day a few years ago.) All over the world of sex and violence in cinema these days, I find it refreshing to note that this film deserves its G rating. And they don't say this naughty "F" word every ten minutes, like some seen movies. Thank God. So, although this film may not be everyone's teapot, it has a redemption value and I give it ten out of a possible ten. This is my story and I'm stuck with it.
