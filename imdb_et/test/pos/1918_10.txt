a well-made documentary about sailing competition, peace of mind and the loss of both. <br /> <br /> I remember reading Sir Francis Chichester's report of his trip around the world when I was in high school when I watched this movie. which was an adventure. <br /> <br /> Deep water speaks equally excitingly. <br /> <br /> It takes a special person and a great seaman to manage the stops around the world ... alone. <br /> <br /> This movie does it very well. <br /> <br /> I love sailing and my brothers compete in J-30. <br /> <br /> But I never had such a feat.
