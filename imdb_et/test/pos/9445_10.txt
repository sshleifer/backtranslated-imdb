I loved this movie so much. I'm a big fan of Amanda Bynes' recently finished show. I admire her (after her body) for her ability to act. He's a good actor. <br /> <br /> The film was great. It's about a girl whose name is Viola, who wants to play football, but when her school football team cuts, she gets upset. His brother plans to go to a prestigious school and decides to leave for England. So Viola wants to make an impression when she plays an internship in a football team. She goes to school and tries the football team. She gets in. At the same time, he meets a Duke who is a sensitive man playing a football team. She really likes Olivia (Laura Ramsey) who likes Sebastian, who is really a viola. Sebastian is familiar with Monique and suspects that Sebastian is not himself. <br /> <br /> This is definitely not a chick flick and I enjoyed it a lot. It's so funny and cute. I don't think I've seen AManda work better.
