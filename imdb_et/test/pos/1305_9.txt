I noticed this movie at Duane Reed's pharmacy on holiday in New York, and it seemed a bit stupid to have fun. And surely the whole premise is ridiculous after words, but it turned out to be a very enjoyable film for children and their parents. <br /> <br /> 10-year-old Ricky Bernard (Jordan Garrett) has headaches in his clouds, a lot of disappointment from his father (Larry Miller). As a member of his school orchestra, Ricky and his schoolmates drive for a concert performance ... and Ricky remembers "again" and suspects that there will be a criminal line. <br /> <br /> The best friend, Sashi, is the fan of the hot sauce (what a strange plot device is) and the others they try to solve the mystery. Oh yes, and Ricky's skills 1000 hours of flight simulator experience come in handy when invited to save the day at the exciting peak of the movie! It was good to see Eric Roberts and Mark Dacoscosit in the family film. And watching DVD interviews seems to have been very fun for everyone to attend. <br /> <br /> I liked the young pilot; charming and kind-hearted performance, funny plot line and real; a sense of enjoyment and pure stupidity. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a fun family movie, you might want to buy it a lot less.
