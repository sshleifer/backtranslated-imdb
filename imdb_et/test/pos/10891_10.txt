Not only is GoldenEye 007 the best time-playing game, it is probably the most influential first-person shooter to ever hit the game console market. If you don't know the plot of the game, which is not a problem, because it's the same popular James Bond film, GoldenEye, which appeared in 1995 - two years before the game was released. <br /> <br /> This is a game full of techniques and styles that would be imitated in many future games, giving the player various goals and challenging challenges. A.I. is intelligent (especially in major difficulties) and the environment is complex enough to provide both entertainment and gaming difficulties. <br /> <br /> Introducing logical hits to your enemies is a great feature. Even the bosses of this game can be taken off with well-headed ends. It is such realism that makes you feel like your James Bond and that you can sneak in, sneak out, hide yourself when you go, or wake up and you have to go through massive shootouts. That's why there are many ways to win the game and have unlimited opportunities to complete your tasks. AKA: You can take simple ways or difficult levels ... and if you don't have a strategic guide, you need to look for those roads yourself (which I could add that it is incredibly fun if you want to waste a day). <br /> <br /> This is one of the more games you play, the more you'll be able to evaluate your contribution to the game sector. Whenever I play, I notice aspects that have repeated in many of the following FPS games. So, if you have a Nintendo 64 walk and dust to a mammal and order a used copy of GoldenEye 007 because you trust me as a fan of Bond and as a casual player, I can say that this game is highly recommended for all those who want to step into James Bond's shoes or just awesome. , an intense gaming experience. <br /> <br /> (Make sure you look at your sister's Perfect Dark, which is also on N64, following the same controls and very similar weapons.)
