I'm not a person looking at T.V.i because the actress sucks or is unrealistic or too dramatic! But this exhibition is perfect. Anyone can act and you can interact with the characters and their situations. Everyone has their own personality, and Lorelai Gilmore is the best for her sarcastic comments that can make the bad situation a little funny. Rory Gilmore is a good example for all girls. She is proud that she wants to participate in Harvard, and boys / boys are always in second place in their book. He is a loyal friend and always a creator of peace. There's a subtle romance that I like personally. Not a dirty romance that many people do in their lives, but a realistic romance. Every sign will end up with it and they will not find their prince at first glance, and they will not just love every man who comes his way. This is a realistic show, but when you look at it, you can raise your films, pop culture and random facts, because Lorelai Gilmore always makes references. I fell in love with this exhibition and if you give her the opportunity, you.
