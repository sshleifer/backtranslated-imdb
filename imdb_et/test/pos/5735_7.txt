It's a bit of a hell egg. I started to hate it because it is a predictable structure of "Old Dark House", a constant reference to the recent US horrors and regular trips in dimly lit corridors. <br /> <br /> But it goes and it was moments of originality. <br /> <br /> When the killing began, I began to think about how they plan to leave it for only six months, but then we get back to the previous building visit and see a whole host of murders that are quite effective. <br /> <br /> Naschy is good and finally it has been an enjoyable movie. It just doesn't jump or grab one, hard enough.
