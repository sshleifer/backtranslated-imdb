I absolutely loved this movie! Since I don't want to give away much, it's basically about mother and daughter and their lives together. This is a very affectionate story between the struggles between them. I also think that Natalie and Susan have the perfect chemistry for the whole movie! It's definitely worth it! Two thumbs up, make up!
