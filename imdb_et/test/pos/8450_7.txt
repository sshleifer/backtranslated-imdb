The "Chinese Syndrome" launched a series of films about the potentially devastating effects of misused nuclear energy - a black paranoia cloud hanging over most Reagan over the years in America. It is a well-made and effective drama that has given its high-power stars, especially Jack Lemmon, who plays a senior nuclear power plant who is suffering from a conscience crisis. But one cannot help but I think that just three weeks after the release of this film, the Serendipitic timing of the Three Mile Island nuclear accident took place, which has given it a lasting appeal as a classic of the 70s. Just as it's traceable, it's certainly not classic. <br /> <br /> The red headed Jane Fonda as a news reporter and bearded Michael Douglas as his camera man (and film producer, by the way). <br /> <br /> Rating: B +
