Many movies try to take universal themes and make comedy; but few will rise to an event like "Checking Out". The film is great. The dialogue is well written and true in form. Action is absolutely prima. Peter Falk has given a truly excellent result - as an actor; as an actor. He is capable of giving up big. Another great performance is Laura San Giacomo. He's such an interesting actor. His performances are surprised. He gives whatever role he should ask for - from Stephen King's "The Stand" wacko to his TV shows. But "Checking Out" allows it to shine. His role is to play. The film is perfectly staged by Jeff Hare. She was able to bring out her story and her direction - in every aspect - made the film a wonderful treasure. Jeff Hare was able to make the difficult subject ridiculous and deep. He gives us a close and personal look at why indie movies have to be done. Leaders' knowledge of his pain and script extends to the finished film. The results are great. <br /> <br /> Hopefully it will be made available to a large audience because it is one you don't want to miss. It has the potential to be in the 2005 sleeping bag - "My Great Fat Greek Wedding".
