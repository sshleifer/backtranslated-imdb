this flick is strange but i liked it a lot. its about a good girl who loves her bad boyfriend and their confused honeymoon. he does not love her and she is the average son of a woman. he will love him after really talked about things happen in their honeymoon. its weird yes! but different than other movies happy. I don't know what to compare, but the story of that love. but there are also many funny things. like getting a James Franco wig. I liked the laptop a lot and it seemed like a love story. but the rest is different. something like that. Sienna Miller is really good. I saw this movie in the experiment because I like him a lot and his fashion. I liked her girlfriend, but it's a better movie than it was. he and jama franco really love in this movie and i hope they are in real life but don't know it <br /> <br /> it !!
