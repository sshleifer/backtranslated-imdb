It's a shame that this movie is rated PG 13 - it's really good for everyone - although young kids may not be watching it well. <br /> <br /> It belongs to this strange serio-comic ghost / angel that should contain all of Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life" and Wenders "Wings of Desire". <br /> <br /> Photography is a stunning, first-rate show and - miracle miracle - uplifting. My only criticism is that there is not much ambiguity in the film. Two intertwined stories seem intriguingly mysterious at first; but they will solve their taste a little too nicely. As the director commented on the DVD, all the components of Irwin's story are at his nightstand. The symbolism is just too small for me. <br /> <br /> What a smell! My favorite scene must be when the relocation team tries to have breakfast. It is virtually a theatrical, spiritual, playful, and positive rhythm in its magic, with amazing cinematography and a sharp eye for grotesque. <br /> <br /> "Northfork" is funny, moving, gorgeous, magical (with the above mentioned reservations) and has no single car. <br /> <br /> Simple nine stars.
