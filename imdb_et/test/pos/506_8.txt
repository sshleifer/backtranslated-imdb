Blade is a dark, grim but important vampire movie and it is one of the best. A little gore, but nothing really bad. Wesley snipes played a strong role in eliminating vampires. Not as buffy as it is too tame, but Blade offers a decent piece of land and this is the kind of film you probably would like to see on a dark stormy night .... it's at best viewing! <br /> <br /> 87%
