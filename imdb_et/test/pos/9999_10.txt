Although I am not a golf fan, I participated in this film and loved it. Historical sites, blatant class distinctions and good and bad eyesight on both sides of the line kept my attention. Participants and their characteristics were all enchanting. And during the golf segments I was on the edge of my seat, which was not only dramatic and exciting but also easy to follow. At the end of this movie, "Seabiscuit" was strongly remembered, although "The Greatest Game Ever Playing" is a much less complicated story than this movie. In both cases, my interest was deepened by the fact that events really happened.
