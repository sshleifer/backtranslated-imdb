This short film intends to focus on one sociologically known cultural event. The film represents the average status of Romania in a democratic Romania, who finds that life and problems do not differ from the communist period, and if you want something, you must bribe it. <br /> <br /> Our main character is fired after a long time, he is about 50 years old and must have the same job, but the only job is one of the worst. He is forced to take it because of lack of money. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, you have to live in Romania to make this film as real and tragic as it seems.
