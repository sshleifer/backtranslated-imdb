The film was very good. I am an avid mysterious fan and I usually think of killing and killing. Although I thought of killing, I couldn't figure out who did it. I was not happy with portraying Gerda's character, but given that the year in which the film was supposed to be, it is possible that the woman was "cloying". Please be aware that although these Poirot films are good, they do not have the same dynamics as the series because they don't have Japp, Ms. Lemon and especially Hastings! David Suchet is definitely Poirot. I've seen all the actors who played him. The worst was Peter Ustinov!
