Looking for evidence that real life is entertaining as a fiction? You found it. This brilliant documentary from the aspiring filmmaker (Mark Bortchart), who refuses to defeat, is a more fun movie I've ever seen - probably because it's one of the most tragic. Oddly enough, the more I watch the film, the more I get inspired.
