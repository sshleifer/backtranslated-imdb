This film brought me tears. I must say that if I were not a beautiful man at home, I would ask this beautiful art to marry. Aaron Carter gives a masterful idea of ​​a confused young pop star, while Timothy Barton writes a quick and clever dialogue that only promotes Carter's performance gene. Kyle is a pretty gay, but his performance was nothing but remarkable. She is also very beautiful and lovely. I thought I'd ask her for a date and give her a very sweet gift at night.) <br /> <br /> If you want to discuss this movie in the future, please contact me. <br /> <br /> Nick Burrell Vassar Class 2012 Malibu, California Malibu West 310 924 0126
