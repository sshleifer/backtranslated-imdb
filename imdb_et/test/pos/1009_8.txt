I hate football! I hate football fans! I hate cars! but this movie was a more fun thing I've seen for some time. <br /> <br /> I was given a great opportunity to see this movie over the weekend, and all I have to say is that I laughed until I called, and when it will be available in the UK and Denmark. Girls, this is one football movie you need to see, its fun! <br /> <br /> The fact that this movie started as a crazy van for a telephone company is simply amazing that boys may not be well-known actors, but it is real humor with real people, and I commend them for he put it on the screen. <br /> <br /> WELL DONE!
