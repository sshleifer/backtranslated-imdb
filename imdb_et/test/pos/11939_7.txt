- Best Bit: When the dull mobster (Nicholas Turturro) calls the kidnapped (Matthew Modine) "Shane! .. Come back to Shane!" and when the older wise man asks him, "What are you doing ?!" He simply repeats "Enjoy Your Time!" Actually, I like it now! <br /> <br /> The most horrible part: I've been wondering the whole time of viewing: where did I see this girl before? where? where? Until I found out about the closing credits .. OHH MY GOD! She is (Elizabeth Berkley) .. Showgirls fiasco! But I just couldn't recognize her! To prove the truth, I felt short shaking. She's really cute and nice, but maybe Hollywood didn't have any grace! <br /> <br /> - The most sexy bit: when (Berkley) says, "Do you mean, what things will give you thinner?" <br /> <br /> - The darkest thing: The slowed assistant after a day and the night in the back of the car is still alive and healthy! !!, in addition, Mexican smuggler took 3 balls (on the same car!) and he is not dead !! ?? <br /> <br /> The most ugly thing: all those murdered people, as well as numerous (F) congregations bored! <br /> <br /> The most beautiful thing: a crazy funny script with all the funny characters and noisy situations, acting nice too (Paul Rodriguez) who stole the show (as he had the best dialogue!). <br /> <br /> - The most disappointing thing: although the direction was not at all a story, but at the same time it didn't give a unique touch, an inappropriate signature, some mad fun like the story itself. Maybe this low production has been wrong! And, of course, simple tasteless music that can be the same because of cheap manufacturing! <br /> <br /> - The most cumbersome part: (Matthew Modine) is a talented man, but what exactly did he do to be a Hollywood star? What could be what he did (or not!) To get to light independent jestos (shipment)? !! <br /> <br /> - The most inadequate scene: Where did Jose (Mexico) finally go? I thought we could see him again at the end, smuggling the survivors a little bit of a criminal, who, with such a short trick, could realize the constant disorder of such a world. <br /> <br /> - the question I had after the end: when will we see (shipment - 2)? Because I'm so eager to have this little comic hurly-cozy atmosphere again! <br /> <br /> These were my own answers. If you are interested in replying to your questionnaire, please send me an email.
