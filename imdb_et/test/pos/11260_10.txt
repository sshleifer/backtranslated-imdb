What can I say? I couldn't sleep and I met this movie with MTV. I started to look at it with every intention to change the channel when it started limping, because so many anti-drug films were made, but I got this movie and I couldn't watch it. Nick Stahl did an amazing job of its nature, and I think he made the film truly worthwhile. I was interested in the soundtrack of the movie (or even the film itself) being purchased and MTV.com was not at all helpful, but believe it or not. Amazon.com will pre-order the release of the movie on August 5th from DVD. I know it was hard for me to follow it and I'm sure other people had the same problem. I buy my copy so I can overpower Nick Stahl while the emotional storyline gets out of my eyes at the same time!
