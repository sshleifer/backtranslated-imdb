Excuse me when I am wrong, but "Cronica para un desayuno" could be one of the most enjoyable films in Mexico's history for many reasons. We get a lot of ingredients for a perfect Mexican middle-class family holiday: a cup of surreal motifs from Buñuel, with a few drops of Ripstenia's destroyed scenarios; pounds around the film and heavy psychological complexity more than Todd Solondz's happiness and Dogma motion pictures. There's a lot of mercy, black humor, repressed dreams (Teodoro's dream of flying), lack of control (the relationship between Marcos and Luzma), a parallel story, discrete violence, anachronisms, and <br /> <br /> a little sense of hope (highlighted in Luzmas, his wife's homeland) return and "Un poco Mas" used in the found motif). Marcos (Bruno Bichir) is a charming character (I think it's Bukoskian), king, without a crown, who doesn't expect anything but a broken nose. Loving husband Luzma (Maria Rojo) put a lot of faces, but the only thing she worried about was that her sons had breakfast; she is a loser in many ways and sensual after a few moments, but you love her. The dragging of the sound track (too many forests) naturally nourishes the lack of technical features, of course: focusless images, illuminated close-ups (in introspective scenes), dizziness pans and sudden print cuts. "Crónica" has something complicated digestion, it is in the throat and something helps. It tastes bitter, like rotten orange juice and sour like outdated milk, but you want to enjoy it. So I recommend getting Melox before the show because you don't get hungry.
