This 3-hour epic (looks much shorter) explores the will for power and conquest, and contradictory motives that underlie this endeavor, following two parallel lives: Emperor Q'in, whose desire to unite the Chinese feudal nations, is the basis for the ultimate goal but committed to violent oppression , isolation and extreme powerlessness; and an assassin, Jing Ke, a mercenary killer who understands the unintended consequences of murder and finds a form of salvation. As with all major arts, it can be understood on several levels. The film brought out pictures and ideas from Homer, Euripides, Machiavelli, Shakespeare and Freud. <br /> <br /> The story itself is true (I checked it through britannica.com!), so this film complains about history. It is ironic that Q'in spent much of his last years in meaningless searching for immortality (not shown on the screen, but in line with the sample). <br /> <br /> The film can also be seen as an allegory of Maoism and Cultural Revolution. It is possible to understand through the film that the last 50 years of Chinese history have been their precedent for the past 3000 years. <br /> <br /> For the audience, these sophisticated ideas have been developed in films that are rich in action and pagent. Battle scenes are worth the entrance price alone.
