Uh, hello .. Rainbow Brite. The name alone is hard to take seriously, as it could be a strawberry Shortcake cousin. But if you're a child, it's definitely a serious thing. So there is this weak, dirty, corrupted girl and she wants the Rainbow Brites belt, that is, the light of the whole universe, and Rainbow Brite and her friend Cris are involved and decided to stop him. As I remember, Murky and Lurky played a minor role in this production. Maybe they wanted too much money? <br /> <br /> So wet, evil girl is a powerful gemstone and she directs her power to take the Rainbow belt. But somehow Rainbow gets his belt back and restores it with a "star sprinkle" and captures the backs of bad girls with Crise and his prism bracelet and saves the whole universe of the process. <br /> So good triumph over evil, jokes triumphant, and Rainbow Brite and Color Kids are once again safe to spread colors and joy to all humanity.
