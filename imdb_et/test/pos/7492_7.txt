When I watched this movie, I had no idea what it was, and I had never heard of it before. But I have to say that I was positively surprised. The first few minutes are the most funny of the whole movie. The Indian store secretary is just too funny! Anyway, the story doesn't really talk too much, but I think it's ok. On the other hand, acting is quite good and still the only actor I recognized was Mickey Rourke, who didn't reach the end of the movie. And the end is where the switch-off is in my mind, it's not bad, but I don't feel it really ends. I feel there should have been more. Final battle in some way. I do not know. All in all, it was a good movie and I recommend it to any Tarantino-type movie with lots of violence and dark humor! I appreciate it 7/10.
