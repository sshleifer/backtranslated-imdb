Like some other people, I wrote that I'm a hard mario fan and I loved this game. <br /> <br /> This game starts a little boring, but trust me, it's worth it. As soon as you start, your hook! Levels are fun and outgoing. They will grab you until your mind turns. I'm not kidding. This game is also organized and beautifully done. <br /> <br /> To keep the spoiler open, I have to hold my mouth. But try this game! It's worth it! <br /> <br /> Story: 9.9 Action: 10.1 (It's That Good!) Hardness: 10 Attention Grabber: 10 Average: 10
