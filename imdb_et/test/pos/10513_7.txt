When you read about this movie, you want to spit. I've seen it countless times, and yet I myself! What is Attraction here? I think this is a romance for me. I find it very refreshing to have an odd connection between a columnist and a happy (health-conscious) ballerina like this NYC Jimmy-Breslin. You feel Paul Sorvino is embarrassed by this ridiculous approach to this woman. Like a man who can't take hints. She is a bit overweight (at least as if she wanted ballerina. I hope it doesn't sound uncomfortable) and maybe even too old. The pace of Nice changed from the super model of the Greek gods. Bill Conti's score with my head all these years later, which is a pretty good sign. But some of the actions are just terrible. The Sorvino character's friendly young Puerto Rico boy sub-block is just funny bad. But the opening where Ditchburn gets to Carole King draws you to this story. Good luck to find. You think that life would have inspired this or even WE again, but I haven't seen it in a couple of years.
