If you've never experienced what Zasu Pitts is, here is Zasu zinger! In 1933, Mae Questel's Pitti voiced his voice for Olive Oyl for the animated comic copy of Pleye by Fleischer Studios. Zasu (pronounced Zay-Sue) makes his best "Olive Ola" impersonation by walking around and calling his hand or securing himself to the policeman. I was waiting for him to say "ohhh myyyy", but instead of "something happens to someone." The first time I saw this movie was that I loved Zasut and found that his character was really funny. I've seen it since then in other movies where he does the same whimsical, dense and fragile flower routine. So, when you look at this movie again, I started to make a little annoyance with constant wilting and hysteria about dust. But here are some funny comedy buds and this is also a mysterious film. It's an interesting mix of mystery and comedy that really works. The mystery piece holds together the camp of Zasu Pitt and James Gleason, who plays Arthur Crimmer as a police officer. Haunted House is fun with many secret passages and even the attic in the attic! It is worth a look. Read more about movie reviews for public domains at: http://pdmoviereview.blogspot.com/
