My family and I like this exhibition and find this fair dwarf vision of what people went through. <br /> <br /> My dad spent time in Chang before going to the Thai-Burmese railway in F. Force. Much like the talk of receiving POWs, I just say that my father was 6 feet 1 inches and 196 pounds when Singapore fell, at the end of the war he was 5 feet 11 inches long and 91 pounds. > <br /> No exhibition can really deliver what chips have gone through, but it's closer than most. <br /> <br /> As Ex POW says, "If you have no companions, you will not survive." This exhibition succeeds in delivering this message.
