I saw this movie years ago (with another Shepitko movie Wings) as part of a series of Soviet films in a local film archive. But none of Shepitko's films have ever made it in the United States for video or DVD. Ascent is a great movie with any standard that has stunning black and white photography, a hypnotic direction, and actors so deep in their roles that you have no idea that they just give a result. The resilience (and cooperation) of the Russian occupation is very slow, but the story is timeless. The Germans capture two Russian partisans and the interrogation tests their integrity and courage. I suspect that the reason why the Russians have not published it on the DVD (there comes a spoiler) is that the Jewish intellectual (not a tough Russian peasant) is a partisan who is opposed to both threats and temptations, peacefully dying , and sets a heroic example for the villagers.
