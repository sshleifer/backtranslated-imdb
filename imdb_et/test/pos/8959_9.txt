Again, I am surprised that Thomas Gibson did not reach his career in his first career. In this film, Gibson once again demonstrates his ability to capture characters regardless of sexuality, social status or nationality. Gibson plays a very convincing gay man at the end of the 20th century. Offering is not yet feminine, fears the basic principles of love, the character of Gibson touches different emotions. Cameron Bancroft also deserves to work. His need to be a heterosexual conqueror, not his best friend's homosexual conquests, gives dynamism to relationships that are unexpected in many ways. Bancroft and Gibson's chemistry come from the first scene they see together. There were many "panels" there. Straight from homosexual relationships; heterosexual relationships to study lesbian love; this film moves through a wide spectrum of sexuality, while being at the heart of its killers. My only regret is that it took 6 years to release it before I discovered this movie! I look forward to it again and recommend it to fans of Bancroft, Gibson or Director Denys Arcand.
