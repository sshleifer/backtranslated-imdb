Better than the original, "Dorkness Rising players succeed in pulling out a funny comedy with good actors, fine special effects and comedy that transcends the" player "knowledge base and makes it a low budget. I've seen a lot of low-budget movies that have been terrible and almost none that have been as good as their high budget colleagues. This movie captures most mainstream movies! Some are a bit weak (a bit with pirates and ninjas - funny - going a little while without explanation and taking you out of the movie), but in general it's a very strong film. <br /> <br /> I am very happy to say that I bought this movie as soon as I saw it and brought it home. <br /> <br /> Any chance we expect is another feature. :)
