The Earth's final conflict began as a new world, a new vision from the creator of Star Trek, something fresh and unique, full of great elements. A very good light with a very reliable Kevin Kilner like William Boone, a former policeman, will be working as a guardian of a mysterious alien (Talons) ambassador after his wife's death in strange conditions. But soon, the character of Kilner can join a group whose task is to discover the intentions of foreigners, why they seem so nice and caring about the human race. Soon, this resistance movement will discover the blind plans of the talons, using those who have their own problems to destroy them. As I said earlier, the exhibition started to be big, everything was almost perfect, including Da'an, like Da'an, the original Da'an was a big secret, because he seems to be a nice creature, but at the same time he is manipulating his evil plans some people on earth. Soon Zo'or, who was not bad, came ... ... to mark the beginning of this exhibition, because he became the first great enemy of the people, an embodiment of evil, killing something bigger in Da'an. The first seasons end perfectly with Boone's dead and the second shows a new leadership liam (Liam), a hybrid of man and Kimera (another alien racing) with some very interesting powers. He replaces Kilner's character in good ways, so the second story makes it better, including the conflict with the jars and atav. But as I said the lines before Zo'or's evil began to take on more importance, the new conflicts were as realistic as the same talons. Over time, a large line of alien roots in Liam, where almost all things related to the previous season were almost completely erased. So when the last season started, the original Earth's final conflict was just forgotten dreams, all the lack of magic, just to let some useless exhibitions, including Kilner and Liam's return for some episodes. The final episode was just evidence of how bad the exhibition of so many bad changes was (to think that some episode writers didn't know anything about the first stories) was one of the worst end I ever saw in the TV show. True shame, because the Earth's Final Conflict began as something unique, fresh, stories cast, after watching so many exhibitions from the United States, something from Canada as Star Trek creator was wonderful, but eventually it all became worse. I hope that someday somebody will be doing this exhibition, using of course the fourth and fifth seasons (except cast, all were perfect in their work). I can still dream of better things.
