This is not the best movie you will ever see, but it is still very refreshing. Of course there are errors, it is humble moments and at the same time it is different than everything you are used to and that is so funny that only French can give you. When you see the opening, you can understand a little about the masterpiece Amelie. I'll give him ten out of 10, but I recommend it to you if you are tired of the usual cage you can rent from a video store.
