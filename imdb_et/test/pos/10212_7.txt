Western Union is a forgotten classic western! Perhaps this is because it is not available on DVD in the United States. But it does not disappear because it has now appeared in the 2nd region of England. It's a blessing in a sense - it's not only inconsistent, but completely ironic, if we think that a film that is the establishment and creation of a uniquely American organization, such as the Western Union Telegraph Company, is not a region 1 release. It spurs faith! It just doesn't make sense! <br /> <br /> The Western Union produced by Fox in 1941 was led by Fritz Lang. It was only the second time a big German director promised to lead the West! He had done a great job a year ago with Fox's "returning Frank James" and he had only one western break in 1952 with an excellent "Rancho Notorious". Lang wasn't Ford or Hawks, but with Western Union he turned to a fine, western, well-tolerant one. At the beginning of Edward Cronjager's third strip, it was beautifully photographed that it was a good example led by Robert Young, Randolph Scott and Dean Jagger. Women are led by Virginia Gilmore, who actually has something to do with the picture. An actor who never made his career. His presence here is only cosmetic. <br /> <br /> It's curious that Robert Young has the best billing for Scott! This is clearly Scott's picture from the very beginning, when we first saw him in the terrible opening scene of the film, followed by the whole plain. Young does not have much to do throughout the film and it seems to be in the West. He just looks like a common fool against Barton McLane. An actor who never differed himself - except for "Crossfire" (1947) - Young appeared in a series of forgotten romantic comedies of the forties and fifties that culminated in his greatest success when he was seven years in the "Marcus Welby MD" in the 1970s . He died in 1998 at the age of 91. <br /> <br /> Western Union speaks Omaha and Salt Lake City with a telegraph wire. Scott plays a reformed law, rented by Western Union boss Dean Jagger to protect the line from abducting Sioux and also taking McLane and his gang who are trying to destroy the line with their despicable ends. Robert Young is a young engineer back to east, joining the company and studying with Miss Gilmore's hearts with Scott. Some comic reliefs - and annoying to say some - Slim Summerville and John Carradine are a modest role as a business physician. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is still a western, albeit in the 2nd region, but a good quality sparkling wine that fans are happy with. My only crib is that there are no extras, not even a trailer, and this terrible cover with these dull graphics. UGH! <br /> <br /> Footnote: Interestingly, the Western Union affiliate was Harry Joe Brown, who later, with Randolph Scott, created a partnership that would bring some of Scott's best Western parts in the fifties.
