This is one of the best TV movies I've ever seen! The title makes it so obvious and predictable, but it's all, all TV movies are like that! <br /> <br /> The story is fantastic. It may seem ridiculous, but it is based on an incredibly real story. Gary Cole plays a soldier named Dave, who feels a trap of marriage. She gives up her wife and children and fakes her death! Everything that he could be with Alyson (Karen Sillas). How far does Dave go to keep his secret? <br /> <br /> Action is the top limit for TV movies. Gary Cole holds the film especially as a charming, smooth-talking sociopath with the answer to everything a woman suspects. Karen Sillas does her best as a woman who discovers that her husband is a LIAR and does not know what to do with it. Teddi Siddall, who in my opinion Gary Cole's wife in real life, plays her part well, especially when she cries out for her "death". Wendy Makkena adds a nice touch to Alyson's sister. Linda Goranson is great for her small role as Dave's mother. <br /> <br /> Predictable, but the actor and the story take several notches of this movie.
