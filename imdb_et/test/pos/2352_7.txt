It's 1913. The studio expert boy spies on an actor who will be Hollywood's next big movie and he will be the director who's going to happen. After the pill throwing and inventing the cornerstones, his dream becomes true. Being fully absorbed in his cinema, he doesn't mean he loses his leading wife to another man. Several budget flops later, he is known as something other than the director who turned to Rin tin. Fortunately, Hollywood's loyal and compassionate inhabitants are without ambition and ego. He's fine as long as he still has his friends. <br /> <br /> This movie begins with a period of snake comedy, and with the scenes that open it has the best of them. It has a playful lack of self-consciousness, which is very deficient in most of today's comedies. In short, the film moves away from this comedy and tries to attract the mind in the movie using the film. These are silent bouncing comedies, well done, but nothing ordinary, and they will last much longer than needed by any audience that has seen the originals. After returning, the film takes a dramatic turn. It's well written and cast to do a great job of making a transition, but the film should have decided from the start what it should be. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie it has changed again - this time for a few Hollywood shine. A small town in Los Angeles has grown into a city that makes entertainment movies around the world. <br /> <br /> Despite its promising start, this film is not very outdated. However, it has strong scenes, a firm nostalgic complaint and a fun subtitle about the people who did it and the audience to whom it was made.
