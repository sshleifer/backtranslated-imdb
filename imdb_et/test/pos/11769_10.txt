what a very small movie, some good occasions in some random letters. Basically, these are potters who get into a comic adventure. In the paragraphs, the film makes sure everyone is dead! What adds comedy. If John Lithgow's (3rd Rock) character reappears - its impossible not to imagine a trip, it may be like a complete paradox. The film is full of twists that keep you out of the way. Billy Bob Thornton Astronaut Farmer is brilliant, in fact looking back, the character is quite similar to having a family of potters. Anyone involved in this movie should get a big thumb. <br /> <br /> As I say, the last scene is a dream; same nightmare at the same time. I love how Hank Azaria (carter) finally says, should we do it every year? I knew that they wanted it. <br /> <br /> I am not saying that this movie is good for everyone, but as a stoner movie lover I will give it a 10/10. - My advice is common; back and enjoy!
