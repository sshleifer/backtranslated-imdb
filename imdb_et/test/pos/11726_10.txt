Dirty Harry goes to Atlanta, which Burt called a fantastic, first-rate detective thriller that borrowed part of his plot on the honorable Dana Andrews film "Laura". The Burt Reynolds star is not in this magnificent prey, but he has guided it and does not make any mistakes, nor has he directed action or characters. Not a bad force in the film and Reynolds is doing a great job of managing it. Henry Silva is really icy as a striker. <br /> <br /> Detective Tom Sharky (Burt Reynolds) is a drug-related affair in the North Atlanta area, when everything goes wrong. He comes up behind the suspect and lets him out on the bus with a gun. An innocent bystander dies during the melee. John Woo "Killer" repeats this scene. In any case, the Atlanta Police Department will cut off Burt as Vice-President and take orders with a new boss from Frisco (Charles Durning "Oh, Brother, where are you?") In the basement. Sharky rises to the real blast of crime. Sharky and his associates Det (Archie Bernie Casey) and Papa (Brian Keith) set up a high-level speech artist Dominoe (Rachel Ward of "Dark Dark, My Sweet") with a luxurious apartment she shares with another girl <br /> <br /> Dominoe sees the local politician Hotchkins (police woman Earl Hollimani) on the side who fights for the governor, but the main villain Victor (Vittorio Gassman, "The Dirty Game") wants it to stop. Hotchkins doesn't want to accommodate Victoria so Victor has a cocaine that hits Billy Score (Henry Silva, "Wipeout"), ending with Dominoe. Billy explodes at the door of a Dominoe apartment with a twelve-inch pocket and kills her. <br /> <br /> Sharky has made this inconceivable. During the surveillance, she has grown up against Domino so much that she has hoped for her. Sharky's mission in life is now to bust Victoria, but he learns that Victor is an informant inside the Atlanta Police Department. The plot really warms up when Sharky later finds out that Billy shot the wrong girl and that Dominoe is still alive! Sharky takes him to the shelter and things are getting even more complicated. He's got his "machine" title to deal with Victor and his hoods. <br /> <br /> The William Fraker wide-screen lens that works is flawless. Unfortunately, this is a remarkably underrated classic only full-frame film. Fraker definitely contributes to the atmosphere of the picture, especially during the ship's distortion scene, when the villain cut off one Sharky's finger. This is a pretty terrible scene. <br /> <br /> Burt never made a movie that surpassed Sharky.
