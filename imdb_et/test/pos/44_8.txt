Lackawanna Blues is a moving story of a boy who has been raised by some rather unusual person. <br /> <br /> This editing and soundtrack really draws you into the story and allows you to experience the movie as the writer actually saw it. <br /> <br /> The music really associated with the story that put the characters to life. Editing made the story more progressive and exciting. <br /> <br /> I was also surprised by some of the performances, especially S. Epatha Merkerson. <br /> <br /> I can't wait to see this movie with such films as writer Ruben Santiago-Hudson.
