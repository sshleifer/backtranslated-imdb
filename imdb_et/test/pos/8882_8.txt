This movie is basically corrupted on Hitchcock's strangers train, which I thought would be overestimated anyway. The plot has Danny Devito, who plans to see strangers, and then thinks Billy Crystal wants them to kill for murder. Both Devito and Crystal are big and so is Devito's mother. This is the debut of the director of Devito and it is better than the rose war.
