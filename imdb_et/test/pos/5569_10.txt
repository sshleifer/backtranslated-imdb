Watching this series will probably see how our parents felt the Star Trek for the first time. <br /> <br /> This series is all. Such stories that make you forget how blinking, what signs make you jump on the TV to act, and the atmosphere that makes your hair terrible and endless admiration. <br /> In short, we start with John Chrichton, an astronaut who gets to the wormhole and comes with prisoners who are black who are ironically known as peacekeepers. <br /> <br /> Other colored characters consist of D'argo, a big short guy and a sword / laser rifle. Aerun Sun, former peacekeeper and Ph.D. Zotoh Zhan, who is the plant. No, he is. He's also a priest, but average. There's also Dominar Rygel XVI, a greasy lazy bastard who hits helium and generally does more harm than good. <br /> <br /> Later we will meet the most sexy alien who has ever been on television, namely Chiana. Young and seemingly chronically horny Nebari. He plays Gigi Edgley, which is the name you should remember. <br /> <br /> One of the many things I love about these series is that, as John Chrichton mistakenly entered this part of the galaxy, he continues to refer to real life. Namely, if John has some difficulty with being frozen as a statue for 80 years, one of his many complaints is that when he returns, Buffy The Vampire Slayer is dead. So Frell all the other series, take your Dren together and spend Ahn on one of these episodes. I can assure you, Sci / Fi, as you know, will change forever. <br /> <br /> This series is all. It's sexy. It's actionpacked. It's mountainous. This is Farscape
