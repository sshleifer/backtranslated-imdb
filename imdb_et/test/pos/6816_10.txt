For a first-time director's film, this is just an amazing little film, although I have to admit that it's a bit difficult to watch and probably offend the feelings of many people who follow it because the film takes suicide for a definite position. But what I loved about the movie is that I had no idea that it was what the film was about halfway through until the movie was finished, and then I was already hooked. <br /> <br /> In addition to the excellent presentation of the theme, I was surprised by the very professional style of the film - some of the best film I've ever seen in a short film. In addition, this camera was so well connected with music and pictures that made the movie beautiful. <br /> <br /> As I said, it's a controversial movie. I myself struggle with what I mean by this debate, but the film managed to make a written and intelligent way, I really have to respect the team that made the film.
