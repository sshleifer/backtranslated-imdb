This is a good episode, but it's not my favorite. Many people love it and at the creative level it's great. Most episodes do not have a dialogue that is both cool and Hush really works well. Plus, this episode introduces Tara, who I really like. But I don't like Riely or Inomatic or Maggie Walsh and they seem to get a lot of time in "Hush". In addition, I don't think gentlemen are the ones that are scary and I'm tired of watching the float around Sunnyda. I know I am in a minority, but I tend to pass on Hushi parts quickly. Of course, there are other parts of the episode that I think are great, so if you watch a DVD, I suggest you see this episode. It's really classic. <br /> <br /> Hush revolves around the city, losing its voices. Skeletalizing demons-boys, called gentlemen, can collect seven hearts of human casualties, but when they hear the loss of human life, they die. So they steal the voices of every city. Buffy and Scoobies are trying to find out what's going on while the inita is starting to investigate. Meanwhile, Xander comes to understand how much Mom means to her, and Willow will meet Tara, a man's witch. Buffy and Riely finally come face-to-face in fighting gentlemen. They're both stunned, they learn ... He's a commando and he's a Slayer. Finally, Buffy saves the day, but now he has to deal with his new knowledge of Riely's secret life. <br /> <br /> Really, "Hushi" creativity can not be seen in its main task plot. This is an episode of silence that makes it so great. The characters try to communicate differently, (white off tables, pantomime, hidden fingers, etc.) and it all works really well. After a while you forget that there is no dialogue because they are all so good to express themselves. During the episode's "spoken" portions, there are many references to the importance of "hearing". Anya says Xander doesn't really talk to her. Giles ignores Spike and Xander protests and demands that Spike move into Xander's apartment. Buffy quickly replaces "oil" for "patrolling" when he talks to Riel that he shouldn't call. And then at the end, when Buffy and Riely learn the truth about each other, they sit there to say something. It's all pretty cool. <br /> <br /> There are many good parts to this episode. I love people to forget they can't talk. Buffy and Xander are trying to use the phone. Riley can't use speech recognition to initiate the elevator. People are trying to shout. This is basically what everyone actually does if they suddenly don't have a speech. And I think it's fun that Spike has to move with Xander. (They also share the apartment for a while in the seventh season.) Xander and Spike have fun beating childhood, which is just fun. I also like the beginning of the relationship between Tara and Willow. Tara plays an important role in the rest of the performance and she and Willow are pretty cute. It's nice to see them just starting. <br /> <br /> On the negative side, I don't understand how gentlemen choose their victims. They just shine around the floats and pick random people. I also don't like Riely. I've never liked her, but from "Hush" I've been pretty much waiting for Angel to come back to town and beat her. Finally, what happens to Olivia after that? It looks like we just met him, his relationship with Giles, everything goes well ... and then he suddenly fell. I can't get it. <br /> <br /> My favorite episode: Giles "" Who are gentlemen? "The lecture for Scoobies. The whole scene is wonderful and its capitals are just fun. He makes some similar look cards for the Seventh Season" First Date. "Quite a lot of Giles are starting to draw monsters, it's just fun.
