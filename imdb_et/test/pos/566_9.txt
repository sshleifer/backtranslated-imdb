it is accompanied by the same blind weaknesses that we all have, unfortunately: lying, deceit, laziness, the list goes on. <br /> <br /> However, like an American, I was surprised that today there is corruption and racism in the police force, which is reflected in the terrible detective and police work of the Duval County Sheriff's Department with the murder of a white female tourist and a 15-year-old black youngster. I shook my head with shame that the detectives were protected from their malicious work, while the young man LIFE balanced the equilibrium. <br /> <br /> But in our court system there is hope and badly paid public defenders who have detained their weapons (for the purpose of irony) and forced the truth from the detective. I wanted to fly to Florida and tell someone about what a big public defense team in Duval County is; these lawyers care about the "little" man and the most important justice. <br /> <br /> Another story is about faith and family. Praises the beliefs of the accused's family and their strong Christians (present any devoted faith) and excellent family values. I hope they will fight their case against the Duval County Sheriff Department. <br /> <br /> Bravo for Justice !!! Bravo for a small man !!!
