It was a really moving movie in every sense. I myself was a missionary of Mormon and I know first of all that I want to complete my mission, but at the same time I hide the fact that I was gay. Like the Aaron characters, I was sent home to find out and expel, but being the only Mormon in the Catholic family, it was not as shameful as it was for the sign. This film brought me back to those days and helped me understand years later how happy I was with the family who accepted me and realized what I was going through. I found myself at the end of the movie when Aaron and Christian find each other in the Lila restaurant. I was really tears. I recommend this movie to anyone who reads this review and tells them to buy it.
