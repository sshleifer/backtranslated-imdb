This exhibition gives me respect for MTV, although I imagine that MTV sees this random, sharp material as its main point of sale and is much less concerned with the relevant truths it expresses. <br /> <br /> I write and play music for live and this exhibition can really make me emotionally rush. For me, Wondsershowzen serves a completely different function on most TVs. Instead of fading or disturbing the senses (which can often be really nice), my right and wrong spirit awakens. It makes me very uncomfortable, but very calm. <br /> <br /> I don't think many viewers absorb most of the content of this exhibition, but when they do, viewers are watching television everywhere.
