I killed it as a teenager in the mid-1980s, relying on a cable guide summary (a trot for the trappers that turned to me) that had no film knowledge or expectation. what a pleasant surprise when i watched it! it was such a fun movie and I remember watching it repeatedly. I thought this concept was well implemented, I enjoyed the harmless competition between the different groups, and I thought the catcher's wolf itself was pretty smart. sometimes people seem to have too high expectations of the film. Not all films have a weighty "message" or letters, production values ​​or special effects. sometimes the movies are just for entertainment and fun, and it succeeds on both levels. it was so nice to read the comments of the actors who played the twins. I haven't seen this movie for years, but when I think I would have just the same warm and enthusiastic response to it as I did when I was a teenager. even when I write it, the head of the cheese is still a suitable theme song: "when midnight madness comes to you ... it doesn't matter what you say, it doesn't matter what you do ...!"
