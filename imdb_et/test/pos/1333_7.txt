I felt that I got the whole story unknown. Although it may be twisted, this twisting was so important that I felt betrayed. I believe it could have been a better writer who could have put together all the elements of the story. The writer could have appeared more "twisted", not all at once. I believe that the actors did very well what they had, especially Matt Damon, who actually had little character of his character, little letters that were not selfish or like a smooth criminal who always knows what he does. The other main characters were their own separate entities, who just had to talk to each other. The group's compatibility with Ocean's Eleven was lost.
