This movie reminds me of great movies that temporarily awaken me to the emperor being really naked. Our election process is clean and unpleasant. My awareness is elevated and I want to see the world change. After a short time, I have lulled my little satisfaction and "bubble life." In the best sense of the film, this work ferments an edible tomb for me, and like "Network", which I want to be convicted of, I say, I am as affectionate, and I am not going to do it! But to whom? My vigorous youthful idealism has been slowly reduced to respond to parents who have quiet beliefs or rather "beliefs". The "Person of the Year" shows how much I miss honest and sometimes humorous to take our current political situation. Dobbs line "I breathe because I thought," What the hell, it's lit, it's in my hand, I breathe it. "" It was refreshing or would have been when Clinton was president. Why can't politicians be honest and set the tone for discussions? We humans need to understand how much plywood is put into reality? I'm already ill in the electoral process, anyone else? Shoot down the veils and set your chosen officials' agenda and take them out (not to re-elect) if they continue to cheat and don't represent the citizens. This film can inspire us to increase the expectations of politicians who express rhetoric. Great movie!
