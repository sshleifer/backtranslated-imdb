I've seen this movie twice on the cable. When I first saw it, it struck a surprise. On the pages of Skateboarder's Journalism at the end of the 1970s, we saw the people I saw. These were the guys we copied and tried to skate. I am glad that finally a movie was made that gives an accurate picture of how it all happened. I am almost 40 years old now and I think a pretty tough guy with all his life problems; this movie made me a good job. Back to free pools, backyard areas and Cherry Hill NJ. I suspect that in order to really understand this movie and understand it, you had to live it. Otherwise, it is unlikely to affect you as it was to me. But for you (and you know who you are) who lived it, you know exactly what I'm talking about! In any case, I don't care who you are if you have the chance to see this movie ... do it! I thank Dogtown Z-Boys for their youngsters' memories and thanks to Stacy for making this movie! JOB!
