Bridgette Bardot, who is as sexy as ever, plays with the French Ambassador's spoiled but innocent daughter. She disagrees with one of her father's main help (wife MICHEL) married to her and turns out to be the best for both. Michel soon flirted with her old girlfriends and, in order to teach her a lesson, Flirt flirted with her married PRINCE CHARLES. Michel is surprised at her jealousy. Between Brigdette and Michel a cat-mouse game appears ("I have a thing" ... "No, you don't" ...) And finally, Michel realizes that he can and will give up all the other ladies in his life. Bridgette and Michel live comfortably for their happy eternity as Prince Charles jet home to England. <br /> <br /> It's definitely easy, but it's incredibly charming. Although some may be flawed because it is time, I found it completely enjoyable. Rent value.
