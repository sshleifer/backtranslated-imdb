This game is very good for n64. You can skate like Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campell, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Rune Glifberg, Andrew Reynolds, Elissa Steamer, Jamie Thomas, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska and maybe some more skiers. There's no Mike V or Bam Margera in the game. Dang! Anyway, the game is fantastic. Level II is a great level to skate so much. In career mode, you collect SKATE, get money, get high scores in 2 minutes and other things. There's a skater that's pretty cool. I created a skater called Butt Mulligan, a black boy with an afro, and a girlboard. There's a park editor, some cool cutting-edge parks, a free skate, and one session where you skate for 2 minutes and get a score. You can watch repetitions that are always cool. Every skater has 2 styles: A and B. The graphics aren't that good. Well, they're good for the n64 game. I wish I had a controller package so I could save my data. In general, this game is fantastic. I'll give him 8/10. But with the GBA version, it's as fun as the n64 version, but it's hard to control. I'll give him 7/10 for the GBA. So go out where the n64 games are still sold and a copy is received. There are also versions for PS1.
