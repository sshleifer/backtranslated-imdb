... David Bovie sings in this movie. AGA IS IT !!! It's all about America, so don't be ashamed to watch it. Just think, if you can, to avoid more damage ... You know, you're just the same ordinary guy next to you, so be careful! One of the best critics of "common" mind and friendship. Still don't care? Go for the music - try it out, just close your eyes and Pat Metheny and David Bowie touch you so deeply that you start yelling! And if you look, if you dare to open your eyes, don't do a popcorn and things, you're pretty much away. You might think it's not worth it, but think twice - and don't look at your neighbor's lawn - you never know what to find there ... Is it worth it? Try it! Just don't push or fuck ...
