The birth of E. Elias Merhige is a peculiar, surrealistic concept of dealing with the religion of humanity. There are a few different ways to interpret things, but the plot itself is simple: God destroys herself and her mother's earth from her generations. Then the Earth lowers the body of God and then absorbs itself with the remains of its seeds. After that, he gives birth to a messiah figure that descends, probably in infancy, but perhaps with terror, to live on earth. All this takes place within the first 15-30 minutes and after that the rest of the film consists of robbed figures that drag the messiah (who is constantly shaking or grabbing) over the desert landscape. The robbed numbers stop just to make the Messiah brutal, then continue to drag it. <br /> <br /> It can be interpreted in a couple of ways, depending on your level of optimism and worldview. It can be readily interpreted as the nihist Nazi atheistic allegory of the complete absence of the invisible force that Christian deities can hold in a modern society based solely on their names to promote their selfish goals. Or can you interpret it as a postmodern Christian pro-Christian allegory, where you look at the film as humanity has turned the message of Christ so much that its original purity and innocence can no longer be relevant in a world where this message and image are inappropriately used for everything characterized by interpersonal violence, war, totalitarianism. <br /> <br /> The visuals of this movie are phenomenal and you don't see anything like this, period. If you can, check out the original release of VHS, I recommend it. I'm not sure if the DVDs have changed the visuals, but I've seen your streaming clips on the client and the impact is greatly reduced. The VHS version achieved Merhige TINAL BINARY CONTRAST. Meaning, basically, there is no average tone except for some grains in some shots. In addition, this film offers a rare opportunity to see PURE white and PURE black and the result is stunning, hallucinatory, and quite distracting. This film makes Film Noir positive and mediocre. The shots scatter each other in a surreal way, reminiscent of Un Chien Andalou, without being completely apoptosis, for the effect called the filmy Rorschach test. <br /> <br /> With this in mind, the film can definitely try the patience and dedication of the viewer. There is no dialogue for beginners. The only sound of the whole movie is a rather continuous cricket ring, which has occasionally died of gurgling and death of goddesses, and an amelodic droneing synthesizer texture. Personally, I think the film is best for listening to experimental industrial music, such as instrumental NIN remixes from Downward Spiral, more abstract noise / experimental music such as F * ck Buttons and Odd Nosdam. It also works well for apocalyptic black metal. Basically, all music has extreme textures and / or hypnotic rhythms. This is one of the most amazing and versatile aspects of this film, for the postmodernist contextualization of PRIME, such as its display during the performance of avant-garde music, or the creation of accompanying avant-garde music. <br /> <br /> When the Messiah is born, there are not many changes to the rest of the film, which means you are basically at least 45 minutes or longer when the messiah is around the desert and beaten. It looks beautiful, but nothing new. It helps to cement filmmakers' intentions of communicating that for thousands of years people have used Christ's name and image as personal benefits, but can be tiring for a casual viewer or someone with short attention. Basically, if you are looking for a modern horror film, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a unique movie experience and you are not particularly fond of the Hollywood cinema, it may be your trembling messiah.
