Thank God for the internet movie database !!! When I first got this movie, I watched it every night before going to bed and I got something else every time. But no matter how I sliced ​​it, it became annoying. Black and white and all the jerks pulled me very much. You look at the screen that you do not know what you are looking at, and just when you think it is, it turns out and it is something completely different. The picture is very disturbing, jerky and straight razor doesn't sit with me in any movie. Still, when I looked at it, I interpreted it somewhat differently (no dialogue, you know), so I decided to check the IMdB for the plot summary. The boy who throws me a loop I had no idea it should be God. Now look at it with this in mind and see what happens.
