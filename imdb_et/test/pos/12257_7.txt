A good drama / comedy with two good performances from Hunter & Hurt, but Albert Brooks steals every scene he has. In the case of a large script, this film is a leap and gives everyone the opportunity to show their ability to act. And even though Joan Cusack isn't so much, but he has a more fun scene in the movie. The highlight of the film for me was Albert Brooks's speech in the hell. Only one pull is that it gets a little slow in places. And I was only interested in the role of Brooks, not so much Hunter or Hurt's. I'll give it to 7 out of ten.
