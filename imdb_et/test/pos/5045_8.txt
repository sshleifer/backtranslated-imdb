"Autumn Run" speaks of a messenger, an onion, 78 (about) year old Czech man malfunctioning who unhappily hit and rebelliously all who know him awfully while his wife is planning his funeral carefully. Hana's Center (Brodsk√Ω) shows us how to get babes to kiss you when your 78 and how to get to the police and get thank you for getting it warm and glowing on the day-to-day roads of a man's creative, amusing but socially unacceptable way enjoy life by refusing the old people's home. "Autumn Spring" is a perfect, exquisite comedy that contains messages of all ages that are most appealing to mature foreign film companies. (B +)
