It's amazing, absurd, short. A white-colored mill makes us a windmill on the burning terrain. Although the image has been paralyzed, there is obvious logic here. But he stops wiping, everything is black because of his work. They are going to bombard each other for no special reason - is an innocent grinder in a solva chip? Is this class a war? Whatever he digs with his opponent's fruit bags that run in the whole fight, losing everything he did before fighting, making the windmill superfluous, so that everything becomes as meaningless as the fight. Miller's grain illuminates the dirt of sweeping - later the West would not be so fine that the heroes and villains are color-coded. Is there a racial tone here? <br /> <br /> If it wasn't beautiful enough, the fighters will be destroyed from the crowd of people who did not come anywhere, suitably Kafkaesque, ending a strange story (or are they just a social conscience fighting a fight that denies the queue and the goal?), and very unusual during early silent cinema. This comedy, surrealism and absurd mixture is the obvious predecessor of BUster Keaton, while the windmill reminds us of one of the great thrillers, the Hitchcock foreign correspondent.
