This is one of the fun movies. And for you who can't, it should be funny. So often, comedies try to be so deliberately funny that they can't, but here is finally a movie that can be more fun in the finest ways. Even "spoofs" lack the originality and natural sense of this film. This is a comic classic, which will certainly be appreciated at some other time when studios have fixed such a thing regularly. Defenders for the Performers, and Funny Fine Actors, including Isaac Wade, whose performances are top notch. Indeed, a true undervalued stage actor is a real outflow star. It's nice to see this guy get him.
