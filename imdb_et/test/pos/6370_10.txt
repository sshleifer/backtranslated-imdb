Michael Ritchie "The Couch Trip" is a wonderfully anarchic comedy about what makes a good psychiatrist. It is so subtle and angry that you begin to understand what a real satire is. This is also the best film by Dan Akyroyd, made especially during the great film year (1988). First, "The Great Outdoors" and now it's. <br /> <br /> Akyroyd stars like John Burns, a quarry who fools the madness to escape from prison. Now it would be a foolish comedy. But "The Couch Trip" uses it all other than a stepping-stone. Beverly Hills psychiatrist George Maitlin (Charles Grodin, delicately entertained here) has nerve damage and selected: Lawrence Baird, who happens to be Akyroyd's psychiatrist! You can pretty much guess what will happen, but the big thing about The Couch Trip is not what happens, but how it is done. <br /> <br /> "The Couch Trip" gives Dan Akyroyd the best role he has ever had. His John Burns is one of the truly original comic books in film history. One of the fucking liners and physical humor is part of it, but it makes it special that Akyroyd makes a pleasant character for Burns. We root him and we grow very much during the 98-minute drive. <br /> <br /> But Akyroyd is not alone here. He gets strong support from other big comic artists. Walter Matthau joins fun as the Artist's Minister, who tries to burn Burns' secret and gently wring. Charles Grodin "slow burns" his way to another great comic role as a burned psychiatrist. Grodin has been one of Hollywood's most underrated participants. It's a criminal that they haven't used more often. Richard Romanus plays perfect with Grodin's thin lawyer. <br /> <br /> "The Couch Trip" is one of the many films made by the now missing Orion Pictures Corporation, which is now invisible. MGM spent a fortune on buying an Orion library, but has not yet acquired his money. "The Couch Trip" combines "Dressed to Kill", "Blow Out" and countless other dusts with rotting. Shame MGM for their inaction. Hopefully, with the new leadership, "The Couch Trip" will find the audience and respect it deserves. <br /> <br /> **** from the four stars
