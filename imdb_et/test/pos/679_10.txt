When Ida Lupino appeared or directed the film in the 30s, 40s and 50s, you were guaranteed great entertainment even when the picture was black and white. The East was able to capture the audience and keep them in the end of their pictures. In this movie, Mrs Helen Gordon, "High Sierra", 41 with Robert Ryan (Howard Wilton), "Golden Gloves" 40, will keep you away from how the relationship changes and how poor Mrs Gordon can be a normal and happy marriage with love and true affection . If you liked East Lupino, who could play a criminal role in a woman's jail and a prisoner who was hated, this is the movie you can enjoy. I really believe that East Lupine was not given the real credit she deserved for her great talent films !!!
