I didn't expect much of this movie, it was just one of those movies I thought I was just watching because it was on television. I definitely appreciate this movie. It's about a boy who kills his girlfriend and a lady to his friends. I was very pleased with the actors, they had the characters well. This was a particularly big scene when Feck (Dennis Hopper) and John (Daniel Roebuck) talked to each other about why John was killing Jamie. It's annoying to hear how he explains that he wants to feel control and why. But Feck loved her a killed girl. Feck regretted when John felt something, he was proud of what he did in hell. It really thinks of people. Keanu Reeves did a great job, like Matt, and Ione Skye was good. It's strange to see her valedictorian "Say Anything" and her as Clarissa. Every actor did ...... It was great for change. It was a great movie and I would definitely say that I recommend it.
