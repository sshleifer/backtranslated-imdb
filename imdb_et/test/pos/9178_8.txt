It was a romantic, simple funny movie. I really enjoyed it and would definitely say that to watch and enjoy, Will Smith was a funny, clumsy, nervous, sweet and just a simple man whom Love hit. It was lovely to see him fall on someone and be so nervous and lost what to do or say. It was great. He was nice, funny as usual. Eva Mendes was better than I thought she was, I thought there were moments in the movie where Will got a shaft, she did everything she could be a good boy and still bad. The end was romantic and happy and it was great. I've seen it several times and I look at it again. Funny movie, something you no longer see. It had an old time with a fresh new look.
