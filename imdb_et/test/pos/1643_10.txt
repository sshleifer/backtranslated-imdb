Wow! It's hard to know your words for this episode. Ice is definitely one of the best season episodes. This is my season's favorite. Six people and a dog in a claustrophobic structure, separated by an unknown organism in the middle of the Arctic, causing murder aggression, cannot make the drama better. Paranoia reigns supremely as Mulder and Scully doubt each other's peace of mind. I've heard people complain about the similarity of this episode after The Thing. I haven't seen it so I don't know. Ice is more than worth seeing to see Mulder and Scully, who are truly experimenting with each other's evolving trust. This episode is intense and stopping to the end. You don't have to be disappointed!
