Bergman and comedy don't match. Some of his comedies are so nervous that you almost win. This film has a strange naive moment - the last 30 seconds are the lowest, but in general it is a charming (not funny) piece that is enjoyable all the time. Bergman throws many of his usual suspects well. David, Marianne and the unpleasant salesman have a big train on the train, which remains in the memory. Some matrimonial materials are typical, cynical Bergman, but it is in Bergman's light, not in the dark. <br /> <br /> This movie has moments and is worth 90 minutes. Not one of his classics and not the place to start if you want to fall under Bergman.
