Although some unrealistic things happen at the end (i.e., a policeman who lets a gun out of a crowd that can kill some innocent), it was still an intense, enjoyable thriller, one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films. Robert Walker is great, like a cooling nut, really convincing, giving an exciting result that is sometimes too horrible. His co-star here, Farley Granger, is okay, but it doesn't suit Walker, either acting or the characters they play. This is a typical Hitchcock movie with some strange corners of the camera, immoral themes, innocent man in trouble, and so on. Unlike many other films, I thought it was a fast-changing story with very few dull spots. Being a former tennis player, I enjoyed his great old online games that contained good contests. Hitchcock's real daughter Patricia has an interesting and unique role of a lesser character. He just didn't get a job because of his father; he can act. Note that the DVD has both British and American versions and the story was different. This is a classic film, still called in today's movies, even in comedies such as "Throw the mother off the train".
