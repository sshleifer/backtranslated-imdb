Clifton Webb as "Mr. Scoutmaster" is one of the comedy's one-time awards and the innocence is now in the world. I do not understand why networks such as American Movie Classics and such films do not show this film, although I have demanded it again and again. <br /> <br /> This film must show the children loyalty, respect and dedication and determination to achieve the best possible individual. In the current daily life, so low self-esteem is spoken, but among many many others, this film is a great learning tool for today's younger generation to see what can be achieved with common sense and dignity. pride yourself and your achievements to improve yourself. It's sad that this type of movie doesn't support modern audiences. Surely it called us a "baby boom" yesterday. The old lessons are UNIVERSAL AND TIMELESS.
