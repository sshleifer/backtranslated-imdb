Hi, I'm john and I would like to tell you that my dog ​​was on this screen in the feed screen when he was like a trench that was going to bite a man chained up. my dogs name was Colin and he was filming for this movie for a week. he was also in other things like the crime scene and some other small parts. he won some shows but he is now dead, I miss him, he was a great, real and loyal dog and we had big times together, but he got cancer that couldn't be treated so I had to put him. The worst day of my life I hope it will give you something to look for in a movie when you watch it again. <br /> <br /> Thank you all
