This movie appears quite often on premium cable TV channels and I find it look over and over again. The performances are wonderful and the material is so much that there is always something new to remove from the movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm too confused about watching movies at home, you know the exercise, the dogs bark, the phone rings, the popcorn ends with the credit. But this film talks about people and what motivates us, aggravates us, causing divergences between us and inspiring us. <br /> <br /> For me, these films are like the Letter of Love, which keeps me on new movies, if possible. Frankly, I am surprised that the film is not better known. I would like to see Blythe Danner and Geraldine McEwan in many other roles. They are happy to see. Kate Capshaw is great and I had no previous idea to be. Ellen DeGeneres plays a role that is much more complicated than just comic relief. <br /> <br /> This movie offers interesting visions as characters and their interactions. I find it refreshing every time I watch this time.
