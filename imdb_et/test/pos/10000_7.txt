The actor turned to director Bill Paxton, who follows his promising debut - Gothic horror "Frailty" - with this friendly sports club about the US Open 1913, where a young American caddy rises from his modest background to play against his Bristish idol copied as " The biggest game ever played. " I'm not a golf fan, and these nervous undersized sports slippers are about a dozen dots (the most recent "Miracle" and "Cinderella Man"), but some about how this movie was astonished. <Br /> <br /> The film starts with some creative opening credits (imagine HBO's Carnivale and the Disneyfied version of the opening animation with Rome animation), but lumbers slowly for the first hour. When the action moves to the US, things open very well. Paxton does a nice job and knows how to make the director's flourishes (I loved the rainy day of the second day of opening), which promotes the plot or adds unexpected psychological depth to the process. There are some compelling character developments when the British Harry Vardon worships the images of the black suits aristocrats and the top hats who destroyed their family house as a child to make a golf course. He also does a good job visually, describing what is happening in the heads of the players under pressure. Sensationally boring sports Golf is alive alive. The credit card should also be given to a department of designers and costumes that will create an inclusive atmosphere in London and Boston at the beginning of the 20th century. <br /> <br /> You know how it ends not only because it is based on a real story, but also because movies in this genre are increasingly following the same template, but Paxton puts on a better-than-average show and maybe shows the camera more talent than it used to be. Despite its formal nature, it is a nice and simple film for which it deserves to be found.
