I took this movie absolutely as a child and still as an adult. Say it is even underestimated. My sister, brother, and I looked at it for a year at our grandparents' house during a Christmas holiday. They had recorded it on TV. Our parents were happy that they kept us busy for one night, but they thought we'd be tired and ready for the next day. Not so! We became mad. They couldn't try us when they tried. It became a precious annual tradition. We loved it all: time, romance, battle scenes, crooks, etc. Come now, who can confront Bent with this psychologist with his constant SIR! Classic! What's more, who can persecute resistance when Justin falls off the balcony? What a victorious moment! I always had a special place in the heart for Orry and Madelaine. They were so romantic. The theme song alone can make me a little tear. This movie is incredibly touching and I'll call anyone until it finishes. It's worth it!!
