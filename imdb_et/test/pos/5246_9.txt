John Wayne's first starring just played me. The AMC has a style of television mailbox, I had to check and make sure I had the right date. Certainly, this 1930s film was produced with a 55mm wide screen. In addition, it contains some of the most nasty and realistic materials from the West that I've seen. The wagons, the men and the animals are indeed lowered with a rope. Trees are cut by broken men - and rubbing women - so the train can move another 10 feet. Indians are not "beautiful boy" city sliders who later depicted them; they are the real thing. The river overcoming the storm of rain is so realistic that it must be real (Actually, I understand that director Raoul Walsh lost cast almost all this time). I can smell the damp canvas. Every day is torment. The different sub-lines are forgotten, but the film is not whole. I can't think of another title that can win the Big Trail to create a biography for Oregon. Bravo.
