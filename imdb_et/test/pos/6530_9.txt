This is really a lovely movie. I had a huge insomnia (girls 10-11) and they loved this movie. They looked at it twice! Don't let the rating fool you. You must be at least 13 years old to rate an IMDb movie that removes the movie from the target audience. If you have a girl (or boy) between 7 and 13, I guarantee they will enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Sorting the "Notting Hill" Gender at High School. Aaron Carter plays a famous pop star who is unable to teach privately. Her mother sends her a "normal" high school with an ultimatum, "going through high school or not doing the summer." With the advice of his leader (former pop star David Cassidy), he communicates with the school's smartest girl (Alana Austin) who is going to deceive her. Look for humorous and understandable Janitor (second former pop star Lief Garrett).
