I'm a fan of Jeff Bridges, so I stopped it on the DVD without seeing it before. I also immediately became a fan of Kevin Spacey. <br /> <br /> The general "foreign human body" is, in my experience, dead, but I liked the approach used in K-PAX that hit me quite differently and more sensitively than most. Bridges make a great doctor (you want to tell him what you think) and Spacey's expressions and gestures are perfect in this role. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Prot and fully human sciences in the clinic is amazing, especially the subtle manipulation of their behavior. <br /> <br /> The end is bittersweet - I like Proti's choice, but the last scenes (bridges) made me tear.
