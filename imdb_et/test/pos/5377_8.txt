I would probably say that it was similar to movies like "Fucking Rain" and such a movie, although it's probably a little better. I love the 70s horror and most of the elements that make up other movies that I like, so it was pretty easy to enjoy. A family during a vacation stumbles through a small town where people seem to be hacked. The kids seem to have disappeared. After the first attempt to escape this place, the family has somehow stopped by the city and found their way back, but did not first find a house where the children have disappeared and the mother and father are dead. We seem to have a different twist in the center of older communities in this city, they are all worshipers of Satan and they need children to renew their lives so they can continue in their service. Not that someone seems too eager to give up their children for this company. It is quite stylish, as it is scary and horrible without buckets of buckets or loud amazing events that are trying to jump into movies today that seem to have replaced the real fears. We have Hank Kimball (Alvy Moore) "Green Acres" like Tobey, a sheriff deputy who reads UFO magazines, and LQ Jones as a sheriff and a very familiar character actor as a stranded family father. And Strother Martin plays a doctor who seems to have made a double commitment to his fellow countrymen. It's a pretty good thing, but sometimes it's a confusing side, but generally it works pretty well and is recommended for fans of the 70's. 8 out of 10.
