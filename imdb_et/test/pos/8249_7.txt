When a qualified electrician, Pinky, is released from prison, her password officer has found her a job working in a metropolitan bank. If some criminals learn from their past, they will use it and rob the bank. Pinky is frightened first, because he really wants to go straight, but when his fate twists, Pinky starts thinking that no one should give the horse a mouth. <br /> <br /> Also known as The Mayfair Bank Captain {among others!}, this is a very enjoyable piece that has been important since the 1970s. London and all this very suspicious fashion are illuminated like a Christmas tree at Ralph Thomas and Guy Elmesi in a cunning cabinet. If the viewer can accept David Niven as an offender of a few ages, then I cannot just tell you, then at Berkeley Square, you may be surprised at night. The actors will definitely not draw any wood, but it hasn't really hurt at all, it's a fair fun quality that is never less than fun. The result and the soundtrack are obviously guilty of dramatic criminal moments, but this is a small complaint to leave me thinking that this is a British pearl. <br /> <br /> Richard Jordan takes Pinky's lead. apparently in the hope of attracting American viewers}, the 70s heart threatens Oliver Tobias {mass hair} is there to keep women interesting, while the knees get a pleasant eye for Elke Sommer and his delightful legs. a decent enough clip and contains a serious finale, Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square deserves much better than the 5.7 rating for IMDb, but how many people have marveled at it ?, hmm, go on if you get the chance
