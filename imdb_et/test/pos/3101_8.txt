I and Pa Kettle's future adventures are gathering almost smoothly where the egg and I left behind. A new writing team and director will be introduced to Kettles' first solo adventure. Leonard Goldstein, accompanied by The Egg and I, was a producer of further adventures by Ma and Pa Kettle. With many characters played by the same actors and actors, MacDonalds and Kettles focus very well. I am referring to beating Birdie Hicks for the first prize for his palm, which is the import scene in The Egg and I. The competition prize money had to be used to send Tom Kettle to college. In this movie, Tom goes home to graduate. <br /> <br /> This film has two embedded plots. One of them is the comedy of a simple mountain family moving to a modern modern house. The second is a mild moral game about how the environment affects children as they grow up. <br /> <br /> Pa Kettle (Percy Kilbride) wanted a free tobacco bag to enter the competition and finally won the house. His disappointment about getting free tobacco bags is a bit of a laugh. When Pa plays with a dynamite, he is completely alert to the explosion. The splinters have never shaken the scene because the cracks in the explosion fell around him. He played this part perfectly. In his autobiography, Jack Benny noted how impressed he was with Percy Kilbride's canal. Kilbride took this comedy device to a high degree of perfection. <br /> <br /> Ma (Marjorie Main) and Pa moved into a new house with modern comforts that interfere with Ma and Pa almost as much as they help. I adapt much faster than Pa. Modern comforts include a television, a very new household item in 1949. Moving walls, hidden beds, and plumbing accessories are props for the comic, but attention is paid to Ma and Pa, never as props. <br /> <br /> Tom Kettle (Richard Long) meets journalist Kim Parker (Meg Randall) who feels hygiene and the environment are important for children to succeed in adults. Tom is a bright, self-esteemed person who contradicts the theory that success can only come in an ancient environment. This topic is briefly discussed in some scenes but is left below. It was also the only serious debate in this otherwise puzzled movie. <br /> <br /> Seeing that the kettles moved out of their old house to move into a new house, it would be almost a disaster if it were not characters that would remain true. I was practical, just as he had been in the egg and I. Pa was the water that was the best comedy. She had never felt at home in the new house, but the actual location of the comfortable bed would never have worried her.
