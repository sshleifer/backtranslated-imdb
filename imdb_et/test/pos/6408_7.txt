Compared to this, Tarkovsky is speedless. <br /> <br /> Bela Tarr compared to this is MTV. <br /> <br /> This is a "Russian Ark" roller skater. I've just described 3 sllllowwwwwesssstttt experiences I've ever known, and this one is the best. But that doesn't mean it's bad. On the contrary, I really liked it. But it was a chore. <br /> <br /> I don't describe a plot because it can be easily found elsewhere. Suffice it to say that the plot is INANE. This is one of the most creative and strange ideas from "John Malkovich". I believe that an interesting plot is the main reason I had to retreat (humor was nice too. This is something we rarely see in slow, artistic films). norm Most films have little plot and little material; but they spend 90 minutes with many outstanding pictures to keep us attractive. But "Hole" is a 100% plot / subject without much eye-pleasing. In this respect, I think it is a truly intellectual experience, like reading a painfully verbose novel like Thackaray's 'Vanity Fair' (which I've never been able to!). <br /> <br /> If you are enormously attentive, I think you like this movie. Despite its molarity, it is very creative and imaginative. It's like Jean-Pierre Jeunet's quaaludes and drab, dusty camera lens. Good luck.
