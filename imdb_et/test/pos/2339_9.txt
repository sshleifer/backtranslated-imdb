All creative filmmakers should watch this movie - it's like a master class in making digital movies per se. Some scenes look like they are made from much higher production values ​​than what they actually were. It is very encouraging that such well-designed work can be done with a small budget. The actors are very good and the characters are very interesting, especially the leading boy (John Kielty), who manages to play with a teenager who has difficulty, staying really pleasant. Her beautiful, but fading mother was also very well depicted and her and her boss relationship was very intriguing. This is a very original, interesting piece and I'm looking for something else that the same team does. The director is definitely one.
