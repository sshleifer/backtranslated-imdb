Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius. And this movie is good! Although the movie does not reach almost the quality of the TV show, it is still very funny and has some serious problems! I liked Ali G for the first time in the exhibition. I think he is one of the best comedy characters all the time .. saying that: Peter Dragon ("Action") and Blues Brothers. The biggest surprise with this film was that they actually have serious actors (Dance and Gambon). After that, I will respect them even more, because I have a good opportunity to use this opportunity. I'm not very bad about this movie, it's very funny. Very minor, but hey, what? One more thing to mr. G: SEQUEL, PLEASE! <br /> <br /> **** / *****
