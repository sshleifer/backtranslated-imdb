"you can't take it realistically." Zombie Bloodbath 2 (ZB2) is a world of its own. I've never seen anything like that before. The only thing I think is to compare it with a psychedelic drug. Excuse the clich√©? I just don't mean it is inconsistent and absurd, though from time to time it is. I mean, it will take you through so many intense experiences and unexpected emotions so quickly that you will be killed, and when it's over, you will find that all happened on the couch. <br /> <br /> It is worth noting that this is an extremely low budget, disclaimer for those who, after the dead "Shaun of the Dead", see ourselves as fans of underground zombie films. It is also remarkable that it is much more brutal than you expect. The kids can grab it and somebody is bothering the teenage girl before hitting him in the groin. His body is "raped". These are certainly no drawbacks and I feel it is a movie for credit. But if it doesn't look like your movie, don't waste your time. <br /> <br /> (I do not want to encourage this, with brutality. Inside or something. "I hesitated to give up some land because it is really surprising. Even an open scene with nothing to do with zombies is Classic horror scene and something quite original. <br /> <br /> Man, I'm three paragraphs and I haven't said anything at all. Here's why I thought the movie was fantastic: 1. It's big and it's At one point, you expect it to become the second NotLD clone, a window window where everyone will stay on the farm and argue with each other. At the end of the movie, the farmhouse scenes seem like a distant dream. . <br /> <br /> 2. Makeup / gore is much better than ZB1, more convincing and creative, something funny: early zombies really look flat, then, halfway through, they suddenly expect very good, dentures and everything. n attentive look like Fulci zombies, some reminiscent of Sir language "dead day." And it has big scenes around dozens of zombies. Never Aging. <br /> <br /> 3. There's something strange. One character confirms that heaven exists and that our dead / undead protagonists are now in heaven. In the film context, we believe it is true. Though the characters behave with the stupidity of a typical horror film, they seem to care for one another and I found myself caring for them. <br /> <br /> 4. Stimulation is great. Hardly a dull moment. <br /> <br /> My only observation that limits criticism is that Todd Sheets appears with the most bizarre dialogue I've ever heard. Personally, I feel that it adds to the experience, but I don't think he's going to do it, so I can't give the movie right. (Example: if a car breaks, the owner screams at the passengers. Then he says something as a result: "I'm sorry, I shouted at your guys. You don't know what a straight razor is when your father is five years old." At the end, it's more than I can. It comes with Bill Clinton editing and some preaching final credits explaining the zombie metaphor. Indeed, I was here to live my drug experience firmly. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. 7/10
