This is what James Cagney is all about, wisecracks, cockiness, hard like nails and nonsense charisma. <br /> <br /> Although the plot sounds serious, the movie is something. It is made in the style of a 30's screw comedy and works well with its "beating" with fool Mae Clark and his reaction to the high stories of his colleague James Burke. <br /> <br /> What makes it more common is dialogue and what it does. Dialogue is good, but it is nothing, unless delivery is on-site, and it may collide with relevant characters. That's all right for everyone. <br /> <br /> Good entertainment and enjoyable.
