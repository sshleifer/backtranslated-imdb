Tex Avery MGM's director of cartoons was in the 1940s and 50s was one of the brightest moments in the history of comics. His cartoons were exceptionally resourceful and surreal, with many strange touches later celebrated in THE MASK. The trademarks of these films were boys who see a girl, impossible tricks and non-stop activities. <br /> <br /> This is one of the many Droopy cartoons for which Avery was responsible and his best. Droopy is Mountie and she has decided to get her husband ... though this is the wolf who has escaped from prison. Throughout the movie, despite many crazy stunts, Droopy keeps it cramped until the wolf gives up, because Droopy is seemingly everywhere! It's a funny joke full of fun, it's a great comic.
