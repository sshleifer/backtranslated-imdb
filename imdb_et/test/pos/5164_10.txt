The latest film by You, the Living by Swedish filmmaker Roy Andersson is not easy to see. One reason is that he has, in his own words, violated the Anglo-Saxon tradition of telling the story, which is essentially the productions of most Western films. Another reason may be that although Roy Andersson is somewhat more complicated with the symbols, he, unlike Andrei Tarkovsky, is more difficult. It took 3 years to complete this 86-minute movie, and it wasn't because he was forced to spend a long break between shooting with financial concerns or problems. The film consists of 57 vignettes, which are mostly captured with a camera, and it was a careful design of every scene that took a lot of time. The image of this film, closely related to the director's previous film "The Songs of the Second Floor", is extremely important for this story, so this story largely speaks of the surroundings and the environment in which Andersson universe characters live and interact. Before each scene was finalized, there would have been at least ten different testing competitions with different actors, colors, dialogue, etc. The result is a dreamy version of the surrounding world that most of us would feel and if the device is like a dream, why not dream a little? Like the discrete charm of Bunueli The Burzsois, when someone says, "I had a dream last night," you can watch it. But then again, what is perceived here as reality does not differ from dreams. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the film lacks the concept of a conventional word and the main character is missing, the different scenes that appear and appear again in different scenes still meet and their stories are inevitably intertwined. What most of these characters have in common is their obvious loneliness despite being surrounded by other people. Smoking a trailer trash and drinking a woman dreaming that she has a motorcycle so she can get away with all this mess, her bodily and mostly quiet boy and her weak and seemingly gentle but rather inadequate spiritual mother. a copper band whose skills at home do not receive a favorable reception from their families and neighbors, from a depressed Middle East hairdresser, and from his arrogant client on a "very important business meeting", an elderly man with a nightmare about bombers in the sky, a young girl dreaming of marrying a young rock star that he is so crazy about love. All this is related to the reality of dreams and nightmares, but it works as much as the assertion of the Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein that "all human communication is misuse". People talk to each other, but as they talk about each other. They try to reach out to others, but close others when they try. <br /> <br /> You, Life, is a poetic film that is physically set in Stockholm, but is generally applicable. The society it depicts is Sweden, its artistic language and the people displayed are unmistakably Nordic. But the topic he deals with, namely the misery of mankind in a selfish world, goes beyond this hemisphere. Despite the seriousness of his subject, the film itself seems much more joyful and loaded with humor than could have been expected. But, according to the director himself, "living everyone is so difficult that the only thing that saves us is our sense of humor". So this film is a tragic comedy or comic tragedy, depending on your sensitivity, not a depressing black-reality journey of human nature. It is unusual in language and structure, but if you don't think out of the box and enjoy it, you will definitely find this movie both entertaining and meaningful. This year's Cannes Festival was shown as part of the UN Certain Regard program, which offers "original and diverse works" outside the competition. After showing the movie to Salle Debussy's, a 1000-strong audience gave a few minutes of play. Do I have to say more?
