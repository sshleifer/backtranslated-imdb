I've seen the 1973 movie Lost Horizons and read a lot of comments on this movie. I agree that there were many opportunities for development, but unlike everyone looking for the perfect movie with perfect songs and the best example, I was looking for something different and this film gave me that. I looked at this film not as a critic, but as a person who was looking for a little bit of hope, a little bit of joy, a bit of freedom from my daily life, and that I got. You may be critical of singing and dialogue, but that's not what I'm watching when I go to the movie. I'm looking for a bit of freedom in my daily life, a little time I can sit and imagine a better life where people love you and help you. We are ashamed of not being able to enjoy the movie about what he is telling us, and refusing to remove it, like an English teacher reading a fifth grade essay. It can be very simple, but really, it wouldn't be nice.
