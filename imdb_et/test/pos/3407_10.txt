A story of love and hatred, tragedy and happiness, and above all of the friendship set in a very interesting time for the American Civil War. <br /> <br /> You are interested in history, you will be emotionally involved, and will make you wait for the next episode of fever. <br /> <br /> Besides, casting was great. Many superstars appear in short shows, leading roles play a large number of talented moms - Kirstie Alley and Terri Garber should be mentioned here - this is just a great example of television production because it should be. <br /> <br /> Don't forget the respect of Wendy Kilbourne's Constance :-)
