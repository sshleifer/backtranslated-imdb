If you need this quick buzz that only in the late 60s / early 70s Euro sex can release movies, then look that you are not just a mother created over stumbled! The following TV director Schivazappa's practice in psychedelic porn (a variety of soft core) may not generally be considered a classic, but it captures much more prominent headlines in a loop similar to Tinto Brass, Jess Franco and Joe D'Amato. Radley Metzger was sure he was somebody else before he took this beautifully twisted small number to distribute his company through Audubon. Gorgeous cinematography (favoring symmetrical compositions) can cause fear of "pretentiousness" from those who swear by bad skin colors captured in someone's backyard. Hey, as far as I'm concerned, it's because of their loss, because it's one exciting ride with the film's twist, well, twisted, you may not even believe them after you've seen them on the screen! Dagmar Lassander (who is immortalized by Lucio Fulci HOUSE by CEMETERY) has never seen more prominence than he does here, depicting delicately innocent (?) Hostages of the hostile (all artistic) hostage of Philippe Leroy, you don't know if he has a good sense of humor to mention it in his cv) because their original violent relationship becomes a beloved story of S&M. Nothing is what seems to be a sick and imaginative pearl of the film that has several truly erotic moments that have been achieved with surprisingly minimal nudity. Because one was completely puzzled and fascinated by how Schivazappa decided to recommend oral sex during one scene (I'll let you do that ...) and Lassander's gauze-clipped boogie with the 60's voice should have become an icon like Sylvia Kristel's picture has her EMMANUELLE days in this wicker chair. You may not know this movie yet, but trust me if you've ever seen it!
