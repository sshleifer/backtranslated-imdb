I loved this movie, it was cute and funny! Lauren Holly was great, she's funny and very credible in her role. Costas Mandylan was also very good, nice to watch !! Brenda Vaccaro, as usual, was delighted to see, she did a great job of its nature. It was a pleasure to watch a movie that is funny, interesting and can be watched by the whole family. It's still hard to find nice healthy movies. Thanks for Hallmark movies, they are wonderful! I wish I could buy it if someone knows where I can buy this movie, please let me know! I have bought several Hallmark films and I am very pleased with them. I hope I can buy it!
