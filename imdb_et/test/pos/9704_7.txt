Like the first, the JACKASS team has been trying to kill itself in whatever way they see fit. Each one fits the tractor tire and rolls down the slope. Or I can deliberately smash. worse. <br /> <br /> The first one was crazy, and this is how to describe it. It was also a very difficult laughing film. But it is completely nuts. It is still dangerous tricks, and even harder to laugh. So, I guess that killing funny idiots will kill the most funny thing this week. <br /> <br /> So before BORAT comes out, I'm laughing at A **.
