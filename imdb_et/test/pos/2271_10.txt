If anyone has any doubts about Liev Schrieber's talents, just look at his new movie "Everything Is Enlightened", which clearly shows a man who is not only one of America's best actors, but also a new leader whose first effort is indeed an inspiration and revenge on it what to follow. Mr. Schreiber has adapted Jonathan Safran Foer's novel to a film that lives forever as the director has adapted the material. The film clearly exceeded our expectations, because we had no prior ideas. <br /> <br /> For those who haven't watched the movie, you should stop here. <br /> <br /> Jonathan is a collector. His love for grandparents is unlimited. He looks at his grandfather dying and when his grandmother is in his death bed. At this point, this deadly woman gives Jonathan a picture and a yellow ornament. Looking at a photo taken long ago, a couple of young couples are seen together. Watching makes Jonathan think it shows grandfather and his girlfriend who have been taken for a happier time. Watching Shotshot seems to be the motivation of this intense young man to look for his ancestors' past in Ukraine. <br /> <br /> Jonathan has signed a trip to Heritage Tours, Odessa. Trochenbrod, the mythical place where his grandfather came. The agency is handled by an older man who claims to be blind, and his grandson Alex, a man who loves a pop American culture that has captured his imagination, as well as his contemporaries in the country. Alex speaks a kind of English, no one speaks and his conversation or translation, because the usefulness of Jonatan is good for our ears, sometimes using English without listening. The old man calls his dog Sammy Davis Jr. to accept Jonathan's desires not to travel and sit next to a thrilling animal. <br /> <br /> As they start looking for Trochenbrod, it's clear that his companions, especially the old man, have no idea where he goes. Here, the film becomes a road, because the three characters on the back are familiar with each other. When the trio reaches out to the sunshine with the house, it shows that they have really come to the right place. Some places are a clear reminder of past conflicts. An older woman living in an isolated place is the missing link in the story. He can put things in the right perspective. But here is where the story changes its emphasis on Jonathan, who has clearly come to the land of his ancestors, an old man. We look at this older man remembering things. This, in turn, changes the dynamics of the movie when we discover how Jonathan and his guides have always been. <br /> <br /> On these pages, some critics have expressed their opinion on the accuracy of the story, which, after all, is a fiction and freedom. It would have been impossible to make another movie that contained so much in the book. The way the movie is divided into different chapters is a smart way to let the viewer know what to see. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood, an excellent film actor, is doing a great job with Jonathan. Mr. Wood makes one of his best performances in any film by interpreting his main character. Eugene Hutzi, a Ukrainian tourist assistant and translator, seems to be an idea made in heaven. Hutz is the best thing in the movie. The use of his intelligent English provides the film with a funny corner that delights the viewer. Boris Leskin, as Alex's grandfather and driver of the excursion car, makes a valuable contribution both to the film seen in the last part of the film and to Larys Lauret. <br /> <br /> Matthew Libatique's brilliant cinematography brings the splendor of the Czech countryside to all its greatness. Paul Cantelon's musical score is heard in the background that the film is filmed in a way that adds to the richness of the film. <br /> <br /> It is especially the triumph of Liev Schreiber, the first director. be sure to go a long way in what it decides to do next.
