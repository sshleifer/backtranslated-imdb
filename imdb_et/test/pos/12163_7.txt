After they have been thrown out of their last job and found a low level of employment in the UK, the six members of Wonder Boys, better known as Crazy Gang, are seeing advertisements for working in the Red Gulch area of ​​the Golden Gulch area in Yukon. It's cutting the newspaper and on the back is a story of Chamberlain saying that the country is better prepared for war. Out they go to Yukon and frozen borders. By the way, this is a case of the Chamberlains. Cutting is forty years old and refers to Joe Chamberlain and Boer War as the current crisis for Neville. But it's typical how things go for this team. I see Stan Laurel making the same mistake. <br /> <br /> Of course, when they get there, it's just a spiritual city where only young Jean Kent and his grandfather Moore live. She's going for years and is a bit touched by the head. The Marriott has a gold mine that is somewhere misplaced to sleep, that is, when he dreams. Gang helps her find better that my or otherwise beautiful Mrs. Kent does not marry Anthony Hulme anchorman, but rather the owner of the cabin, Bernard Lee, which is worse than death. <br /> <br /> It was my first contact with Crazy Gang and I see why they were so recognized in the UK and why they never influenced the pond. The jokes come quickly and fiercely, and then there were a number of things that the US code simply didn't allow. The jokes are also strictly topical for the British, and much just didn't get here. <br /> <br /> The sightseeing tips are universal, the last chase is worth what Marx Brothers did in America. My suggestion is that if you look at frozen borders, record it if you have a job familiar with British history, and run it two or three times only to make sure everything is received. It's worth it.
