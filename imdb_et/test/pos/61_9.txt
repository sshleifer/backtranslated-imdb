The central part of Lackawanna Blues is the character Rachel "Nanny" Crosby, who leads the boarding house and offers a young boy, Ruben, film narrator, unflagging support. Based on the experiences of the writer-actor Ruben Santiago-Hudson, the film rejuvenates the New York City's interior nicely and invokes the climate of the 1960s transition culture. <br /> <br /> The first part of the movie is almost non-stop music. The other half is more fully engaged in full board with different letters. The ability of a nanny to "take fragments and heal them" affects all of his sphere. A particularly vivid scene is when she faces a malicious spouse, telling her firmly, "If you ever touch that baby, we'll dance!" According to actress S. Epatha Merkerson, this line is so sharp and full of a solution that the haired spouse is frozen on her tracks. <br /> <br /> From start to finish, Merkerson is leading the way. His character is linked by the different lives of the borders of his home. It was a wonderful, cordial film with great pain. As played by Merkerson, Nanny's character just gives love. It's a movie experience that I remember for a long time.
