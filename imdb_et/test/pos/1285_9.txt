I watched it on the DVD three times - as "normal", once in a row in a sequence (in this movie, a ripple, a story at the beginning, in the middle and at the end) and once with the director's comment. Quite amazing. The bare story that was said more about praise, energy, and matter than most of the overwhelmed features of the large budget that has been released today. I think it's a more feasible film than the later Memento, which made me first to Nolan. Can't wait to see what he's doing with a bigger budget (and bigger post offices) in his next film Insomnia.
