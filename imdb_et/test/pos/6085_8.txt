Anthony Minghella's 'English Patient' is a film that takes us back to the golden years of Hollywood. It is extensive and impressive, and yet the person is so heartbreaking in depicting love and suffering. In 1997, the Academy awards a film for overnight stays, with twelve nominees for nine awards, the most decisive clean from Bernardo Bertolucc's last emperor in 1988. Based on the novel by the author of the Canadian author Michael Ondaatje's 1992 Writer Award, "English Patient" is a meditation on life, love and loss, observing the critically burnt human history after the Second World War. <br /> <br /> During the war, the man (Ralph Fiennes) is discovered in the burning remains of a fallen aircraft. If his face was scared of unrecognized recognition and if the man seems to be under amnesia, he is assumed to be an allied soldier and is simply called an "English patient". After the war, in the mountains of the mines in Italy, a nice caretaker, Hana (Juliette Binoche), who has lost all her loved ones, will stay in the cozy monastery. Over time, he needs to learn more about his "English patient", who has actually appeared as a Hungarian geographer, Count Laszlo de Almásy. Instead of losing our memory during an air strike, we find out that this gracious man may have chosen to forget his past, so that he can protect himself from persecution and treat himself with the tragic memories of his past love. Through many setbacks, we learn about Almásy's former violations of the Sahara Desert and his romantic relationship with a married woman, Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas). <br /> <br /> It is certainly easy to understand why "English Patient" was so successful at Oscar, a beautiful film that mixes the quiet beauty of the Italian countryside with the endless golden sands of the desert. that David Lea's magnificent "Arab Lawrence" has a film that has such beauty and splendor in the desert, making great use of the air checks from the Almásy plane, even at the most intense moments of the movie, the great use of close-ups and illumination for the emotions of an exciting scene that are naturally connected to all <br /> <br /> The long-standing favorite of my favorite actor, "English Patient", may simply include Ralph Fiennes' best results, and since his history includes films such as "Schindler's List" and "Constant gardener", it's not Laszlo de Almásy, his count, is initially a very sympathetic character, but i will learn more about our past, its pleasant qualities have worsened with its less admirable trends towards others. "Ownership" is the main theme of the film. When Katherine asked what she hated the most, Almásy answered "Ownership. Owning. If you leave, you should forget me." However, as the relationship progresses and Katherine may be trying to pull her away, Almásy discovers a hint of arrogance, insisting that her love for her gives her the opportunity if she has: "I want to touch you. My own things belong to me." <br /> <br /> Juliette Binoche, who got the Oscar here, is great as Hana, a lonely sister who is afraid to love thanks to tragedies that have always been damaging her loved ones. After some time he was only looking after Almásy, he was suspected of being a Canadian thief, David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), who lost his thumbs during the war and suspects it was Almásy, who gave it to the Germans. Hana is also hit by an initial romantic relationship with Kip (Naveen Andrews), a British army Indian bombshell disperser. However, due to his earlier history, Hana fears that involving Kippi will cause him to die, especially given his very dangerous work area. <br /> <br /> The 160-minute 'English Patient' miraculously resembles the memories of the old old classical romantic epic to successfully find mystery, love, joy and tragedy. Ending the film is a heartache and sad, but also in its own way resurrecting. While some romantic relationships have been condemned since the beginning, others have a very good chance of bringing happiness. However, it is always better to be loved and lost than ever.
