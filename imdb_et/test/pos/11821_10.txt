I had seen Cure when I was a kid, and I loved it then. Now, years later, I was impressed by the copy almost randomly and looked at it again. As a child, you can't really get the things you want, it's usually your parents' privilege - but when I looked at it again, I felt sorry I didn't make more of that movie to get a copy, and so I almost forgot to date. <br /> <br /> This is really a beautiful movie. It speaks of an unlikely friendship between a hard-hit, misguided child who takes his clues from his terrible, abusive mother - and his neighbor - a little younger shopholder with AIDS. <br /> <br /> You say. One more of them. Teardrop jerker. Boss movie. Moral tail. Yes, I know I hate them too. It's not. This is one of the few films I have seen, which pulls out a very rare trick: it gives a really sad story (and yes, a moral story), but without a single moment when it feels cheese, forced or some other. otherwise "hollywoody". This shows the true relationship between the two REAL boys who interact with REAL children. And through this interaction, the good-natured, loving character of parents' boys, Eric, begins to emerge through his "tough-boy" personality, because he takes care of a big brother for Dexter, his HIV-positive younger neighbor. Together, they start an adventure to find a cure - which Erik seems to be just around the corner - so all this silly AIDS thing goes away and they can be friends forever. <br /> <br /> Production is the upper limit. But of course, this movie is actually performed by two conductors - Brad Renfro and Joseph Mazzello. Especially Mazzello, who is just stunning - he is delivering the weakness he needs for a vulnerable boy, but at the same time he has a truly energetic and decisive character on Dexter. He appears in the place where his sons Pony is standing: his impulse to protect his older friend strikes him, drives him to say what he says - and only after that the horror is depicted in his face as he realizes he is saying is true: his blood is poison ... Renfro also has his moments, especially scenes with his mother: he perfectly depicts how this macho, street-wise child is left completely frozen and numb when he comes into contact with his abusive mother, and doesn't get the word that he is against him because he forbids his relationship with a painful boy in fear and ignorance. Annabella Sciorra also gives Dexter's mother a memorable action, which, in some ways, is also a sign of Erik's mother. <br /> <br /> I first saw this movie back in school in America. and loved it - no such movie. But the behavior of this child in this film was so real I could easily associate with them. It is ironic that the teacher who showed us this movie (a wonderful woman, I am still familiar with her) got it in trouble, because some surprising parents complained that when two boys are watching Playboy ... Pathetic. Seriously, Americans get this ridiculous phobia, I don't know. The film was barely distinguishable by the playboy cover, which is why it is not shown in schools ... as sad. Children must watch this movie. It is more inspirational and educational than all "formal" post-school features. <br /> <br /> And one more thing. I know I hurry, but still ... Hit. That's great. I am a musician and I know Dave Grusin from his records: he is a well-known jazz musician and record producer. Until the end of this movie, he didn't know he'd made a film score, although when I later checked it, I discovered that I had been watching several movies with which he worked. Really, great work there. <br /> <br /> A total of ten. I recommend this movie to anyone. And I can see it with my younger siblings - they can use a movie as usual with the usual special effects hysteria they usually see.
