I looked back at "Path to Paradise" and stunned it, a dramatic license and everything. I lived for a few years in NYC (Brooklyn) and remembered. Today, considering the links to groups such as Al-Queda, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, I see it as warnings that our government does not recognize. To do this, I blame our bureaucracy and our leaders. 9.11.01 was a new tactic for two of our branches, and there is no excuse for our gov to prevent it, period. "Make a Paradise" was just a '93 preview of a dramatic view and no one cared. Now, almost 3,000 deaths later and years ago, we are trying to find a solution that can be resolved for decades.
