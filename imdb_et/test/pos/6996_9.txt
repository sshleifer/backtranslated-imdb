As a fan of Sci-fi movies, I also like Alien. But Pitch Black is definitely better than Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection. It sounds good to the alien series. But it's not a stranger, it's something else. OK, enough comparisons. This movie, I think, is why people are afraid of the blind. You can't get away from darkness. It is impossible. You have to be in the dark and in the dark. In this movie, I also liked the fact that Vin Diesel's character Richard B. Riddick was not a typical good boy. He had secrets and he has done bad things in the past. For other people, he is a hero who tries to save them all. First he wants to get out of this planet. There are other metaphors in this story. Every big sci-fi fan should see this picture.
