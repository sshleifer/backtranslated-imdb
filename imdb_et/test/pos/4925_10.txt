You don't have to be a fan of the comic exhibition to enjoy this movie. I watched it for the first time when I was nine years old, being a fan of the T.V show, and my parents laughed as hard as I did. This is done in classical style Bugs Bunny cartoons yesterday, and considering today's vulgar cartoons, I think someone would appreciate a multimedia film that relies more on "funny", then vulgar to get some laughs.
