As a fan of Dan Aykroydi, I watched this movie when it was recently shown on television at night. I didn't expect much, so it came as a big surprise that I loved it so much. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that Dan Aykroyd seems to love to do. The chance that he can "grab it" and not take things too seriously. If you love her in Blues Brothers or Ghostbusters, you know what I mean, and you would be wise to look at the Couch Trip. <br /> <br /> Avid Fans Aykroyd has fun with all the small links to other movies in his script! <br /> <br /> I can't describe this movie without damaging you, so all I can do is check it out. I can't boast about this movie, and it must be the time to release the DVD !!
