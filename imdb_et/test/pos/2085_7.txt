Zachary Scott does what he does best, i.e. playing a worm in "Danger Signal", a 1945 B-movie, where Faye Emerson, Mona Freeman and Rosemary DeCamp also play. Scott plays a writer who kills women after receiving money. Laminas of his last murder leased the house of the Fenchurch family, Hilda (Emerson) and his mother (Mary Servoss). Scott throws himself at Emerson and he's blinded. Central romance, her younger sister Anne (Freeman) comes from the doctor. When he mentions that he was Uncle Wade's favorite and he left his $ 25,000 (big bucks with 1945 standards), Scott loses interest in Hilda's poor and plays Anne. Anne looks like Rebecca from Sunnybrook's farm until she slides with Scott - overnight, she's 10 years old and becomes quite disgusting for her sister. Finally, Hilda's message that her tenant is not good is calling psychiatrist (Rosemary DeCamp) psychically and advising her. <br /> <br /> Psychological dramas were all acts during and after World War II, and Scott does an excellent job as a smooth sociopath. It was his forte - a weak-willed sheriff "Flamingo Road" where he didn't show a real presence. For the two timings, we saw him doing it "Mildred Pierce", where he proved himself very well. Emerson is a book stenographer whose hair is drawn alongside her face and her big glasses, but after hours she is beautiful and gives a strong result. DeCamp was always an undervalued actor - here he sports a soft German accent and is delightful. <br /> <br /> This is a very fun movie, although it is a very routine story. It works really.
