Many accuse Rod Steiger of overuse and anyone who has seen Amityville's horror and "flying" section would find it difficult to say otherwise. That means he's great at this. <br /> <br /> It's never on TV, it can't be bought on DVD (legally). In 1988, when Channel 4 still had a recipe for innovation, they showed it between the small amalgam of the 60s, Privilege, etc. - and I remember the essence of the theater experience that has been well taken over by the film. Theater is a great thing, it's closed - how do you make it available and interesting on the screen? PH almost pulls it out. Since such a movie is never on cable television or on Sky TV anywhere, it's hard to go into the debate, but for everyone who has seen or remembers it, my memories are direct and almost striking for Sally Geeson. "Everybody took care of it" (which reduces the almost exceptional presentations of her and her siblings in many of the early 70's) says Ref. There are several of them - the main features you remember for years, decades. This is the power of such a movie. <br /> <br /> PS I saw it again and easily. One day, television is also illuminated.
