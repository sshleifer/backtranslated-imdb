Pat O'Brien once played the best role in Knight Rockne, a Notre Dame football coach. From humble beginnings, Rockne entered Notre Dame as a student in the 1910s. He is chemistry, but he becomes a great footballer and hero. <br /> <br /> At graduation, he teaches chemistry at school, but he has a football fever that pulls him away, forcing him to give up chemistry to continue his dream of playing the game. In some ways, too bad, the school probably lost a great chemical teacher - definitely much better and nicer than what I had in high school. (Erasmus Hall in Brooklyn is accurate.) <br /> <br /> She motivates her students. He does not tolerate academic subconsciousness. He is a coach of all seasons. <br /> <br /> O'Brien is catching this ordinary touch. One of his students, George Gipp, plays a remarkably short supporting Ronald Reagan performance. <br /> <br /> Years pass by and achievements are high, but Knute remains the same coach who recognizes Congress when football is questioned. <br /> <br /> Donald Crisp is a prominent Notre Dame priest who knew that Rockne was meant to be a football coach. Albert Basserman is enough, but his Jewish accent in depicting the priest is at best inconvenient. This year, Basserman was named "foreign correspondent" in the support category. <br /> <br /> Rockne's tragic death, during an air strike, robbed a world of many years of a perfectly professional human being. The film is great.
