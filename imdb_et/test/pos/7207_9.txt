For those who do not know it, Asterix's books are a huge success for a series of comic books about the village, the indifferent village of Gaulide, who resisted the Caesar invasion through a magical drink that makes them an unknown superman. There have been a number of animated features (only one of them, the twelve tasks of Asterix really grasp the spirit and spirit of the books, despite being on the original screen), before the perfectly cast Christian Clavier and Gerard Depardieu took the lead in adapting the two live activities that turned out to be Europe was a colossal success, but did not impress the English-speaking world. <br /> <br /> The uncut French version is very fun, but unfortunately it doesn't seem to be available in English with subtitles outside the UK DVD. Although the US theater or DVD has no sign yet, Asterix to Obelix's Miramax version: Mission Cleopatre is also on this DVD (and has played on UK TV) and you never think what - it's completely redesigned (at least 21 minutes lost) and duplicated in English. Perhaps Harve made a mistake for the Hong Kong movie - he never saw a foreign film he didn't think it would be able to repair with heavy reprocessing methods and shelves in a few years. Asterix et Obelix Contre Cesar was dubbed in English especially by Terry Jones's particularly good translation script, but otherwise it remained unchanged that such a thing is not really Miramax. The results are not good. The film was the best attempt to get a blend of screen-shot, anachronism and a classic humorous book, but many classic references have disappeared (for example, the large raft of Medusa's sight or the references of Cyrano de Bergerac from everything that seems too French or may slow down the picture, the first 20 minutes are now a real slogan. There are not many queues associated with sequences, the Depardieu part is trimmed (its part was already relatively small because its serious health problems were at the time of shooting: the US version has been partially digitally redesigned to make your face unhealthy) originally!) and, as usual, dubbing, since literal translations into English are not well suited, the lines are so much that they are no longer funny or the dialogue has completely changed (a couple of these changes are funny, like one sign) dreaming of a world where he you could move your lips in French and hear English words before). <br /> <br /> Not a complete disaster, but very disappointing, considering how good the full-length version is. It would be nice to think that Miramax would make Shaolin football and release both versions, but since they have both been dressed for two years because they cost them 45 million dollars (another classic case where Harvey's infamous chronic buyer regrets: gee doesn't know why Disney was so pleased that they had overrun their spending) and they still have no plans that could just be a way of wanting. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that such an accessible and entertaining movie is now available only to French-speaking people who are in such a cuddly defense. It seems that the lucky Gauls could win the Caesar Legions, but not the Miramax Jackpot.
