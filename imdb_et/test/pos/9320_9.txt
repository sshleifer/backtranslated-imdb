One of the best musical biocides. Dennis Morgan is an excellent singer / composer Chauncey Olcutt. Supporting cast is very good, especially Andrea King as glamorous Lillian Russell. The atmosphere of the century is an ideal place. Tehnicolor is great. Simple primer, but with the help of the film you can feel good. Morgan was always undervalued as an actor and singer.
