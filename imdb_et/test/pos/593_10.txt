Who doesn't remember the Muppet movie? <br /> <br /> Kermit, the frog is now an icon of American culture. Which child doesn't like this character? <br /> <br /> Like the first real Muppet movie, the movie was simply named "The Muppet Movie." Kermit takes the advice of a Hollywood agent and leaves her home to respond to the ad. Along the way he meets a pig, a bear, a chicken, a rock band and some other quality dolls. Watch dozens of fires like Madonna Kahn, Steve Martian, Richard Pryor, Mel Brooks and more. I grew up watching this movie and I loved it.
