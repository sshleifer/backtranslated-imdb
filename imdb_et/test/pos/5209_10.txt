This film is one of the most accurate warfare films ever made in history, as it shows the reality of the specific circumstances of both the soldiers and the Stalingrad battle, which is obvious when compared to Anthony Beevor's book. "Stalingrad". <br /> <br /> Unlike the better known "enemy gates", where the plot relocation is a sniper / hunting story, this movie shows what war can do for individuals. While the Germans were filming, "Stalingrad" is nothing more than a national apological film. This shows that war films can be something that goes beyond flag waving, the true distortions of the truth of the innocent war, as many Hollywood war products seem to be. <br /> <br /> Scripting, acting, direction and other "Stlingrad" film techniques are the highest caliber. <br /> <br /> It's a must-see movie for anyone considering joining the army and fulfilling any type of orders from Fuehrer.
