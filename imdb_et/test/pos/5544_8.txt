Michelle Pfeiffer and Matthew Modine are delighted to watch this screwball comedy. Alec Baldwin, who was at the top of the film and another star, is a hoot. Dean Stockwell is hysterical with John Gott. But Mercedes Ruehl, like paranoid and upper Connie, steals the movie. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Demme, formerly known for funny comedies such as "Something Natural" and "Melvin and Howard", once again confirms that he is a genius. I was not at all surprised when he won the Oscar, who led "The Silence of Lambs". His married actors are inspired and the audience is involved in a wild and woolly journey. <br /> <br /> One of the most beloved, loved films of the eighties is head and shoulders over many of the satires of this era.
