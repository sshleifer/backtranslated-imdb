Classic 50's film. Overdose headquarters (Joan Crawford and Louis Jordan) are not the best, but the direction, cinematography and action of the younger choice are convincing. In the 50's (what I love). <br /> <br /> The look and feel of a contemporary movie, "Far From The Sky," reflects this kind of movie (and I doubt that this film can be one of the models). A stupid plot, of course (hey, it's 1959!), But movie - glorious! As a reflection of society, it is very interesting. And as a witness to how Hollywood leaves the idealistic portrayal of American sexual practices, it is exciting.
