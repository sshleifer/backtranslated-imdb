Erika Kohut is a woman with deep sexual problems. At the beginning of the movie we see that he arrives home late. When her parents protest her mother, Erika goes mad, attacking the older woman without regret. Erika, as it turns out, is a famous music teacher in the conservatory where she teaches. When we see her next, she is a love model, but she sees the bold side as she attacks a young male student because she feels she is wasting her time and her. The same applies to the insecure Anna, a talented girl hated by Erika, perhaps because she sees a young woman's promise that she is not ready to advertise. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day, we look at Erika when she goes to the amusement area and goes to one of the booths showing pornographic material. Erika is transferred when she looks at things on the screen. The second time Erika arrives in the car where the film takes place. His attention goes to a parked car where two lovers perform sex. The camera stays on Erika because she's lost in respect, looking at what the two lovers are doing until she is surprised by the young man inside the car. Erika flees scared when she was discovered. <br /> <br /> When a prosperous couple invites Erika to perform in his cozy home grounds, he will eagerly meet the young man Walter who is related to the hosts. Walter is taken immediately with the Erika game; The young man is a talented pianist himself. His eagerness to congratulate Erika has been skeptical about him. Walter decides to listen to the Erika Master Class and has been accepted. <br /> <br /> So Walter's quest for Erika, who is surprised when he understands what a young man's motives really are, begins. Erika, in turn, begins to imagine Walter in the way she can only imagine what she would like when she does, and when they get together. Walter can be turned off by the letter Erika wrote to her, specifying the disgusting sexual behavior of a young man. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie reminded us of the latest "cache" of Mr Haneke. . We're going to the concert hall where Erika will play. He can see that he is following a conversation that is looking for Walter to arrive in the hall without noticing him. Erika's expression on the camera shows much more of her mental state at the last minute of the film. As he escapes in the lobby after the wound, he gives up and focuses on the facade of the building, which seems to be on the screen for a long time. <br /> <br /> "La Pianiste" is a personal winner of Isabelle Huppert. This great actor is one of the best performances on the screen, led by Michael Haneke, a solid hand, one of today's most interesting directors. Mrs Huppert works with economic gestures, but she designs as much of her soul as she burns the screen with her Erika. <br /> <br /> Supporting casting works wonders under the direction of the director. Annie Girardot, always great, is perfect as Erika's mother. He seems to be the key that went wrong with his daughter. There is a film incident that is played with fineness in the film context. Benoit Magimel is perfectly cast into Walter. This young actor makes a wonderful work in the film, like a young man, so in love with a woman who is in the possession of demons, that she can never escape or love her in the normal way. / / <br /> Michael Haneke's films are always distracting, but they offer so many benefits because he dares to go where other men don't. The famous famous music in the film is mainly Schubert and Schumann, two composers who are Erika's own favorites. The film was enormously helped by Christian Berger's cinematography.
