I think it was Fran√ßois Truffaut, who said that the best films are related to the joy of making movies or making movies. This flick is definitely the first type. Tromeo and Julia have the pleasure to look from beginning to end. This kind of Shakespearian shenanigan generation is contagious. I don't think I'm so hard to laugh because I saw Monty Python and Holy Grail. It's so good!
