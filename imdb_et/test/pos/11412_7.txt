When foreign calls are actually a pretty good movie. I had never seen the original and so when I looked at it, I thought it was unique. When the TV advertised foreign calls, the trailer ended. Well, I never saw a trailer, so when I saw this movie, I was surprised how good it was. I went to it one day and decided to buy it and now I'm happy because I thought it was a very nice movie that is a nice little movie. It gets a lot of unfair treatment and if you are interested in this movie, don't listen to all the negativity. Camille Belle is not as bad an actress as anyone who puts her out, and she did a great job in this movie, so all your hates get over, relieve and try to really enjoy that movie; Funny, tiny bopper, popcorn. If you haven't seen it, do it because it's much more enjoyable than many other slashers have done recently ...
