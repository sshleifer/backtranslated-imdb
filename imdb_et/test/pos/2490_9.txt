It has been said that this movie has been banned or banned in the US after its release. Since there is no information on IMDb, I have to rely on my other sources and believe. If this is really true, the film is even more harmful and frightening and it is anyway. <br /> <br /> The movie is called. It creates a scenario where America is like a military state and all revolutionary objects are arrested immediately without evidence. After mandatory arbitration, they have to decide whether they will go to prison in a few years or choose a punishment park. To do this, they must walk through the desert within three days to reach the American flag, which is posted 50 miles away, while being monitored by police and military forces. documentary about these incidents, and follows the courts of the European Union film crews and hunt in the desert. All the facts are explained, the interviewers ask questions and film everything. People look directly at the camera, shouting at it. It looks very, very real. Talking about reality is pointless. This film does not mean how to make a realistic movie, but how such a film would look if it were real. And that would definitely look like that. If it were still filmed. In such a "utopian" country there would certainly not be a European film crew who would allow these things to be filmed. <br /> <br /> There are many things that scare us. Defendants are people of all social classes. Political leaders, musicians, authors, philosophers, unemployed, etc. They seem to be hopeless, rebellious, or fearful. They are not heroes. They speak a lot in the tribunal, knowing that it does not bring anything, but they say everything they said before speeches and books and songs. One says he's not afraid to die. Is that true? Well, she doesn't have to run through the police hunt. Defendants have no chance, or at least their only chance, of a decision between the prison and the punishment park is not really likely. How they finally decide and at the end of the film makes it clear that such heroism is suicide. <br /> <br /> These courts remind us of many courts in the Third Reich. Officials use the same idealistic speech, ignoring all the arguments of the defendants, starting to shout at them and then telling them that they should be quiet. They warn the defendants of "seeing their language" and offend them much more. They ask them questions, the defendants can't answer, but it is never intention. These scenes are a statement of what we call justice. <br /> <br /> Scenes in the desert are at different levels. When we see prisoners for the first time, we realize that they understand they have no chance. Seeing the desert and the mountains, feeling the sun and thirst, they have no idea how they should stand on this free day. The film team follows them and talks to them when they try to escape this madness. Are they claiming they should play or flee or rebellion? It all leads to the same and no one is surprised. Some are asking if such parks would actually exist in such a country? Why not? It empties the prisons and allows the government to punish the revolutionary as they want. It is not a gas chamber, but the Nazis killed the Jews before the construction of the concentration camps. The comparison is fair because it is not a real difference. <br /> <br /> The film is frightening and frustrating. Problems that are spoken to ignore. These are not scientific literature. Talking about poverty, unemployment and crime is not utopian. The film shows that the government and democracy, as it is presented to us, are not only useless but dangerous. It also shows that the revolution is certainly not the solution. Defendants seem confused because they don't really know how to fight it. They do things, but nothing. Even this does not offer us a solution, but it is a statement. <br /> <br /> For me, the most frightening thing is to ban this movie. Here is a film that blames the loss of freedom, morality, and peace. It accuses the government, which is still a fictional government, of being dangerous and inhuman. And such a movie is forbidden. Think about it the next time you see the American flag.
