I saw it last night in Fort Lauderdale. Generally it was funny and I especially liked Sabrina. The action is good and the story was OK, except for the end that was left on many lines and we were like (what?) I wanted to know what the characters happened and that was a strange ending that could have done a lot better. <br /> <br /> The film really represented the rules of life and we laughed all the time. This has certain drawbacks, but for the first time for Ash Christian's movie, I thought it was good. You may want to wait for a DVD about it. But if you have the opportunity to see it, it will hit him
