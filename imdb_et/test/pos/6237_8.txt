Some films disappear, but the tourist has been running a test of time and has rightly become a cult favorite. Although not entirely original - it owes much to Texas Chainsaw Massacre, it has its own sense of humor, real horrible moments, the brilliant Pino Donaggio score and the fun performances of Chuck Connor and the production. Don't let PG keep you away, this movie proves that free horror and nudity are not needed in every horror movie to make it fun. These elements are usually used to cover the film's lack of excitement. Here the fears are worthy and effective. In addition, only Chuck Connors could wear a scene where he had to share a soup with a dummy! In fact, it's a classic scene. Now the DVD is more accessible on the widescreen, this movie is indispensable for fans of the 70's horror.
