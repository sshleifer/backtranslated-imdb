Nicole Finn (Madonna) is just released from prison. Although he has ordered a bus to Philadelphia, he wants to detain his place of detention. This is because he claims he has information that would erase his record. Louden (Griffin Dunne) has been assigned by his future father to send an escorted bus. In any case, Louden travels to the city (his future mother, Rolls Royce), speeding up the wedding ring and a rare big cat for the eccentric collector. But Nick starts the next chaos as he jumps in rolls to take over. Lawyer Louden knows that he is no longer in Kansas, with large cats, taxi drivers, hit men, bridesmaids, and weapons. Is there a way out of madness? This movie is a wild trip to the comedy avenue. Madonna and Dunneare fit perfectly with each other, making them interdependent because they play their role as ex-con and uptight, button-down lawyers, respectively. The script is praiseworthy for its ability to send the viewer to hysteria, because one incredible scene gives way to the next and the next. All secondary, from supporting actors to landscapes and costumes, are also pretty nice. If you know someone who needs joy to strike, rent this movie to them. Both of you are cheerio pronto.
