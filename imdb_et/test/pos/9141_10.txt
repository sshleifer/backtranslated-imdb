With some wine, friends, and good humor, I was watching this movie very well. I especially liked the performance of Jilon Ghai (like "Randy") who was such pants! His scenes with the charity Rahmer ("Michelle") were wildly entertaining. I wouldn't want him to come to me, but it was nice to see Randy try to score with Michelle and even better see the results! Of course, the girls in the movie also have fun watching. Yeah, my friend showed me the PLAYBOY problem with Pilar Lastra at the end of the month. He's definitely a spectator. All in all, this film fully served its purpose, which was to attract us lightly and carelessly.
