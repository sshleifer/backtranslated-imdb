I rarely watch short films because they seem to be only on late night television and are not sufficiently informed to find out what short films are worth. Since The Room is an additional feature of Hitcher's DVD, it provided an excellent opportunity to recognize high-quality short Rutger Hauer in great shape. <br /> <br /> Artistically black-and-white room with a man's obsession room, which he passed through early adulthood and expressed in documentary / interview style. Dialogue is very poetic, typical of a person who expresses his feelings about a woman, but is also ramblings and occasionally defective. This adds a great reality and depth to Hauer's performance, perfect as an eccentric man whose life is behind his life. <br /> <br /> The piano music that Harry (Hauer) hears from the room is constantly in the background and enhances the atmosphere of the film and increases the sense of sadness expressed by Hauer. <br /> <br /> Hauer proves that he is more than just a psychotic bad guy in Hollywood, who plays this role and shows his most sensitive side. Mattijn Hartemink is also effective with the quiet role of young Harry. He shows how he has lost his music and his frustration. <br /> <br /> The end is prophetic and will leave you in a reflective mood longer than many feature films. Very good effort.
