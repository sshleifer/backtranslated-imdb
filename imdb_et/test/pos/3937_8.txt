I've never realized what a fabulous dancer Lana Turner was until I saw this movie. She was only 19 years old and proud. What a joy to watch her dance with George Murphy. The story was typical for this day, but the dance was very special. I never drive looking at Fred and Ginger, but Lana Turner in this movie was just as terrible. I always thought that Lana was an actor like that, who tended to act. She would have had to do more dance and less Maddam X and Peyton Place roles. After this movie and his wonderful dancing, I saw him new. Too bad "Academy" does not give "Oscar" for dancing.
