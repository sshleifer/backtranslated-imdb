This is the case where the script plays with the audience in a way that is only intended to expand the story to 90 minutes. The story begins in 1969, when a young girl named Faith (Cameron Diaz) goes to Europe with her boyfriend Wolfopher Eccleston, but dies in mysterious circumstances. Then, in 1976, Faith's sister Phoebe (Jordana Brewster) decided to travel to Europe and try and find out what happened to her sister. In France, he sees Wolf, who has been there, and he wants him to help him again, what the sister took and answer some questions. She is reluctant but decides to travel with her. Along the way, he fills the gaps in events and tells Phoebe that faith had joined the Red Army, an extremist group linked to terrorism. Phoebe and Wolf participate in romance and make it difficult to travel to Portugal where Faith died. There are a lot of things wrong with these movies, and that's all related to the script. First, the romance between Wolf and Phoebe is wrong and does nothing for this story. It rings completely wrong and comes to a forcibly. It seems weird that Wolf would deal with the romance of his dead girlfriend's sister. Secondly, Wolf knows exactly what happened to Faith, but only allows little information within 15 minutes. Wolf looks at Phoeb every 15 minutes and says, "There's something I haven't told you!" Gee, thanks a lot to Wolf! If Wolf had been talking to Phoebe for the first time, the film would have been around in 30 minutes. Another thing that bothered me was that I didn't think this movie was created again in the 1960s. Diaz is wearing hippie clothes, but the time just didn't speak. I enjoyed some things like authentic places where the movie was shot. It is a very good looking film and the landscape is beautiful. The performances are especially good by Brewster and Diaz. Besides "Fast and Furious" I had never seen anything from Brewster. But after watching his movie, I was very impressed. He's very good here and I hope his way is better. The script is very spiritual and the film is never credible.
