For all the junkies of the offenses, this movie was great! Every character in the show appeared in the film. This helped to solve some (but not all) problems in the series. Unfortunately, if you don't really see this series, most of the enjoyment would be lost because the film made strong references to the season of each show. This would probably have been a different film than the serial finale, but we have to take what we get. I hope they will make more movies and will continue to be criminals in law and order.
