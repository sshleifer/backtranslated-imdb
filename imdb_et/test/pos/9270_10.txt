There are so many episodes that make me beat the stories <br /> <br /> that I would like to choose the best, Rocko and Bill are making a strange pair that is out of help, but can play the victim and the BS with their way out of the hard since then, just defeat Dan's crime. <br /> <br /> Canadians observe the toronto or federal government's strange jokes and because the CBC brought a really good show to Frantics that Dan was a part, the exhibition takes shots and the episode "Dan's Umbrella" CBC is raked over coal. <br /> <br /> When Dan says that the CBC will never waste taxpayers' money on a useless venture, Rocko enters the room and gives Dan Ralph Benmurgue back his Friday-night tape, this show was a flop and most people didn't get kidding, if they did not know that the history of the CBC shows that people do not see or show good exhibitions that they watch.
