I recently rented a "Chinese Syndrome" mainly because I read this is the movie that inspired ABC to do "Day after Day". But "Syndrome" is more like a thriller than a drama. The film is quite political, but I strongly agree with this message - although nuclear power is extremely effective, it is too dangerous for public use. The risks are just too high. Hopefully, those responsible for genuine nuclear power plants are more responsible and ethical than in the film. However, given that the real life catastrophe of the Three Mile Island happened only a few months after the release of this film, it puts it under discussion. (In fairness, this case was probably more incompetent than corruption.) <br /> <br /> "Syndrome" is not only critical of nuclear power, but also of modern journalism that resembles a "network" of a vein. , only a lot more serious. As a printing journalist myself, I am quite familiar with how people perceive the media; but it was a little scary to see that even in the 70's TV news had already been sold. If Jane Fonda's character tries to convince her boss to let her get real news instead of fluff, she is not advised to try, because "research" finds people prefer fluffing a beautiful girl rather than heavy news. > <br /> What really makes the movie memorable is the last third. During this time, the viewer is constantly afraid of the lives of the protagonists, regardless of whether the danger arises from employees or the possible melting of a nuclear plant. And this last scene - of course I don't - but it will keep you away. <br /> <br /> Finally, I noticed that I felt a movie that seemed more than a movie movie as a true theater movie. However, this may be due to the fact that the rented tape in question was rather old and not formatted to suit TV screens, how videos and DVDs are today.
