by TyNesha Mells. In this drama And Regis, who celebrates Reggie, fights his father's disappearance. His old friend J-Bone, who has recently been released from prison with a cold bloody thug, helps Reggie find his father's murder. A week after his father's death, the dead preacher Reverend Packer proclaimed. Reggie was supposed to kill her, but was she? Did Reggie kill Reverend Packer or was it some type of setup? The day also has a couple of romantic scenes. Look, Reggie falls in love with the preacher's daughter, and J-Bone does not appreciate the affection of her love. When J-Bone tries to destroy what they have, Reggie knows that love is forgiveness. But what does J-bone do, does it work? Are Reggie and her girlfriend breaking or getting closer? I like this movie because it leaves you wondering what will happen next and doing it or will happen. I like watching movies! It makes you in the movie so you can discover things. I also like this movie because everything goes right when you really pay attention to it!
