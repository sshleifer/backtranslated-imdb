First, it's not a bad film. It's good and I like the characters. I also like Lady and Tramp votes on this issue. <br /> <br /> However, I would like to see more of Lady And Tramp. I know it says "Scamp's adventure," and I love Scamp and an angel, but this is a sequel to the original, where I think they should just release it as "Scamp's Adventure", not "Lady and The Tramp II": Scamp's adventure. <br /> <br /> Tramp played a big role, but he didn't have much time with Lady. But in any case the songs are pretty good and Scamp and Angel are sweet. I've seen better tricks, but hey, it's not a failure. <br /> <br /> I'll give him 7/10. Very good, but still there were mistakes.
