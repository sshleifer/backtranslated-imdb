I do not agree with other comments! I also saw this movie early in screening and found it to be very enjoyable. Robin Williams is in top form. True, the tone is familiar, but it is Williams of Good Morning Vietnam: smart, funny. After too many dark turns, Williams has finally reached the best. Supporting actors give great performances, especially Laura Linney and Chris Walken. Chris plays himself as usual, but as the president of the next representative, he was always happy on the screen. Lewis Black basically only plays for himself, but here he has been very well used. Jeff Goldblum is also a fun time. The film is more than what the trailer suggests. The movie is funny, but it's not pure comedy, as suggested. It has a little thriller line that everyone should seriously consider, especially if we pay attention to the newspaper.
