I'm a fan of Randolph Scott Westerns. While some of them are amazingly cliche (as is the westernmost of this era), its simple delivery and style adds to the classic and almost classic state of the movies. Although the film has yet another example of the real life of Western heroes who were killed by Hollywood (in this case, Bat Masterson), the film works well thanks to it and its excellent supportive characters. One of them is Robert Ryani - a great actor who is unfortunately almost forgotten today. The other is the widespread Gabby Hayes, who has one of the best missions that is tough and very colorful. Here he is more joyful than Roy Rogers and John Wayne in many of his roles - mostly because his part is better written and given more. </p> <p> </p> Westerners have ever done. There are some bad guys who hire a bunch of strokes to let the local people work, and that's what makes him good (Scott) to restore peace and kill the villains. However, how the plot is filled is much better than average and the film is still traceable. Just don't expect much innovation or uniqueness - if you don't want to see just what Gabby Hayes is the best result.
