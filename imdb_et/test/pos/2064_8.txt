The small town teacher (Geena Davis) is slowly realizing that she has suffered from amnesia and has really used it as an assassination of the secret government! Soon he will be followed by men and a small-time private investigator (Samuel L. Jackson). <br /> <br /> It was packed with some special special effects and really funny single liners (especially from Jackson). Although this activity may be a bit stupid at times, who cares? After all, movies aren't meant to be the times? <br /> <br /> Craig Bierko is fun like a ruthless villain. The film itself was a good time. Just do not think you have to think too much about it, because if you take it too seriously, the movie is not really fun, but stupid. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't deserve to be called a fool or other bad name.
