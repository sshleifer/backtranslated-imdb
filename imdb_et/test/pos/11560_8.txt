Harvey Keitel gives one of his first leading roles in conventional excellence, a terrific, ambitious and uncompromising young master Coleman Buckmaster, a real talented hot shooter with a remarkable "golden ear" and famous jazz pianist son. Coleman wanted to relax with the rhythm of rails with the Rok / B group (none other than Earth, Wind & Fire with its excellent funky prime), but with its rigid commercial greed, A-Chord Records, led by robust, mobile-connected mid - Jerry Road (properly association) Ed Nelson) wants him to save the hit on one of the astonishingly unpleasant woodworker-like pop priest pages, which is said to be a pure clean cluster containing the smarmy pedophile step-father Franklin (completely whistle) Bert Parks, the nervous, neurotic daughter of Velor (thin, a good-natured Ckythia Bostwick's complicated move) and a hedonistic smack-dependent son Gary (formerly 50-year-old young sitcom headquarters Jimmy Boyd). Extremely naive and idealistic, Coleman has to learn the brilliance of how a music company really works and plays the lowest level of dirty gaming as well as possible, otherwise it loses both group and credibility. <br /> <br /> The director of the syndicated columnist and rock journalist Robert Lipsyte, the most well-known "Superfly" producer, who is a brilliant, corrosively rugged and unevenly biased script, is decisive for cynical and unequal bribes, disbursements, broken promises, back-stabbings, duplicities, and double transactions that are unpleasant, but essentially part of a largely corrupt rock business, especially thoughtful thematic aside from Art vs. Commerce against fighting its artistic integrity, and then the recent push to homogenize rock desperate, useless, creatively standing mainstream respect. What's more, this sharp and amazing pearl offers a rare, excitingly detailed and credible backstage for the recording process, as the console-cowboy Coleman of the recording cabinet fights his words in the game to "make a chicken salad out of chicken s ** t." In Nifty bits, a disc player and legendary "fifth Beatle" will appear on Murray K when DJ Big John Little (Velor rubs his hand after Big John's hand when he's live in the interview!), New York's soul on DJ and NBC's "Friday night videos" , Frankie Crocker as her jazzy'n'jivin 'herself, R&B singer-songwriter Doris Troy (she gave a lovely "Just One Look") as a church pianist and tubby, bald-70's blaxploitation favorite Charles MacGregor as a priest wedding. Quite a bad sound and Allan Metzger's sloppy cinematography adds to the film's dirty, harsh edges of documentary authenticity inadvertently. Although this film is technically somewhat flawed, it is still one of the biggest, most bitterly pessimistic scenarios of the 70s.
