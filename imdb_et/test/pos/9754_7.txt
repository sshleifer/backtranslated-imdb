HUNT FOR JUSTICE is a Canadian television drama that has made it on the DVD and is the reason for those who are starving for educational dramas that inform us of the facts of the current history that are somehow buried in the media. The film is not a production of Hollywood, it is largely based on court files, but many of us are also introducing the heroism of Louise Arbor to the trial of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. <br /> <br /> Louise Arbor (Canadian actress Wendy Crewson) is a Canadian judge who has been appointed as NATO's Chief Criminal Prosecutor at The Hague International Criminal Court. The film begins in 1996, when Arbor travels to The Hague to cope with the political impediments to the Civil Service Tribunal to convict war criminals during the war in Yugoslavia has fought in Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia. crimes against humanity in the form of genocide, destruction camps and other terrible abuses. The generals (including one William Hurt), who are afraid of the great World War, are being hampered by the progress of the same precautionary measures. Arbor, his translator Pasko Odsak (Stipe Erceg), his staff, including Keller (Heino Ferch) and British Captain John Tanner (John Corbett), bring forward by focusing on the impossible task of all those responsible for three specific events. Three of the three main suspects have been caught, but during these attempts everyone has their end. It leaves only Slobodan Milosevic and Arbor and his colleagues are successful in the war crimes in 1999. <br /> <br /> This well-documented story speaks of many aspects that make the point of history more personal. Some may find that film movies about bodies and prisoners and death camps are too strong to watch, but they are necessary to bring the film's goal home. Wendy Crewson has the strength to lead the message home - a message that war crimes should never be punished. There is much to learn from this film: writers Ian Adams, Riley Adams and M.A. Lovretta has shortened this information and made it dramatic. Director Charles Binam√© balances the docudrama story with advancements, not forgetting that he also has an intrigue story. HUNT FOR JUSTICE IS WELL! Grady Harp
