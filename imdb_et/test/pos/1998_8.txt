Okul is the first of its kind in a cinema in Turkey and it's better than I expected. Those people who say it's not scary or funny, makes sense, it's not that big. But keep in mind that all the people involved in the film are quite amateurs, so it's basically a maid's journey. Comparing this movie to other Sinan Çetin's other films, such as the "Propaganda" of the 1st Grade Garbage, this movie is pretty damn good. <br /> <br /> One thing to say: it deals with the life of high school students Turkey is very realistic! That's right! Scenes for intimidation are somewhat cheap and in Hollywood. Most of them, even if not all. But this scene of religious lessons made me smile in tears and Emre Kýnay performs the best practices of this flick as a religious teacher. <br /> <br /> It's not your waste of time, go and see it! You'll find it more fun, especially if you know that Turkey is sufficiently connected with the life of a Turkish youth school.
