A truly unique and stunning movie about Jules Verne's "For The Flag" by Karel Zeman, Czech director. Although the story is set in a rather undervalued late Victorian style, there are visual challenges. Zeman uses animation, graphics, painted kits, animation with real-time action to create the Verne's atmosphere that the reader associates with his mind. The style is similar to the Dore and Bennet and Riou steel lines, which illustrated these stories with the dose of Georges Melies. Photography is the most beautiful black and white animation, and not Saturday morning. There are submerged sequences in which the floating fish are drawn so accurately that they can be used in the field guide. There are pictures of ships, submarines, flying craft, castles and machines that are designed in such detail that it is necessary to freeze the frame on your VCR or DVD to stop the scene and explore the remarkable detail of this production. The late Victorian atmosphere is meant for a world that has never been and will rejoice in the magic of science that made Verne's great father a genre. If that's not enough, there is also a movie score that is probably one of the best ever created for a fantasy or sci-fi movie. A really forgotten classic, it's worth hunting and buying. Always one of my favorite films of all time, it is definitely your one. And remember - it took decades before CGI or computer animation. Tissue to the big artists who probably put their heart. It shows. Jules Verne himself would be proud of this film. The film that deserves to be better known, but those who have seen it, love it and treasure it. A great achievement, this remarkable movie gets better every time you watch it. Actual cinematographic artwork from visionary.
