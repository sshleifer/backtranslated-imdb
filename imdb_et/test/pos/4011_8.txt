I looked at this example when I grew up. If I mean, I remember it quite well. When you asked me, it was a pretty good show. Every time I think about it, the opening sequence and the theme song don't remember very well. In addition, everything was ideally cast. Writing was also very strong. The performances were also top-notch. I hope some networks will bring it back so I can see every episode. Before licking it, I'd like to say that I always remember this memory forever, although I'm not sure if I've seen every episode. All in all, if any network ever brings it back, I hope you get it one day before it gets in the air.
