Rachel and Chuck Yoman (Valerie Harper, Gerald McRaney) decided that the city was too busy and dangerous for their family, so they offered their reluctant son (Gregory Togel) and daughter (Tammy Lauren) and moved back to the lake as Rachel lived as a child . <br /> <br /> They say you can't go home again, but this is the perfect countryside that seems like the Mayberry feeling. Later it seems that the place of residence is more like people. Soon the bodies begin to rise and everyone sees the suspects except some friendly faces. It does not keep the family from running and mixing in the woods. <br /> <br /> We find they have to find secrets and they must not be anyone until they receive accepted antagonists. <br /> <br /> Is ignored young Stevie able to rescue his parents, or is their tracker (s) putting their feet in? <br /> <br /> This movie is most of the parodies when it was played with parts of the strait. They couldn't choose the better actors and Daryl Anderson was exceptionally horrible. The added plus is that they let us know what's going on before the characters come out instead of pulling the rain after that. Anyway, this is good for a laugh on a TV movie.
