View 1 10.10.2009 - 8 out of 10 (Dir - Billy Wilder): Lindbergh's famous flight to James Stewart as director of Lindbergh and Billy Wilder. There is really not much background in this story, but it is OK because Wilder makes the event truly remarkable because it comes directly from Lindbergh's point of view because he used his book as the basis for the film. This early film about flying must be one of the best ones. Stewart, who speaks and thinks about himself during the flight, gives you so much insight into what Lindbergh went through the 33-hour solo flight through the Atlantic. And he did all the flight without going to bed at night - it's amazing! It is a little upside down on how he bought the plane and the funding and some setbacks on his life on the flight, but the film is mostly about flying. The story is also beautifully made and photographed, and it is a pleasure to watch despite the age. I appreciate the fact that they don't throw a lot of fluff and let the story speak for themselves. Well done whole. This is a classic movie that everyone should watch.
