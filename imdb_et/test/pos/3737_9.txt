I think this exhibition was the right money for me. I watched it over the airplane, but there were parts in the movie that made me check the whole place. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Richard Gere and Diane was very credible (fantastic with both parts)! I loved how Diane lane's daughter worked at the show. She showed maturity and how she changed during the exhibition was easy to believe that what a teenager might be like in real life. <br /> <br /> I loved this example from start to finish. Definitely recommended for romantic people!
