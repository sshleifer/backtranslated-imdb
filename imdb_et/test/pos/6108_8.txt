Pink Flamingos: The History of Society's Past <br /> <br /> Pink Flamingos, a movie staged by John Waters in 1972, is a very disturbing image of the negative impact that traumatized childhood can have in the future. Babs Johnson grew up in a very non-typical home. Obviously you will see what impact this has had on society through its activities until the end where it involves the excrement of dogs. Was this film somewhat ill and the presence of twisted endless intestinal techniques or was it a much deeper symbol? The first side would be a simple way out and dementia may appear on its side, but perhaps true. The film has some credible similarity to the real events of our social past. Anyone we see as "terrible" as humans is similar to Babs Johnson. The horrible Ivan, Genghis Khan, Adolf Hitler and Joseph Staling were all "worrying" in childhood. Babs Johnson had a worrying childhood and is therefore associated with the same class as all previous rulers. That's why a lot of his activities in the entire film can be considered disturbing. But his actions were his own fault or society that he grew up like he did. In addition, each of these films is either a past driver or an event. Another coincidence is Edith's obsession with eggs. With an open mind, it can be associated with genocide and Hitler's attempt to destroy the Jews. Some look at Hitler as a genius, others are crazy. John Waters must see him crazy because his representation, Edith, was really mentally ill. Edith's son Crackers and Traveler Cotton are symbolic of what was in our own garden, slavery. Both names are slang terms that represent a period that most of us would rather forget. These characteristics are very important in that it shows that in some times our society in America was not better than what we often see as a terrible social attack in other cultures. The king of chicken f ** is what is wrong in our society during this period and is still wrong. Chicken, is a woman's 1970s slang. Therefore, it may be possible that John Waters tried to bring out the rape through the activities of Cotton and Crackers. The antagonist family, if one antagonist could be determined in this film, was marble. Marble is often referred to as wealth. It may therefore be a symbolic struggle between the poor and the wealthy in a fight that continues today and is likely to continue forever. Pink Flamingos is a monumental film about his worrying scenes, but it must also be noted about the ridiculous political agenda that Waters showed so much in its entirety.
