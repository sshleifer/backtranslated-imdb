I saw this movie for the first time in the early 1980s with the help of cable. It was unique as a statement of the sixties, culture, war, music, race and a lot of things I'm sure of. But about a year ago, it came back to my life when I started to enjoy it with my son. He's a little young (9) a lot of his topics, but he realizes that dance-hippies are fun to watch, and he gets the idea that it's ironic. Although I can't think of other movies for this genre, he has an independent genius that I love. This also makes Central Park unique justice. Most of the musicals have disappeared in one way or another. "Tommy" was up and hard, "Oliver" looked like a crowd on a silver screen, "The Wall" was so abstract self-improving and caring drifting, but listening to "hair failure" for human hair today sounds the right time for us, as it was in the eighties, as it must be in the sixties ... really timeless.
