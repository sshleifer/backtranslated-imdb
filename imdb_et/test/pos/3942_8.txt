This movie was adapted to the well-known horror when you know that his three students were looking for a long-lost book about teaching the Buddha. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is not as festive as the previous legend, it managed to bring romance and fun humor. <br /> <br /> The real goal of this movie is to rotate more to the monk, who was mostly saved from eating demonic flying creatures. One of his pupils, Monkey God, managed to take him out of battle, but the demons, in turn, seized them and dropped into the deep throat of the dragon, locked in that particular cave. > <br /> The monk woke up to a small village where he found Mei Yan (the so-called ugly snake daughter) who fell in love at first glance. Though she was ugly, she didn't let her look away. But the efforts made to rescue the three pupils will soon be filled with obstacles, and each of them became Mei Yan after the work. The problems were deeper, and this is where conflicts in the relationship get worse. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story is left at your disposal, but it is enough to say that this movie does not represent a typical story, it's more for those who want to look for a funny and easy picture of what they traveled in the West and the obstacles to love actually mean. <br /> <br /> After all, the whole summary could only be described with one word and it is love. The Munk went on to show the Heavenly Gate, the Heavenly Palace, and the Buddha exhibition itself, how love can overcome even the worst fears and is considered inappropriate as the most powerful weapon that can be used against any enemy of supremacy. /> Buyers of this ticket are waiting for wonderfully created and funny actions. Of course, it would not be unfortunate, at least from my side and those who were with me in the same day watching the same movie.
