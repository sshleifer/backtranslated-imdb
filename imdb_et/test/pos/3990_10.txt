First I loved this movie. As a fan of Billy Crystal, I have to say that I was expecting more comedy situations than I actually got. However, it was nice to see her with a deeper and more emotional role. His imagination of talent representatives from Sammy was excellent and unique. In addition, Gheorghe Muresan (Maximus) was excellent in his first film role. When Sammy goes to Romania to visit his client at the place where he has turned his world around. He never expected to find one person by accident who could change his life. Sammy's and Max's journey is unique and occasionally humorous. Plus, the location in the Czech Republic, where parts of the movie were shot, was absolutely beautiful. I have to say that in this dramatic comedy I had a lot of emotions. I thought it was great and I would like it for everyone and everyone.
