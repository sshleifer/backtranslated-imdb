COMPETITION IN 1933, Hitler and his "National Socialist German Workers' Party", which of course we all know as Nazis, increasingly tightened their country's grip when time passed. Early on, when they were Germans, they started inviting all artists, newspaper men and filmmakers to Nazi headquarters to be informed about what the newly-declared "Third Reich" (aka "Empire") was expected of them. <br /> <br /> When Fritz Lang, leader of the silent impressionist and expressionist era of German cinema, was invited to meet Herr Goebels; he listened carefully and said nothing. Immediately after leaving the Propaganda office, Herr Lang went directly to the train station and took the passenger directly to Paris. Fritz Lang did not even return to his place of residence in Germany (at least several years later. He stayed in France; finally immigration to the United States. * <br /> <br /> MR. LANG went to work properly in America, creating various more enjoyable, stronger and significantly more literate top-of-the-line films during the year. The titles of this smörgåsbord include today's happy theme, WESTERN UNION (20th-Fox, 1941). /> <br /> TYPICAL The Old-Western and Pioneer Days film needs both quality and cast, WESTERN UNION qualified Both props are considered as talents as well as supporters of a large number of headlines that make every mood for every minute and joy of every scene. <br /> <br /> Playbill's title is Robert Young, Randolph Scott, Dean Jagger, and Virginia Gilmore, others are outstanding people like John Carradine (not playing) vampire or other scary man, but a doctor), Geor ge "Slim" Summerville (veteran actor, Silent Film veteran and graduate of Mack Sennett Keystone Comedies), Chill Wills (always a trusted supporter and former singer "The Avalon Boys") and a low-light bad Barton MacLane. Add to this mixture names such as Russell Hicks, Victor Killian, Minor Watson, George Chandler, Addison Richards, Irving Bacon, James Flavin, Francis Ford, Frank McGrath and Kermit Maynard (Ken Maynard bro). <br /> <br /> Among those American Indians who are: Chief Big Tree, Chief Thundercloud and Mr. Jay Silverheels. It has also been pointed out that one of the great representatives of North American Aborigines is an excellent, unique, impressive and memorable example of the Red Man, Louisiana Native, Iron Eyes Cody (born of Espera DeCort, the parents of Sicilian immigrants). <br /> <br /> Filming delicate outings took place in Arizona and Utah and was made available at the highest level of Technigolour. (There is no monument to the valley, but it is John's province). In some ways, this film is a much more amazing achievement than we think; because he took a kind of pulp magazine, adapting it to the thirties and the early post-war American flavors and idioms. All of this is done by a German-born director who was only in Hollywood and America in a short time. <br /> <br /> In the final analysis, WESTERN UNION, although it may not be the most historical exact example of the Western genre; we just don't care. It will appreciate all the necessary categories that are needed for a great night in movies! SO, who cares little about details like "accuracy"? <br /> <br /> We'll give Mr. Lang and the 20th-century Fox an evaluation ****! <br /> <br /> NOTE: * We just saw a special WTTW at PBS, here in Chicago it touched all the filmmakers, directors and other craftsmen who brought Nazi power to shelter in America and Hollywood. (It seems that the film's folk and scientists were the biggest export to Germany at that time, being the scientists who built the atomic bomb and the future NASA people came from Europe now.) <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
