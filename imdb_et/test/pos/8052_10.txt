I'm from Phoenix, and for the first time I saw this movie and read the book only with the confirmed stories I've ever heard. I asked my grandfather about the mobile and he told me that when he fought back in the Pacific theater he started the CPA company, which is the largest in the Columbus area. when he just started, the mob asked the mobile to do a financial job for them, but he said he was gently dropping. Even if the FBI and the army came through the city of Phoenix and cleaned it up, my grandfather did not take it lightly when my mother, aunt or uncle went across the river, but I assure you that it is now over. The city center of Phoenix needs to be restored and its courthouse has slums, where all the pictures STILL OCCASIONALLY take place in angry, uneducated, low socio-economic people and the 14th Street Phoenix eagle bridge is closed for 15 years and replaced by a newer 13th street bridge, but on the fair side of Phoenix town on summerville rd. it is very peculiar and depressing landscapes. <br /> <br /> My best friend's family from high school told me one more case that lives in hwy 165 called the Holy Trinity, Alabama, which is about 28 years old. minutes outside Columbust, Ga. my best friend of high school uncle was the man who went to the old man's Davis name. no matter how the movie goes, there were 3 bosses there and the old man Davis was one of them ... you can even read about him in the original book. the legend is that he was so cold blooded that he went to the city of Phoenix downtown to make a deal with a man, but apparently he supported the deal directly with Old Man Davis, so the old man Davis stepped out of the shotgun and let the man in the middle of town in the courtyard . they say he even walked away because the mob had paid all the city law enforcement officers so he had nothing to worry about. <br /> <br /> Another case is about a bridge that belongs to another of your friends renting a house in downtown Phoenix. it is the same bridge that the mob has died and threw down a black man, and you can even read this part of the book. I would also like to see many people in Columbus and Phoenix asking for civilian additions to the film. When a patterson friend is murdered and brought to justice, but he is still free, the judge is my father's partner in his law firm in Columbus, who is unfortunately dead.
