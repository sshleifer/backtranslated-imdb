At the time of making this film, I tried to make a statement about it on television. Something like this: "Does Killingg√§nge take Nazism now?" <br /> <br /> So my understanding of this film was from the outset getting the concept of Nazism. When you recently saw this movie on TV, I had this filter in front of me and it wasn't hard to see. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, I haven't been to this movie since I first heard it. <br /> <br /> These are the things I found in "Four Brown Tones". In all four stories, the lack of empathy causes disaster: <br /> <br /> 1. The Crematorium employee does not show real empathy to dead animals or to those who had to say goodbye. In the Crematorium room to deal with death and fire, it's almost like a joyful game for him. Dad and his boy do not stress the seriousness of death and fire, ignorance pushes the button, leading the father to a serious disaster. <br /> <br /> A possible lesson: the importance of showing young people enough emotions. When they grow up, they need to know what behavior leads to a disaster and what emotions bring about. <br /> <br /> 2.The actual maneuver your wife as an invisible doll maker. Just when he thinks he has begun to cut off the strings, achieving personality, honesty and joy, he pulls hard and he's back in the desert and despair. <br /> <br /> Their son has tried to create his life in the ascension with perfection and "good" taste as opposed to his parents' "bad" taste. The real problem he is experiencing is far from understandable: his father's behavior goes on as suffocating his wife in his perfect environment. <br /> <br /> A possible lesson: oppression pulls blood. A father who was abused as a child goes to sadism to his children when he deceives them with his inheritance. He robs them of their childhood and even their heritage. <br /> <br /> A possible lesson: If love is not given, you cannot give anything. <br /> <br /> 4. The Abuse of Fathers The daughter creates a cruel aggressive robber in her. Here, ice-cold Naziism becomes very obvious in the case of physical violence. This provides a possible background and a somewhat plausible explanation of the behavior of young "scin-head" neighbors when pushed by others. <br /> <br /> A possible lesson? : Can Nazism Born To a Perverted Home? <br /> <br /> In the long run, can ignoring empathy in family life be a room for sadistic Nazism? <br /> <br /> Very rarely does the movie contain so much. It appears little when I meditate on it. I think it is "stained" and the actors are great. Especially Ulf Brunnberg apparently played the obvious luck, which is the worst.
