My 24 library of the top 24 lesbian movies has to be rated as the first ever movie. This film goes down in history as the best genre. This is the story of a girl (Rachael Stirling) who goes to rich rags and towels to wealth, her first love (Keeley Hawes) opens her life and out. It's set on a Victorian background in the 1890s, making it an ideal place for some of the best entertainment in the industry. This movie did not save the cost of music and costumes, and Rachael and Keeley made only a variety of films on the Halls stage. <br /> <br /> No matter what kind of movies you prefer, I can ensure that this movie not only amazes you, but keeps your attention through all three episodes. This film is played and enjoyed for decades. An unrated version of the DVD collector is mandatory for everyone's library. Rachael Stirling and Keeley Hawes were the best choice for these two roles and they played very well.
