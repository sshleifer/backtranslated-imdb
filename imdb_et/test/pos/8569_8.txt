H.O.T.S. is a fun movie for a trip back when the skin flick had a more positive fun filling. They were just doing good and have some laughs. Everything seems less cynical and tired. All girls have natural numbers and some are Playboy playmates. A simple plot deals with a group of young women who open an unpunished corporation to get back to the nervous corporation girls who accused them and insulted them. Instead of today's medium-to-strong tricks, most hijinkes are just innocent fun. Women are decent actors for this genre and are mostly very attractive. In order to keep our attention between the topless scenes, we have mafia-henchmen, a stolen bear, a hot balloon, a funky house-mother and the cheapest robot ever seen. There's even a family of Dannyd Bonnaucci. If you have a sense of humor, let yourself go and enjoy some light entertainment.
