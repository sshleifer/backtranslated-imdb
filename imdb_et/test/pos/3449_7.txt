This movie has a lot to suggest. Paintings, music and David Hewlett's naked butt are all proud! The plot of plot, redemption, forgiveness, and courage in the face of accidents is also very interesting and touching - and it is not predictable, which says quite a bit about the film that day and age. But the operation is mediocre, the direction is confusing and the script is just strange. It often seemed like he was trying to have a parody, but I never understood what he was trying to * parody *. And if it is not a parody, it remains a very high potential film that he did not live in.
