I've only seen about half a dozen movies starring Lino Ventura, but it looks very similar to others. He plays a laconic criminal who is short and weak but occasionally explosive. Given his quiet personality in films such as SHADOWS ARMY and SECRE BREATH, I have noticed that his minimalist style of action is extremely effective. In other words, because he is so quiet and clever as he does the bad things you usually notice. And like other movies, he also has a very strong, though twisted, moral code. <br /> <br /> Abel Davos (Ventura) and his partner Lilane are both living in Italy and are career criminals. They both grew up in France and eventually had to flounder due to criminal activity. Now that the film starts in Italy, they still live the life of the offenses and the heat is there for them. Strangely enough, instead of going back to a third country, they decide to go back to France - even though Davos has gone missing and convicted - and when he is caught, it can mean life or death in prison. Much of the first third of the film concerns their hidden return. <br /> <br /> For Davos, return is not perfect and now it seems that every French policeman is looking for him. In addition, the reaction of his old compatriots to crime is not what he expects. In fact, their mild response to their return at the end of the film will result in the release of a number of terrible events. <br /> <br /> Davos meets along the way and takes it to my stranger Eric Stark (Jean-Paul Belmondo). Despite Davos, who apparently had no friends, Stark and his friend are trying their best to make his return successful. What throws another one with this key is Davos' two very young sons - what Davos does with them - keep them together in their hiding place? In general, this is a very good criminal film - like the French film Noir. Unlike the American Noir, many of the French-language versions I've seen have a more realistic and smaller prospect for them. Fatalism dominates, it's definitely! The action is first-rate (especially Ventura and Belmondo), the direction is very solid and very nice in writing, although I am sure many do not like the end. It seems to be just about - as thought-out. I understood why they did this, but they also see how it can leave many unhappy. As for me, it remained flat for me. Otherwise an extraordinary film.
