By 1952, Hollywood decided to redefine Al Jolson's first-rate classics. <br /> <br /> This time, Cantor's son Danny Thomas played. Coming home from the army, he is assumed to follow his father and other male relatives, becoming a cantor. But younger Golding has quite a lot of exhibitions. <br /> <br /> At the moment, he is trying to catch up with Peggy Lee. She works very well and her favorite song Lover is remarkable. The filmmakers were smart not to combine the obvious Jewish dude and the non-Jewish girlfriend relationship. If anything, it's shining. In his anger, when he made his promise as a candidate, he made his father's traditional Jewish sign showing the loss of the family. It would not take place in a situation of breakage of bondage, if it were an interfaith marriage between Orthodoxy. <br /> <br /> Thomas is doing a great job to play with the cantor's son. His song is up to the right when the movie ends with a positive comment. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that technical advisers did not realize that women do not wear a laptop on their Sabbath or at all during this period.
