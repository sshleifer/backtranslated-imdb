See Three colors: blue and three colors: white. They are both great movies and give the finals three colors: red extra. Red is a fantastic movie. It can be enjoyed in one viewing, and the movie's climax is very powerful at this first viewing. But look at it again. If you understand the use of the parallels between the symbolism and the character in this film, you will see new things with each view. At first sight you realize that film is a work of brilliant mind. With every additional view you find yourself discovering that it is actually a genius. Red is meant to symbolize the French flag of the Brotherhood. The story revolves around the brotherhood to look at corners that are never suspected. The fraternal parts of the different letters are as deep as you care. If you are accustomed to the blatant "symbolism" of most mass films, you may find that Red is a bit slow. You can find yourself looking at a screen full of intensity that you don't know ... and horror, don't know what all the excitement is. It's not a pointless experience. Not everything is explained to you. You have to think when you look. You have to see ... not just look. Wonderful movie ... one designed to enjoy a wonderful moviegoer.
