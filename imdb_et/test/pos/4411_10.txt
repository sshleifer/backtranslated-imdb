"Flesh" is difficult to describe with a difficult summary because it is not a lot. The movie shows quite a day when Mr Joe (Joe Dallesandro, who is underrated by Louis Malle's "Black Moon"), was doing his round, sleeping and modeling money to pay. his wife's lover for abortion. <br /> <br /> Not much, and since the film is eighty-nine minutes long, you think "meat" would be slow and dull for one and a half hours. You think wrong. The film is made up of improvisation, the scenario, and the corner of the film is also on the ground, but there is some kind of truth under the frame that makes the film dementedly fun. Everything makes sense and serves the purpose that happens to Joe that day. He meets with regular John, who apparently lies when he says he wants to see Joe again, a photographer who speaks so much that he's always Joe's tears, two dragging kings who read tabloid magazines when Joe gets mousy-dependent on his heads mumbles later on how she wants to get breast lifting, old Joe friend who reads her male rape stories, and then the last scene with her husband and her lover who repeatedly hears a movie at the beginning of the scene (one of the best openings I've ever seen for the film) ? and says fully what the film is philosophically general. <br /> <br /> It is amazing how movie messages and styles feel almost timeless, although it is set in the 1960s in New York in real time, in a real place, and has been filmed as an obvious independent flick of this era. This is certainly not a movie that could be done today that adds to its delicious mysticism. <br /> <br /> Strengthened by unexpected jumps; and there is no score to further develop your pictures? "Flesh" is about as raw, sharp as the film about male prostitution in the 60s.
