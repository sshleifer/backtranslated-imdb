The best Batman movie in the 90s is not in doubt. This film takes place in a city full of insecurity and nightmares. <br /> <br /> The performances are really great and the comic behind them really offers expectations. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by fake clothes, it's a clean style of Burton. It cannot be described; Burton is a sui generis director who took the Batman franchise to the second hidden level, but did not forget the passing of this comic style. <br /> <br /> An action movie is recommended for fans and best of all when it comes to superheroes.
