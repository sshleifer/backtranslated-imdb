I've looked at this comic as a child, a father, and now a grandfather. This is my favorite movie. I love signs, very few stories and very good drawings. I totally love the main song that appears in the whole comic. I think it's a pretty little comic. Anyone I have shown just loves it. It is too bad when it was opened on such a bad day (bombardment of Pearl Harbor). Had it not been a bad time, it would have been a great success. I hope I find this DVD because not all VHS tapes make it fair. <br /> <br /> I think if someone shows it to your child, they will come to the same result. They just love it. <br /> <br />
