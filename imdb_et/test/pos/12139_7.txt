I agree with all the other reviews that have been mentioned, but here are some shocks that hold it firmly within the crime drama or movie genre and limit it as a great drama that goes beyond the elements that make up the movie's noir - not to say that big filmmakers don't not / can't / should not be big dramas, but it is not. <br /> <br /> Another labeled music movie is used sparingly, but I would say it is used to emphasize activities rather than female elements. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie, which is, by the way, a stubborn ending that is either right or downward dependent. at the moment. But children are never shown to react in one way or another. Not shouting or asking my father what happened, kids are good actors, and my father's reactions are important to me, but it's a big mistake. This is a story, and children are mostly empty in their reaction. They really just aren't, in the next scene they see something happened. <br /> <br /> Similarly, Belmondo and Ventura also have a bond between the characters. Belmondo says he knew the killed partner, but it was never explained or dramatically influenced by Belmond or anyone else. Belmondo's romantic sub-block also tightens confidence, although it has been convincing. The Ventura character just lets Belmondo get the whole stranger out of his escape plan for no reason. He doesn't even comment or see. The second gap. The end of the movie and I don't break it, the end ends with a screen with a perfect voice to tell you what happened. I think it is trying to make it feel more alive, but like the others, it leaves the drama screen. <br /> <br /> What is the point of not addressing these issues? I do not know, except perhaps, the aims of the film have been limited to the audience he wants from the melodrama of the crime - to suggest some deeper elements, then move to ignore them. <br /> <br /> Too much to recommend this movie, Ventura is very good, but too bad could have been a drama as well as a crime story - like IMDb's favorite movie GODFATHER all the time. This film had potential. Would you make a good transformation, though if there were more problems in the US, you would probably be drowned in the movie, but it would be a good remake to the right director, even though it is doubtful about Ventura's performance. <br /> <br /> So it is worth seeing, but depressing as a whole
