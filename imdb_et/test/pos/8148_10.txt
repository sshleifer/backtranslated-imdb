My last days were a very moving film that showed how difficult and unsuccessful the gay community really is. The film breaks the real passion and really examines the feelings of these two characters, the film has a real compassion for the gay community because it actually speaks to a gay man / woman. Personally, I think that the homosexual community of all-time religions should no longer shame it, but to be beautiful there. The film was a great eye-opener for me because I couldn't believe how the homosexual adversary world really is. Even in schools, if the child does not like anything, it indicates that it is "gay". I really hope that more of this movie will be made and that they will not be labeled just as a "gay" movie, but as a story of love, because I believe that georgians should stick to themselves and tell their story through their eyes.
