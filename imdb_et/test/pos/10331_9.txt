This movie should be just a movie qualifying. <br /> <br /> What makes people more aware of people. Maybe it is even tedious to understand that a young Jewish southern girl could be Kristy McNichol, an astonishing portrait of an accident, a young girl who is thirsty for thirst and love. Michael Constantine gave a remarkable result, as his hard father and Esther Rolle, like servant Ruth, gave an excellent Emmy victory as an understandable girl who received these events. <br /> <br /> Bruce Davison depicts a German who is not allegedly guilty of Nazi atrocities. So his role appears. He has escaped, but he joined the German army and could be a member of Hitler's youth movement. <br /> <br /> The action takes place in 1944 in a rural country in Georgia. The townspeople are full of prejudices. Even the FBI inspector works the way he would like to get something about the Jews. Notice the opposite interpretation that when McNichol is in bed, Davison is chilled and finally released. It is interesting to see that society sees McNichol as a traitor as a runaway war prisoner. The film also deals with the extremely complex relationship that exists between father and daughter. The outbreak of Constantine at the end of his daughter is some action. Because mother Barbara Barrie has little to do. It was annoying that he was stereotypical as a typical Jewish mother with a loud tone of lip lipstick. <br /> <br /> Remarkably made and worth seeing.
