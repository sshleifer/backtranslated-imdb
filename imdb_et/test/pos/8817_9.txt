This blaxploitation classic kung fu mama, who rides Hong Kong to his brother's death, offers everything you can expect from the genre. Playmate Jeannie Bell (giant afro) really pulls her ass and loses her clothes very quickly. If you don't take it too seriously, it's fun to watch the movie. Stan Shaw gives a solid result, Jeannie Bell is a bit less convincing. Pam Grier he is not. <br /> <br /> This is where Quentin Tarantino got his idea of ​​a light switch scene from "Jackie Brown". <br /> <br /> Don Julian's soundtrack is a gem and is often used in rap songs.
