Sonny Chiba, as everyone knows, is a man. In this film he depicts Mas Oyama (1923-1994), a true martial artist who fought over 50 bulls with bare hands and won (an interesting man?). Anyway, Chiba kills just one bull in the movie, but it is a memorable scene and when the liner notes Zombie is there a zombie vs shark scene! The film also offers loads that can be countered, and a decent piece of land, although I don't think it's all true. This film is the first Oyama trilogy in Chiba, which is recommended for fans of martial arts activities. Finally, three clean small tidbits; part of the opening topic was used in Kill Bill Volume 1, itself appeared in Oyama's opening sequences and it's because he trained Chibat in real life for five years!
