I am really sad that this film has so much negative criticism. I think it's a nice little comedy and really funny. The humor of this movie is kind of warm and innocent and I like it. I also like the character of Madonna and I don't agree she played. He has created a character and compassion. <br /> <br /> My favorite scenes were fighting style on a drowning car and where Madonna climbs over the garden to get her love. The humor of the film has a somewhat surreal touch and maybe it's not the tea of ​​every person. But this is their problem, not the film. <br /> <br /> I found this movie healthy and sunny. In fact, the day I saw it for the first time was for some reason incredibly sad and this film shone my day. And Madonna can act. Take your glasses off of negative thinking.
