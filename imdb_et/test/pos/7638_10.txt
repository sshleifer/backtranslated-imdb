I watched this movie thinking that it was absolutely terrible and was ready for all horns, bad special effects, and so on. But I was pleasantly surprised. Not to say that this is the best vampire movie I've ever seen, but that's definitely not the worst. I liked all the alternative reality / dream that played the movie. The graphics were pretty good for the DVD movie and I liked the overall appearance of the movie. I liked the main character Sai. I usually stop hating the women leaders, but there was something about me that would interest me. Yes, he makes some bad decisions, but it was expected. Yes, other characters were stereotypical, but I expected it too. I don't know if I want to highly recommend this movie, but I give it a chance and you may be pleasantly surprised. I'll put this one on my list of blessings.
