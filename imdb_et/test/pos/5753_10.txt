My God, it's funny things. Yes, it is extreme, but also quite funny ("Here are all the wines on the page." "It's a bit early for us, I'm afraid." "Well, what are you doing?") And the fighting sequences are any. Despite what you have heard, laughing * doesn't come and surprisingly big. The comic abilities of Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson alone will help keep it cool. threw all the comedy drops from the script. I can only compare it with "Fear and Hope in Las Vegas" - whether you find this movie hysterical or not at all; the same is true here. This is probably the most fun British movie from "Withnail and I", but to say it has acquired a taste that is something brutal (sic) underestimation.
