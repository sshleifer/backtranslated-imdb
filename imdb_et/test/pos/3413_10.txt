Of all the seasons and TWILIGHT ZONE episodes, after they saw all the great, desperate, thought provoking stories, it's up. This is correct. This story, this title titled "HUNT", highlights a large number of the best scripts in television history. <br /> <br /> True, there are no interplanetary space flights that are not inexplicable cracks. There is no live nightmare, no sudden changes. Our protagonist no longer sees anything ordinary to deal with. <br /> <br /> The main character played by the veteran actor Arthur Hunnicut is in the mountains with his loyal hound, hunting for his cab. Since the raccoon is predominantly a wolf of nocturnal animals, it is a moonlight. <br /> <br /> The man and the dog will soon be exposed to a large raccoon who hops the dog and tries to sink the whore into the pond. Man jumps to help his dog. There's a sort of dazzling sort of dusk, after which the couple can be seen on the shore, lying, almost asleep in a position. <br /> <br /> Calling your dog by name (Rip, I think) the old man returns home. When he arrives, he finds a woman to cry and does not respond to his conversation. He also watches the guests who come and go to their home, pay tribute and give the words to their spouse. <br /> <br /> Still, it seems strange at the strange reception and when switching home cabin, man and hangers, a long walk along the road, where he notes loudly that he does not remember such a long fence in such parts. Finally, he comes to a rather large companion, dressed in clothing, such as his overalls, hat, work shirt. They are at the gate leading to the area where the smoke frees. Gate Keeper is too convincing in its convincing pitch trying to get a man to enter. Rip sounds annoying. Gate Man tells the old man that he can enter, but the dog should stay outside, offering the animal to look at him. The man is not one and the two continue their way down the road. <br /> <br /> After a little more hiking, they will come to the entrance to another gate, where the goalkeeper will recognize the man and greet him. When the old man announces what happened along the way, he tells him how the man at the other gate was trying to separate the man and the dog, and added: "If the dogs are not allowed, it must be a place of hell!" 2nd Gate Keeper announced he was right! "That's exactly what it is!" Our family had lost their 1st dog, Lady-a mixed Lab, in October 1981. About 6 months later, like luck, it would be both husband (Deanna) and my two daughters (Jennifer 9 and Michelle 6) watching this episode of TV, WGN TV, Channel 9 Chicago. Well, it all gave us a perfect understanding at this time. For this 60-year-old writer, the episode still creates watery eyes.
