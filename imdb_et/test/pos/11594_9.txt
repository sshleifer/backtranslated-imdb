Director and co-author Alejandro Amenabar did not make his tense, somewhat longer but very disturbing story easy for viewers, relying exactly on the Spanish man's struggle for suicide. "Mar Adentro" ("The Sea Inside") is thrilling and has a much greater impact on theater time. <br /> <br /> Award-winning Canadian "Barbarian Invasions" people could see the family with the children of their dedicated friends to solve their loved one, even though the careless person's desire to end their lives. In this film, attention was focused on progressive, incurable cancer, and its descent into the terminal stage was rapid. Emotional as scenes were, death was inevitable - the question was if the gentle could do it through ordered intervention. <br /> <br /> Ramon Sampedro (perfectly played by Javier Bardem) is a different story. For over two decades, it has been quadrupled due to a diving accident. (Very sharp viewers can identify terrible irony about why he stopped doing so because of his improvising dive.) As a world traveler and lover of beautiful women, he is now immersed in a stationary body, all his needs are linked to a truly committed family who renounces great to your degree of privacy and time to maintain your beloved relationship. <br /> <br /> Rosa (Lola Duenas), the mother of two little boys, enters the household of Sampedro about what might have been just a curiosity to learn about the situation of a paralyzed person, but she becomes both an emotionally supporting Ramon center and amusing, but time aggravating presence. Nice staged Duen. The problem is, of course, that Sampedro is not sick in the normal sense. He can take good care of decades more. Thus, his soft but persistently expressed desire to end his "dignity" in his life is a moral dilemma for friends and relatives who have not surprisingly responded to different ethical and religious perspectives. <br /> <br /> Ramon is a poster quota group dedicated to changing Spanish suicide laws. "Death with Dignity" is their key word. The gene (Clara Segura) is a sensitive activist who supports pro bono publico defender Julia (Belen Rueda). Julia has her own health problems with an indefinite but catastrophic prognosis. Luckily, he married a dedicated husband, emotionally associates with his client. <br /> <br /> The following is a sharp sensitive combination of values ​​and emotions. Ramon lives with his brother and husband, with their technophilic teenage son, not with intellectual Ramon and his elder father, who is unable to end his son's cataclysmic descent into absolute helplessness. <br /> <br /> Moral and legal issues are played through a spectacular actor and short vignette, including a courtroom scene where formality wins over any judicial interpretation that may take into account Ramon's feelings and views. It may be Spain, but the problems are alive in most countries, including the US. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of fun in the nocturnal bedroom on the first floor, a discussion between Ramon who has been talking about teaching the Jesuit priest. quadriplegic, but whose hidden dogma disguises the lack of soul, <br /> <br /> Special praise to Mabel Riverale, Ramon's sister Manuela, for deliberately authenticizing a strong woman with a family together. The same compliment also extends to Belia Rueda, Julia, who interferes with a close woman close to objective lawyers who fall into a dark fate. <br /> <br /> The director does not set values ​​that allow the full range of characters to express his feelings effectively and at times move. Like "Dead Man Walking", this film can support all views on your deadly subject. <br /> <br /> No one can prevent a person from committing suicide when he / she is assigned, but the universal tragedy of Ramonite in the world is that without help you can't live in a body where only the heart strikes and only the head can move, a sentence the court does Can't declare criminals the most abandoned. <br /> <br /> Cinematic art is a well-matched story, and beautiful Galician scenes are meant to contrast with the limited views Ramon experiences once he experiences his special bed. <br /> <br /> 9/10
