This is an excellent film that deals with the issue of racism in a gentle and balanced way. Great performances all around, but absolutely outstanding show by Sidney Poitier. <br /> <br /> He makes this movie breathable and lively. His imagination, a man who fights against discrimination and violence, is just a blow. At the same time, his actions are vigorous and gentle and subtle. Truly worthy of Oscar, Poitier had to wait for several years (because of her skin color) before the Academy recognized the brightness of her actors. <br /> <br /> Cassavets are also taken away for great performance and anxious and realistic as it has become its hallmark. He and Poitier are irresistibly opposed to the power of cowardice, courage, and human transformation through friendship. <br /> <br /> The film is enjoyable and at the same time deeply haunted by US portrayal of racism. The irony is that it somehow reflects the reality that Poitier was supposed to work with.
