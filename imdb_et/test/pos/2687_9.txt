Like in the last ten years or even longer, the whole world is flooded with so-called sitcoms (in fact, very little deserves because they are so predictable), the Queens King is a very original, unique and amazingly funny alternation. It concerns the daily life of a supplier and his wife, who works as a lawyer in Manhattan, Queens, NY. With them, Carrie's father, Arthur, lives in the picture book extrovert, which is played by fantastic Jerry Stiller and who steals the exhibition from everyone else when he appears. Other important people are their best friends Deacon and Kelly, married couple and their second friend Spence, who is almost 30 years old and still live with her mother. What makes this exhibition so unique and funny is, above all, that every single character seems so real and Carrie's cynical, sarcastic attitude is the opposite of Doug's good-natured, slightly foolish optimism. And Arthur is the one who makes it completely unpredictable for his strange ideas and habits. Often he gets into trouble and Doug and Carrie have to pull him out of the mud. Even though I think the quality of the exhibition has fallen slightly over the past few years, it is still one of the best everyday everyday hits. It takes a little time to get to the characters and associate with them, but after it's done, you get some unstoppable laughs. Although I think I couldn't survive one day in a closed room with Arthur without igniting him, I really love him in this show. See and enjoy it, I'll give it to 9 out of 10.
