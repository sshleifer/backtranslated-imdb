"The Beguiled" is one of my favorite Clint Eastwood films and leaving his typical earlier roles. Director Don Siegel, with whom Eastwood collaborated on several films, was made a year before Eastwood's debut "Play Misty For Me". The alternative title of the film was "Pussy-Footing Down at The Old Plantation", which was fortunately not used, otherwise I am sure that it would be difficult to avoid the difficult jokes that this is happening in the girls' school. I saw this movie in one of my college movie classes in the mid-1970s and it was taken right away with it. I had only an old VHS tape until I recently bought a widescreen DVD that includes a fun, terrible trailer that turns the movie "Peyton Place" into a soap opera and doesn't make any movie horrible. Interesting Notes: Eastwood and Siegel had to fight Universal Pictures to win their original end and win them; and the film was presented as a traditional western part of Eastwood, which is certainly not the case. It is a Gothic story of fraud and horror that has taken place during the Civil War and is based on fluctuations in eroticism and sexual tension. <br /> <br /> I do not put any spoilers in this review, and if you want to see the movie as it should be, be careful when you watch it on the internet, because the spoiler reviews are abundant. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood depicts John McBurney, a Union soldier who strikes the Confederate ground and discovers a young girl from a girls' school. She rescues her and takes her back to school, but instead of reporting her local patrol to her presence, she is being taken to prison, Head, Miss Martha (Geraldine Page), her assistant Edward (Elizabeth Hartman), their black servant Hallie (Mae Mercer) and mostly teenage girls bring him in, heal him and fall under his spell. The film puts its wings and Gothic horrors directly on the headlines, as it shows the true battlefield frame of the war, while Eastwood's voice is quietly heard in the era of the song. <br /> <br /> The opening scene with her little girl who rescues her, determines the tone of her character and the overall tone of the movie. Say more than it would spoil surprises in this first scene. Much more to say about the film itself can destroy anyone who has not seen it ... if you are creepy, gothic, find and rent. Eastwood is great in the film and it is interesting to see him in his early role or in any role where he depicts a character that is usually very unreasonable. <br /> <br /> On Geraldine's page there was a plum role in the film as a director, and I can't imagine yet another actor who played the same role; Pipe Laurie could have long been defeated, but I don't think Laurie could have shown this role in the same way as Geraldine's page. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Hartman (whose wonderful power on "Patch of Blue" as a blind girl who loves Sidney Poiter's character is another point in her short career), at the same time her main, delicate and masterful. Unfortunately, his delicacy was on the film in his real life; he committed suicide at age 45.
