I sometimes wonder if maybe Meryl Streep has become as acceptable as the most impressive, versatile actor, perhaps at the very beginning of an era that maybe her talent is self-evident. There are probably about three themes he uses consistently throughout his performances (most noticeably squeezed lip), but not only that his performances are staggeringly varied, and his internal work is original and fresh. Although "Sophie's Choice" and "A Cry in the Dark" and "Silkwood" may be exemplary, her work here and "Bridges in Madison County" is also remarkable - just thinner. "One real thing," he is mostly sweet and in love with his domesticated life, and Streep does what could be routine, even boring, attractive and charming. I think he has to develop these mini-claims for each character and find out what things make that person real and interesting. He works out of every character and maybe it is the quality that has caused the main criticism of the deviation or self-awareness. I don't think he's cold at all, but instead he has thought of the unique qualities of his character. I think his critics are confusing self-consciousness with intelligence. Not too many other participants would be so complicated and creative that Kate Muldrun would be easy and carefree in his beloved and homely environment to later reveal an unprecedented depth because he is truly connected to this home environment. Her performances are insurmountable with continuity, she rarely does anything wrong. I don't know if it is conceivable that any picture of Streep does not seem to have diminished because of his presence ... Anyway, Kate loves her home and her affection for her "family life" is as tempting as her new conflict at home is jarring. When all this comes to an end, and Kate begins to admit that she can no longer operate with the same power, and breaks the pies and punishes her not being disabled, it is painful to look, because it is not someone's feeling. Streep is smart enough and big enough to recognize how much better everything is, because she has known Kate's dramatic validity and is really the only scene she promises to go for her character. But how refreshingly it is to see a character who can really surprise you by displaying something you wouldn't have thought of. The character of Streep once again has three dimensions ... God, it sounds like a thesis, but as an actor, Streep has only special intelligence, incredible empathy and excellent expression skills. The film itself is probably somewhat mediocre. I think William Hurt is meant to be an unlikely jerk and he does it very well. I think Hurt is really horrible. The script is quite common - another respect for Streep that he was so touching and believable as he was.
