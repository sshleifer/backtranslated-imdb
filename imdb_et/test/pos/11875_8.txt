One night at McCOOL / (2001) *** (four) <br /> <br /> Blake in French: <br /> <br /> According to Harald Zwart, one night in McCool, "this movie is" Dark comedy about women's power in men and how people can perceive different realities. This is the same story that is said to be from three different perspectives, and every time we talk, we try to find out a little more about what actually happened, something nobody really knows. "<br /> <br />" One night in McCool's "is Zwart, an award-winning commercial and music video director who started making short films when he was eight years old. have seen so many examples of how these men think they are making another ad or music on their TV with their production. Zwart is against this trend. Stan Seidel, even if it is somewhat confusing. "One night at McCool's" there are three men who share their experience of a particularly beautiful young woman. Sometimes this movie is an American Beauty comedy, but in others, this world is separate from each other. <br /> <br /> "It all started in one night at McCool's," everyone explains three men to their different listeners. a cousin, Carl Carl (Paul Reiser), who is staying until the closure. Detective Dehling (John Goodman) arrives when the cabin becomes a deadly woman's deadly boy named Jewel (Liv Tyler). Randy is the first to see her, because the individual treats her uncomfortably. She stands for her and before you can say they have sex and they move with her. At first, Randy reluctantly said, "Sex and violence, all one night? It's a bit much." But who could decorate the jewel like Jewel. <br /> <br /> Jewel changes the lives of every three men. For Detective Dehling, he pulls his trouble out of death because his wife died. He makes Carl forget his loving family and a nice small suburban household. For Randy, he illuminates a couple of lights, both positive and negative, and later in the vein to contact bingo players named Burmeister (Michael Douglas) to stop his deceptive ways. <br /> <br /> It is interesting how the film perceives three different chronicles - even the Jewel costume is compared to the story-telling person. Dehling sees Jewel as a beautiful, mesmerizing gift from God. Carl sees Jewel as two sexy legs and a lot of splitting. Randy is not sure what to do about her, waking up on her otherwise boring path somewhere in life. The most intriguing feature of this movie is Jewel itself, but it is always tasted by the pleasant Liv Tyler ("Armageddon"). He's not really interested in men, but what they offer him. His motives are too simple, not honestly evil or evil; she is just a young lady who has learned early that she will get what she wants from her life through her beauty. <br /> <br /> The movie material is very fun. From enthusiastic entertainment, to his violently entertaining showdown, One Night at McCool uses most of his humorous ideas. What makes the movie even more fun is how these three men's viewpoints differ. The actors are also very fun with their characters. Goodman is curious; Reiser fits your kinky, dirty part quite well; Douglas is clever and mysterious in one of the funniest shows in the film; Dillon gives his character an arrogant personality, although Randy is no one; Liv Tyler is dazzling. He injects Jewel with a perfect set of proud charisma and tantalizing spirit. He reminds us of Mena Suvari's intimate performance "American Beauty". <br /> <br /> "One Night at McCool's" is the first movie to be released by Michael Douglas' new production company, Furthur Films. It is a creative, real and sexy production. Along the road, it is often caught in the structure, but it is a natural response to a film that deliberately connects several corners with a single story. The movie ends with a note that is both black and comic. This is another comedy where serious events take place in a humorous way; ie black comedy. Many of the films in this genre are either too black or too incomplete. "One night in McCool's" is one of the few who actually work. <br /> <br />
