I saw it in a special screening of the movie. At first I thought the film would be like a typical movie by Amanda Bynes, but I was wrong. The film is based on Shakespeare's book The Twelth Night. This movie is about girls who play football. Well, when the girls' team is cut off, she has to go a long way to reach the boys' school in another school to get revenge on the egotistic boys' team at her old school. On his way he arrives at a network of long-spawned love, lies and deception. This movie is this year's Mean Girls. I think it shows some great abilities of the participants, and there are very big stars in this movie.
