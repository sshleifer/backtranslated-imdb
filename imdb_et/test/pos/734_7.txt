Don't look in the basement is actually a very smart and well thought out exploitation that creates bad rape because it is cheap and bad behavior. Of course, this is not a masterpiece, but it is a very fun little B movie that has a lot to offer and even a lot of scary scenes that will stay in your head. <br /> <br /> As I said, action could have been much better, but it is, for the most part, that I cannot actually complain. The story is clever and it has some big plot twists that think of you. I thought the gore was too much fun. There's just something great about older gore movies because they didn't have CGI, so they had to set it up. Look at this good time!
