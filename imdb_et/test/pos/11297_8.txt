One of the biggest tragedies is that Disney is so successful in everything they do. If they weren't there, we might have more unique small animation beads like "Mr. Wonderbird's curious adventures". The story is that the evil king has used the throne of the Up-And-Down-Land site (I might have had the wrong name). He hates everyone. His favorite hobby is shooting birds and at some point he probably killed Mr Wonderbird's wife (a bird, played by Peter Ustinov with a typical elegance), leaving him four young chicks. In the meantime, we see that the other hobbies of the evil king are painting. She has made three paintings in particular: self-portrait, sheep painting (she is in love), and sweeping the paint chambers (whom she is jealous of). One night, a shepherd and chimney sweeper climb down from their paintings and run together. The king's own portrait also rises out of its frame and loses a real king (you think I will do it? This is a real plot) and sends the king's police force to the young lovers. Mr. Wonderbird then helps lovers try to escape the king's troops. <br /> <br /> The plot is wonderfully surreal and the Up-and-Down-Land setting is an incredibly imaginable place filled with elevators only lifts. It is the equal mixture of "Metropolis" and "1984" worlds and Dr. Seuss's drawings. <br /> <br /> See it for a very unique viewing experience that doesn't fit most animated standard forms. Features.
