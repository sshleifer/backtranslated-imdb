The transformation of Alfred Hitchcock "Man Who Knew Too Much" is not usually as good as the original, but for me it is one of the best films ever. I prefer it between "Vertigo" and "Rear Glass". <br /> <br /> Like North North Northwest, this is the story of an average man who has inadvertently fallen into the world of international intrigue. James Stewart plays his son's father who has been kidnapped because he's been mistaken for international spy. He does something to ensure that he gets his son back and protects his family. <br /> <br /> Although the original was good by this time, it is difficult to look at today's standards. It is a great product quality, loving Doris Day, and a really horrible frog. <br /> <br /> Don't bother to rent it because you want to see it over and over again.
