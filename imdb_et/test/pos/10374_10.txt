Aunt Cora had always been tactless and her well-bred family ignored the note she made after her brother Richard's funeral: "He was killed, didn't he?" They remembered it the next day when Cora was murdered with a hatchet of murder ... <br /> <br /> For some reason, the POIROT movies are far from faithful to the original. I was disappointed with the changes made in CARDS TABLE - my favorite Poirot book. AFTER FUNCTION, my second favorite is Poirot's book and I was afraid that the story would be destroyed. It wasn't! The film was loyal to the entire motif of the generation, almost for the whole page! All the actors were wonderful, but my favorite has been Monica Dolan, who gives great performance as Miss Gilch, a companion late aunt Cora. Undoubtedly the best Poirot movie that has ever been!
