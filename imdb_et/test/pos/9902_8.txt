"Check out out" is very wisely and honestly imagining the strange family that happens to the Jew. Judaism plays a virtually no role in the film, but the culture and behavior of the Jewish American is thoroughly sent ... it's a loving way. I wish the film dealt with the religious perspective on the subjects being studied, because I think it would have been interesting. <br /> <br /> I've never been a Columbo fan so I'm not familiar with Peter Falk - he's so much fun to watch. It's nice to see Judge Reinhold, Laura San Giacomo and David Paymer - why are they no longer working? They are all fun. The script is terrible with a lot of memorable one-liners, which I definitely use with my family. See Gavin McLeod (Captain Stubing!) As a Door Holder.
