Spoilers Jewish Frodo? Yes, it's Elijah Wood again. <br /> <br /> Since the end of the Lord of the Rings, Elijah Wood as Frodo has found it increasingly difficult to leave this important role. A football hooligan, a psychopath and now a young Jewish American playing Wood has tried a route that he can avoid. Now, "Everything is Illuminated," he can finally achieve it. He plays a role that is not as radical as the other efforts, he really reaches the spirit of his character. However, it is not like Wood alone. Thanks to the great adaptation of the first director Liev Schreiber and the excellent performance of the newcomer Eugene Hutz, Wood has found an excellent production for spreading his wings. "Everything is Illuminated" is a great, moving cinema. Jonathan Safran Foer (young), a young American Jew, puts Ukraine to find a mysterious girl who saved her grandfather and helped her get to America. Upon arriving in the country, Jonathan meets everyone, all dancing Alex (Hutz) and his racist grandfather (Boris Leskin). While traveling across the country, three are slowly learning more about history and relationships that Alex and Jonathan never knew. <br /> <br /> This is a strange feeling when the movie moves to the second chapter (actually divided) into four). The first part, though sometimes a little funny, is usually serious and intense. So, if we are given a brief history of Alex and his family in the second half, it is a strange step to a serious and fun transition. It doesn't work very well, but when the movie progresses, it will definitely learn a lesson, because this combination of humor and sadness will eventually become more subtle. <br /> <br /> The ultimate loan for all people involved will continue, so we're getting more and more involved with the signs. Elijah Wood is great, Boris Leskin is so strong and strong that it raises questions about why Hollywood has never been properly noticed by him. The most remarkable, however, is the newcomer Eugene Hutz. Hutz plays an intense peaceful character. He shows the gap between his relatives and the real world with almost perfect skill, and when his character communicates with Wood, you really connect with him at a deeper level. Without Hutz, this story is so strong that the film is still great, but with it it hits the next level. <br /> <br /> As the director Liev Schreiber is a debut, this story is also a brilliant piece. The passionate work (Schreiber's grandfather as an immigrant to America) really does embrace the content of the content and presenting us with really beautiful landscapes and some great shots, he really does get home. Particularly the last half hour is so beautifully created that the challenge of tears is not the eye of the viewer. It's a moving story, and with Schreiber's help it becomes even more powerful. <br /> <br /> The passionate director is loved, "Everything is Illuminated" is a beautiful piece. The difference in the story of the roads has worked perfectly and has been wonderfully written. This is a movie everyone should see, and it's the perfect way for Elijah Wood to finally Frodo rest.
