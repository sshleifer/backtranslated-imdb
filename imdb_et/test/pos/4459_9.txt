As an experienced fan of Italian thrillers and directors Dario Argento, Mario Bava, Sergio Martino and Aldo Lado, I thought of Lucio Fulc as an overrated cage. I had seen The Beyond, which, in my opinion, is completely overestimated, I found that the New York ripple was just terrible and I didn't like the House of the House in particular. These three films led me to the conclusion that Fulci is the least interesting for these Italian filmmakers. But my stubbornness prevailed and I had to study my movies more. The dead city of life was a movie that I found very interesting, but don't torture the duckling is almost a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Located in a small town in an Italian countryside with a repressive religious community where young boys are killed. The authorities are helpless, who are behind these crimes, especially after their main suspect has been deleted. An enthusiastic young reporter with a pretty slutty girl (who seduces young boys) is exploring and eventually reaching its bottom. <br /> <br /> A great atmosphere with a good story and good pain (not always with the 70s Italian thrillers) Do not inevitably torture a good soldier. The plot is well designed, not easy to understand, and the final conclusion is very satisfactory. Fulci creates a dynamic atmosphere for repression and offenses in a very forgiving and ignorant community, and creates some very strong visual features, especially in a scene where a local citizen kills a woman. Fulci's social comment on religion and innocence is quite nervous and every aspect is well handled. Thinking about your zombie clamps and his ultra-violent New York Ripper, it's amazing how well he balances his criticism with explicit violence and makes it even stronger. So far, I haven't seen any Fulci movie that has been done as professionally as it is. <br /> <br /> Although it is not a traditional giallo movie, the duck has many genre brands. Fulci displays complete control over formatting only when it comes with convincing unconvincing force, but in general it seems to be even better than making mysteries than a full blown epic. Extreme scenes are much more powerful and really packed here. <br /> <br /> So far, torture alone is not Fulci's best film in my opinion. A social commentary with explicit violence scenes and a good mystery burst.
