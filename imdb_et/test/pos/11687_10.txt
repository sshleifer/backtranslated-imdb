One of the greatest advances in the decline of Western civilization, the indie breakthrough of filmmaker Penelope Spheerer's is that he may turn to non-punk fans like hardcore. More importantly, it takes time in history before the movement became a "market value", when the bands play (or at least try to play in some cases) in a cozy and dirty club for an audience with so much self-esteem as they respected the ensembles. For a fan, like me, interviews with some valuable LA punk-scum, some dead, some still live and still work hard. <br /> <br /> Performances and interviews include Circle Jerks, X, Black Flag (before Henry Rollins days), Catholic discipline, Fear, Alice Bag Band and more memorable (in my opinion) are germs. Although I knew some film ensemble and performer (mostly the Jerks and the black flag), I had only heard rumors about the late (late) singer Darby Crashi and the film footage seems to be one of the punk-movement epitoms. He doesn't take himself too seriously, he loves to drink, sometimes when he says it is perfect, and the attitude he brings to the stage is both funny and free. Such a performer is likely to intimidate Steve Miller and Jackson Browne from their skin. <br /> <br /> The decline in Western civilization may not turn on any non-punk fans who are looking for this movie (hard to find from the video)), but it should not necessarily turn them off. Like an anthropologist infiltrated into the feast, Spheer gets the behavior of those people, their motives, pleasures and hate, and the power they had with those on and off the screen. Some of them are almost customary, some are not, but they are offensive only to those who are not too open to things. What's more, the movie is black-what is kids who think they are punk-fans just because they listen to Good Charlotte and Blink-182: if you want to get a real scoop about the movement and genre rock you know love, give pioneers a chance.
