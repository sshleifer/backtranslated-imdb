Gilles Mamouni plays with the audience the story of Max (Vincent Cassel), who was looking for his own lost love (Monica Bellucci). Mamouni uses without warning many sequences of setbacks that the best way to know where we are is to look at the actor's hairstyle. Otherwise, it could be very confusing ... Mamoun still has a strong film debut by Thierry Arbogast (Element 5, Messenger) and Monica Bellucci is expensive to watch ... I felt a little disappointed by the way I gave it out of 10 out of 10.
