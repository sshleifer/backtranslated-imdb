<br /> <br /> There is something to see in the movie from a good old fashioned movie house that adds a huge appeal to every picture. I was fortunate enough to see a couple of Ernst Lubitsch's comedies at the New York Film Forum during their three-week tribute to the legendary director. The double function I participated in was the screening of the eighth spouse of Bluebeard's 1938 Comedy Lubitsch, and the classic way of pre-codes that neither had seen before. Everything I read about Design for Living praised the film, but I did not find a good overview of the eighth woman. Leonard Maltin didn't want to do it. VideoHound also gave a low rating to comedy. The IMDB score was not free. And Pauline Kael (not a big surprise) broke the film during her wretched review. So when I went to the city that day, I only waited a little for the eighth woman of the blue elbow and love Design for Living completely. In the beginning, the blue-haired eighth wife began, as the eccentrics who settled in the cinema sat down and lost their thirtieth music. "Adolph Zukor presents Claudette Colbert and Gary Cooper as Ernst Lubitsch's eighteenth husband," read the title card. Then a picture of a fun scene was opened: Cooper wants to buy a pajamas top, but he doesn't want any part of the north! He gets into jail with a secretary who is looking for help from his senior superiors, and they seem to be the end of the argument. Enter Claudette Colbert, one of the thirty cinema's most beautiful, charming and talented person. "I'll take the bottom," he kindly leaves. And there you probably have the best screw comedies. The film kept my interest great. I always found myself laughing constantly. When Colbert discovers, just before the family's portrait, his groom was married seven times, the whole theater broke into hysterics. If he buys money right after the shock is over, laughs (which have not yet stopped) will intensify. And Edward Everett Horton milked some fun reactions from the script. When Cooper inspires Shakespeare from The Shrew of the Shrew to disciplinate his wife, I couldn't control my laughter when she hit her. And the fun scene with hair strokes is one of Claudette Colbert's funniest comics. The film's greatest comic moment was when Colbert raised the boxer to teach his wife a lesson. With a clean screw ball, he strikes the wrong person, putting his friend David Niven into the cold. He wakes up when Cooper arrives. To overcome this situation, Colbert makes his fist with a strong sexual moment, asks: "Where did this man hit you?" Here? Here at the same time? Here, too? ' and then BAM! knocks it again! The film was wonderful, from the beginning to the end it was a great pleasure. I also loved Design for Living, although I dare say that for the sake of laughing and entertainment alone, Bluebeard's eighth wife was a better and more enjoyable film. The big screen has a vintage movie. In the presence of other laughter, you feel comfortable. This is perhaps why I felt like I was doing a blue-haired eighth woman.
