Starewicz is endlessly inventive and his techniques are still amazing animation fans 70 years later. We may now have a computer-generated technique, but all that it was in 1934 was an imagination that didn't match "no." Whatever he wanted to see on the screen, he created it. <br /> <br /> And he wanted to see really strange things - every conceivable piece of scrap metal is called to service: old shoes, chicken bones, utensils, broken glasses, dolls, monkeys, rats .... there was nothing there would have been without borders. <br /> <br /> A truly frightening, even amazing movie that anyone who has even a passing interest in animation should see. This movie must be seen as believing!
