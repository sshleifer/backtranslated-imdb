This is a decent film. Although it is a bit short for me, it will pack a lot of activities, sharpness, meaninglessness and emotion over time. Matt Dillon and the other main character are doing a great job in this movie. Emotions and intensity were convincing and tense throughout the film. This is not a typical fictional movie from Hollywood CGI, but it was indeed a very satisfying film. My evening was great because of this movie. This film is a traditional traditional film with great performance, story and leadership. I recommend this movie. The development of characters was good and makes you believe that it is actually a real event. Since this film thinks it was made from a cheaper budget, the act and quality were much higher.
