"Plots with a View" is a delightful little comedy in 2002, as only the British can do. The sense of humor in the film is so lightly sick and black and still very cute and sometimes very bright. This is the only film I have ever seen by director Nick Hurran, and although I'm not going to watch my other movies right now (I'm not a big fan of romantic comedies), it's very enjoyable and very funny. The film takes place in a small town in Wales where Betty Rhys-Jones (Brenda Blethyn) is married to a city drunk and adultery (Robert Pugh). Boris (Alfred Molina) is very much in love with his childhood, but has always been too shy to recognize his love. In addition to being desperately in love with Boris, they also have other problems because Frank Featherbed (Christopher Walken), an American mortuary of the eccentric, has opened burial companies in the same city ... The odd, very British wit should like to entertain humor and change the story sometimes pretty odd. Also, "Views with views" profits from great pain. Brenda Bethlyn, who has already proved to be a funny female "Saving Grace" in 2000, plays a leading role and is once again very funny and very loving in her role. Alfred Molina, who plays his shameful admirer, delivers excellent performance as always, and Robert Pugh fits perfectly with Betty's role as a foolish wife. Beautiful Naomi Watts is also a big man's "secretary", I'm becoming a bigger fan of every movie I see her. The greatest role, however, is played by incomparable Christopher Walken (one of my favorite actor). Walken is brilliant because he is always in the role of eccentric Mortician who organizes funerals that are quite unusual. In general, "Plots with a View" is a very fun little British comedy that I highly recommend!
