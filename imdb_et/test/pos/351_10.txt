(Warning: may contain a spoiler) Let Rosalina help Mario to steer and smile because this game will brighten your day. 120 stars need luck and skill, but 60 brings you so much excitement! <br /> <br /> Blasting through the stars shows Mario and Luigi and what travelers they are now! <br /> <br /> Walking upside down has never been more fun, especially the last fight with the Cave near the sun! <br /> <br /> This is really a super awesome game and it's absolutely worth the Nintendo Hall of Fame!
