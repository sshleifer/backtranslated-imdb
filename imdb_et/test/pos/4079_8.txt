A real incident-based, dramatic drama affects a number of ambitious African citizens who decide to temporarily leave their families when they leave the outgoing ship. They think that if they do the trip successfully, they can make their lives better by making enough money in New York to send their families. Unfortunately, the vessel they have selected is a Russian merchant ship that has been downloaded from the ship and has already been penalized in the previous port for passenger ports. The captain and the first spouse have decided not to let it happen again when their jobs are on the line. The Black Group begins its harassing journey in the cargo spaces and is finally discovered, forced and hidden (Sean Pertwee's outstanding power). Some (convincingly scared leader Omar Epps among them) are able to temporarily escape and are caught unawares through the ship when they are caught. All in all, there is a riveting film that has its own nail biting and teeth, wondering how such terrible events could take place in modern civilization.
