Race Against Fear must be one of the most mobile TV movies I've seen for a long time. The main actors were excellent, especially Ariana Richards (Mickey Carlyle), William Bullimer (coach Kurt Ansomi) and Susan Blakely (Margaret Carlyle). Ariana made very emotional performance and facial expression fit. He depicted the emotions that Mickey felt perfectly, and you could easily believe he was really raped, so his power was realistic. <br /> <br /> RAF is an incredibly realistic film that is cast from moving performances. Bullimer came over the perpetrator, and you hated him more and more when the movie moved on. Blakely also made her a violent girl to make her mother (Mickey Carlyle) emotional, and you felt more and more damage to the Carlyle family because no one believed them about rape. <br /> <br /> RAF is a great movie. It is both mobile and tense, because you are constantly confident that Ansom is accused of rape by believing in witnesses, evidence and claim. I strongly recommend seeing this movie.
