What actors and actors in this Columbo episode, next to Peter Falki, are twins Julie Newmar, Jeannette Nolan, Martin Landau. Anyway, the old uncle dies mysteriously and his fianc√© Julie Newmar seems to have discovered a heart attack on the bicycle, which plays a role so tastefully. Jeannette Nolan plays the second woman in the house, the housekeeper, who boasts her talents and chides Columbo's slender and often typical behavior with her pig. Martin Landau plays the same twins in this. Anyone who blames you for murdering your uncle. Well, you just have to look and see the result, but I can assure you that it's always worth it to be cast and a team.
