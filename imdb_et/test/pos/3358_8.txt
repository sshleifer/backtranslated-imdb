Im die hard Dads Army fan and nothing ever changes. I have all the tapes, DVDs and audiobooks, and every time I watch / listen to them, it's completely new. <br /> <br /> Movie. The film is on attacks on certain episodes, human and hour, enemy gates, battle school and many other edges. The introduction of the new general instead of the captain's square was a great step - especially if he did not check the cash (something that is rarely done now). <br /> <br /> This is due to the early years of equipment, uniforms, starting and training. All in all, this is a great movie forever on Sunday afternoon. <br /> <br /> Two drawbacks. One of them is the German's shiny bright accents (coming one, the Germans can't pronounce the letter "W" as we do) and two Liz Frazer casts instead of the familiar Janet Davis. I like Liz in other movies, such as going on, but he doesn't do it right and Janet Davis would have been a better choice.
