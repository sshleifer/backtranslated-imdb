Fulci ... Does this guy ever bring a goriest and strange movie ever? Answer: yes! Cat Brainis, also known as Nightmare Concert, is Fulci's last masterpiece. Yes, that's what some people say about it. There are few facts about why this movie is one of the best Fulci movies. <br /> <br /> Fulci makes this and his movies fun. The roll of this movie is nothing more than Fulci himself, who plays ... also the director of the horror-splatter-gore, who thinks he's slowly crazy. It's full of black humor, which, unlike most of today's horror movies, works here. Being a Fulci flick, you must know that it is a gory. How much? Well pretty much. I always loved the movie in the movies and I never get enough of it, but the true cat of the brain cut off my thirst and believed me, it's hard to archive. Even Braindead didn't stop it. CITB is under discussion. Almost every scene is rotated by Fulci, who after * khmmm * hypnotizing sees evil psychiatrists seeing all kinds of horrors that happen to him or everything he sees. Some scenes are related to the fact that he throws a whiskey at random and sees that he sees a rotten body on the floor that spits on his wounds. Forget beyond or Zombie 2, this is the most important Fulci movie! Now I like how Fulci can apply all these comic parts in the gorefest movie. He's such a great director. Occasionally there are some funny moments and features, such as where Fulci says, "Making Gore movies is such a disease" The end is very good, given that Fulci (and most Italian horrorists) are aware to stop without meaning or Many plot holes. If you're Fulci fun, make sure you've checked it out. If you have a weak stomach, avoid it and repeat "Movie Only" ps. some of the times of this movie: Chainsaw dememberment (full), tongue torn, eyeballs pulled, deer-infected corpses, zombies, decapitations, face placed in boiling water, prick in the shower (head), sore throat body parts and organs roast aside, hammers crushed face ...
