This is a great anime movie. It is well animated, has a good complex plot and very good music. I understand that some may think a little long, but I think it's a good length and animation is a good traditional anime. <br /> <br /> THREE NEEDS: <br /> <br /> How they use Tenka, is masterful. For example, double-display of the body in all these places adds a malicious tone to the film. Tenkai's design is also good, the way she looks like a monk and in the end scene was wearing armor. <br /> <br /> The old man Andou is on earth and has a very nice character. When Jiro meets him, it's a turning point in the movie. <br /> <br /> Satsuma Shinobi, invaded by Sanpei, Tenks clan, rescues Jiros twice. He remains the backdrop for most of the movie, but he's really one of the movie heroes. <br /> <br /> PLOT: The plot is good. It is traditional without being original. The historic time it works is interesting, restoring Meiji. Tenkai wants to hide the shogun restoration when Jiro finds that he is using it to help shogunate forces to overthrow the shogunate. <br /> <br /> Tenkai Tricks Jiro is interesting and kind of "Hamlet" knows it. It is also a sweet irony that if Tenkai did not have Jirot to become a shinob, I do not think he could have killed him at last (Maybe to fight a firearm but not to hand). <br /> <br /> The whole plot of death makes it very dark, but we see some of Jiros' childhood memories lightly. All in all, it's a good, dark, complicated plot. <br /> <br /> MUSIC: An open topic is for example a very good electric guitar and drum. Sometimes they use the drums of this piece that I believe, but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> There are lots of great music. Like what was played while traveling to each shinobi. I believe this name is called "Numatou" and has an incredible flute. The flute may be a pan flute, but probably shakuhachi. <br /> <br /> The final theme of "Kamui no komoriuta" is calm and gentle. The song is beautiful and so is the song in general. <br /> <br /> ANIMATION: <br /> <br /> Animation, though good, is not perfect, and sometimes running blood sometimes appears orange. Transitions are interesting and I think some transitions are very good. One example of a good transition is when Jiro and Any shinobi are working, in the background there is a sunset and music is playing. The transition is simple but effective and it has a nice feeling. <br /> <br /> MY FINAL PROVISIONS: I think the plot, animation, music and characters make it one of the best anime movies I've ever seen.
