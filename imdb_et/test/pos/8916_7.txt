If you are looking for an erotic masterpiece, this is not the case. If you are looking for a comedy masterpiece, this is not the case. If you are looking for something tough, this is not the case. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for beautiful European erotic comedy art from the mid-1970s, this is how I see many people complaining about quality, please understand that it was made in 1974. Yes, women do not match the ideal of modern attractiveness. They are not ugly women, but they do not have the same look that is ideal for our silicone culture. Yes, duplication is not great, but they speak German and anyone who speaks German understands that the word is quite difficult to copy with a 12-syllable. <br /> <br /> Once you have released a DVD before the last release, it will be marketed with two 80-year-old and 90-year-old adult letters. The film is an R-film, so those who complain about hardcore should have understood it, the movie has been edited by the original BUT, but it was also edited before the 1970s. <br /> <br /> For the first time I saw this movie as a young man and, according to some comments, there are many in the same boat who have shown the Cinemax glance. Many people get upset when they don't live their past memories in later life. This is understandable given the attack and nudity packed with modern eroticism. <br /> <br /> If you compare 2069 with a modern soft-hearted erotic comedy, you may be disappointed. The film, but extreme, is actually quite fluid and jokes, but in general innuend and double concepts are still up and can still be collected. Comparing it with hardcore film, it is even more disappointing than the current vision. <br /> <br /> This is still one of the best examples with the European erotic foundation and the other thousands. Comedy Cinema of the 1970s.
