In Russian, I sometimes find it difficult to get a joke about people or celebrities on American television. In addition, the Family Guy is the smartest, the funniest and the politically most illusive exhibition to see on earth. Voting is great and sounds clear enough even for a non-English speaker who understands himself. Animations are also good, perhaps even too good for a TV show. Here we have the equivalent of an adult swimming channel, but nothing is just like that pearl. Not even the Simpsons or South Park. I hope the creators will continue to entertain and entertain us. Don't want to see that the whole thing is mediocre entertainment.
