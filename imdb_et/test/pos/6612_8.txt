I saw this movie at a sub-festival (23, 24 August, 25 August) after my friend said it was a very cool movie about skating history. I couldn't wait for that movie. Was it recorded by a couple of skateboarders who thought they could do a couple of cool tricks, or it was a documentary about skating. <br /> <br /> So I went out after about an hour waiting for my expectations. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a great job to start skateboarding. It started with a zephyr team who was a group of fine surfers. It does not happen in such a nice area to live. At some point, the waves are no longer so well surfed. So they try something else. Skateboard was a fact. <br /> <br /> If you were part of the zephyr team at that time, where are you one of the cool boys / girls. Because many people saw escape from the place where they lived with the zephyr team. So they tried all the new tricks on the skateboard. <br /> <br /> Skateboarding was never popular. There were a couple of competitions and one national competition. The Zephyr team participated in several competitions and also at national level. But what they did on roller skates there was incredible. But the jury was unable to assess them now. So they put the whole skate on the head of the world. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I can tell you the rest of the movie / documentary, but you have to see it with your eyes. Because then you can feel the vibe of this movie. This film got a lot of style for me, so I recognized it 8. <br /> <br /> greetings from gijs and elsewhere in the Netherlands. See you.
