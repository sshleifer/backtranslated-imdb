Colonel Chabert is one of the best adjustments from the novel to the screen I've seen in the movie. It combines the realism of French cinema with an excellent character, from Depardieu's missing Chabert to Fabrice Luchin's proud lawyer Fanny Ardant's complicated widow. The film has a wonderful dimension, as you would expect from a top player, such as Yves Angelo. The characters keep it in motion and although slowly at the beginning, it picks up the pace and is a fine film for the time it reaches the finish line.
