This film exactly shows that the fighting was typical for East Germany. As seen by the secret police, friends and co-workers, most of the East were just there. <br /> <br /> The two families of Strelzyk and Wetzel decided they were not going to take it anymore. Despite the extreme danger of escaping to the West, they feel that the rewards far outweigh the risks. John Hurt and Beau Bridges, who portray the respective heads of the family, were struck by the idea of ​​flying across a strongly reinforced border across East Germany. <br /> <br /> There are tense moments when collecting and sliding the necessary materials for the flight. They work their day and build a balloon at night, under the authority of the authorities, one of whom is Strelzyk's neighbor (Klaus Loewitsch). The first attempt, involving only Strelzyks, ends with failure when the balloon collision is just a few meters from the border. Defended by the balloon-discovering border guards, and a consistent search conspiracy begins, who decide to try again. However, if the sales of the materials are closely monitored, Peter and Guenter will be able to obtain clothes and pieces to build a second balloon to bite their nails. The film also features a warm-hearted and effective sound from Jerry Goldsmith's late.
