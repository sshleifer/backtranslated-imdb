After a lot of frustration, part 3, I was wondering if I should even work with The Next Karate Kid, even though I saw why the saga wouldn't continue, I still enjoyed the second and third karate boy. movies. Although there are some very unreal moments and situations, it was very enjoyable and the story is pleasant and warm. <br /> <br /> Hilary Swank, has this girl been far? She plays a rebel girl who has lost her parents in a car accident and when Miaugi says "babysitter", she notices that she has karate skills. He gives him more lessons than he gets more serious in life. Now, of course, there is a boy who likes him and his central tempters, which are quite similar to the first Karate Kid, but I would recommend it. I think you are pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> 7/10
