This is a great movie in many different ways ... maybe the most important thing is that it introduces a remarkable, tragic story to the western audience about Aung San Suu Kyst and his struggle for freedom and democracy. Wonderful action, proud cinematography, breathtaking action and breakthrough: "Beyond the Rangoon" is everything. I've seen this movie many times over the last ten years and every time it means more to me. Not everyone likes it (hence the relatively low rating IMDb), but that's because it's not the usual Hollywood fool; Rather, it challenges the viewer on multiple levels. I have never watched it without knocking at the end, and I promise to live a more meaningful life.
