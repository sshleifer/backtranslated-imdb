I'm a big fan of big big, loud, tricky, totally foolish movies like Rock, Con Air, etc. FUTURE will tell the story and it will say it well. In both credibility and excitement, and in the mid-term review, it also touched upon a number of important moral issues that really matter. The last picture of the movie is Eastwood and Russo, sitting on the White House, watching the dove for delicate, peaceful music and feeling deeply satisfied. It was because I cared about the characters and I was happy for them that their story was happy. It seemed like a real story. Clint Eastwood is fantastic as an agent of an aging secret service tortured by the fact that he was unable to protect JFK on this fateful day in Dallas. He excellently gives his paranoia and his personal need to stop his opponent. In the second half of the spectrum, John Malkovich is a horrible predator who tortures Eastwood about what happened in 1963, publicly announcing his plan to kill the current president. This Oscar nominated performance really gets under the skin. Throughout the film, Malkovich talks to Eastwood as if they were friends. He does not threaten him, he does not lie to him, he does not laugh at him, but he tortures him with his intolerable friendliness until the last moment. In addition to this fascinating main plot, Rene Russo, another agent and Eastwood, is a charming love story. Despite the age difference, they have a great chemistry for the screen and the manager wisely doesn't let it dominate too much, but keeps it as part of a well-functioning background. All in all, I love this movie because he has a sense.
