If you've seen enough movies, there are very few that don't remember other movies. However, it was traceable as a somewhat disturbing film. I had to turn it off from time to time and return to it later. Like "The Silence of Lambs", it has been looking for a serum killer who has kidnapped someone and has been limited to his horrors, as the "Flatliners" protagonist explores the dream world through an experimental procedure. The surrealism of dream sequences is made by the film when one finds characters in a situation and landscape where literally can happen. And besides its consistency and mindset, there is no need for it, which makes it a filmmaker's dream. <br /> <br /> The only thing that seems a bit out of the way is that ultimately, the redemption of the serum killer or the exorcism of his demons hopes. In fact, you feel sympathy for the little boy inside the man, but clearly the boy's innocence cannot be separated from the man's terrible deeds. Attention is paid, because it must be the salvation of a person to save the victim.
