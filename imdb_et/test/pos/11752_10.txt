I saw this movie for the first time in the mid-60s when I was a teenager, and it moved me so much, in fact, to the final scene where Han Suyin heard Mark's death, and then he rushes incredibly to the mountain where you hear Mark's voice saying: " Give me your hand "and then his picture disappears, a butterfly with his superstitious meaning, music, in love with Han Suyin's emotions, left my heart behind me. I was crying outwards bitterly, my mother and sister looked up and were shocked by my reaction. I just left the room alone. Fortunately, I don't respond like that anymore, but when I always cry at the end. I love everything about movie, mostly music, Han Suyin costumes and location. Jennifer Jones and the beautiful beauty of William Holden were both the best. I have this wonderful movie VHS and DVD. I also have two versions of Arthur Newman's and Sammy Fain's music and lyrics. I also have a book by Han Suiny, "A Lot of Split". I recommend this movie 100%
