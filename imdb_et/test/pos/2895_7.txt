The Rush-in-Rio DVD has long been a delayed release of a concert that is both delightful and disappointing. This sliding two-piece set shows Rush's best. After 30 years of admiration for its unique sound, it is great if it is one of the most talented rock bands ever. <br /> <br /> The concert has over two dozen songs, documentaries and three songs with multiple shows - viewing. Packed with a double sleeve sleeve and a small insert, very good in the amount of material included in the price. <br /> <br /> From the late 1970s to the early 1980s, this DVD comes through a great deal, with half the exhibitions highlighting this era of songs. I don't read songs if you want to be surprised. If you participated in the Vapor Trails, you know what they are playing. <br /> <br /> Rush is the biggest crowd, Rush is a big crowd. In fact, it was one of the first things I noticed that it was special for this show. Throughout this two-hour concert you will hear and see the crowd, actively singing and dancing to the music wildly. In the beginning it is gratifying to see that fans give Rush a well-deserved response. But after several songs I was ready to listen and see more band and less crowd. It is in no way a crowd of Rio. More power for them! This is the criticism of the final editing of the DVD. <br /> <br /> What brings me to the second and main reason "I hate it". Video editing is, I think, terrible. Except for the multi-angle bonus cuts, the whole show's visual chaos is a frenzy. It's like the director wanted to see how spastic he could do it. I constantly count on changing camera angles every one to four seconds! After about three or four songs, my head and eyes were ready for a break. What's too bad, because I would have liked to sit through the show, as I did last year at a concert. Perhaps this quick editing is the latest frenzy for concert DVDs, but I really think it is irritating and reducing the overall experience. As mentioned earlier, I wouldn't want it for a song or two, but the visual side of this album is fast or RUSHed. It's really ironic, because all the previous concerts I've seen from Rush, mostly from Moving Pictures, have been filmed strictly straight. Visually, it's almost boring. This DVD has reached its other extreme. I know that many painted-villa-rush fans do not agree with my claims, but that is just my impression. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: If you're a Rush fan, I'll buy this DVD despite my review or something else. I had still bought it after I had read it. Just can't expect a "normal" concert. Who knows, the above-mentioned things may not disturb you.
