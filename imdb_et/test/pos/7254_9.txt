I adore this movie. The two chiefs of Miller and Carlisle's chemistry are amazing, they spark out so well, creating the unlikely comedy Duo. Alan Cumming is fun, his enthusiasm for the role is obvious when he puts it in the camp. Action is great and it's a really fun and moving movie. Not the biggest movie ever made, I admit it, but it's a huge fun and I would recommend to those who enjoy other sharp British pictures. Includes some of the best British actors, including Michael Gambon, so you can't go far. Pay attention to the profiles of David Walliams and Little Britain and Rock Lucia Mattose: Profile Celebrity.
