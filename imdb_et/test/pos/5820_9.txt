This warm-hearted (Cassavetes) love story delivers two wonderful performances by Gena Rowlands and Seymour Casselli. Rowlands was never more beautiful than a repressed, injured woman of the 30s who met her in Seymour. Cassell is a powder of energy and romantic terms (under his terms). <br /> <br /> <br /> Val Avery has been a great supporter of Zelmo Swift and unusual (as always) Timothy Carey, which is worth the price of admission. Made between spouses and women who are under this influence, this Cass is the most accessible film that should touch everyone's heart (especially the Cassavetes wrestlers) who claim that his films are sometimes too long and embarrassing. I made my own at the beginning of the decade and I didn't see enough people. 8 out of 10.
