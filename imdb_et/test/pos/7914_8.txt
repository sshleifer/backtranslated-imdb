When Patricia Newell is attacked after seeing her cousin's murder, Detective Carrella is looking for a city for her killer. Detecting a killer after an intense manhunt is sent to Patricia to live with her relatives in the country. For Carrella, the case is closed ... "Blood relatives" is a forgotten masterpiece.Donald Sutherland plays a policeman and it is nice to see Donald Pleasance play a small role as a child molester. The conclusion is quite disturbing. All "blood relatives" are more of a mystery than a horror film, so gore fans are disappointed. For fans of outdated mystery films, see 9.
