President Harry S. Truman once said that the only new thing in the world is history that you don't know. <br /> <br /> Seven years before the creation of Richard Rhodes' outstanding Pulitzer Award winning atomic bomb, the BBC drew up a seven-part ministry "Oppenheimer", a typical study for people who designed and built a weapon that came into the atomic era that consistently united science and technology country (and especially the army), not just making history, but making the world forever. <br /> <br /> Production is impeccable, casting is not wonderful, not only the main characters, but also secondary characters bear similarities to imaginary individuals. is Sam Waterston's American physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, a scientific director of the Manhattan Project, who was in Los Alamos, NM, personally selected, research director; Manning Redwood as General Leslie R. Groves, who oversaw the entire Manhattan engineering area (official project) David Suchet as a physicist and the final opposition to Oppenheimer, Edward Teller Forty years later Ronald Reagan whispered in his ear, and brought us a strategic defense project "Star Wars" and Jana Sheldon as Kitty Oppenheimer. Attention to detail is an evenly great part of the whole. <br /> <br /> Part of the thriller, part of the love story - and finally the tragedy, this series will credibly create a chapter in world history - and science - that we dare not forget. Highest recommendation. <br /> <br /> (NOTE: Viewers who enjoy this series can also enjoy Jacob Bronowski's 13-part series "The Ascent of Man" and BBC movie Michael Frayn from "Copenhagen".)
