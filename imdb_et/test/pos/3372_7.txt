The creator of Donnie Darko will bring you the thematic story of the twilight zone in the most bizarre fashion. In 1976, the film focuses on a medieval young couple living on a payroll. One day, the red button will display a mysterious box. Later that day, a spooky gentleman appears and tells them they have the opportunity to press a button and get a million dollars, but someone they don't know will die. This is a disturbing and provocative issue that has been stopped and seized by the trailer and TV shows. But let's know you just don't know what's up to you until you see it. At times, the pretentious and somewhat melodramatic film is ultimately effective because it is a good performance and an interesting subject. It would be unfair to spoil a plot of turnaround for you, but just to say that the film fulfills the aspects you expect, and not to fully fill in what it is about to describe. The film has many obvious insignia and subtitles that are both interesting and annoying, as it was not so obvious that his second feature film, Donnie Darko. There is not too much to say without destroying the movie. it is designed to inspire a lot of cafes after that. However, I would also like to say that it is well photographed and has a well-aged look and is worth watching. Look at it.
