this film has a great chase when you listen to the soundtrack when cars are pushing each other, it seems like it sounds like a soundtrack from a movie table, you hear a 4-speed shift and they show the brake pedal in Roy Schneider's car, it's an automatic brake pedal! that one of the most fun moments of the movie is how bad a man Richard lynch looks at the driver of the car, as he is, like a man with nuts!. ........ the dwarf running in the garage is also the man who on the first rocky film, the rocky boss. good movie! even when the door is ripped, you see the man who just sits in the car, the man who helps him out of the car, like Brady Brady, is he not?
