I also saw this movie at the film festival, but unlike the previous poster I found it as interesting as it was original. In the sea of ​​terrible qualities, shorts are often twice as bad with poor budgets and poorly performing, A.W.O.L is still a tiny little thriller that listens back to "External Borders". The performances are strong, not that Morse or McGinley would expect otherwise, and the performance is sharp and money. I personally find it difficult to reconcile the comments made with the previous poster with the film I saw. A.W.O.L is written by Shane Black, who, as usual, plays with the genre that we respect the stories about the sensitivity of the pulp while trying to reach the audience and never take it too seriously. All in all, A.W.O.L turns out to be a very well done and fun movie.
