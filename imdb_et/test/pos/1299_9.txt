I wasn't going to like this movie and the first 10 minutes did nothing to relieve my fears. It starts with 2 high school gangs attacking each other with a bad kung-fu. The scenario found countless other Korean films. Ho-hum. Add the fact that the story is written by the same man who wrote "He was cool" (which was barely passable) and I thought I was insecure within 2 hours. <br /> <br /> But don't give up so fast! "Romance's" was directed by Tae-gyun Kim, who also made "Volcano High" (which I thought it was fun). Anyway, "Romance's" will soon turn into much better. The high school girl who moved to Seoul finds herself in the middle of two attentive attention. Every man has his own decoration and it is not clear which one (if any) would be the right choice. <br /> <br /> The following is not your usual teenage love triangle. Emotions are complex and although you may not agree with certain choices or actions when a movie evolves, you can definitely understand why these characters are doing it. <br /> <br /> The film presents questions for questions and viewers. Who chooses? At what point in time is it even required to make a choice (and is it unfair if it seems to be being detained)? If you (or your heart) have chosen how you react (and how should you react) when new information comes to light the new situation? The end result is one scene that is very subtle, but perfectly captures what I think is a reaction to real life instead of a general "film reaction". Fineness is in the background of the character. Recent events and revelations have left him confused and emotionally overwhelmed. Basically, he doesn't know what to do about things. Instead of "doing something" or seeing he's hesitant, he just looks at a particular point that can't respond at all or say something. It's like someone just pulled the plug on it. His reaction seemed right to me and I appreciated this scene. <br /> <br /> Like most Korean films, it is a combination of brava, slapstick and melodrama. Korean films often tend to turn suddenly (see "Sex is zero" for an excellent example), which can be totally shocked. Go ahead and start yourself. I like it, love it or hate it, I think most viewers are able to appreciate and appreciate the qualities and reactions of the characters.
