The film career of independent filmmakers, John Cassavetes, is in many ways polarly opposed to people, such as Alfred Hitchcock, the perfect director of the studio. When Hitchcock treated his actors as cattle, Cassavets wanted to work with them in improvisation. When each element of Hitchcock's firing is made immune, Cassavete took less care of how the scene was figuratively shaped than what she knew or emotionally passed on. Hitchcock's stories were always the first stories of the plot, the human element was put on the background. In Cassavetes, the front of the human experience was set in front of each of his films. If something is not logically logical, be it. <br /> <br /> This can be seen even from his first film, the 1959 shadows, filmed with a 16mm handheld camera in a budget of about $ 40,000, in Manhattan with a Cassavetes actor concert company, and talked about as an improvising film. The story is quite simple as it follows the life of three black brothers Manhattanites-Benny (Ben Carruthers) - a trumpet and an account, Hugh (Hugh Hurd) - a washed singer and Lelia (Lelia Goldoni) - a younger sister of both. The three main maps of the film deal with Hugh's failures as a nightclub and his friendship with his leader Rupert (Rupert Crosse); Benny's perambulations around about Manhattan's two no account pals; and Lelia's love - first a white boy Tony (Anthony Ray) who doesn't realize a lightly skinned Lelia race even after his bed; then Davey (Davey Jones), who may be outrageous. <br /> <br /> There's nothing going on in the first arc, except for dark skin. Hugh can crumble how he worsens in low-class nightclubs and girly-opening shows. He dreams of making it big in New York or even Paris, but it can be said that he is a man who continues to mislead his weak skills because, once we hear him, he shows that he is a marginal talent, at best case. The fact that Rupert encourages her gives us a glimpse of how destructive friendships work. But is it the least important of the three arches? Although this film is generally better than saying, Martin Scorses' first film, ten years later, who's knocking at my door? - The second story about an unfortunate romance and disappointed New York, it has no brilliant moments - acting reasonably or cinematically - that this movie is. Nor is it natural because creativity in art is very difficult to achieve, especially in the film, although the 1950s Manhattan's outer surface, on the ground, is a gem that revives. Although Shadows may indeed be an important film in the history of independent film circulation, it is certainly not a big movie. Some of it is preaching, not working well, scenes end, almost like blackout sketches, and sometimes they are in the middle. All in all, this is a very sloppy job - a particularly frightening jazz score that is often not in sync with the rest of the movie, as Cassavets proved to be a good actor at least in his first film. The only reason someone sees Shadows is that Cassavets later got better with better movies and this gives an idea of ​​his later work. <br /> <br /> The National Film Registry has rightly recognized the "cultural importance" of preserving this film. It's all in line with the long-standing credit of the art of Cassavetes, which is characterized by this quote: “I've never seen an explosive helicopter. I have never lost anyone and have somebody headed off. Why should I make films about them? But I've seen people destroy themselves in the smallest way. I've seen people back. I have seen people behind political ideas, behind a sexual revolution, behind fascism, behind hypocrisy, and I've done all these things myself. So I understand them. What we say is so gentle. It is a delicacy. We have problems, terrible problems, but our problems are human problems. The fact that this film is "culturally important" is true, but that truth is not synonymous with its "artistically important" nature. The difference between the two definitions, where great art really flourishes.
