Being a sub-group of post-apocalyptic future films is a stylistic and very intimate contribution. The most noticeable element of the film is its silence; nobody is talking. I don't think Besson, in spite of what is obvious in most of his later work, meant it as a trick in any bay. I think it makes it so smart and so effective that, without any other way of communication, everyone has to read each other on the basis of intuition and transmission of emotions, no matter how small. Although I was not glued to the screen, I see in my reflection that this is a very sensitive and sensitive perspective on human nature. This vehicle is a stylized sci-fi movie. Part of his thinking about the nature of the human world is that every person may not be the perfect person: a hero, a lonely generation in an abandoned new world, taken by an older party who refuses to hold his share of the food exchange between him and the husky, brutal character that Jean Reno plays, and so Reno tries everything he can, mainly with brute force to get what he wants. So, the antagonist is the right, though not a good person, and the protagonist and his sympathetic foil are both wrong, though they are both good people. <br /> <br /> It has been captured with clear and crisp black and white, edited and caught in a de minimis but spry and small-scale approach, and its participants are very real. How can they not be? They, like their characters, are left with empty communication needs. This is one of the few really good films that Luc Besson has written. His earlier work is almost always better than the fluff he now pulls out.
