I liked this movie a lot, but the feeling that I came most was a reminder of how much I enjoyed the novel. The film has two of the best actresses working today - Jessica Lange, who is great here, and divine Jennifer Jason Leigh, who does the best she can when she is thin, as well as surprisingly great Michelle Pfeiffer and lasting Jason Robards. Adjustment is basically faithful to the book, at least as faithful as it can be in an hour and forty minutes. The film does not interfere, except for some scenes between Lange and Pfeiffer, but it does a thoroughly competent job of visualizing this wonderfully tragic story. It was definitely better among novelized films. If this is nothing else, he'll be back to my bookshelves to find Jane Smiley's great novel and great back to King Lear to practice a little character to see how close the parallels are. It is worth your time as a movie, certainly and hopefully enough to remember that reading great literature is also a pleasure.
