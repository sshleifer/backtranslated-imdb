Despite the pans of the reviewers, this film liked. In fact, I liked it better than the interview with Vampire and I liked Lesta (Stuart Townsend) better than the Cruise test. All the major players in the series participated: Talbot, Lestat, Armand, Maharet, Khayman, Pandora, Mael, Marius and one and a half times (although most of them came home). Marius, Lestat and Akasha were the main players (and Jesse of Talamasca). Also, despite other reviews, I think that this film and music were at least as I perceive the depiction and ethos of Anne Rice. Aailiyah was pretty good at Akasha, at times (her first entrance and mini-dance). The film did not hit the width of the book series, but I thought it was a nice addition. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of this series, mainly because of Anne Rice's style, sensitivity and treatment. And I found this film's author's vision loyal and often superb.
