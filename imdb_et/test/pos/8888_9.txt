Black comedy is not always easy to sell. Every time and then you get a black comedy that is very successful, like Fargo. But they usually don't find a big audience. It seems that people put comedy or serious chaos. There is no big market for both good blends. Throw a mommy from the train was a pretty decent hit, but a few people seem to remember a lot about this day and age. Danny DeVito hit it out of the park almost in 1987. DeVito plays a strange mamma boy named Owen, who wants to get rid of his terribly overwhelming and unpleasant mother with whom he still lives. Mother plays with Anne Ramsey, who died right after her release and she's a pretty caricature. He's picky, ugly, rude and sublime. Although Owen seems to be reluctant to take care of herself, she desperately wants her mother. He fantasies about it in some really strange scenes, but he obviously doesn't have the courage to do it himself. There comes Billy Crystal. Crystal plays Larry Donner, Owen's creative writing teacher at a nearby community college. Larry is a paranoid intellectual novelist who claims that his ex-wife stole his novel and made millions. He is currently trying to write a new one, but he can't even get a good first sentence. "Night was ...." Owen listens to Larry's desire that his ex-husband be dead when the school's cafe breaks down. And borrowing the idea from a stranger on the train, Owen decides to travel to Hawaii and murder Larry's former wife. If he seems to have done this, he expects Larry to return to his favor and kill his mother. The resulting action is often quite funny and even amazing. Surely it is never boring and often full of surprises. <br /> <br /> The actor is extraordinary even when Ramsey was up. Crystal is as good as it gets, and DeVito is always underrated as a performer. The film relies on quite a few physical comedies that usually work, often painfully. The film uses some really innovative editing techniques in some scenes and the off-beat tone is really refreshing. I am often critical of the late 1980s as artistic malady and right-lazy filmmaking. Throw mommy on the train takes the opportunity. Both in its character creation and in its general context. How many comedies around the boy, whose mother was murdered? The film is not too long and it is full of laughter. Writers find it more interesting than the public, but almost everyone can still enjoy it. 9 stars out of 10. <br /> <br /> The Hound.
