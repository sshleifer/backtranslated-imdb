Touching Bollywood's epic melodrama about a 10-year-old girl who finds she has been accepted and has decided to find her birth. The great success of the film is P.S. Keerthana, who plays the girl. The first half of the movie is very good. There are also some very good songs, especially the number that introduces the main character. Unfortunately, the other side of the film, which is happening in war-torn Sri Lanka, seems to be a completely different and disappointing film. This is great for explosions and special effects, as Sri Lankan soldiers and rebels fly from grenades that come from fireballs and worshiped by stunt cables. All movies can provide an overview like cheap spreads like: "Someday there will be peace" and "Maybe kids will find a way". The final order in which the daughter and mother are reunited is a good, but so universal music and a well-timed rumor that seems to be deceiving. I know, I know, it's all in the Bollywood style. But this is a story where great moments simply reduce the simple and powerful central story. Bollywood can sometimes be somewhat limited.
