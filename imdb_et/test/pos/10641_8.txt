This is one of the best movies I've ever seen in quiet times (sad to say, I've never seen too much, except Chaplin / Keaton stuff). Very visually brilliant, highly influential in style editing and compilation. Really unique (especially by this time) camera angles and extremely passionate editing. You must definitely watch the movie. <br /> <br /> The downside is that it is a bit too much of your face in politics (I have no problem with politics when they are fine or at least somewhat unknown as a back seat). It is also not an entertainment film that is good, but it is not something I look at a billion times. It's art, simple and simple, like it or not. <br /> <br /> Influence the A + value alone, but on the basis of personal pleasure I give him A-.
