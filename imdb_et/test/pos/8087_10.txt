I just saw this movie in the children's program at the Berlin Film Festival and it just killed me (and almost everyone else)! And this is not the mistake, this movie belongs all the time! Let me tell you that I am in no way involved with the creators of this movie if you believe you read it. No, but it's actually IT! Under no circumstances is the label of the "child's film" labeled "Klatretösen" in almost every account classic (as "biblical")! The story concerns a 12-year-old East (magnet: Julie Zangenberg) who has been destroyed to learn about her father's terminal illness. A special operation in the US would cost 1.5 million and of course no one can afford it. So East and his friends Jonas and Sebastian do what every good boy does - and put the bank in the bank! Sounds skinny? Don't forget: it's not American and "Klatretösen" is by no means a tear-jerking Robin-Williams multiplex-plat-du-jour. Director Fabian Wullenweber put a great budget-comedy on kids and boys, whether he succeeded! Let me say this: This movie tends to be like no child movie and some others did it before. And there is much more than just "action". After about 20 minutes (well given) the expedition speeds up the monster: <br /> <br /> makes "mission impossible" (numerous action sequences are masterfully staged and look really expensive - take it, mummy!) <br /> < br /> - just about every other movie in the dwarves (it's not easy-only-only-kids-antics) <br /> <br /> - it seems easy to laugh enough to make jim carrey look for career opportunities <br /> <br /> - In the same seconds, both the damon and the karate nod nod <br /> <br /> - there will be so much evil humor on the computer side that I hear the American rating board wet my pants over here. they are kids! - Nevermind, look at the last scene!) <br /> <br /> The stars Stafan Pagels Anderson, who has been Mirakel's favorite boy actor in recent years, <br /> <br /> drive!
