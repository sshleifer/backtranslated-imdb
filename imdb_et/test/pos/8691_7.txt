Why Jessie Matthews, one of Britains' top musical stars, was in this movie with her "The Good Companions" sparkling wine and the classic "Evergreen" is a good question? When I first saw it, I was very disappointed. I wanted to sing him and dance - he was billed "Millie - non-stop sort girl", but there were more stops than a variety. <br /> <br /> Now I see it as a good little drama. It's about a bus accident and the stories of people on the bus that bring it to you. <br /> <br /> In addition to Jessie Matthews, who is great as Millie - Sir Ralph Richardson plays his groom (yes, that's right). <br /> <br /> Edmund Gwenn - who went to Hollywood in Lassie films and Natalie Wood's "Miracle on the 34th Street" is a terrible businessman. Gordon Harker is his very annoying partner. <br /> <br /> Emlyn Williams, who wrote "Night Black Fall", was a black postman and Frank Lawton who went to Hollywood and appeared in "David Copperfield" and "The Devil Doll" is a young man in trouble. Sonnie Hale, who was married to Jessie Matthews at that time, played a bus driver.
