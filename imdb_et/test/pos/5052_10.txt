As a Czech, I am very pleased to read these comments here. I'm absolutely sure this movie is great. And what you don't even know is this story specially written by Mr. Brodsk√Ω. The man you see is his and his typical attitude - to live and resist death. He was one of the greatest actors and we are very happy that he has made so many beautiful films during his lifetime. You're lucky if you see at least one of them. Enjoy.
