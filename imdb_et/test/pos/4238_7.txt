This is a 100% improvement in the shape of the third movie and it's one good time. This is John Hughes' film, which corresponds to Devil's Rejects. I really enjoyed this movie and it really stands out as a savior. I thought Jennifer Tilly was really good at Tiffany and Brad Dourif in Chucky's shoe makes this movie really bright again. In fact, they are the only good parts of the movie. I have pretty boring Katherine Heigl and Nick Stable scenes. It would be as if they were thrown into the trajectory and someone who saved the day. But Chucky and Tiffany were great to look at and I liked this black humor. I thought it would make the movie out more. If you want one hell, be sure to check it out. <br /> <br /> 7/10
