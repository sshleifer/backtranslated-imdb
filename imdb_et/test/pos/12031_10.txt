I was a schoolboy watching this movie for the first time. The next day I knew that all the students in our form looked at it and were all fascinated by the film. I think the same situation was in all forms of our school and of the Soviet Union as a whole. Later I watched it every time it was shown on TV and I want to watch more. I do not think comparison with "Back to the Future" or other Sci-Fi movies is appropriate. "Gost'ya iz budushchego" is unique in many ways, if you have followed it, never forget it. <br /> <br /> This movie is full of faith in peaceful science, full of faith in a beautiful future in our world. It is not only a film, but also a forecast of many scientific inventions and achievements. The time shown in the film is the year 1984 (the year of its creation) and the year 2084 (where schoolboy Kolya Gerasimov has traveled for some time and where his friend Alisa Seleznyova was from). The year is 2005, many inventions and achievements predicted in the film have not yet been realized. For example, "Mielophone" (a device that can read animal and human thoughts), expeditions to Venus and Mars (as easy as going to a picnic at the weekend), creating and launching satellites for student homework, easy controlling of flying machines (which completely replaced cars), biorobots "historical identification" of any material or creature that was performed within a few minutes, and many others. In the meantime, they have become more realistic today than in 1984! Just wait 2084 :-) <br /> <br /> The film also depicts typical Russian schoolgirls and schoolgirls (and does it naturally!). With your creativity, curiosity, humor, dreams. See, for example, Fima Korolyov, such a character can be found in almost all schools of the Soviet Union, the same kind was in my form! Alisa Seleznyova ... I myself, but also many of my classmates loved her at first glance! By the way, later he became an actor as an actor - I think he was influenced by the film as much as the people who watched it on TV. <br /> <br /> Beautiful idea, beautiful execution, beautiful actors, beautiful music, beautiful song "Prekrasnoye Daleko" ... "Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful ... <br /> <br /> The last thing I want to say is that there are different remakes and "new" song songs from the movie and even the movie itself was made later and spread on television and on the internet. All of these are not comparable to the original. I shouldn't even comment on them, my comment is only original. , ask the original and enjoy it!
