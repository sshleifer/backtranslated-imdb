As far as I know, I've seen most of Lucio Fulc's movies, except for some of the later ones that are now opening up on DVD, and I have to say that it was his best "pre-zombie" offer. In fact he wins his later films with his hands. It is a story of superstition and suspicion in a small Italian town, located in the middle of the middle, where young boys die mysteriously. It's not a mystery how they died, I guess it's more who does it. Is this a woman who has always been considered a witch by urban people? Is this a young woman who lives in a gorgeous modern house on the outskirts of the city, who was a lot of drugs before? Is it a village idiot who has failed early because it is in the wrong place at the wrong time? You only know when you look and watch because it is a top-notch mystery thriller or I should say it is "giallo". I've seen it before, but it has been a long time and it was still as powerful as it was for the first time. For those who only know Lucio Fulci for their zombie flaps, open their minds to it because it is worth seeing, and while "monsters" are such human, they are just as disgusting as all in their later films. 9 stars out of 10, look at it! Please ....
