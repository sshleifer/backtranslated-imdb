Should we open the shoot as a strange frame ??? I think we have to. Anyway, there are two women behind the roof, they go up from the talent agency and we go with them ... and they never see them again. Okay, how not to click on the piano or elsewhere on the keyboard sound, then watch it inside and over, la Hitchcock ??? So I think Clouzot tells us not very subconsciously that we are following the segment of post-war society: especially how he then uses the citizen Kane = like a story that has been cut to about five pieces to show off the talented women. Agency until his first roses and his Vaudeville debut applause. <br /> <br /> After that, we are relentless observers who are more or less disgusting about the country that has been hit by the war-torn split knees. And no one has ever met a little nasty better than Clouz. It is actually too bad that he never tried Sartre's nausea. Almost everything we see in the first few minutes makes us so tough. .... okay, okay, I'm very serious about living a lot of the film's general feeling. Look carefully, and you will even see one of the police who choose your nose. And how many movies have done it. Then the head-head is a very strong nose blowing in front of the photographer's lesbian and notices that it does not literally mean the eye or raise the eyebrow. <br /> <br /> All this is almost a fever immersion in the side, seemingly until you get the scent of almost every scene and see and feel it. <br /> <br /> As for the other aspects of the film, others here have dealt with them in much more detail than I. But forget the mystery here: it's the ultimate McGuff. Clouzot is about as interested in a real killer as the two women who come in the first few seconds of the film and have never seen it. From the beginning to the end, everything he wanted to do was to follow a lot of people, not even very interesting, and say to look at this woman's twitching, the towing of this man in her pants all the time, years and years before Tina Turner sang, we don't need another hero . <br /> <br /> Even the forced ending has ended in a broken down part of Paris, and rather an empty walled chill. Only couples love each other to see them, as if to say that the whole city must have two or three million like you, working your fingers after a day for a little love at night. <br /> <br This is just a short step towards fear pay and ultimate despair. <br /> <br /> They don't even know how to make such movies anymore in the US. That's why they didn't even know much in France, now less. Gest's relentless detail even makes Italian neorealists look like bad psychologists. I think Clouzot is a kind of Rosselin. Very enjoyable crap, this movie. It seems to me that the only mistake and the other viewer noted that the head of a woman is not in any way right. All others in the movie are almost completely cast.
