What I can say about this movie, which is not a narrative, is one of the most exciting film history ... and based on a real story! Old enough to commemorate the Berlin Wall when it was still in the country, this film gives you a dark overview of the gloomy imprisonment of East Berlin and their desperate efforts to escape, no matter what the price is. The film follows the lives of two families who decide to escape with their own hot air balloon. Whenever they are afraid of arresting authorities, they have to calculate a plan to reach the other side of the wall under the control of their neighbors. An exciting and exciting story of courage and determination that truly respects all those who succeeded and failed in the treacherous journey to West Berlin and freedom.
