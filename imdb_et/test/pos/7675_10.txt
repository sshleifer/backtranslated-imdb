The comments made by others have been very informative and I share their calls for the release of the 1959 film Porgy and Bess. the ones I chose to join. I knew some voices were duplicated, but the album only recognized Robert McFerrini. Recently, my daughter bought a CD from Austria, I guess. Quality is great, so I'm confused about why CBS Records, Inc. is available in Europe if I haven't had luck in local stores. local video stores have got it. Now I know why it has never been available. the music and the story of beauty reached so many of us who would never have had the experience. <br /> <br /> Trudy
