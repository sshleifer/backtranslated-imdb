I loved this movie !!! It was so easy to get into the lives of the characters and really feel the emotions they pass through. /> <br /> The only part I didn't enjoy was a special feature. The comment behind the scenes was a bit behind. Because I saw the movie before the extras, I prefer to think of actors like characters (fools I know), but the actors' personality is very different from their players. However, this is a fantastic, remarkable, brilliant movie that I would recommend to watch this movie and think I should buy it? the answer must be sure yes!
