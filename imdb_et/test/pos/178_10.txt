For the first time I saw this great movie and Alyssa, my star *, playing Frances Ella Fitz, was so big in this movie! It was just so real and his little dog so cute! I saw it for the first time when I was 11 years old and it was the best movie I've ever seen, and you know what? I still think so! 10/10 ********** = the greatest ever!
