My guide to film quality is whether I mean it after leaving the theater. I still think about it the next day, which doesn't happen often. <br /> <br /> Landscape (reasonable calculation of 16th century Italy), costumes, lighting, cinematography are all excellent. This is a beautiful film visually. <br /> <br /> The characters will never rise above the script, but these actors used their material the best, which is great. This is one of Shakespeare's best exhibitions that people are still driving for 400 years. All the principals were interesting and enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Those who say it is anti-Semitic must be deaf and blind. If this is something, it is anti-venitia-16. century catholic. Although Shylock plays a man controlled and tortured by his suffering, it is clear that the society in which he lives is largely guilty. The script clearly sheds its own personal responsibility to where it belongs. <br /> <br /> Great movie.
