Mute Witness is a modest but very confident thriller that has never received the attention or good comments it deserves. Movie? wrote and leads completely by Anthony Waller? is a tight, thrilling thriller with black comedy and horror effects. There is no pointless mumbo-jumbo or endless plot - just straight to the point of mystery. Mute Witness is engaged in the "snuff" vicious circle and in Russia. *** SPOILERS *** Because production costs are cheaper there, the US film crew temporarily moves to Russia to make a horror film. The location of the movie is the old hangar. The team's make-up artist accidentally gets overnight and tries to find a way out, but witnesses the recordings of an authentic snuff movie! She's caught and trying to escape, but because she's silenced, she can't look for help and she can't explain what the police did. The lives of girls are now in serious danger because they have a hidden network behind their snuff and they don't want witnesses to be alive? *** Final spoilers ***. Mute Witness contains many very outgoing activities and is quite bloody. Some clues of mystery are kept efficient until the end. On a similar subject, I would say that it is certainly better than the most famous "8 mm", directed by Joel Schumacher and starring Nicolas Cage. Mute Witness is not great, but the leading actor (who is Russia himself) seems really cute. Sir Alec Guinness also has a special look. And very cool, one can say. It is definitely advisable to ensure fun and scary.
