I heard this movie for the first time a friend. She loved it and always looked at it. When he told me about it and how old it was, I decided right away that I wouldn't want it. I was so wrong. Dirty Dancing was such an amazing movie! I love music and dancing. I bought a soundtrack and a DVD right after that. Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Gray were great at this. They hit both feelings and feelings so well. They were so good dancers. After watching the movie, I wanted to dance to them and I hope to take dance and Latin dance soon. I've become a fan of this dance, and I'm all about movies and programs. Dirty Dancing showed my passion for dancing and music. Movie favorites are when Baby goes to Worker's headquarters and sees them dancing and probably the last scene where Baby and Johnny are dancing with everyone. I believe everyone should look at Dirty Dancing at least once in their lifetime. If they don't, their loss is !!
