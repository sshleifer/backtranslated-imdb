At the beginning, a huge fan of hip-hop and turntablism, I always knew I wanted this movie. But I wasn't ready for just how good the documentary is. It covers almost all the important aspects of the only hip-hop element that has been there since the very beginning. "Story" begins in the early 70s and follows the development of turntablism as art from the beginning of the year 2000 (turntablism aficionads make it important). <br /> <br /> Editing is an almost perfect movie at all times. In addition to the superb visual "scratch" techniques they used, the quick cut between the interviews and the film material is very good, giving the film speed if needed. Sound editing is also very good, some nice sounds are used to help transitions. <br /> <br /> There was also a lack of narrator. We do not take this story by hand, and as a result, the audience is able to make their own assumptions more easily. Each DJ adds a story to the other side and is so interesting to hear about the hip-hop unknown stars, especially those who were kidnapped by the hip hop left, right and center. > <br /> Although there are many great things about this movie, I have some hands. The biggest one is the lack of several remarkable DJs, such as Ca $ hMoney and Jazzy Jeff, as well as DJs outside America, such as Scratch Perverts and DJ Noise. However, if you watch a DVD (which I highly recommend) with a commentary, the producer and the director will thoroughly review how they regret not being able to present these features. Deleted scenes contain many interviews with Ca $ hMoney, Jazzy Jeff and Scratch Perverts. <br /> <br /> This is definitely the best documentary I've seen in hip-hop culture and music. It does not stop showing the real potential of turntablis; that's why I recommend reviewing the DMC and ITF videos. However, it is small. I recommend this movie, especially for the phat soundtrack, with great music. (9/10)
