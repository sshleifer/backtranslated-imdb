More than more fun than all gay orgy "300". More heartbreaking than the tragedy of Shakespeare. More poetic than even the most melodious poem about lost love and bla bla bla. And beyond that, what's the biggest trash ever made. <br /> <br /> Black comedy, which is testing the boundaries of human feelings, is the story of John Waters' cult film "Pink Flamingos", a conflict between two families, ending in humiliation, death and, of course, eating feces of dogs (yes, it is not actually downgrading). No, it is not impossible love, in the 90's there is no Rome or Julia. This film talks about prestige when it could be called. Fighting for a title - Filthiest man in life. <br /> <br /> On one side, we have a divine (played by a regular costume) ... a caring daughter, a good mother, a cannibal, a murderer, a perverted and the owner of that title. She loves her son a little too much. Crackers themselves sport the sexual attractiveness of both chickens and young ladies sometimes mixing them with threesomes. The family friend and loyal associate Cotton gets their satisfaction while watching the Crackers for some of their actions related to these earlier objects. Last but not least, the divine mother and grandmother to Crackers, Edie. 400,000 pounds of woman, sleeping, eating and living in a nursery. He's addicted to eggs and loves an egg-man (a man who brings eggs ... lol). <br /> <br /> Four of them live peacefully in a caravan outside the city until they become a Marbles target. Exhibitionists, manipulators, scammers, really bad people actually. Their main source of income is the kidnapping and impregnation of young women. For the impregnating part, they use their reliable and loyal cloaked butler for sperm delivery. After that, they sell to the highest bidder of the born child. <br /> <br /> It was Marble's envy to the divine and his title, leading to the inevitable confrontation between the two families. Epic Battle for Slag, Perversion and Violence. <br /> <br /> Pink Flamingos is an unbeatable masterpiece in the trash movie genre. Stunned by strange and strange actions, John Waters' film is enthusiastic and hated by the traditional, critics and the medium. But for those few who do not lose these generalizations, Flamingo is an unforgettable experience. Funny and sick, violent and poetic. It's really a bad taste
