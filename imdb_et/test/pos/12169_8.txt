Trio is a pleasant, nostalgic journey to this first desire - when it was still unknown - before we "grew up" and added HIV status, emotional luggage, and gotta-my-my complexity to the -pager-just-go-off emotional mix. <br /> <br /> The image you are depicting is a pure adolescent, but it sounds in all three tracks. Their sweetness and positivity give you a good feeling that you are gay. And such movies are little and far away. <br /> <br /> Good news! Both Boys Life and Boys Life 2 are now easily accessible from DVD since September 1999.
