This film is an impressionistic, poetic experience of immigrant experience, a reflection of instability and fear that may be associated with emigration. These are aspects that are often overlooked in America, especially in the countries of films on emigration, and more generally in any country, and the film represents a lively and convincing nervousness and enthusiasm when ignorance, poor, illiterate Sicilian immigrants are waiting for their emigration. United States. <br /> <br /> They have some fantastic, unrealistic thoughts from the United States that are being distributed on the go. One of them is that the rivers run with milk, which represents a poetic, impressionistic effect in the film. The film is not sound and silence seems to reflect the inconvenience of ignorance that local people have about American life or, if not ignorant, a vision that is stained with superstition and fantasy. <br /> <br /> This means that the film is a thunderstorm reality, a boat trip to the United States, and a consumption process that came to Ellis Iceland. Boating is intended to be quite boring, which certainly was a big part of the time. The quarters where the incoming inhabitants are sleeping are depicted as extremely crowded beds that are four or five inches apart from each other, and which do not have much light, which was definitely on the deck below. <br /> <br /> Once again, the movie is not overcrowded or too brightly lit, and the result is a relatively realistic idea of ​​what he really liked to emigrate to the United States. Villagers may not be the worlds, but they are quite reasonable, and communication with immigrant parents, Fortunata (Aurora Quattrocchi) and immigration officials, who require solid results, is quite abundant because they are not diluted or softened to the syrupy conclusion and see Sicilian realism as widespread rules that drive life in the United States. <br /> <br /> Immigrants and their stories are very interesting, and cold-faced realism and the magical fantasy of human imagination make a convincing vision of Sicilian or other human beliefs who have little formal education in the United States. Similarly, barebone works; it is not at all demonstrative or apparent but seems more realistic for it. This means that all the main speakers, especially Salvatore Mancuso (Vincenzo Amato), who is the clear leader of the group, are excellent. Though she does not smile, her character activities are much louder and it is clear that (fortunately) other group members, her two sons and the aforementioned parent Fortunata, the boys' grandmother, believe in their leadership and respect their clear leadership. Amato absorbs her character very intelligently and fairly, and this is a testimony to her abilities that her character seems so capable and self-confident, while her character makes very little emotion. <br /> <br /> A strange side of the movie is the opportunity to meet a mysterious English woman (excellent and appropriately mysterious Charlotte Gainsbourg) who speaks Italian and does not know why she is going to the United States or otherwise she is unanimous Sicilian emigrants group. Finally, it finally becomes apparent, and revelation usually takes place realistically and does not seem particularly melodramatic or exemplary. The film is directed by Emmanuel Criales, who is confident of the realistic, sometimes superstitious, worldview of his characters living and presenting competently and confidently. In fact, it is fantastic to see how difficult and realistic the superstition has combined in the film. This is a worthwhile study of immigrants' experience.
