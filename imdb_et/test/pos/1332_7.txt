Soderbergh is a fabulous director, but nothing he could win could not have been the astonishing lie he had for his descendants. It is clear that he knew this get-go. The term "star-vehicle" has traditionally been used to refer to a film built with one star. What this film does is the entire Hollywood hotfile and makes them brighter even before the brighter. The last scene says everything - all the stars that sit when nothing happens and nothing is said. We just see them socializing as if they were a scene of a reality show where George Clooney, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, and Don Cheadle were just hanging themselves. So the story is not at all important - at least where the greatest enjoyment of movies comes. If you want a smart heroic movie, you need to be better off 11. But if the stars look at you, it will make your day.
