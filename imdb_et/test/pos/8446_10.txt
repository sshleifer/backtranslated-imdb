>>>> By: msgreen-1 from Canada >>>> The big problem was the "Chinese Syndrome" claim - that if a reactor error occurred and radioactive waste leaked, it could burn its way directly through the land to China. Many people have made it fun, and if the filmmakers meant it seriously, then yes. The spill would not change to the middle of the ground or even to the molten rock. Even if it had come to the center of the Earth, how would it come out of China? It should flow against gravity the rest of the way! China is not the opposite of the world, the Indian Ocean is. <<<<< ......... ......... ........... ............. ... ............. ..................... ................ .. .............. ............ ...... .......... <br /> <br /> This point is highlighted by the film's characters, saying that, of course, it could not happen because the core hits groundwater and releases the radio - an active cloud that falls on the population. <br /> <br /> Before you find a weak spot in a movie, you must first look at it !! Don't frighten the book by its title ...
