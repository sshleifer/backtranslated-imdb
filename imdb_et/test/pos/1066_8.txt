Forget Jimmy Stewart by reviving your life and choosing this smart comedy. I think only institutionalized sexism explains why this flick and another great Christmas song "Meet John Doe" is not respected with the same level of love as ... well, you know its name. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck plays McCall-type clothes that have lied to his pompous publisher for many years about his crowded environment. She is ace b.s. an artist until the day when the Morgan sailors were pulled out of the ocean after 18 days and 6 weeks of recovery in a naval hospital. The film released in the last year of the Second World War is finely grounded with patriotic gestures and nostalgia for holidays, but never pushes to sentimentality. Stanwyck is sexy and dirty, as always and meets his hunky Morgan, with whom it is at first sight. Unfortunately, he has to play with a Gardin prissy architect who has actually been looking for his hand for years at his farm CT to just cheat his boss. <br /> <br /> S.Z. Sakall adds a great deal of Hungarian malaprop and double humor to humor, as Babs' true source of culinary talent and Una O'Connor are fun as Gardiner's terrible Irish housekeeper.
