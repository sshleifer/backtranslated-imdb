Andreas arrives at a strange, inhuman place where everything seems perfect. She has done a good job, everyone is good for her and everyone, and she doesn't lose too much even when she finds a beautiful girlfriend. But in this unnamed city, Andreas will soon find that the perfect world of goods is not really a paradise. Really one of the best films I saw this year. The attractive plot is supported by a perfectly smart direction, where each single component (cold-saturated photography, cold symmetrical design, unemployed, slow, highly-guided camera movement) helps create a unique strange atmosphere that keeps the audience complete. Sarastical, ironic, bitter comedy that made me laugh and think, because only the best movies are capable of doing. Nothing new, probably in the analysis of the modern de-humanizer civilization, but a really smart job that has some surprising ideas that you hardly forget from whom you could see it. Just a beautiful amazing scene on the subway underground.
