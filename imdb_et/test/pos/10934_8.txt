At first sight, this film seems to be a fairy tale of a beautiful and significantly white horse that was never forgotten. Although the story is strictly viewed in context, the idea of ​​surviving in the post-civil war in America was to be a horse, not an old horse, but really great. And the Eagle wing is such a horse. But to make a person worthy of such a horse is another thing. Who should own it? Native American or AWOL soldier? The story of the whole digs against the civilization of primitivism. As other commentators have said, it is ironic that the English language director felt this fact and then developed this simple theme westward, like someone else you probably see again. The film is mainly about the wild harshness and living people of this beast and nature. Photography and soundtrack are subtle. Martin Sheen's presentation is a revelation. This film, published in the same year as Sheen's second great force, like Willard 'Apocalypse Now', hints at his abilities that never were given such a free race. More damage. Comparison of these two readings raises their surprising similarities - at least so that both films map a person's journey to his soul to find redemption. When Willard is redeemed, I leave the viewer to decide if Pike is finally. The end is a fabulous word in the real sense and very mobile; not warned. This is an extraordinary film.
