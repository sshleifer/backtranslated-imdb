Great Combination: - Chabati Humor - Uderzo / Goscinny World and Characters - The Limited Presence of Christian Clavier <br /> <br /> The Original Comic was a great one - one of the best of the general series, and Alain Chabat, one of the most famous French group Les Nuls, was the funniest member. filming, multiplying and supplementing the great work done by goscinny and uderzo, wisely applying the story, giving Djamel Debouze his best role (finally a bit far from his usual playable part), collecting a number of great actors (Gerard darmon is wonderful, as often, Chabat himself is great Cesar). <br /> <br /> In addition to being committed to Christian Clavier with Asterix, Chabat tuned his role in the movie, giving Darmon and Debouze the emphasis ... which is always a good idea! <br /> <br /> => Great environment, great scenario, great director, great actors, great humor, beautiful Cleopatra ... This movie would have deserved 10 if Clavier hadn't been a bee involved.
