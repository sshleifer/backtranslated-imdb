I enjoyed it briefly, even as a fan of Toronto Maple Leaf. <br /> <br /> Director Sheldon Cohen and narrator Roch Carrier excelled in all the boy's emotions. He felt that he was Maurice "Rocket" Richard for his hero, that he was excited, waiting and hoping to get a new Montreal Canadian sweater soon, to see his face horror when he got his sweater from his mother; The Toronto Maple Leaf Sweater was invaluable and a shame that he had to wear this terrifying (in his eyes) blue and white Toronto Maple Leaf; Not Montreal's Canadiens rouge, bleu, and blanc, with Richard's number 9 as his old sweater. And worst of all, her mother made her out of the house of the Maple Leaf Sweater. You could imagine and foresee the ridiculousness that he would get from his friends when he hit this sweater before he got there. <br /> <br /> I laughed all the time and this is one of the best animated shorts I have seen. <br /> <br />
