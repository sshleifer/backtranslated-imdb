It's nice to see a film that marks children whose idea of ​​"adult" is not sensuality. Instead, these children see a problem in their community and are responsible for solving it. Hoot is a movie directed specifically at families looking for a fun day in the cinema. Production values ​​are good, especially in Montana and Florida sprawling images. Jimmy Buffet's soundtrack is perfect. Young actors are moody and refreshing. <br /> <br /> A plot involving children working together to save some of the owls from the death of a careless empire builder will involve the kids. So many movies make children inexplicable, it's nice to see a movie that shows that the kids are working hard. And while the parents are missing or temporarily disturbed, it was pleasant to see the children who want to follow their parents and try to correct the right injustice. <br /> <br /> If you're tired of all the self-conscious story squares for kids who fill the cinema, give Hoot a picture. Then take the time to talk to your children about other adventure adventures and care for the world they live in. Positive film positive message.
