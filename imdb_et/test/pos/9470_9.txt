He's the Man was all I wanted it to be and maybe even a little more. I love teen type "chick flick" movies and I knew it would be great !! Like the 10 things I hate you (one of my all-time faves), He is a Man, a unique, well-written, well-performed comedy with some of the funniest lines and physical comedy I've seen for a long time. This is probably the most funny movie I saw this year (except for a fun pink panther.) But he is a man who is actually more intellectual funny and most humor is based on funny manuscripts, erroneous identities for mixed "three companies" and mixed messages and cast. . <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes is the star !! Even since the days of terrible combos (but at the strange amanda show "Amanda" she has shown a brilliant talent for comedy. She is probably one of the most talented comedies. Her style is physical comedy, impersonations and a witty dialect. Previously her big-screen debut (where she was a star) was quite fun and well done "What a girl wants." If it weren't for her to break if she's a man taking care of this hand, it's really a neighbor's ultimate girl, it's a shame she's not doing a bigger screen job because she might be next "this" girl, she is all american, cute, on earth, bubble free (although she is now twenty years old) and is able to wear her talents and style to watch an adult actor, but with this movie in mind she is perfect! he embodies his twin brother and makes it credible. Not completely ... but credible enough. Most scripts are based on his mistakes comedy trying to be man, but it's just fun, not stop laughing. Channing Tatum redeems his unfortunate performance in 2005 with "Havoc" playing Duke. He is a jock, a captain of a football team, and finally an object of Bynes's affection, unfortunately he is also Sebastian's spouse (who is Bynes.) He is a good leader and chemistry is ideal between them. Laura Ramsey is Olivia, who happens to Sebastian (who is Bynes again.) She's also doing good, though her role is small and she doesn't really influence otherwise or otherwise. James Kirk is very small in his actual Sebastian role. His resemblance to Amanda Bynes is surprising ... they are absolutely believable as twins, and even further afield how far you realize that someone believes Bynes is Sebastian. The rest of the cast is all right there and their roles range from short to support, but essentially they support all the story between Bynes and Tatum, but everyone supports more or less Bynes' terrible performance. He wears a movie just without hesitation and makes it worth it. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films that shows so much trailer and not yet one of those movies that is no longer funny when it comes out. The parts of the trailer that make you laugh are even more fun in the real movie. The relative newcomer director Andy Fickman is doing this incredible job on this film. He knits a potentially complex story and makes it naturally flowing and doing everything together. A story based loosely on the twelfth evening of Shakespeare, but it is remarkable how much they managed to translate this modern film. It is seemingly completely wall-mounted, but more classical comedy than you think. On the negative side, there is not too much to say, except that the last half-hour drags a little and becomes predictable, but it does not change the fun of the first half of the movie. Nonetheless, you are laughing at tears and this is one of the funniest movies in the theater right now! 9/10
