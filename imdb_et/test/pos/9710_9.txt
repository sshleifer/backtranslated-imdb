Yes, yes. Bam yelled a few times and so did Englund. And probably you too. The whole cast is back in action and Knoxville has stepped up to become the gang leader in the confused slowdowns (I mean in the best possible way). I thought first of all that Bam or Steve-O were the main guys .... quick, the main man is Johnny. Don't get me wrong, everybody, and I think everything is great on this flick! Immediately as you go, laugh and believe me, don't plan to rest your smile. Personally, I think the film will definitely have better moments than the first. You know, when you go to the theater, and you don't want great expectations ..... well, this film blows all your expectations. If you love Jackass, you can go with it with huge expectations. No matter what you laugh your ass. If you don't laugh, the reason is probably someone who has a weapon on your face that tells you whether you're laughing you die or maybe you're laughing at sound or most likely you're eating Jack Sh! for breakfast and Jack left the city. All I have to say is to prepare myself for the painful face after the movie. :)
