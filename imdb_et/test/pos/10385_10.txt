looks like I have ever seen. not too intelligent perception, but so sensitive to sensitivity. Antonion is relatively smart for his film. Malkovich is so organic, the roles are so real, the situations are so real. I've changed my world view after this movie. I'm a novice writer in Russia - Tolstoy and Dostoevsky - and I'm pretty sure Antonioni is a good and fun russkies because I and we understand his position. so I don't understand her less betrayal of IMDb. I am sure that when talking about Russia and our people, Antonion likes our romantic soul and the positive feeling of the surrounding reality
