Let me start by saying that the original "Lonesome Dove" fan is no more than I. Both Pulitzer's award-winning book and the higher-class mini series are moving, dramatic, plausible, and binding in my experience. There is no comparison between "Lonesome Dove" and western films - at least not after John Ford and John Wayne's legendary collaboration. I had the real reservations that I was sitting on this new mini-series to look at McMurtry's non-participation and missing original cast members. After watching the first episode, it was clear that it was not "Loneome Dove". In almost every measurable way, this sequel remains at its original level. But what? I didn't expect to measure it. In order to embrace this film, this film is interesting, entertaining and of excellent quality. If this was done as a continuation of the new story, not "Lonesome Dove", I think there is no doubt that it would not have received so many negative ratings. Jon Voight did a decent job, Barbara Hershey was a great Clara, and new characters like Gideon Walker and Agostina Vega were well rendered and credible. Louis Gossett jr. it is worth mentioning as a horse Isom Pickett. The film made me look after the characters and I didn't ask more than an actor. it is unfortunate that this worthy effort lies in the shadow of its predecessor - it is worth its own right.
