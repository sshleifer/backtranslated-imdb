Muppet Movie <br /> <br /> Director <br /> <br /> James Frawley <br /> <br /> Kermit Frog and friends are reviving stories and stories about how they all came together. /> <br /> The Muppets star in her first feature film, bringing the magic they are known to get a bigger picture. The story is not too complicated and is written as a pre-form. Well-written jokes appear because each character gets an introductory value. The images are not simply thrown away, but are written in interesting letters, making one of the many peaks of our furry friends.
