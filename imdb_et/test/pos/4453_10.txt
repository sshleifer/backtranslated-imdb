Lucio Fulci, a cultural rider, is probably the most famous of the terrible Zombie clips dating back to the 1980s, which earned him a legitimate reputation as "the godfather of Gore". However, Fulc's absolute greatest film dates back to 1972, and although it is definitely sharp and violent, it's not nearly as big as many of his films. "Non Si Sevizia And Paperino", by. The 1972 "Torture" is not only Fulc's greatest film, but this brilliant and completely brilliant Giallo is one of the absolute highlight of the genre. Stunning atmosphere and an agonizing relationship, a great Sizilian environment, an intriguing story of brilliant performances or intense shocks - I don't know what this brilliant Giallo!

Exhibition shows are the best of the Italian Horror Cinema. Tomas Milian (one of my personal favorite actors) is in the lead as Andrea Martinelli, a journalist investigating criminals. Sexy Barbara Bouchet offers both eye-candy and excellent results. Equally prominent performances are Irene Papas and Florinda Bolkan, who are absolutely brilliant in their role. The great score of Riz Ortolan greatly enhances the tension and atmosphere, and the film is fantastically captured in exciting Sicilian landscapes. Although this film is not as sparse as many other Fulci films, it is certainly a violent and uncompromising film with some shockingly cruel scenes. <br /> <br /> "Don't torture a duckling" has all the brilliant horror. It's not quite as easy as most other Fulci cinemas, but I assure you that searching is worth it. All Horror fans have taken my personal favorite, and I recommend not leaving the true lover of the movie at all. Masterpiece!
