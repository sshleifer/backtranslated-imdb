I really wanted to write the title of this review, which didn't come as a brilliant or painstaking one, but still described its feeling. I can see now that this is not possible. "American Family" is one of the best shows I've ever had to watch television. Several IMDb visitors have mentioned the word "beautiful" when describing this exhibition. The word has never been more suitable. The cinematography of this exhibition is stunning. Each scene and shot look like a masterpiece. Lighting, camera movements, scene composition and colors ... I have to remind you that I watch TV shows, not a masterpiece of moving picture. Lee Holdridge and Nathan Wang's score brings tears to my eyes. And most importantly, the whole amazing actor's act is honest and sincere. I don't feel like I'm watching shows ... I feel like I'm watching real life. If this beautiful is only real life. <br /> <br /> The "American Family" has indeed raised the television's high-quality entertainment bar. I recommend this exhibition to anyone who is ready to watch it. I could simply drag CBS to pass this exhibition, but I have to say that it is not important to me who encourages it. I'm just happy to see everything there. So thank you to PBS for not losing anything at this show. <br /> <br /> I have to pay special tribute to the end of each season. The first one was pure creative shine and it led me to tears. I was waiting to see if the second season would end in a creative way and would it be enough. Again, tears. <br /> <br /> Thank you to all the people involved. You have really made this exhibition a special art and I mean it sincerely. It is a shame that we only have two seasons, but the miracle we got at all.
