The dragon runner is undoubtedly one of the most amazing books I've recently read. I could expect the movie very much, but the movie was good, the whole device seemed realistic. nothing was done fancy. dialogues were not very attractive or powerful, they were right. The film was not a bad experience at all, especially in the last 15 minutes where it became truly emotional and even the most difficult man would probably cry. seeing a movie. but generally a good movie to see for those who are not readers. but readers - a novel would be a better experience, so if you ever want to see a movie, read this novel and then compare it to the movie.
