The cast is perfectly chosen and balanced. This cinema is great. The music is admirable because all Burt Bacharach's music is and fits the plot line. Making a musical version of the Hilton story is a welcome change from transformation. We see experienced actors who add real depth to the emotional content and importance of each scene. I cannot agree with the critics who ignored this glowing pearl of the film. This is the treasure of the silver screen! Find it when you can - and let your charm lead you to everyday worries, inspiring you to find your "lost horizon".
