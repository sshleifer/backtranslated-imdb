Although this film looks like Crime Thriller Noir, the plot is actually a bit simplified and with very little surprise debts or revolutions - and those that appear are not exactly shockers. <br /> <br /> You slip out of the "Intense Thriller" mode and "Frenzy Entertainment", this is a really fun movie with several fun moments. Most of them may be due to a spiritual dialogue between Alan Rickman and the characters of Emma Thompson, but it said Sadie said that everything was in her open-minded visit to Friedman, and it remained very little to develop anything between the two characters. I did not find the respected version of British actresses from the southern accents that were bad (Ok, Thompson sounded like she was marbling in her mouth when she spoke to the south, but Rickman was surprisingly good, very few minors were the usual English accent) - if you want to emphasize accents, then discuss this about Coco - he spoke only southernly periodically! <br /> <br />
