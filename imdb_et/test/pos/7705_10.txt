"Dope Sick Love" is a truly remarkable documentary made for HBO about two pairs of heroin addicts who travel on the streets of NYC. I managed to catch it by accident one night and found it completely enchanting. There is no narrative and we never see interviews on topics, the camera follows them just like a third eye, completely open. The people you follow don't even know they're filmed! (or at least they don't care). The film is amazingly sincere. Some of the most sincere I've ever seen. It's as real as it gets. Nuts and bolts he wants to be on the street and depends on heroin. We look at these scores, shoot, fill, fill, and even embody people into the police to rob people, and about a million other tiny details that less attentive documentary makers would leave. <br /> <br /> Some movie footage is really terrible. Like looking at one of the men who immediately sought the correction, he lost. I found that I pray that he would find it so that his affliction would end temporarily. And if he finds it, the man literally dances on the street. <br /> <br /> The cyclic nature of the drug addiction becomes very clear when you watch it. ALL is to get the next score for these people, but the next result seems to be barely worthwhile. <br /> <br /> I would like to get a copy of it if anyone knows where it is available. Highly recommended if you can catch it on HBO.
