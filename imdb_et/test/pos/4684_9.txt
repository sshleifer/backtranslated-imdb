Over the past few months, I have seen many comments on Italian work, many of which are negative. The essence of almost all of these pessimistic critics is that, with all of their modernist and high-budget technology, the film does not have much substance when it counts. Look, people, it's just a fun movie. This is a picture where you should sit, relax and just enjoy the constant motion of the movie. Like Ocean's Eleven (2001), at the same time, you can focus on the characters and the plot without having to think much (for some people happy). "Ocean" is a better movie, but who cares? The plot may have some holes (there is a huge amount of about 3/4 mileage), the operation may not be as free of charge as the trailers were outlined, and some dialogue may seem pointless and cheesy, but again who really cares? Cool Characters, Mini Coopers, Big Explosions, Charlize Theron. What more do you want? I think it's time to give up the fake Roger Ebert will meet Gene Shalit and enjoy yourself once! Oh, and one more thing you do does not compare it to the original, because to repeat what Mr Gary Gray has told the press a million times is NOT NOTING! My advice - if you are interested in your way through a good humorous, more fun flick, don't even bother working with Italian work. But if you don't have a severe inferiority complex and / or want to see Ed Norton reaches a bunch of Ukrainians, go ahead. The bottom line, my companions, is: lighten up and have fun, fuck.
