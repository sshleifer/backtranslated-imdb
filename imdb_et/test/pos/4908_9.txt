Directed by Michael Curtiz, four girls are about four musically talented sisters, their spouses and their father, a minor conductor. Playing Sardony, Fast Talking Mickey Borden is John Garfield in the role that made him a quick star. Rain, such as Adam Lemp and Lane's sisters, Lola, Rosemary, and Priscilla, and Gale Page are his spiritual daughters. Its final scene takes place in Lemps' living room. Borden, his hanging cigarette, plays one of his compositions. Ann Lemp from Priscilla Lane tells her that the piece is beautiful. But he says, "It stinks." He continues: "There is no beginning or end, but in the middle." Ann calls her to start and end the animal. Borden replies, "What is it? Fate is against me. They threw the coin heads that I am poor, tails I am rich. But they threw a two-headed coin." The audience loved the way Garfield said in a harsh voice of the city that it smelled. This scene created Garfield's screen staff forever. Four daughters are Americana's slice with Garfield, with powerful performance, offering more than a hint of darkness. <br /> <br />
