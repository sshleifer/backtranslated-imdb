Another good animation about Disney. Postcards are not always so large and tend to follow the same plot as the original. But Tram's son is trying to get home and family what he knows and learns where he really belongs. Being a junkyard dog is not for everyone, er dog it is, but Scamp goes beyond adversity. The voices of the various characters were excellent and were offered by a number of well-known actors such as Scott Wolf, Alyssa Milano and Mickey Rooney. An entertaining and well-made family film.
