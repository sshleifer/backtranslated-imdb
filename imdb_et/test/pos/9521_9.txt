Starting with "My Name is Joe" as a Scene for Alcoholics Anonymous BM Career Mad Fidelity Infidelity, Double Standards and Secret Things. but what do you expect from a family of lawyers? <br /> <br /> A really funny movie with some of the most annoying characters because Birdcage, the plot and the sub-block are interwoven with the surreal scenes (ever) of the decadent life of Paris in the men's toilets, where the bride's grandmother and her robbed girlfriend smoke and shining blue jokes? No, I either!) Leading almost to the end of Arcadia's insignia. <br /> <br /> Great.
