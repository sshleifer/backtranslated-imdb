The cartoon is really a well done 6-hour drama about drugs (about 1987). At the same time, he speaks of three readings on how opium is grown in Northeast Pakistan, how drugs are being smuggled from Pakistan to Europe and, finally, how people depend on drugs for drugs. All three stories are actually spoken and empathy. You will see that the characters live enough to understand how ordinary people can breastfeed a life that is truly immoral. <br /> <br /> These are not card tiles, the opium grower is trying to feed his family in a dry area filled with weapons and other opium growers. The drug smuggler is rich in German, without heart, but his wife (one of the three main characters) is just an ordinary woman who has to choose her life "in the old way" or give up. Finally, the role of the prime minister is the most difficult, because he has to deal with the emotional destruction caused by his daughter. He slips into the world of drug addiction and steals, carries bad health, emotionally attacks his parent companies, so that he can continue to satisfy his desire for heroin that destroys his life. /> Traffi is one of the best dramas I've ever seen on television. The scenes of this exhibition will stay with you for a long, long time. Highly recommended. - Colin Glassey
