The first part of the film frightened me of hell and usually I am not easy to scare, but the other side of this thriller didn't work quite well, but still very scary! A good thriller to use simple ways to make a good horror. Low budget set in Russia, unknown cast and made in Europe. but still very fun, and yes, there are some laughs on good things too!
