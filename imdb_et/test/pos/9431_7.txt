Not too bad entry into the series that is heavily blended with war propaganda, but Rathbone & Bruce sincerity keeps me happy. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty fantastic story from start to finish, how much McGuffin is there? Holmes (and Moriarty independently) pulled out dancers that were so uncoded, was Amazing Watson - so why aren't you surprised! The bomb-sight / magnifier explanation post reminded me, it was just such a cheap trick that Universal played - reminding me again that they don't expect people to be critical of it for over 60 years. It (and I think every other universe potboiler in that period) was supposed to be one or two times viewed and forgotten. Perhaps they should have realized that in principle people do not change, that what was entertaining for ordinary people in 1942 still attracts the selected group (2005) and tightens the script and set! <br /> <br /> Lionel Atwill went through his Hollywood rape trial around this time, I don't know if it was or was a particularly effective make-up that made him look like haggardina or Moriarty? <br /> <br /> It is important that SW is the first Holmes movie by Roy William Neill, I think he led all the rest and produces everything except one, thus creating a wonderful surrounding continuity.
