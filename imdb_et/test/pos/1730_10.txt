I looked at all the doctors who had episodes that my local PBS station was playing (got a doctor through John Pertwee), as well as a doctor's "camera copies" that sent US colleagues to the United States to their US counterparts. I had a great time to show, but it never seemed serious - I mean as seriously as a science fiction show for about one passenger. I went to CONs, a costume language (doctor # 5,6 and Tegan were my costumes), I loved it. then it all stopped suddenly. the program policy and lack of interest and funding changed the doctor who was 25 years old, an antiquity that had invaded the ethos. <br /> <br /> When I heard the sci-fi channel was received by a new doctor, it was my first thought, "Yes, now my 11-year-old son sees what I've been banging over these years and I know what the hell about TARDIS "(I have several phone boxes and different size TARDIS in the house) do not expect story, character development and f / xi. I have to say the least satisfied. for the first time i found a doctor who was not a worshiper, clown, fop, traveler, pussy or jerk. Christopher Eccleston is by far the most trusted doctor. can't get me wrong, I loved almost every doctor and his church, but Christopher gave the doctor something he never had before - a true word of credibility. I'm just sad he decided against the second season. I'm trying David Tennant like me, but now the bar has risen ... <br /> <br /> Bad wolf rules !!!!! <br /> <br /> 2008 update - I love David Tennant! his "mod" persona is something my generation remembers, my son's generation can deal with and fashion gestapo can relax! he is a bit more human than Christopher, but not like other former doctors. i miss rose, i dig marthat and what did they mean donna noble!?!? it is still the best on TVs
