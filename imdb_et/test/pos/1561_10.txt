story. This is a reality that is mixed with Americana and very original. <br /> <br /> Emily Grace is a young girl who is tired of her boring life, working in New England on a minimum wage. His slippery bosses say he's giving up and taking some money from the registry. Driving from New Hampshire to Miami, Florida is not a short trip and his Ford Escort is dying out. He then meets with a satisfying senior couple depicted by Judith Ivey and Bill Raymond. They have RV and kindly offer to help her - it's not safe for girls to be alone on the road. Especially I-95. <br /> <br /> Emily Grace is very realistic than Alice, and initially, Judith Ivey lets her character help; buy your decent clothes, cosmetics, etc. First of all, Alice has a pleasant holiday, hoping to connect with her girlfriend who attends the University of Miami. There is an interesting cinematography, as the trio travels to RV in Florida: the rest stops, relaxing landscapes, and finally the North Carolina mountains. <br /> <br /> Finally, something is terrible, and Ivey's character has probably made stories about his daughter, as well as his wife, who now seems a little embarrassed. <br /> <br /> I will not break the result of this movie, but it will end positively when the audience is waiting for a relationship - this movie reminded me a little about Spielberg's "Duel" - although it wasn't so dangerous at first - the story of morality is - you don't know Never what people think - especially when you travel across borders. Beware! You enjoy this movie.
