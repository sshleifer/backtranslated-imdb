I saw this movie with my girlfriends and we all loved it! This is such a lovely and heartfelt warm, real tear-jerker! I was still thinking about the day after seeing the movie. This is such a beautiful story about the difficult things that all families are going through. I really recommend this movie to anyone looking for a Saturday night. With your girlfriend, your family, your boyfriend, everyone will enjoy it! : D This is a true story of a real family that would draw into every heart. Not to mention the beautiful scenery and fantastic action. Look at this, I'm sure you love it as much as I did!
