How many of us have read or played the book, and when the movie version came out, were we terribly disappointed? Well, maybe it would be one of those movies for those who played it, but if someone who could not see it on the stage, I was extremely entertained by this film. The characters were funny, the music was great and the story was interesting and made you feel real empathy with characters, mistakes and everyone. Jonathan Silverman has such a good comic timing and his lines are especially fun. I'm not going to give a spoiler, it's just a nicely done, funny movie that shows the inner workings of a middle-class family during World War II. So if you never see this game and if you have had other Neil Simon movies, they should not be held back by a couple of negative comments. Brighton Beach Memories is a great film of its own. I guarantee it (no money back).
