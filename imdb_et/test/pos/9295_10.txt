No matter which country you have to buy this exhibition, you are sure it is Australia and if you ever saw our comedy attempts, they will suck, but if they are not boring then they will not be bored forty-year-old men doing bad punch. a team of people who talk about current affairs (pretty much in Australia), joke our crap ads, joke our politicians and so on. <br /> <br /> The boys were also called Cnnnn in 2002, which was not as successful as the war that only began this year, so all they say is the current news that is really good, no matter what how boring or tragic it is when they try to show things humorous light.
