this movie was great! I absolutely loved it! wesley snipes was great for this role - and I'm sure the blade 2 would be just as good. <br /> <br /> Blade is still one of my favorite / horror movies! and if you haven't seen it yet, and like vampires and blood (all these things), you should really rent it because I assure you that you love it!
