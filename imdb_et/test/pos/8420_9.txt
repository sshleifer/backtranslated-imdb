He tried to film this movie in DD, reflecting the channels ... And thanks for the sky, even when it just started. After studying Pune, this film touched on a lot of joyful memories of the city ... besides whether it admires movies, it doesn't ... Every character is so etched - grandfather, child, doc ... except the social worker who engraves then, the rest of the film has almost no mistake ... is it worth the entry of the Oscars even if it is not set ... surely it leaves the throat of the stranger ... who drives u needing urination? And guess this movie needed Sachin Tendulkar to distribute it. Despite being in Marath, there was hardly a moment when I couldn't watch the movie. Subtitles were good. Must watch every good movie fan.
