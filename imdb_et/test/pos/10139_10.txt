Spoilers !!! To understand what really happened first, you must be a warrior, stay alive in real war, think off-line, analytically, critically, and not linearly. Otherwise, you will find the wrong conclusions that Maj.Gray was a stupid or unstable person. The truth is something completely different. He was a solid tempered veteran and the only way Captain O'Malley killed him was to kill him. It was his way out. He chooses it. He was not the man who retires. If you've never been on the first line, you can't understand it. He deliberately prepares suicide. First, he seduced Mary Jane, when she deliberately acted as a fool, as staged claims - foreclosure to witnesses (to protect her later after she did what she wanted it to happen when she met) when she gave her son balls ( make sure he can load his weapon later), came that night, loaded his gun, woke him up, put his weapon in hand, acted when he attacked him, first shot his knife and shouted "One killing" shot him again, and before he died, he dropped the knife as he tried to take him back after the first shot. He also gave him the message of his last cry. "After the first killing, everything in your mind changes and destroys your life, this is the only way I die as a human being, but someone who I love is my choice and my only privilege, war and army is not what you have so far He finally grew up and saved his life until you could do it. He left the military life. He understood him. And he didn't die in vain. The man who helped him to prepare all this and then to conduct the trial and the outcome of this trial was Colonel Sam Doran's wife, Tim Macy, did not know what was going on and what it was, but he did what he was supposed to do. He took photos of Mary Jane and Maj.Gray Colonel Sam Doran, who gave this order because Maj.Gray asked him to do this after he refused to leave the military (what Col. Doran asked him to do), Colonel Doran persuaded the prosecutor that he was accused of being murdered instead (he knew he could not be found) p Col.Doran also inhibits an interruption of an argument to block the prosecutor's doubts about deliberate murder charges, but let him expose it during a trial that was heavily influenced by the jury. I have no doubt about the outcome of this trial. Why did Colonel Doran do that? Because he does something MajGGray ask him to do it. Why? Because he saved his life on the battlefield. Why does Mary Jane decide to go to court? Because he was a person with honesty, principles. And that's why Maj.Gray chooses. It must be nobody deserves, someone respectable. Keeping the secret about the evening that really happened has also proved his honor. <br /> <br /> Miroslav
