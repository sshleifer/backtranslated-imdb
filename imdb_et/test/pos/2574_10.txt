If you want to see nudity, sex, drugs, alcohol, brutally beating and rape of a movie, this film will satisfy you. If you want to see a man with a vengeance for his wife's treasure, this film is it. You've already heard the wonderful music that keeps the raw emotions going. Surprisingly, the story of violence, action, and music can bring a moment of silence without a pedantic speech that changes the film. Look for the final scene that is unexpected proof of wounded healing. Perhaps we know why we are experiencing abundant profane, learning that love can be located above the back of the heart. Follow the rhythm to which love is sacred for the gravity to be pumped.
