Not all, but most of this story, Buster is mistakenly "Dead Shot Dan", a notorious criminal. <br /> <br /> There is really no story but adventures to show Buster's physical talents that are amazing and his comic timing. The 27-minute movie is basically one adventure after another, mostly involving someone who drives our hero. Roberts, the potty policeman - and father, Buster, is interested - who's pursuing him. These last scenes were the best I thought, with lots of smart gags that included a hotel lift where Big Joe and his daughter lived. It was Keaton at his best. <br /> <br /> It's just crazy for half an hour, which makes little sense but cares? It's Buster at its best or near, so it serves its purpose: to attract us. Think: 85 years after the movie, there are people (like me) who discover and enjoy these quiet comedy classics! Cool!
