In these modern times (as a topic well known to the director of a short film, which is what the German counts?), Politically correct films are the "leitmotiv" of contemporary young filmmakers. "Shoulder Arms", directed by Herr Charlie Chaplin during World War I (the film only appeared a few weeks before the truce), is a clear example of why early-stage pioneers were certainly bold people! It was a tricky thing to lead a terrifying, bloody, inspired, humorous film inspired by the First World War that only a few leaders who had dangerous and bold ideas could be allowed? for such a delicate company and for its success, only geniuses were reserved. <br /> <br /> Since this German number said "Shoulder Arms" was made during World War I, at a time when the whole world certainly lost its innocence (fortunately, this German aristocrat is not greasy?) and it's fun, inventive social satire for this and every war. The film is full of great gags and entertaining film continuity for a story where this tramp lives with risky and bold adventures, a hero to allies? By that time, German soldiers were mustache and longer beards, not to mention that Kaiser does not have many medals in his uniform?) For battleships, unhealthy attacks, frontal attacks and ghosts (how do you dare!)? and the delicate way is even the miracle of the film, which is impossible to overcome. In view of these terrible situations of war, the difficult task is only possible thanks to great creativity and talent. Apparently Herr Charlie was a lot of Chaplin. <br /> <br /> And now, if you promise me, I have to temporarily take my vacation because this German Count must go to Schlos's ditches. <br /> <br /> Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/
