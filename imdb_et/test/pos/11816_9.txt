Although this movie is 11 years old, I rented it yesterday and found that it is really a movie. The story of true friendship with a very real monster is inspiration and quite touching. <br /> <br /> Although I don't care much about the language used by young actors, especially Renfro - I understand that art imitates life. Renfro is again making a massive and harsh, very (and I mean) distracted workforce (his role in the customer is remembered) and Mazzello is doing a wonderful job, somewhat peculiar, Dexter - a child who understands that his life must end too soon. <br /> <br /> Although there are so many touching and funny moments in the movie, I have to say that my favorite was when the boys were in a pony-abandoned church and Dexter (Mazzello) chopped himself by saying that his blood was poison . Although it is very inventive and somewhat amusing to see an adult man running away from two small children, this is one of the most difficult scenes in the film. <br /> <br /> Be sure to check it out, but prepare with your Kleenex - you need it!
