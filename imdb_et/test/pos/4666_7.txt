* SPOILER ALERT !! DO NOT READ HOW TO MOVIE! * <br /> <br /> I was originally planning to see this movie last weekend, but my plans changed my time to see it. So I and my friend made a plan to see me at school today. Boy, are we happy. The film begins in Italy, where a group of boys are planned (Charlie Croker [Mark Whalberg], Steve Frezell [Edward Norton], Lyle, also known as "Napster" [Seth Green, get the nickname later], Handsome Rob [Jason Statham], left ear [Mos Deaf] and John Bridger [Donald Sutherland] are planning to steal 32 gold bricks. This will lead to an opening that is good for 10 to 15 minutes and includes a boat ride that opens the movie to the right. Steve Frezell enters the group when he gets away, steals gold and kills John Bridger, who is the head of the group (retired). A year later, when Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron), John's daughter, is one of the most important safety traps anyone can ask. Charlie Croker (who was actually indirectly responsible for his father's death, as he called him to retire) says that they have found Steve (who has been hidden) and want to get him back what he did. First, he refuses, but later agrees, and teams back together, getting help from a mechanic wrench (Franky G) to bring the perfect spirit while creating one of the biggest traffic jams in Los Angeles history. This movie is the perfect combination of action with funny bits. It's going to be joking about Seth Green's character, Lyle, creating Napster, and how Shawn Fanning (who makes the furnace) stole it when he was high, and finally Lyle only responds when he is called "Napster." Seti's movie even has a funny line that goes "He said in an interview he called Napster because he described his hair as it was diapers. He called it because I * was hungry when he stole it!" The start and end sequences are pure genius, and everything that is in between is perfect. The only negative thing I can think of with the film is that Edward Norton's behavior was a bit weak. He wasn't big, tough bad man. He acted as he was paid and just made an empty minimum (which is a fact because he was forced to make the film due to a contractual obligation). But even if this is the only real grip on the movie, the movie is still very enjoyable and I definitely recommend that you see it. And even if you're not interested in the actual movie, look at Seth Green's shine in comedy. He's perfect. Rating: **** out *****
