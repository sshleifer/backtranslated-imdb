Just before Dawn, the slasher movie appeared on golden days. The backgrounds began to start with a lot of movies like Friday 13th, The Burning and Madman. Just before dawn is a step forward from the normal backbone slip. Cinematography is great. Action is the upper limit. The movie heroine is not your typical "final girl". <br /> <br /> Constance is a "forest girl", but if she stays the original instinct of survival, she is a step forward. Only when it comes to saving her and her boy's life, is the original concept of survival included. Here is a subtle transition that gradually focuses on girls' hidden sexuality, which coincides with her will to live. Just before Dawn is not for everyone, but for a sloher fan it is as perfect as you can. The killer (s) are very threatening - almost like a game to fight and murder all who cross their territory. The end of the scene is a bit outward. For the first time the viewer may be a little shocking. I recommend it to someone who is a fan of backwoods. Even unsatisfactory fans will find something so pleasant. The setting is terrible and makes you calm. Death hounds are not very harsh, but I'm not sure the film needs gore. Look at this!
