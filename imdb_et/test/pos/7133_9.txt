I'm a new game, but I would have started much earlier than this movie was! I got it last year at Gen Conni (a trip that was only made for my husband) and loved it! Even for the non-player, as I was, it is funny and accessible - so much so that I finally finished and started to sit down with my husband's playgroup. <br /> <br /> I don't want to give out all the details of the plot, but if you are a player you have to see the movie - and if you don't, you have a good time regardless of yourself. Certainly there are jokes "in", but most of the movie is available to everyone. <br /> <br /> My only complaints: I want it to be longer and would like it to be available on DVD. Maybe soon?
