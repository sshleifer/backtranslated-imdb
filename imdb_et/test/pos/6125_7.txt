Babs Johnson (divine) lives in the trailer of his son Cracker, his daughter Cotton and his mother Edie (Edie Massey). He competes with a pair called Connie and Raymond Marbles (Mink Stole, David Lochary) to call him the most difficult life. The film shows their attempts to cross each other. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for everyone. It is your face that it does not hinder bad taste. Crackers have sex with a living chicken wife as her sister watches; marbles take female hackers, impregnate them, keep them in the basement cellar and sell children to lesbian couples; Divine and family have a party that includes cannibalism, etc. It is disgusting, but in some way it is unobtrusive. It is so up and so unapologic that it is exciting. As Director John Waters can say, this is a bad taste. It's also interesting to see - the actor is so sad (especially by Massey) that you just look at it incredibly. A friend laughed loudly about how bad Massey was (she recovered in later pictures). <br /> <br /> It's not for people who are easily offended. Even if it's over 30 years old, STILL is shocking. But if you have an open mind and you can take a lot of extreme behavior, it's black. The only part that was really too much is what the Divine does at the end.
