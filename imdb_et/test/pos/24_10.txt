"Sir" has played Lear more than 200 times, but today he does not remember his opening lines. Sitting at the mirror, his eyes reflect the king's madness. Her dress puts her gently, fingering words. There's the air of both men's despair.High actor who knew his powers, slips away, his tourist center big domo cum conscience cum surrogate wife - aware of his boss's madness and knowing he's impossible to do more than just his passing. "The Dresser" is really a love story between the two. Over the years, they are interdependent to a degree that does not represent the future without the other. During World War II, it is honestly about the success of the secondary tours of Shakespeare, which consists of an equal number of "babies" and "wannabs" led by the theater, a knight of what could be called "old school". No matter what part he plays, he grabs the middle and relaxes his legs, tempting his audience. But somewhere inside, he was buried deeper than most of the time, eats out regularly, still shining. It is an attempt to get a glimpse of the hopeful hope of its viewers. Mr.Finney is very cleverly focused on ham, often on a caricature, and just when you are ready to burst your work just as a hyperbole, he creates a subtle fineness and vulnerability that makes you realize that a great actor plays a great actor. The same is true of Mr T.Courtenay. It is easy to write about your imagination of Norman's stereotyping exercise. Here we have a middle-aged ephemina, not a camp theater teacher who lives his life, enjoying "The Girls" and loving the insider's rumor "The Theater". . There were - and I have been very suspicious - many men just like Norman Profession. Finally, kind and patient, knowing more than many actors play, they lead upside down with wisdom and affection. I believe that the overwhelming majority of them will begin to laugh with a laugh at Mr Courtenay's portrait. I saw "Dresser" in London, where Mr Courtenay "Norman" was more restrained than the film in the wisdom he was watching. "Sir" was played by a large audience, Mr Freddie Jones. was a memorable performance that overshadowed Mr Courtenay, reducing him to "run" rather than acting as an actor in billing. The idea that "Sir" and "Norman" may be incomplete, immediately went out of the window. "Norman" was his doll, which I am not sure what Ronald Harwood intended, but made it a breathtaking theater. Mr. Finney and Courtenay improve the balance of the movie by restoring equality with the relationship. Both men have come from the British New Wave for a long time when they became insecure on the left, "middle class and shame" of the gold. When the British cinema practically put Hari in the letter in the 1970s, they quietly focused on the theater except for some roles to keep the wolf out of the door. With the renaissance of the most important films, they appeared again, blinking with the unfamiliar bright light. <br /> <br /> Dresser celebrated his return, still energetic and talented, shouting to the world "We're Still Here". It's not a big movie, it's definitely great.
