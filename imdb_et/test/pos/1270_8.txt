Christopher Nolan's first film is a black-and-white film that is not on the budget for an unemployed person who starts after strangers, which in turn leads to robbery and also violence. It's very good. <br /> <br /> Like his later movie "Memento", he doesn't play the story linearly. Instead, it jumps somewhat, so you end up wonders, trying to put it all together and take pictures early, probably at random, as the movie progresses. This style also means that the twists are much more effective. <br /> <br /> Be sure to see if you have the opportunity (especially if you like her later work and / or movie Noir)
