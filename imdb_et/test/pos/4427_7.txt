Video Vault Author: Shawn K. Inlow <br /> <br /> Architect: Boy's Journey 2003 - Nathaniel Kahn No rating: 116minutes Vault Rating: 7 <br /> <br /> What's up with fathers. "My Architect: The Way of the Son" is followed by Philadelphia filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn as he desperately searches for answers from his father, a renowned architect Louis I. Kahn, who has died for 30 years. <br /> <br /> Louis Kahn died at the train station in 1974 and missed more than one family. The funeral service, when the filmmaker was just a boy, was, say, an unpleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> We find that Nathaniel knew only about her father's passing, her random visits with her mother, with whom we are told she loved her deeply. This film is about a shop who is looking for his father and perhaps his own job, as if the excellent structures were secret. Definitely Louis Kahn was a talented architect, but the "architect" is a cold word. The man was a sculptor on a large scale, who spoke about his craft in airy silence and art. <br /> <br /> Among his outstanding works, lovingly explored in the film, the Salk Institute (1965), the Kimball Art Museum (1972) and the monumental capitol complex in Bangladesh (1983). The part of the film where Nathaniel first visits Dhaka, Bangladesh, finds a job, but not a man. and a professor at the University of Yale and the University of Pennsylvania. Many of Khan's modern and co-workers are also helping the filmmaker to form a clergyman. <br /> <br /> Despite this, the viewer does not seem to be particularly satisfying. The answers Nathaniel Khan seeks are hollow. Not good enough. <br /> <br /> In scenes where the director meets his half-sisters, both from different mothers, he can experience years of tension, strokes and pain. It can be assumed that they will get into anger, but only the camera will save them from hostile action. Each of these children has obviously lost something. <br /> <br /> It can be pointed out that Khan, who seemed to be driven by perfectionist, never became rich. Instead, he became remarkable. Just as he would sacrifice his family for his art. It's embarrassingly sad and a big deal. <br /> <br /> April 28, 2005
