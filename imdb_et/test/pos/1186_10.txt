It would not have been able to get out of the worse - as if the country entered Reagan's years, the boom boom in the 80's, no regret, would not worry. It wasn't word of mouth and it opened badly. The studio threw it. But hair is probably the best music - under the leadership of Forman and the Tharpe choreographer, this is an amazingly beautiful, well-functioning and well-written triumph that few people remember. Casting is perfect, the musical number is unforgettable, and even the decline of the end does not diminish the terrible spirit of the film. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie, you haven't seen the best musical. Seriously.
