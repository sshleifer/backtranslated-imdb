Everyone has the right to an opinion. The only critic who counts is himself. I think it's a great movie. Much better than the original. <br /> <br /> "Caddyshack" is Rodney Dangerfield funny but unpleasant. He was asked to make a sequel, but things went on. Jackie Mason shows that "less is more". He's a funny, but real family man, rounded up. It's not a drama, it's a movie that makes you feel. In fact, at some points, Jackie Mason is sorry, especially when his daughter leaves her. <br /> <br /> It has a good soundtrack and generally good damage. Good completion of the series. <br /> <br /> In Alf, television, Alf says he called "Terms of Use". Spouse Kate Tanner, played by Anne Schedeen, also says she called "Caddyshack 2".
