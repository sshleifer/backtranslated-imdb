As I expected, too many reviews of this film (from both professionals and amateurs) have focused as much as no more on the ideology of the film. This is because the sea (aka Mar adentro) is a film of euthanasia. Specifically, it is a true story of the infamous Galicia, Ramón Sampedro, who fought for several years for the right to commit suicide denied by the Spanish Constitutional Court, and who - I do not want to destroy the film's ending for you. <br /> <br /> True life in Sampedro catalyzed the national debate on euthanasia in Spain. Now the producer / director / writer / composer / editor Alejandro Amenábar (Abre Los Ojos, 1997 and The Others, 2001) is "bi-bordered", The Sea Inside, the second rhetorical help given by the international debate on this topic. <br /> <br /> But as I still say (deaf ears?), your opinion, the pro or con movie ideology should not affect your movie's rating. You don't have to be an evaluation of the philosophical or political messages Amenábar wants to do. You should rate a movie as a movie. Perhaps it is a bit too idealistic because no one of us can probably completely separate our assessments of our ideological bias, but not the ideal or not. <br /> <br /> So forget about philosophical and political issues for a moment. As a film, Amenábar has made more elegant and mature works to date. He does not focus on social discussions. He does not focus on Sampedro's legal / political struggles. He focuses on Sampedro as a man who lives in bed with his bed. <br /> <br /> Sampedro, who played amazingly at Javier Bardem's performance, was quadriplegic. As the film begins, it has been forty years of quadriplegic. This situation occurred when Amenábar showed us through a striking rebound, as a result of a diving accident - Sampedro was disturbed by a beautiful woman, calculated in water, poured, kicked and almost drowned. Quadriplegicina finally began writing poetry, some of which were published in the book entitled Cartas Desde El Infierno ("Letters in Hell"); in real life, Sampedro's book became Spain's best seller. Perhaps, taking Sampedro's works of art, Amenábar has created an elegantly poetic film. <br /> <br /> Most of Sea Inside's are placed in Sampedro's bedroom. The focus of these scenes is Bardem's complex and overwhelming result. Quadriplegicina is limited to Bardem moving his head and talking. He has acquired subtle changes in expression and infection to convey a deep character with a versatile, intellectual approach to life. Bardem and Amenábar have Sampedro's often delightful philosophical underrated speech, but always combined with an evil sense of humor, a passion for aesthetics - including music and women and sadness and even occasional bitterness that is far from surface. Different underlying emotions break from time to time as waves on the skin of the oceans. <br /> <br /> The people most often interacting with Sampedro facilitate this in difficult ways. These include his sister, Manuela (Mabel Rivera), who has been her main caregiver since the Sampedro accident; his brother José (Celso Bugallo), who is one of Sampedro's desire to die for vocal objections and with whom there is an unresolved question (perhaps it seemed that José Sampedro saved him from drowning?); his nephew Javier (Tamar Novas), who is probably the most sensible about him; law-death lawyer, Gené (Clara Segura); pro bono lawyer, Julia (Belén Rueda) whom she wanted because she had a degenerative disease, CADASIL (the predominant arteropathy of brain autosomes with subcortical infarctions and leukoencephalopathy) and would therefore be more empathetic and fall in love; and Rosa (Lola Dueñas), a local woman working in cans and moonlight as a DJ who heard her from the media, who wants to convince her to live and fall in love with her. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie is made up of characters who interact with Sampedro in their room. There are also some other signs, including Sampedro's father, who is strangely distant, and the infamous and media-conscious priest Padre Francisco (José María Pou), who is doing his best to change Sampedro's mind through philosophy / theology (the scene is often seen as a false "comic" - It has a companion companion, but the scene is mostly very serious. <br /> <br /> Since most movies are in Sampedro's room, they make a major change to a brilliant couple to determine their impact. Sampedro's room has a nice, big window that she says she is happy with the world as a point of view. Perhaps more importantly, he depicts the window regularly as a launch pad, through which he travels over the mountain ocean he always loved and has been the most influential force in his life - he gave his life when he was younger and took his life mobility. Amenábar gives us a fantastic sequence of Sampedro that depicts one of his flights to the sea. It is beautifully fired from low mountains (presumably from a helicopter) to the mountains that run until we reach the wide open ocean that represents freedom, infinite and natural forces in this film. <br /> Another important change to the setup comes with the introduction of Sampedro into the wheelchair (otherwise he refused to refuse them, saying that they "mocked their immobility") to appear in court to help his case. Amenábar gives Sampedro a visible and melancholic travel campaign that has been subjectively photographed about Sampedro's life and the world. <br /> <br /> Whether you agree with legalizing euthanasia or not, it is hard to deny that it is a well-functioning, well-written and well-designed film. You may not believe that this is ten (and it is even less likely if you do not agree to legalizing euthanasia), but it is still worthy of a good example of artistic, complex film making.
