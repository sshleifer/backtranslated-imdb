A very good film about anti-Semitism at the end of World War II. The scene that really speaks loudly about the ignorance of these people is a meeting in the church, when the priest gives his speech against "international money-launderers and communists". It sounds astonishingly like the speeches that Adolph Hitler used to squeeze his nations, but none of the attendees seem to compare it.
