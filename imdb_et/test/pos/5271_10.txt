Bright best film. Very funny, very surreal. If Bunuel made Buster Keaton starring Krusty as a clown, it would look like it was. <br /> <br /> Great productions we already know from other Schneider films, especially Helmut KÃ¶rschgen as 00Schneider's sidekick. (Andreas Kunze, who is playing the woman again, is a bit annoying). Of course, Helge is as incredible as Nihil Baxter. <br /> <br /> P.S: If this movie had proper trading, I'd like to buy a copy of this "Holz" painting.
