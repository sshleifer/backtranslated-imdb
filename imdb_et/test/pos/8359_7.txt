When the episode was made and aired Eisenhower was president. Kennedy was a presidential candidate. <br /> <br /> As for the episode, it was a satisfying episode, if not a bit serious. "Professor" does not show much here and the whole thing seems a bit hurry (many TZ episodes don't fit with time lapse, some seem like they have been compressed and hurried, some with little or nothing for half an hour and some fit naturally. I think you you expect a little bit of tension when you take it back to some rooms and stunned. But in general there is a decent episode. Indeed, "what if" the motif of the timepiece is nugget in itself and sets the table with the main interest. that there were many TZ episodes, not quite as good, and some much better.
