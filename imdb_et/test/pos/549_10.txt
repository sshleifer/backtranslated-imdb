I saw "Anywhere But Here" last night as a free hidden preview. I've totally loved the movie! I pulled it because of a realistic depiction of the mother / daughter relationship ... there was definitely a link between Adele a and Ann. I think he is talking about the outstanding performances of Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman. Sarandon was just the right actor to portray Adele and after leaving the theater I couldn't think of another actor. Portman was also a great Ann. He brought his maturity and intelligence to the role that I think no other teenage actor would get. I think it should give credit to the Academy of Arts and Sciences, where it is needed, and call it "Actress" and "Supporting Actress" for both Sarandon and Portman. It would be a shame if they were ignored.
