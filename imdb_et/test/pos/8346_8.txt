Lady and Tramp II are very colorfully animated and the songs, especially Junkyard Dogs, are pretty good. However, the family seems too idyllic and I cannot understand that Scamp is unhappy when everything is forbidden. But I'm also sorry for an Angel who has never been a loving family until she meets Jim dear and Darling. <br /> <br /> In any case, it is clear that the original Lady and the tram are better than the sequel.
