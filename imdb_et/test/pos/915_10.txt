Most of Kieslowski's movies seem to me to be puzzles designed to expand thought and soul. The characters are not very plausible, are ideal, are schematic. However, how Kieslowski, through his way of life, presents his ways of eradication, their complicated interaction with others, the universe, coincidence or destiny, makes me understand the faith, makes me (want) to believe in God. This is at some point meaning, if not for me, definitely for someone. <br /> <br /> Trois couleurs and especially Rouge get closer to touch, feel, experience the "truth", "meaning" than any of his films. The only problem that has been explored on "riddles" is a bit too similar to his other movies, and at some point they become somewhat predictable. There's a lot of joy here. It's like a familiar wine brand - you know what to expect and it gives, sometimes a newly found bouquet that can come from aging - either wine or yourself.
