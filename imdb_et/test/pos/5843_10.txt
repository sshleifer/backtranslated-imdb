Oz was a fantastic show when frequent man nudity didn't turn you off. There was too much front male nudity in this show, more than any other show you see on a porn channel. The downside is that it was the best TV show and the previous commentator said "better than the suspect prime minister". Prime Minister is Tom and Jerry vs Simpsons. There is no competition. If you have DirecTv then they will now launch it from channel 101 at the beginning, now they are Episode # 3. Highly recommended. The creator Tom Fontana was also involved in the killing, which was on the AWESOME show. But why all men's nudity? We all know that stuff is going on in prison, but did they really need to show it so often? It was the only thing that brought me out of the show. If I want to see naked men, the boys are raped, I kill someone and testify first. Otherwise, I like my television sets every five minutes with no black pen.
