The Venetian merchant is a fantastic movie. This is very true for the original Shakespeare game. When you saw Jeremy Irons from Casanova and liked his performance, it's a movie for you! When you saw that Joseph Fiennes is in love with Shakespeare and that you enjoyed his action, this movie is for you! If you saw Al Pacinot Donnie Brascos and liked her performance, this is a movie for you! This is a very enjoyable movie and if you learn Shakespeare like me, this is a great movie to see! The only problem with this movie is that you can't let the babies see it because it has some nudity in it. But besides that, it's really a good movie!
