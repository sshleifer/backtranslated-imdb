This movie is a twist, a derived fire board, (burning at the end of harvest) Happy memory for Tamura, she lives in her mind for a long time and at the end of this gloomy film, like a man who dies thirst, believes she is at home and this last illusion is all what he has left. Billy Wilder's great carnival (Ace aukkuku) is the only movie (to be remembered) that is just as grim as this small Kon Ichikawa masterpiece. Although I think the whole movie is brilliant Two memorable scenes are when Americans attack Japanese soldiers trying to escape (there is a belly), and they are killed, a real horror, and like an American soldier and a pretty Philippine girl soldier on the roadside with a cigarette , he smiles when he pulls, then his face makes rage when he sees two Japanese soldiers trying to surrender, he grabs a gun and kills them with joy, an American soldier tries to stop him, but he has no chance of telling me about the volumes what the Japanese do in the Philippines, and it's all a great movie if you have a belly for it.
