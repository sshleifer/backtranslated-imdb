Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) is a teacher who is getting married. Then one of his former students wins the Oscar movie, where he plays a gay warrior and thanks Howard for his reception, being homosexual! This film follows the follow-up, as journalists descend in Howard Village and try to convince everyone that he is straight. <br /> <br /> I love this movie! Kevin Kline is wonderful, has some very fun moments and it always leaves me feeling great. As a result, this is one movie I enjoy as often as possible. If you haven't seen it, you're missing!
