"The strangers on the train" was one of the film classics I've always heard of, but somehow nothing could really be seen. Finally, I looked at it a couple of weeks ago, and as always with every Hitchcock movie, it was not just a time trial, but a lot of thrillers made today. Here you can see the inspiration for future films - climate change, ending in a controlling seaside and two offenders duplicating each other, reminded me of the great sequence of action at the end of Jan de Bont's speed. "Of course," Strangers "is over forty years older than" Speed ​​"and it does not contain any modern special effects, but the visceral excitement is there - Hitchcock was a real genius. <br /> <br /> Not so fine on the Bruno side (Robert Walker amazing) Think of him as Jennifer Jason Leigh's "Single White Female" version. - and soon she has become very obsessed with her. <br /> <br /> In her films, Hitchcock loved the Olympic elements (see also "Psycho" for more coarse basics) and there are a lot of them here, Bruno hates his father and wants him to die to his violent ways and obvious homosexuality must have just slipped by censors in 1951 if gays were not allowed on the screen - but Hitchcock gets the message effectively when we see Bruno on the phone non-masculine bathrobe, flirting with Guy and answering her mother. <br /> <br /> The deep layers of this movie make it a fast paced thriller when you can go back and forth again - unfortunately, it has been rebuilt with a big budget Hollywood production, but after seeing the original, I can't imagine anything that would surpass the white chewing gum of this movie.
