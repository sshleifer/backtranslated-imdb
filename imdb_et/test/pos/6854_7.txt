I liked this movie. The participants were great, especially Potente, who is different in every role; FÃ¼rmann, who is also capable of playing; and Loos, who spiced things up (he is also a talented singer - he sings the song "My Truth", heard one sign moving up in a stereo stereo). <br /> <br /> Anatomy is a good horror flick that draws attention to its characters. It is also occasionally very delicate and the design is innovative. It is too bad that they had to make a sequel that was not close to the original. <br /> <br /> There are two more things to note on the side. The DVD is not duplicated, which makes the film a better experience. Be sure to follow the beginning of the last credit.
