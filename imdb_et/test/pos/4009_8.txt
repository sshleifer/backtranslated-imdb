Most of the criticism of "Exhibition Attack" is from people who compare it unfairly with the old "TV Screensavers" program. People are upset because G4 decided to "Screen Savers" to cancel and replace its "Show of the Show" based on pop culture. Comparing two exhibitions is similar to comparing apples to oranges! <br /> <br /> "Exhibition Attack" is a unique hour-long program that covers the current generation of X / Y culture. It includes movies / television, panel discussions, video games, new DVD editions, sexual counseling, new gadgets (MP3 players, mobile phones, etc.), comic books / graphic novels, magazines and internet fates. <br /> <br /> This is a fun show that is definitely worth it in the 20's or 30's. I'll give him 8 out of 10.
