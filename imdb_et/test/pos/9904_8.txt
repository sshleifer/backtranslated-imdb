The 2005 Phoenix Film Festival had no secret what the film was on the front of everyone's watch list. Checking Out (2004) brought Scottsdale to Harkins Cine-capri for crowd film enthusiasts. Participants of the festival, waiting for a series of lessons, turned to the door, despite the screening ability of two theaters. <br /> <br /> Checking (2004) is a beautifully made moving image; inspiring comedy for many audiences who enjoy. Director Jeff Hare combines traditional filmmaking with a new twist of creativity, capturing Peter Falk at his biggest and more sentimental moments (usually shown in intimate close-ups) on a silver screen. <br /> <br /> By combining the development of your enchanting humor and narrative plot, Checking Out (2004) is a landmark independent film that deserves your attention.
