Post-war England, "Atomic Age". At the same time, a young schoolboy cannot be worried that his first "kiss" will experience something as insignificant as BOMB. It was a pleasant, if not educational, look at the young love of a young man and his world point of interest in the 1940s. From political correctness and preached messages, this film is released to the viewer world that only a young teenager's mind (and <br /> <br /> hormones) can be created. Amazing Subplots <br /> <br /> Retain character interests in the "Gregory Girl" area and lots of <br /> <br /> well-blocked shots to help capture the images of this era. This is a very good story for everyone, young or old, who has ever been in love or ever wanted to be. Will he ever get his wish? Look at it and see.
