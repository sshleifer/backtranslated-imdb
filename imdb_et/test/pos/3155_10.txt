Just look at it! It's a smart movie, but it's hard to understand for the first time. See it more than once. Everything that is seen or heard on the screen is deliberately designed to create a feeling, feeling or tone. The crisp clarity of certain visuals and certain sounds is deliberately at odds with vague images or jumps, cracks, lifts and barely audible sounds. The structure is non-linear and cyclic. Motifs recur when time runs both clockwise and counterclockwise. Expectations of "plot" and "character" interrupt the non-traditional use of movies to tell a story that is both modern and old as humanity. This is part of the review: "USA The film is emotionally intense, intellectually intriguing and deeply disturbing, in surprising and unusual ways." Dion Dennis, PhD
