Most of Brigitte Bardot's films I've seen have not been able to make full use of her enchanting screen presence. Unfortunately, he was undoubtedly given a few really good tasks in high quality films, which was a real watch. He deserved them and was able to show his journey. Like Genevieve's "Love on a Pillow", we had a clear exception to the trend of light, fluffy vehicles, because it was an interesting, artistic film with any reasonable measure and the 28-year-old BB was the most attractive to him. "Une Parisienne" is another one that has a very exciting Brigitte in an interesting, well-designed comedy that explores how ambitious a lady is convinced that she remains faithful to an incredibly beautiful young woman. There are several good performances here. His playboy husband, Michel, is one of the "prince" played by Charles Boyer, another entertaining effort with good supportive pain. As for Brigitte Bardot, the way she watches this movie is the way I remember her for fifty years. He was 23 years old in 1957 and was ahead of his time, more beautiful than any other actor, including Marilyn Monroe. His curvy, squating sexuality, which is widely displayed in many bosom-baring, skintight dresses, simply pops up on the screen. He was more hip and cute than American women today, nearly fifty years later. Obsessed with their career and still desperate for feminist politics, they come out as attractive lesbians. Conversely, the sex kitten was sexually liberated, intelligent, and clearly independent for a long time before it was fashionable, but although he fully understood the power of his extraordinary femininity, he used it for a higher purpose than mere interest - he believed in love. The photo just couldn't do justice. You had to look at his slender but busy form (20-inch belt) slightly past the space. You had to see that wild blonde hair, looking at her big, brown, seductive eyes, and listening to her full, pounding lips spoke French. At the end of this movie, she sees the camera in her eye and flirt, her beautiful orbs blinking. What a baby! For fans of Brigitte Bardot, "Une Parisienne" should not be overlooked.
