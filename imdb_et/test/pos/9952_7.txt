William Shakespeare's Venetian merchant depicts the 16th century Venice. Al Pacino plays Shylock, a Jewish loan shark who puts revenge on the Catholic who looked down at him. The film is at first a slowly moving plot that gathers over two plus hours. The film gives its characters, especially Pacino, a very good and credible look. Listening to Pacino playing a Jew, one might think that it does not work by looking at Pacino's earlier cellster-type roles. However, it works very well, credit must be given to the costume designer and film director. The appearance of all characters fits well with the time period in which the game takes place. Costumes look like a renaissance look that can be imagined. <br /> <br /> The film represents a very anti-Semitic atmosphere. From the first minute to the last show, it is shown how Catholics are trying to exploit the Jews in every possible way, even if they keep them in "ghettos" and don't let them work regularly. Compared to Christ's passion, another recent film that people think is very anti-Semitic, the Venetian merchant makes Passion like a Jewish holiday. The film shows how the Jews, or at least Shylock, wanted revenge for the ill-treatment of the Jews. Location shots also appear to be very timely and, depending on the scene, the scenery is sometimes very beautiful or very ugly, making it just more realistic. Beautiful and ugly vision can also be seen as anti-Semitic, because ugly is usually shown around the Jews and Catholics beautifully. <br /> <br /> Although the film is likely to catch some serious aura, add some humor to the act. Oh so serious trial between Shylock and Antonio (Irons) adds a bit of humor when Portia (Collins) and Nerissa (Goldenhersh) come to trial and decide who is the winner and defeated. This in itself may not be funny, but seeing that they were women who were disguised as women, because men could be amusing. It might have been even more memorable at the whole cladding site, as it might have been, when artists and director Michael Radford noticed that two women were still seen by women and could be easily recognized. The director could also have seen that women, rather than trying to hear men who partially take away from the scene, but not kill it completely, speak their usual voices. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie gets 10 out of 10
