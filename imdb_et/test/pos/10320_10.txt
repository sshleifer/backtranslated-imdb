Almost certainly the best of Shemp's short three Stooges, "Brideless Groom" is as good as any of the best trio shorts with Curly. The memorable Stooge moments are abundant. The best example of Shemp Howard is the opening, where Professor Shemp gave his voice lessons to Miss Dinkelmeyer (Dee Green), home, unattractive, and leaving, worshiping his terrible vocals and fighting for his progress. Many considered him the most natural joke of Stooges. <br /> <br /> Later, when Moe and Larry try to help her find her husband (and claim $ 500,000), Shemp thinks she has cut off her head when her mirror is turned back. Attaching a mirror cries with relief: "I'm as beautiful as a picture!" "Yes," Moe responds quickly, trying to hit his pants, "APE!" <br /> <br /> The best scene (and perhaps Shemp best with the trio) comes when he calls an attractive young Miss. Hopkins (Christine McIntyre). He hurt her for a long time with the lost "Cousin Basil", she screams her with hugs and kisses (also taking a bit of fun between Moe and Larry in the hall), leaving her the opportunity to explain her true identity. Suddenly, REAL calls Cousin Basil to make a call and he's beating, getting him repeatedly and accusing him of "poor? Helpless? Defenseless? WOMAN!" This last line will be delivered when she socks her into the jaw (with a real punch, Shempt and team members), tapping her in the door and the hall to the perfectly dead gag. "What happened, boy?" Moe asks. "Can I help if I'm not a cousin Basil?" Shemp asks before spending. <br /> <br /> Other classic bits include Moe and Shemp, who are in the phone cab, trying to find a lost coin, Larry got into Shemp because of his bad appearance (his face pressed against the phone) and a big girl fighting for a peace justice apartment . Big Emil Sitka offers her classic line (written for her tombstone), "Hold your hands, you love birds" over and over when her apartment is in the trash. <br /> <br /> I write "Brideless Groom" as medicine for everyone who thinks that Stooges' glorious years ended when Curly left. True, Shemp did not have as many short short groups as Curly, but it was because Columbia and his (and others) advanced ages are not supporting. When Shemp was healthy and the trio was given the proper material to work, they were still at the top of their game.
