I saw this movie for the first time in Papua New Guinea in 1967 and I remember it, even though I've never seen it for the first time. <br /> <br /> Just as the good lives of people can destroy the pure evil that existed and still have the memory that haunts me forever. <br /> <br /> The movie is funny and tremendously sad at the same time, and Anthony's quin role is great. <br /> <br /> This movie should be in all college studies on human inhumanity to humans.
