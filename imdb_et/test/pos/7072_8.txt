This film has the courage to show that it is best to simply receive and smile your life. Like a person who is more excited about the idea of ​​taking responsibility and advancing his life, I felt the face, but it's okay: I don't have to love and respect the film. Great acts Streep and Hurt, and everyone else really, and some wonderfully strange scenes. Serious movie. And take the hat.
