If you have the opportunity, look at this Russian language (how should I name them: gems, masterpieces, hidden treasures?), Military films like this, or here moths are quiet, or Proverka na dorogah ... And right after that look again at America films or international productions that are allies and Germans, etc. Or worse, look at Italian war movies. Everything from the West is much lower, natural, ridiculous compared to Russian films. I am surprised by the quality of the Russian war films mentioned above, which I cannot find in words that are commendable if they break the superiority of Anglo-Saxon films.
