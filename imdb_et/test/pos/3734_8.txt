Listen, you don't watch this movie to change your life! But if you're especially female and you've always had something for Richard Gere; this movie is on your street. Diane Lane and Richard Gere are behind the screen chemistry. 'Nights in Rodanthe' is not an Oscar winner film and it is probably sooner forgotten, but if you want an atmospheric, beautifully played love story between MIDD AGED good looking people (they don't make your stomach and even when Gere is on it, he not see too jowly), this is the movie for you. I loved the theme of this story and it was quite relevant in many ways. Of course, the whole thing was superficial, glossed over and not really dealt with ..... I mean I would have wanted to know more about the relationship between father / son between Gere and James Franco, but this story was really an idea that great love can MAKE YOU BETTER change; whether it is a lover, a child, a friend, etc. The theme of the film is love and its mysterious way. I was surprised that James Franco took such a small part in such a movie, but he's always good for a few minutes on the screen. I liked this movie because it was touching and sweet.
