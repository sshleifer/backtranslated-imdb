I know that the film should have been for several hours to be included in the book, so I think they did their best to get things that were decisive for the story. I thought the pain was great, the kids who played Amir and Hassan were very good actors. And the man who played Amir as an adult was great! Especially the scenes between him and Baba touched. I thought their places were interesting ... Scenes set in Afghanistan were shot in China, and one scene that took place in Fremont, CA (Stopping Scene) was actually shot on the island of San Francisco. I worked one day as an extra "Kite Runner" and that was the day, the day they created the production. We informed Treasure Island in the morning, they checked everybody's wardrobe to make sure it looked like in the late 80s, so we took our seats to the audience. They shot the scene over and over until they were happy with it. It was cool to see that the actors were close to seeing the author of the book, who was in the hands of a consultant. I thought this book was great and I recommend both the book and the movie to anyone. It is a moving story of friendship, love, guilt and potential redemption. "There is another way to be good."
