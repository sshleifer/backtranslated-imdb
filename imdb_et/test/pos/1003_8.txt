So, the Kira knight is in this ... So let's automatically compare this movie with the attonement. In addition to being a war-time film and its uneven appearance, these films are completely different. Team. <br /> <br /> If you want a movie where things happen, give it to another, because the story of this movie is about people's interaction and their physics, which their experiences have damaged and how their lives are interrelated. > <br /> This film has real communication, perfect moments of pause that will keep you breathless. Not exciting, but it is thrilling when you can feel these characters. In moments, I wondered if this film could be a theater game rather than a movie. We expect a lot of movies because everything is possible, but with the theater we still allow communication and reliance on faith. <br /> <br /> There are things wrong when you are looking for a blockade, if you are looking for something to let the movie take you, move around, let yourself forget those letters and not decide them as actors, but let them become people, you really move yourself. Go ahead! ! let it go!
