I liked Ramin Bahran's Man Push Cart, and this movie is just as good. This part of life is almost a documentary about life on the edges. <br /> <br /> Alejandro Polanco and Isamar Gonzales are doing a great job with a 12-year-old brother and a 16-year-old sister who lives in a small space over the car store. No parents; they are in their lives. Ali supplements her income by stealing her car, selling bootleg DVDs, and selling subway candies. Izzie supplements her income with a food lift by selling herself. They try to make money, but their own truck. <br /> <br /> One is tempted to express the resentment that these two children will be left alone, and it may be very irritating that Izzie sells to his car-seekers, but the fact is that it now exists in the richest country in the world not in some underdeveloped countries. Save the annoyance and do something.
