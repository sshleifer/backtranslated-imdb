"Outcome and Running" is a breakable story that always represents a marvelous Margaret Colin as a social girl who "has everything" until she hits a car with her car and leaves the scene. So the title. The tragedy is that he goes for help and return, but the angry passerby scares those who think the hitter gave up the scene. It was done on those days when everyone had no cell phones or no story. <br /> <br /> Colin's guilt and distress are feeling and causing his behavior so strange that the detective gets to his right. Her lies deepen her deeper and deeper into her own dignity, causing her a worse situation. <br /> <br /> This is a very thought-provoking story and no one can help a lady's pain, wishing her all to be pure. <br /> <br /> As a TV movie, thanks to Colin and a strong script, it is a medium-sized TV movie.
