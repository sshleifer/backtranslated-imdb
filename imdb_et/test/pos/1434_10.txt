Frankie Machine (Frank Sinatra), who has been released from a six-month drug rehabilitation program and earned her time for card payments in illegal gambling cards, is very much in the hopes of cleaning up and finding a new life as a big band drummer. But when he returns to his old criminal district in Chicago, he will soon find the pressure around him, including his wheelchair wife Zosch (Eleanor Parker), to return to the old money-making "Dealer" lifestyle that he started on heroin-dependent self-destruction. <br /> <br /> It is very rare that the film has so many great characteristic performances as it is. Frank Sinatra is great as the Frankie Machine and realistically depicts the symptoms of a drug addict that go undoubtedly better than anyone else before him. Sinatra seems to be a sensitive understanding and awareness of her character here and expresses a constant struggle for her life, which is forever in the heart of Frankie Machine. Parker as his exhausting wife, Zosch, wants Frankie forever to "do" to make good money to take care of her and pay her regular medical bills. He seems to be afraid of something he sees as a threat to his control, such as the freedom the drummer can offer, or something that can change the status quo between them. <br /> <br /> Observer Molly (Kim Novak), a girl who lives in the same building and seems to have true and strong real feelings for Frankie, not willing to control her, but only to prove her which is the best that Frankie gets for her in the world if she can just stay long enough to wake up and realize. However, Darren McGavin, as a heroin drug store, Louie is always waiting in the wings, knowing the right buttons to push, just what to say to become a former addict who returns to the old habit that is useful for Louie, but deadly for the Independent also seems dead that is, in life, in place, on the spot, in the dark, in the dark, in misery, and in crimes where there are not enough positive things. where it is too easy to escape through bottles or drugs, a quick "fix" that is not at all certain, but only works to keep one in the dark from daylight and all the bright prospects the world can offer. It is a pure touch that if Frankie is on the right track, the device will always look brighter than when it drives the wrong path. While some claim it is a bit dated, I have this sharp film that has a realistic internal war over the man to control his own destiny, which has a very strong character with all the performances involved. Given that a man with GOLDEN ARM gets my highest recommendation.
