I was pleased to see this movie available on DVD. Despite being a "TV movie" and being shot at a distance of 16 mm, it provided an excellent overview of the various people who wanted to become a "London Cabbie", with their foibles and family responsibilities. Even the most miserable candidates, "Titanic", with his unmarried spouse, could see how Jack Rosenthal was capable of 90 minutes of fun and sometimes tragic cuts in London's life. <br /> <br /> Originally for the first time, Mick Ford's passenger car (red intended), ensemble selection, including Michael Elphic, Nigel Hawthorne, Jonathan Lynn, Lesley Joseph, and Maureen Lipman (Mrs Rosenthal), meant the quality of Mick had the best billing but he had to work hard on such competing talents. <br /> <br /> Even 15 years after the 1991 release, it's still as fresh as ever!
