"One crazy summer" is a more funny, crazy (not necessarily the best) movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Just when one crazy scene is made, another will appear. It will never let you rest. Just one thing after another. The soundtrack is great. Songs are right for scenes. <br /> <br /> It's also a clean film. Little dirty in it. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is the story of the guys you don't trust with your lunch, challenging and gaining more resources. Who would like to see it if they failed? There is a serious aspect that parents and children do not live in each other's dreams. Should always be open and consider all options. This applies to both parents and children. "One crazy summer" is the wrong parents. This is not always the case.
