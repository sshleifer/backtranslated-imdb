I don't understand the need to jump back and forth on the scene set and print it out. I show that someone has the skills before they use it, so my understanding is offensive. It will feel a bit viable and as vague for the first three series. This episode is a little disappointing. <br /> <br /> Besides, as before, when Locke's ability to find out when the storm ends, is honestly offensive ... should we ooh and arr, or laugh on the softer side of Locke? <br /> <br /> This episode was all over the place.
