Flowers! If this is one thing you take out of this movie, it is flowers. They are so prominent and used as plot equipment, you become an expert who, at the end of the film, identifies daisies and black tulips. <br /> <br /> The Amsterdam-based Daisy talks about the story of a depressing love triangle with 1 girl and two men in her life. One professional striker who lives out, another Interpol agent. Pan-Asian cast (Korea, Hong Kong) and the team (directed by Andrew Lau from Hong Kong, Korean writer and Thai Postal Team) can imagine headaches in concert. <br /> <br /> Park Yi (Jung Woo-sung) is a hit man who found a soft spot for the painter Hye-young (played by Jeon Ji-hyun). This is the love of the French meadows, where his clumsy attention was earned. However, being shy and always aware of the dangers of his professional career, he can admire a little, or do a little (or maybe big) things anonymously for him, but the one who carries the cake sends him the pots. every day without failure at 16:15. He becomes a distant guardian, protecting him and keeping him from danger. <br /> <br /> Hye-young is in love with this mysterious stranger. She is waiting for her constantly, but I really don't know how hard this almost accurate daisy delivery would be. However, he has been terribly moved and this is the only action. However, as the stars would be, the Interpol detective, Jeong Woo (Lee Sung-jae), is one of his mysterious missions to urban youth during his urban space, and he has been conquered by him. Similarly, because of his profession, he is doubtful whether he should take the first step. <br /> <br /> What the viewer thinks is depressing. The lady would probably fall for the wrong boy (then again, this is a "good" boy), Park Yi has threatened Jeong Woo's pursuit, but still does not agree to step out and identify himself, and Jeong Woo is an opportunistic free anonymous identity involuntarily. It is almost the same as you would like to give all of them hell to wake them all up. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of tension that interests you. And it is maliciously fun to see if two males are hard to fall in love without endangering their career or their close ones. But do not frighten the fans of the acts, have enough cat-mouse revelations and unspoken adultery in the form of Infernal Affairs, but also a lot of armed forces, although I felt that the end could have been written. <br /> <br /> What stones are smart editing. Speaking of a story on a non-linear timeline (don't worry, it's not so bad, you can still keep track of the narrative) from all managers' point of view, keeping you informed and culminating in a triple shared screen that introduces all your emotions in one convergence, which I thought was very well done . <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful movie of lush meadows and busy urban squares, with lots of classic music to soothe the soul. Like romance films, all the leaders are eye candies - girls have two good men leading the day, while boys have to do a slightly weak face (argh! OK, some corners) with Jeon Ji-hyun. <br /> <br /> If you're in a romance movie with equal balance in the action / tension department, Daisy would be your choice. If you prefer a more common smart, then the second Korean film that debuted here at the same time, You're my sunshine, your alternative. And yes, I completely dig the end of the scene, which I thought the Koreans would do best? Kinda reminded me of JSA.
