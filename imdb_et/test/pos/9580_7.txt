... the opportunity he gave me to look at the Irish past was invaluable. <br /> <br /> I had the benefit of seeing it with my mother, who greeted Cork and watched that we talked and learned a lot about her, how things were. <br /> <br /> Similar things like Deasy and Co were Cork Soft Drinks Company; how to destroy rain catches; how the farmers got to catch the past; how in the dance halls women and men really had to stand up before the men walked forward and asked the woman to dance; the bellows that kept the fire; how the priests really called the list of donors and their donations to the church, and a little bit of the currency of that time (which my father helped me show the case that used the penny, schillings and pounds used at that time) (which were legal means of payment))). <br /> <br /> I didn't pay much attention to how good the movie was, but I was very grateful that I had the opportunity to look back at some of the Irish History, but also others, including some of our parents and grandparents, it's their childhood.
