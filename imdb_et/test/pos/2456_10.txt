Estevez, Martin Sheen, and Kathy Bates are great at this Vietnamese animal evolution that is at home in war, but still haunted. Bates plays a married mother who wants the family to be a "family". Sheen is fantastic as a father who tries to understand what his son is going through but is too much in his principles to really understand. The setting is thanksgiving and relatives come for dinner. Estevez, who plays a returning vet, does not want any part of family practice and demands that his fighting fatigue be carried for dinner, explaining, "That's what I wore the last Thanksgiving." Escape and family arguments are invaluable, especially the "peanut crunch crisis", but the end is both thrilling and terrible. It has to be seen as appreciated. <br /> <br /> In general, one of the best films I've ever seen is.
