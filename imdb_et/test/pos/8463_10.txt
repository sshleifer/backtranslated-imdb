Ever wonder where this episode, "Tuttle", came from M * A * S * H ​​in the middle of the first season? Well now the cat is out of the bag: they got this Soviet movie, satire about how dark the tsar is, thanks to the slip (changing the phrase "Lieutenants," ... "Lieutenant Kizhe" that doesn't mean any meaning) and nobody is honest or guty, to contradict him and just tell him the truth - Kizhe does not exist and never did. So they make him an imaginary life and eventually kill him. And 40 years later, David Ketchum and Bruce Shelly took this generation's plot and gave us the same story, but on the other side of the Cold War, which proved that high-ranking people can be as stupid as they can be!
