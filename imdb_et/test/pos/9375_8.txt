The great soldiers are killed by a man who is a Jew and tries to get to the soldier. Not as good as the novel based on "The Brick Foxhole" ("Brick Foxhole"), where it was a homosexual man who was killed ... but Hollywood didn't touch it in 1947. Anti-Semitism is treated very well, but it grabs the audience that bigotria is bad ... well! But it was 1947. The image has worked well all over (especially Robert Young and Robert Ryan) and the tone is very dark ... as it should be. Very atmospheric. The big hit earned that day ... is worth watching.
