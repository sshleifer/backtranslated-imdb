Since most other reviewers seem to agree, it is very good after adjusting the funeral. Always one of my favorite Poirot stories I was worried that it might be "confused". Well, it was a little bit, but ONLY a bit and the end result was a lot of fun. David Suchet is still very good because Poirot and (as others have said) are the second star of this exhibition, Monica Dolan, who certainly couldn't be improved as Gilchrist. I really enjoyed Fiona Glasscott, who was on the spot at cutting Rosamund Shane, but in fact it was absolutely perfect! <br /> <br /> One point is knocked if the adapters can't take too many revelations in the last fifteen minutes. Dealing with will and house deeds was a bit unnecessary, even though I didn't think about how they tightened the structure of the Abernethie family (the genealogy is quite complicated in the book). But the last moments when a murderer is revealed are really very well done and I found it over when they all left Enderb, touching quite a bit. It is still one of the best in the Poirot series.
