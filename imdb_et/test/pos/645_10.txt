I felt that this film had a lot of heart and it must be the work of Eleanor Bergstein's love. Primary actors (Campbell Scott, Jennifer Beals, Yancy Butler, James Goodwin III, Patrick Stewart and Leslie Caron) were very well-chosen and played their part in excellence. It was a very exaggerating film that I would like on tape or DVD. Rare pearl.
