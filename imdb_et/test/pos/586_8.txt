Joy from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> If you don't like Muppet, I just have to make you sorry. This fantastic movie is not just money in the popularity of Muppets - it's a well thought out and well-written film. It has great songs and has a skewed melancholy yarn that was always present in Jim Henson's creations, and which is the most personal with Kermit's frog. I always responded to it as a child, and this makes Muppet still an enjoyable adult when other child-oriented materials make me crazy. this movie looks like "Around the World in 80 Days", which is about 80 times better. <br /> <br /> Rating: A
