I think my husband and I are a little slow. We usually do not warm up in series until they are almost at the end of production. In this case, we didn't start looking at the KoQs for almost the 6th season. I'm not sure how it escaped from our radar for so long. Other than the fact that we are not big fans of the "meeting" TV show. Our timetables that we don't want to track every time they come, (and we didn't have a DVR yet). So I think it was only when TBS started running runners in their daily ranks that we started to watch. series canceled. But let's look at it almost every day at TBS. I prefer to see almost a series like this because you can watch several episodes every day and this will help create consistency and what happens to the characters without having to wait for a whole week. <br /> <br /> But the episodes stand alone in that the songs are not transferred from week to week. But it is good for me because you can watch the episode, then leave for weeks - and still back. <br /> <br /> My only criticism is that writing was not always consistent. Some episodes would be terribly fun, and some of them would be just a little funny. So, I'm not sure it had the quality of the writers that Seinfeld or Raymond had. But I loved casting and the characters are all quite plausible and realistic. Kevin James is just a funny watch! So even if the plot is not so big, James makes body language and expressions worth the exhibition. Leah Remini is great as a "play-straight" woman. I think it's harder to play a straight character laugh than a comic character and it does a good job. He has sorcery against sarcasm and insults like someone else. He's one tough cookie! And who can forget Arthur as Carrie's father who lives with them in the basement. <br /> <br /> This is a great series and I was sorry if it was canceled. But a big thank you to TBS for keeping the king alive!
