I described Woody Allen to Manhattan as someone the other day was perfect and he thought it was a strange way to describe a movie ... <br /> <br /> I've only seen a handful of movies that I would call perfect. Manhattan is one, Robert Altman McCabe and Ms. Miller are the other, and Sergio Leone is one time in the West, which I think is the perfect film. There are some others, but besides mentioning the three mentioned three mistakes, I have to admit that all three directors have tasted. <br /> <br /> If there is one movie I could stand behind and bet that anyone I would show it would be flawless, this is the shoulder. <br /> <br /> City Lights, The Great Dictator, Gold Rush and even the pawnshop are the 10th, but not only Chaplin does everything right in this movie, all he did is fun and touches on inexplicable levels.
