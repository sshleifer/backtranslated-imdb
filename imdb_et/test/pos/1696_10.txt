Of course I think it was a great movie. I recognized a number of people I didn't see while filming. I was the one who played the guard for about an hour in the court house of the death penalty, asking for light on the cigarette. I also changed this into one scene. They had originally had to enter the yard and stretch out the prison and turn him around and walk. The director said, "It will take a long time for you to do the Gower." I said, "We have to go in and grab his hands and drag him back. This way, the camera can stay on his face when we put him down." I also lived in the same prison as a young child because my father was a security assistant. I am also the current employee of Tennessee Deaprtment of Corrections as the supervisor of Riverbend's maximum security agency. Although much of the movie was a joke, the part where I was was a reality enough. Also in the bar scene, the dancer got up high and left the actual stripper, which I used to work in The Classic Cat.
