Well, don't expect anything deep inside. Most fighting scenes are pretty decent. Two of the leading ladies are quite fun, but their lack of HK activity is sometimes. Finally, maybe there is nothing but I enjoyed it. Cheesy's humor doesn't seem to turn to anyone who hasn't looked at a bunch of HK movies, but if your thing is that and you have a couple of hours to do something meaningless, you could do it a lot worse. (OK, so you can do better, but .......) <br /> <br /> Certainly it is equal to most of Hollywood's thrust. <br /> <br /> 7/10
