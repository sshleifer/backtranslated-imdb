In the film, there is another extraordinary collaboration between director William Wyler and operator Gregg Toland, first after Tolant's work at Citizen Kane. But the talent of both men was focused on achieving an excellent crafted film, which was seen as a great story in the sense of a good old America. The technical aspects of the film are covered so that the viewer is absorbed into the screen without displaying the power of the image. Technique is seen as a representational tool, unlike Citizen Kane, where the Welles baroque style almost drew the story of how the story was spoken. One of my favorite music that is deeply focused on in this movie is the welcome home greeting offered by Homer and Al. When the Homer girl Wilma reaches her perfectly, Al goes to her wife, who is also perfect. This is a great move because it only shows the use of the images that see the nature of these relationships, as we see them during the movie: Wilma loves Homer and she accepts her as she is, Al-wife loves her, but she feels ready to welcome her home. Even later in the film, we find that their marriage has not always been a bed of roses. <br /> <br /> Wyler is a director whose power is that he is true to his work, without the need to boast. He wanted to show his audience how difficult it was for American soldiers to return to war so they could fit into a society that didn't understand them or treated them with contempt. With perfect casting and excellent dialogue, Goldwin and Wyler made a movie that is forever a return home video template. Three hours, which coincide with "harsh cuts", because the test group listener did not feel for a moment that the action was slow and the scene of each film seems completely justified. The whole thing is built beautifully, every character gets a fair amount of exposure, nothing is left unintentional, and it's quite pathetic that Hollywood never manages to bring so many character conflicts to the screen today. TBYOOL explores the depths of the American way of life, the American family and society to such an extent that other films look like "children's lessons".
