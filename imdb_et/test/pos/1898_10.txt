Yes, this is one of the biggest aspects of the black action genre. This movie is not confused with a mixture of racist comedy and racist violence (sometimes reaching a disturbing place even for a genre fan) this movie is not in your park park. The wonderful bits of Rudy Ray Moore's comedy stand up, which doesn't seem funny, at least not like a white boy like me, but also great in context. Much better than his different sequels, "Man in Toroon"
