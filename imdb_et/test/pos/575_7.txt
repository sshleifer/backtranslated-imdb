It's a pretty unclear, stupid horror movie in the 1970s Everglades. In the first half it is really stupid and flat, it really starts to get better in the last half. There is a scene where the hero travels to save his friends from church group singing techniques, I don't know. It's mesmerizing. I was impressed with the night scenes because it actually seemed at night, unlike most low budget horror movies, where it still seems like a day. I feel the director was really talented but worked with a small budget and a difficult schedule. After all, there are some scenes, the aforementioned and also the ultimate cool credits. This film could have been a real classic when he left his Scooby Doo conventions and went straight to the throat. I was surprised how good this film was. I couldn't take my eyes off it and I had to ask myself, "Why?"
