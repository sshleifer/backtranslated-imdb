Garbo's first spoken words in this 1930's movie electrified the audience and became part of the Hollywood legend. In 1926, Garbo became the star of his first American film The Torrent. And the audience was expecting this movie to see if Garbo could talk about the transition. He did. And while Pola Negri, Vilma Banky, and Renee Adoree were on the road because of their accents, Garbo drove for another ten years. Despite the astonishment of this film, Garbo is really great, especially at the opening place, with the same size as Marie Dressler as Marthy. Two big stars trade dirty looks and sharp words when they enlarge one another, while they have some drinks and set the tone for the rest of the movie. Garbo was 25; Dressler was 60. Charles Bickford is OK because Matt and George F. Marion are old Chris. Marion got this role in Broadway in 1922 and played it with the silent version of 1933 with Blanche Sweet. This Eugene O'Neill game is a real classic but strange, never filmed. Anna Christie is one of Garbo's greatest performances. And, despite the astonishment of the movie and the story of sin, he is truly admiration. Check out this Garbo and Dressler!
