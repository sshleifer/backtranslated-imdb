A unique mix of musical, film and comedy with a few sexual scenes. The only other film I think quite like a mixture of natural and mad themes and clichés is the French film Billy Ze Kick - but it has a more surreal and peculiar approach. <br /> <br /> Not that this movie is not surreal or peculiar. Humor is sometimes quite subtle, otherwise it is instantly your face - and often crosses the border with resentment. As an example, in the post-prostitute post-interview conversation, our hero Max Müller encourages to expose who was responsible for the recent murder using the words "Schiess los!". Literally, this phrase means "shoot!" German, and that's exactly what a hidden assassin is doing. In other words, this beautiful lady was sacrificed for red. <br /> <br /> Müllers Büro is also one of the very rare examples of funny sex movies. Larry's romance is accompanied by the song "Ich will mehr" (I want more) - although the song is the basis for this action, the meaning of its words changes a few times, eventually suggesting Larry's inability to provide further service. The main love scene of the film There is no such nuance between Max Müller and Bettina Kant - this is the jaw dropping, especially when the song of Bettina slowly slips into sadness, of course, all in the rhythm of music. <br /> <br /> Unmissable if you are not one easily offended.
