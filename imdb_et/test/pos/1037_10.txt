I saw this series in PBS in college in 1980 and I still can't get it out of my head, even though I've never seen it. I remember every cast member (the selection was perfect, as mentioned in other comments), design, lighting and, of course, a story that is enough in itself to keep the device glued. Probably the best TV series I've ever seen next to the original "Swedes".
