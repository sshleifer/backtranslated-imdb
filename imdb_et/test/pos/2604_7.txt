After the "fifty-foot woman attack" with Alison Hayes opened the doors for women to be as dangerous as men, it was obviously an open market for other films to pull a flashlight and what a lovely actor as Dorothy Provine "It's crazy, mad, crazy, play the role of the mad world. The fall is that cute and blonde Provine may just be too sweet and innocent, looking for the 50th gift of Allison Hayes. This role was really needed by someone who had sex exchange. Certainly there is more of a female type of girl. He could do this role and do it to prove he might be sexy, but the material lets him down. Lou Costello, however, proves that he can make a film without Bud Abbot, who drinks him, and he even interferes with the dramatic role in some of his scenes when he doesn't turn to Gale Gordon, his ancestor. Gordon admits, however, that everything he may have is spooky, distracted, and steadfast, with the same character he later creates on The Lucy Show. Charles Lane also plays the same role in everything he does: straight man and his screen time is limited. The special effects are convincing by then, but I would have liked Dorothy to be a little more than a cheesecake and sauce and at least be allowed to be dangerous. Like the film's flagship, he takes another billing to Costello, who has been missing several times as a sub-block with Dorothy. The whole film is unable to decide whether it should be scientific literature, comedy or just a parody of Allison Hayes' classic. There are many good scenes, some very funny humor and some very ridiculous bearings that affect the rest of the movie. However, I like this movie because it's empowering women; there aren't enough movies out there. If this film had the chance to redesign today, I would recommend Courtney Cox and Jason Alexander to leadership roles and allow me to fully write the original script. Courtney writes lists of my actors I believe they could and should play proudly enough; although I have to admit that when one of the titanic decorations Allison or Dorothy came after me, I go quietly!
