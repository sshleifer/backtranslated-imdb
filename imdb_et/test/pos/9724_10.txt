The whole series - Jim Henson's best work. John Hurt * is a narrator. Often, the Oscar caliber scenarios are not surprising when you think Minghella is writing. The Oscar caliber always works. <br /> <br /> Sapsorrow - everyone loves "soldiers and deaths" but something "sapsorrow" pushes it higher in my favor. At the first ballroom, costumes, music - perfection. Hurt and the dog typically interact with the story halfway, but this time Minghella pulls it to the top of Hurt and Sapsorrow's circle. In terms of the friendship between Straggletag and Prince, the chemistry between the characters is particularly well developed, the more common. Have you seen it? Look at it again. Pay more attention (to those who do not respect this 22-minute film perfection). Never seen? I'm so sorry. <br /> <br /> Luck Child - not as complicated as Sapsorrow, but very smart. It's a story of irony. Irony after irony, ironically ... I love it. Every character is perfect except for the barge. He did drama; everyone else did romantic comedy. I forgive him. This is my favorite mainly of comedy episodes, "Sapsorrow" and "The Soldier and Death", which are examples of more dramatic episodes. <br /> <br /> Attention: Greek myths. What this lacked in Minghella's nuance (a different writer), in part, fills the courage because it represents more compassion and respect and history than the four chosen myths.
