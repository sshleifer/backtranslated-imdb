IMDb forces reviewers to write a number of lines, but I want to say - "It's an incredible movie and you can't read yourself as a movie fan without seeing it." You should just trust me and stop reading this review and get a movie and a start-up game. But I have to write something. So, let me point out the following: <br /> <br /> (1) River's Edge contains what can still be Crispin Glover's most fun and best movie of all time, and if you have followed Crispin Glover at all, you know that this alone justifies giving it 10. Funny lines are many. <br /> <br /> River's Edge includes the second most memorable result of Dennis Hopper's career (except for Blue Velvet) and it's really great. Dennis Hopper is really funny. <br /> <br /> River's Edge contains the best results from the Keanu Reeves career and it is great. It was his role to play. He has many good features, but it is really funny. Listen closely when his character and father talk to each other. <br /> <br /> Still the best stoner movie, it's much more than just. It tends to appear in drama parts of movie rental stores, but if it's drama, it's always a more fun drama.
