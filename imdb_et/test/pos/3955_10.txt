Recently, I saw a dark spot in Coyoacan, where he pulled a huge crowd and some quite intense discussions. I really wondered the story and the visual approach. Action is a scary and lonely mood that movie projects are amazing. There is a lot of beauty in the melancholy surrounding these three heroes. Not only in the desert, but also in the city. My best scene was after the boy discovered his friends in the apartment and then his skateboard rides through all the spectacular lights of the city. You know this guy. I never heard of the participants before, but I liked all three. I think they did a great job of discovering it. All in all, it is an amazingly cool and stopping movie. I still have a lot of pictures in my mind.
