I have to say, when it comes to Movie Movie adaptations, the BBC rarely gives me a shot. Now for this mini-series. I love the Starling novel, it's the best murder / mystery I've ever read. Mini series, it shamelessly made my day when I saw it. The primary story was almost intact. The characters fit the novel very well, the personalities and modes were on the spot for red and Jesi. I thought Duncan was doing very well when Kate, Eric came from too simple a character, he was a bit deeper in the book, but they also changed their sub-story that they should have dealt with it. Of course there are changes, but most of them are cosmetic, but some I found disappointing, Eric's murder charge sub-story and it changed all the dynamics between Red and Eric for the film and they cut out Triathalon's training Jez was doing. Some other events in the book become friendly to the viewer. Just like if you liked the book, if you like the mini series, you'll love this book. I have to say that this is the most accurate book to customize the movie I've seen.
