Sam Lion (Jean Paul Belmondo) discovers that he has to take time, because everything around him goes a long way and dies. If he discovers those he loves, he still loves love, and he will be assisted by Albert Duvivier (Richard Anconina). Looking for his past, his own desires, this fabulous Claude Lelouch movie is mature in human maturity. <br /> <br /> As with all Lelouch movies, the continuous kickback of the movie is possible. Be amazing, especially the scenes where Paul Belmondo (who looks like his father) plays young Sam Lion, while Sam Lion is in the same room - a setback after a second time. <br /> <br /> One of Lelouch's most difficult works, the L'itineraire d'un infant gate is a black vision of self-realization.
