Many other comments about the movie say it all - just add that we showed it to about 30 in our cinema last week, and it got an overall average score of 8.6. We would like 100% of this for today's audiences, especially if they see it on a real cinema screen and can later talk to others like our audience did. <br /> <br /> The performance of all the performances of the troupe alone was incredible and quite enchanting. Of course, Finney and Courtenay were really stars. but all were well cast. For our afternoon audience, most of whom are "elderly citizens", there was a serious impact that the plot can be easily tracked due to the clarity of speech and the excellent non-technical use of the camera and sound. > <br /> How wonderful, many said to see a really big movie that is British: still twenty years later: not full of blood and guts: not confused because bob-on-all-over-the- place camera shots and back and forth through history: no sex for sex. Some younger people expressed such views.
