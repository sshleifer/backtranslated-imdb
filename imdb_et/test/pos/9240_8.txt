I also apologize for the somewhat impartial opinion of this endeavor when I contributed to the soundtrack. Yet I got my copy, sat back and enjoyed the roll of symbols, which were probably more colorful than the ones they gave up in this shanghai story. For those who feel that George Bush is a "believable Texan", there is no need to look beyond this film to crush the image that Texas is full of truck-leading, one-dimensional rednecks. The cast contains some of the most intelligent, original and humorous people you can find everywhere because they attack embarrassment, bliss and frustration with the excellent film order, budget, guerilla style (ie "punk rock style") each person helps to define). <br /> <br /> This is a great documentary made of passion and guts and all the poison you have to break through any industry bus. and do what you do (take note of authors, painters, musicians and co-workers). He listens to the reliability of the first wave of American hardcore music as the term "D.I.Y." was a standard, a period where courage, passion and commitment were more than techniques, style or valuable calculations. Not that it doesn't have enough technique or style ... the documentary tone is quite refreshing. Editing cuts provide as much drama as this dialog. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​creating a documentary film about the death of a cast devil, team, and director is great, totally in Texas and absolutely punk rock. In a more realistic sense of the term.
