There are some aspects to Park movies, and especially Wallace and Gromit, which I would say would be so big. The first is the fineness and observation, the flagship of which is the character of Gromid. He's not talking, he's not making any noise, all he has is his eyes, eyebrow and posture, and he orders them with the film. The park manages to give us everything we need through its silent nature through its expression. Comedy and emotions are carried through the smallest movement and it works perfectly well. <br /> <br /> Watching a movie must be aware of the entire screen. Usually, movies are directed to things, the screen is not moved too much, there are not many things to keep away from the eye or activity. The park seems to need a different look at your movies. He throws extra content to his audience, in the background it is, even next to the screen, and in the foreground there is almost always something that stands out in your eyes. Watching and discovering his films is versatile, with jokes and side effects. shadows that give way to abandonment. You can imagine that films have always been an event for Park and the movies he loves are what he wants to see again. This is what his films and his most loved characters show. <br /> <br /> Then there are the strange and nervous inventions Wallace does, which is reflected in the story and the turn. The plot is all odd and wall-mounted, but it seems so normal in this world. You can imagine that there is Wallace's mind in Park. <br /> <br /> There is another thing that makes these films so unique and it is modeling and precise manual animation. I have to admit that I was worried when I knew Dreamworks was involved in making this film, and I thought they would bring their computer to the forefront of animation. I was frightened that Wallace & Gromit became CGI units or the smallest CGIs to clean up the modeling added to the movie. <br /> <br /> Not so. The characters still have tips and tool marks and the film is not far away, but it adds so much real feeling and a sense of physical depth to the screen and characters. <br /> <br /> So what about the movie? Well, I have to say that wringing the plot was something I was thinking of before the movie in the movie and it wasn't a surprise, but it didn't affect my enjoyment a little. In fact, the comic timing of the twists and turns and the reactions and reactions was all, and it was just as sucked to me as if it was a thriller, but all the time I smiled. <br /> <br /> The film was exciting in many ways. To see the animation, how natural are the inventions, how Wallace goes in trouble and Gromit gets her out, where all the cross references are in the movie and where all the fun is! After that, I must tell my friends that I couldn't believe how much I had left. <br /> <br /> There's nothing more in this movie than with others, here's a new level of humor, and I don't mean rude jokes (though there are a couple who are just so British that you can't laugh), I mean jokes, that just fly over the kids but hit the adult face. What you are used to seeing comes out like Pixar. It just adds more to the movie. <br /> <br /> All right, let me try and be a bit negative. I did not notice the sounds of this movie, you know how to listen to the participants and see if you can recognize them? Well, I was just in the movie to take care of or see who they were ... okay, it's not negative. Let me try again. The main plot was not as strong and engaging as I expected, and I found myself in a lullaby and in my own characters ... again ... it's not a bad thing, the movie was just as rich entertainment. <br /> <br /> I can't honestly say a bad thing about this movie, probably the worst thing is that the title queue is quite repetitive at the end ... until the final title! Really, this is the worst thing I can say. <br /> <br /> The story is fun, well-set, well written, well done. There are many fantastic characters here, not just Wallace & Gromit. There are so many cases on the screen, so many references and jokes (see Lady Tottingham's dresses), cheese jokes everywhere, jokes for the whole family. The characters are great to absorb and you will find that you have understood them before. That movie has so much for everyone. <br /> <br /> I can say so much and write about it, but I know it will quickly turn into a park and Aardman setback, as well as this series would be "a little bit really funny" and "there is a bit more .. . ‚Äù, and what I'd rather do is say it's a great movie to see and experience the whole thing for yourself. I'm saying bunnies are great!
