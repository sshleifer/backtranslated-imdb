I loved this example. I was expecting it to come out on the DVD ... it has never been. Does anyone know how to get an example on a DVD? I've contacted a lifetime TV and some others and nothing. Please let me know if there is a way we can get this series on DVD. I'd be the first to buy it. I really tried this exhibition. I don't understand how many other TV shows are available on the DVD, but not on any day. I am sure there are many people who love this series on DVD or even VHS. I thought I'd contact the production company. Has anyone tried to contact this information?
