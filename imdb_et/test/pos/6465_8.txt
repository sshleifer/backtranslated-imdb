Although this little film has disappeared after the water region, the classes on the outskirts of the city may have their own star-cornered classic. This is another story about docks and the silent code that regulates it. <br /> <br /> Along with the corrupt alliance that Lee J. Cobb ran at The Waterfront, Jack Warden is really a small corruption. But he's quite real, because one of the dock bands who scares other employees, is at hand with his fist and a rescue hook, and he gets the rest of his hard-earned money back. And that's all the money earned in this service. <br /> <br /> One man, Warden, cannot scare that Sidney Poitier is the second gang head and when he tries to intimidate the newcomer John Cassavet, Poitier takes him under his wing. Two are developing friendships and Poitier and his wife, Ruby Dee, even improve Cassavets with Kathleen Maguir. <br /> <br /> Warden is really a nonsense creature and it is sad how he, through the power of personality and physical prosperity, cows almost everyone else. In this sense, he is tougher than Lee J. Cobb, who had to rely on a quarter of the Goons crusade to enforce his will. <br /> <br /> The city mark was Martin's big-screen debut Ritt, who did a good job with the good presence of New York players and on-the-spot cinematography. The movie is shown with a small budget, but you're so impressive when the band is cast, which you don't really care about. <br /> <br /> Cassavete, as a single with a past and hip and tough Poitier, is both good, but my personal favorite in this movie is Ruby Dee. He should have received a prize for his performance, his final scene with Cassavetes is great. <br /> <br /> Get it wherever possible. I want it to be on DVD or VHS.
