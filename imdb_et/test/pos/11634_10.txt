Yes, barney is now pointless, but when I was a child, it was quite meaningful. <br /> <br /> I haven't been smarter, but I enjoyed it. when the child was mocked because no one could say their name so I changed it. since I was 4 years old, I have been named Tina Barney because I can be related to her nature from another culture. I'm 17 years old and barney is a big part of my life. ... my name came from this .... I can't show that I grew up no matter how stupid it seems now. <br /> <br /> I don't care if I blocked that I have nothing more to say. they should not make at least 10 lines because some people just don't have much to say. Okay, done
