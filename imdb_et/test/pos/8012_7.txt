me and the dull friends who make up the university - alberto lopez, dave hall, celina alcock (we finished uea, norwich, uk 1997), are still gathering together and watching b movies. <br /> <br /> We are the perfect experts in the art of making a bad movie, and this movie was put on the top ten of terrible / brilliant movies. <br /> <br /> So if you just have beer and weed control and need a movie that laughs like DROID GUNNER or PHOENIX 2, it's for you! Marc Singer is fully aware that he is here in turkey, and milk all he can! Matthius Hues is sublime in his wood and interpersonal morality (is it the word ??) when he grunts "But I want my 20 thousand!" Pure Shlock Gold! If you liked it, see also: TRANCERS, RUNESTONE, DOLLMAN and something from Charles Band or Fred I Ray ... (but caution: some of their films are totally and completely without merit and you scream those lost hours of your life !!! !!).
