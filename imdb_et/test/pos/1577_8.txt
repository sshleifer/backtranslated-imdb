When they gave prizes for the most corrupt and confusing films in the world, the Japanese cinema would be cleaned up: exploiting them in the cinema wipes the floor with most other candidates, the most extreme examples being totally jaw exercises with bad taste, nausea gore, freakish strange and misogynous sex. <br /> <br /> Beauty has been a role model for a rugged, offering attentive viewers a little over an hour of glimpse and free violence. very mad J-splatter goodness. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a young woman named Yoshimi, whose search for her lost sister has led her to some nasty yakuza, who will continue to rape her and shoot her with a strong dragon called Angel Rain. After the gangsters have finished their fun with the poor woman, she can escape and flee to a nearby hospital where the sexual psychologist Hiromi (Megumi Ozawa) is trying to help. But the frustrated and confused Yoshimi throws himself off the roof of the hospital, becoming a venom monon when he hits the ground (at least what seemed to me!). <br /> <br /> Death of Yoshimi, Hiromi attracts Higashi, a member of yakuza, into his office, and when he pulls him out, he hypnotizes the members of his colleagues. After Higashi is happy with a knife at the headquarters of Yakuza, he is severely beaten and drilled, forced to say his meeting with Hirom and then hacked into pieces. <br /> <br /> The psychologist has then been caught by a gang, forcing him to force (forced at the same time to force the head to Yakuza bitch) and inject with Angel Rain, after which he immediately called. Gangsters then tend to put their body in their car launcher with Higash's scraps ready to be destroyed. <br /> <br /> Before they can trap the bodies, the superparel has an unexpected effect on Hirom: he returns from the dead as a hermaphroditic monster with a toothpick and a terrible blow, and in hellbent revenge sets yakuza to kill one by one; it brings some somewhat memorable splashes, including a dirty headache, a person killed by a monstrous quirky vagina, and a woman killed by her gigantic, swarming fall. <br /> <br /> Probably you can say from the above summary, this is some crazy, twisted stuff and probably not the taste of the most intelligent people, but for those strangers who are tired of the mainstream cinema for a long time and who are already redundant in Asia, be amazingly guiding and deviant. <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.
