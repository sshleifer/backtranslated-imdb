Gilmore Girls is a fun show with endless sarcasm, common sense and charm. At age 16, Lorelai Gilmore was born to Rory Gilmore. He left his parents and got a job. Now the relationship between Lorelai and Rory is what many mothers and daughters envy. They are the best friends. Girls have a thorough knowledge of films and TV shows and are constantly quoting them. In the first season, Lorelai needs money to send to Rory Chilton (a highly respected high school) so she has to reluctantly turn to her parents. They give them money peacefully, but in return Rory must come with dinner every Friday night. I highly recommend this exhibition. I love it!
