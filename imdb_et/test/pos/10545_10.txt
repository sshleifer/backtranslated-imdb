I can honestly say this movie is the most fantastic movie ever !!! If you have a comedy mood, I recommend this movie completely! So, here's a summary. It is this girl (Nikki) who is fourteen and a half years old and she is going to rest with her father (Andre) whom she has not seen for about two years. He expects the vacation to be completely boring until he meets the boy (Ben) who is much older than him. So to impress her, she says she's not on her father's vacation, but on the lover. It's a hysterical movie from start to finish and I highly recommend it. So rent and have fun !!!
