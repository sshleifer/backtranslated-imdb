At the end of the sixties, director Sergio Corbucci made four spaghetti westerns - classic THE MERCENARY, GREAT SILENCE, SPECIALISTS and COMPANEROS. Of these three, except the SPECIALISTS, the westerns of spaghetti are ranked among the top ten. Until recently, everything I had seen was very poor quality compilation with some English, some Italian, fuzzy pictures, and it was almost incomprehensible. Now, having seen a beautiful widescreen version with subtitles (still in two languages), I can safely add the four classics to these professionals. Johnny Halliday is very good as a charismatic Hud, an infamous hand where the weapon returns to Blackstone to investigate the death of his brother, which the townspeople agreed to lose their savings. It includes the bold beauty of the bank, El Diablo, the Mexican bandit leader, who once had friends with Hud, the honest sheriffs dreaming of the better days, and the small hippie band - well, it was in the late sixties, and the hippies were everywhere, probably in our western part . It's not in the wilderness to the west, somewhere in the alps, and it's nice to look. A little more nudity when I wait in the west, but it's not bad. Sylvie Fennec is as beautiful as Sheba, who may be Hud's niece or girlfriend of a dead brother ... it has never become clear. This film deserves to be seen and again we dig a nice DVD with all the decorations - I think the professionals would be as well known as the other Corbucci westerners, and that is really commendable.
