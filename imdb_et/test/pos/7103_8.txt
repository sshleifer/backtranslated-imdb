The Drakula House was made at the end of the universe's horror cycle of the 1940s and I've seen it a few times. <br /> <br /> Doc Hull, Edelman is developing plants for the serum that heals people. Count Dracula reaches his vampire and Lawrence Talbot then looks at whether he can treat him as an adult werewolf. Then Frankenstein's monster is discovered and Edelman brings him back to life, as the villagers descend to the castle and shoot. However, Talbot, now treated and one of Edelman's female assistants, is safe. <br /> <br /> As with many kind of movies, we have a horse assistant and a thunderstorm to move it. <br /> <br /> Cast includes Universal Horror regular Lon Chaney Jr (The Wolf Man), John Carradine (House of Frankenstein) and Glenn Strange as Frankenstein monster. Also featured are Onslow Stevens (Them!), Lionel Atwill (The Vampire Bat) and Martha O'Driscoll. <br /> <br /> The House of Dracula must be seen by all old horror fans. Very fun. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
