Enchanting cinematography from Sergei Urusevsky helps make it a stunning work. Opening scenes are like when somebody is going through a photographer's album and when the story begins to emerge, both the depicted events and the beautiful look are wiped out. Everything is well photographed, but there are several whole sequences that are just breathtaking. Difficult to describe without "spoiled", but it is enough to say that one is a very intense scene during an air attack and the lady behind her and her lover's brother is in conflict with the breakage of sirens and windows. Another title is a rotating staircase and a borehole spinning ball, and even forms a fantasy sequence. Soviet film makes the highest order.
