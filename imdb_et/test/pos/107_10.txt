Just one of the best Indian movies. Allow it not to say much (I did this after a 15-minute view). But I can really say that the fire is one of the really beautiful and brilliant movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> Beautiful pictures. The best example I can give is between two female lines (Radha and Sita) and Hindu mythology with the same characters. For example, Sita is honored by Lord Ram's husband. As the legend goes, Ram surrenders his wife by doing her fire to prove her purity. Sita shouts and leaves her, reuniting with her mother (Earth). This is a story of any mad link with two Indian women (Nandita Das and Shabana Azmi). The word "fire" suddenly has many meanings - marriage, tradition, religion, motherhood, and probably some others I couldn't. Many who had been offended by this film should actually be the first to see Fire (eg my mother who really loved it). Why? Because Fire is an attack on tradition, it is also an attack on tradition. In other words, it's strength, not its weakness. Traditional conservative social mores (whether Indian or Canadian or American or any) are useless when enslaving you. Gender roles and denial can do both. <br /> <br /> These are the things I took with the fire. Hats for Deepa Mehta?
