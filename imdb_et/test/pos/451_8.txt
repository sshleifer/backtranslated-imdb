Yul Brynner was the wildest symbol of the 50-year-old tines, playing in 1956 as a Russian leader in this country during the Revolution, which made this a Marxist. <br /> <br /> The manuscript of this film gave the writer a good taste of mixing love and adventure with different characters in Hungary to England. <br /> <br /> The best point of this film was the symbol of the challenge of killing Hungarian resistance in the film hall of the Russian Ambassador (Yul Brynner), which gave thought to this great flaw in his bad work, but at the end he did a good job of helping Deborah Kerr Escape and her sweetheart to London to write good work in her book to ultimately gain the people's consent and confidence after the murder of Hungary.
