Nice to see comedy for adults. Masterfully structured Aaron Sorkin through Mike Nichols' own mastery. The mastery of Mr. Nichol is to present all the characters in his shocking truth, the sad and riveting Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, "Who is afraid of Virginia Woolf" to the sad and wretched Julia Roberts, Clive Owen, Jude Law and Natalie Portman "Closer". "Charlie Wilson's War" is a shocking truth outside the characters, and sad and riveting Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams are something else, it's just a few points. Hanks must burst his glory into the individual chess, and Julia Roberts throws the party and boldly introduces straightforward signs. Amy Adams is a witness and witness. An unrivaled task that Miss Adams can overcome beautifully. Philip Seymour Hoffman's Gus, however, has monopolized his attention. His character may not be the first, but it is the first way Hoffman introduced us to us. Someone who lives with such an irregularity that he treats the absolute conviction that he is wiser than all of them put together. Hoffman is great. Changing the story will help you not to fall into numerous useless issues. Sharp, short, smart, sad comedy and when was the last time to say it?
