Probably one of his lesser-known films, he has the same lack of contact as in El Salvador, because it is actually his best. <br /> <br /> Eric Bogosian wrote and plays, Talk Radio tells the opinion of a radiotelephone that disturbs the wrong listener. The film is important and there is a lot to say about freedom in freedom and just how free it should be, and you can easily say that it started life in the show. You know what to get before you sit down to watch it and you're fine. <br /> <br /> In fact, it is not really like Bogosian steals a movie, he wrote and was unable to take my eyes off and it was part of many listeners; The people who hated him did not interrupt the cases they did not miss. <br /> <br /> Not for everyone, but for a very good drama and a very good movie in general.
