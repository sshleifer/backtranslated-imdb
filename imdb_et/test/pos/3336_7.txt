This is a better than average entry in the Saint series - it keeps your interests and, as the mystery should, keeps you till the end and there are several suspects. The golden age is not for all tastes, especially for younger viewers. They wear clothes, cars, settings, etc. Who today asks for highball? Or wearing a suit and tie everywhere? And the legal process was so much easier - there must have been a lawyer's weakness. Frankly, these days there is not much of value. <br /> <br /> In any case, go with it and enjoy it. That's good - in the old-fashioned sense.
