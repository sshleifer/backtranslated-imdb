Aaliyah blows out all the female cast members out of the water, including the official love interest of Marguerite Moreau. <br /> <br /> I would have loved seeing this movie as an Akasha race. Aaliyah is just a screen when it is on the screen. He makes a sensual, beautiful and threatening force for 10. Watching a full vampire bar is a vision. <br /> <br /> Lena Olin is in the ungrateful role of the "older woman", which is extremely unjustified. She looks fantastic and still looks stunning at 46 (according to IMDb). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story is very limited, we've seen it before, and so on. <br /> <br /> Akasha's death scene is the closest to his heart, especially remembering what happened to Aaliyah after filming. <br /> <br /> All in all, there is a remarkable vampire movie.
