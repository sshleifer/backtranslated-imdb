Supposedly, the erotic night of the Living Dead has been restored with the same pain and setting, but it certainly does not have Laura Gemser. A lot of what I like about this movie. Of course, it is enough that the story and the dialogue are codswallop, but it is so beautifully filmed in such a wonderful environment and I really like hardcore. I find it immediately natural and exotic, and that doesn't just mean that there is a black girl and some slender penis! I find that numerous and diverse sexual scenes are very plausible, even if two are set in an ocean-side wood chambers where waves are constantly spraying. The creature does not see it appear half an hour before the end, and it must be said, disappointment. However, during the remainder of the day, he will be able to kill two of the two on the expedition and if the girls have sex with them for the first time (or at least in one case later!) And this film is not as slow as some will keep. Moreover, there are some sexual moments, especially the female scientist and her claim against the two "natives", and the glorious finale, when two survivors rush on their boat, look back to the island where they have fled, and find there is still time for one last copulation to do it.
