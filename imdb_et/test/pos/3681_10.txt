I saw this movie for the first time at a film festival. 10 minutes after the end of the movie, the gay couple walked to me and asked me if I needed help - I was still sitting, crying like a maniac. The film is cheesy, it's strange, it's up, it's gay - but it's amazing. I think every sign is plausible. Everett is characterized by a woman who only tries to help, she throws out her (terrible) friends brutally, she has a storm, she can damage a flight, a "flight" that killed her life's love twice. Bates is a miracle, he is perfect as a role. A woman whose love and admiration is so strong that she even loves her homosexual lover is the essence of true love for me. I even understand Maxi (husband), he is bored of his life, he has a midlife crisis. He moves out, tries to lead an exciting life, but to understand a) that he is really a boring part of his relationship and b) that he loves his wife. I love the fact that he will eventually return to him because I think it will give the film the right balance between dreams and reality. Finally, he is his wife and he may not be as exciting as Victor, but he is real, he is a man he loves very underground. I watched it about 50 times and I love this movie, all this unconditionally. BTW, just read Rupert Everett's autobiography and UL is the only movie he's talking about as one of the best movies he ever did. For me, this is the best film he has ever made.
