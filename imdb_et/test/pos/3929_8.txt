Although HOUSE OF WAX can never get lost with Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE or HALLOWEEN, it manages to be a worthy addition to high quality horror movies. There are enough tensions and enough imitations to please today's young audiences and there are enough explicit gore to squeeze some yesterday. In general, this DVD is a well-made film that should work well. <br /> <br /> Six kids on a football game go to DELIVERANCE as a setup and that actually looks like it would have been removed from the Deilverance sequel and the back ground will be pampered by the group. Finally, the group must break and the parties drive into the car to get some car parts. The other half of the group is left in the camp and it creates a movie for the other party. <br /> <br /> House of Wax has many strengths. First, it is blessed with very pleasant pain. Paris Hilton is good in his role, but he is far from the center. Chad Michael Murray, Elisabeth Cuthbert and Brian Van Holt are three very charismatic actors, and their presence in the film adds some panic, some credibility and some elegance. I had never heard of Chad Michael Murray, but he was a pin-up teen heartthrob. But he has his presence. She nurtures her intangible, which seems to have translated her performance. She is instantly pleasant and has a strong trait. I enjoyed his work much more than I thought, and when he was on the screen, the film flowed. <br /> <br /> Now the question is, "Is this movie worth the horror movie?" And the answer to this is surprising YES. As I mentioned above, it's not in the same class NIGHTMARE IS ELM STREET or LAST HOUSE on the left or even RING, but it's relatively tense, pretty graphic, and there are some very resourceful death scenes. This is not the WAX ​​HOUSE that your parents told you. Vincent Price is nowhere to be seen, and when you start seeing your fingers break and the hot wax that covers the coma, you realize that this movie is a bit of an edge. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see an uncompromised version of the uncut director X. I bet there is one somewhere that would be much stronger than that. Be it as it is, it's a very good entry into horror music and it's head and shoulders above the weak films, as I know what you did last summer and BACK TO WATER AND some others. Definitely worth a look. <br /> <br /> 8/10
