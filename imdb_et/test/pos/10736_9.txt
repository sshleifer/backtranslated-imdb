I think not! I mean, if you compare this movie to a godfather, or maybe a little older movie like Casablanca, or maybe a little newer movie like an English patient. It doesn't have camera work or cinematography like these other movies, but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie or is it? I think the reason why this film is underestimated is that many people always compare it to other big Oscar winning films (it should never be done), making the film's beauty and realism difficult. In the Best Picture, Best Actor in Leadership and Best Actor in Supporting Role, this movie really did all of them. Excellent Dustin Hoffman once again gives us his best performances. A few times in this movie I forgot that it wasn't his son because it was just so real! I've never seen a movie in relationships with different families where participants were so easy to play that particular role, but still so beautiful. So Dustin Hoffman passes the test with flying colors, in my opinion. There are some actors in the world who deserve to be named the best: Katherine Hepburn, Meryl Streep, Jane Fonda and Ingrid Bergman (I can't help, I think she's great). Meryl Streep, though she has a supporting role, is amazing and real and you just can't help but be on her talents and how she does her and the real thing. Oh, that's all I can say. Justin Henry was great in his age, his tears and his relationship with his mother and father were beautiful, so I say good work to Justin Henry. <br /> <br /> Although I watched this movie for the third time, I could no longer cry. I tried, but I couldn't. Thank God I was alone! This is probably the cleanest film I've ever seen. Other films that were the best picture were Apocalypse Now, Norma Rae, Breaking Away and All That Jazz. I am ashamed because I have not seen any of them, but what I have heard the Apocalypse is now great, but when I heard about Norma Raest, I was just thinking of Sally Field. I think that this film has been awarded to 5 Oscars for other candidates and that it also affects other people and calls for a long time, as has been the case in the last 28 years. All the actors and actors in the film are doing a good job, giving us great performances and memories of watching the movie we never forget. <br /> <br /> Thank you for your time.
