This movie is a great scary action and comedy, it starts right from the beginning, there is no boring reconstruction. Chemistry of leading roles adds excitement and expectation to the end, although my doubts were not met. Special effects worked great and were credible! It would have wanted a different end, but it was still in emotion. The story rises well, but it's a movie that you need to look carefully at from beginning to end to gather all the details to fully understand and get maximum enjoyment. <br /> <br />
