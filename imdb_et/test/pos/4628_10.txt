It was riveting. I just didn't see it. When the film was rolled out, I began to feel it was powerful and confrontational, but I had no idea how much more intense it would be. <br /> <br /> The film gives an overview of what is unfortunately the everyday life of many school students. Some of us live outside this environment and walk and don't know what's going on. <br /> <br /> Parents need to see this movie especially to see what their children are going through. Often, parents leave their children's problems trivial, but unfortunately they are massive for higher education. And, unfortunately, the problems may worsen for a tragedy. <br /> <br /> Certainly everyone must see.
