OKAY. Warning for anyone who is a parent or guardian. Be careful about seeing this movie - ie. I'll explain why. <br /> <br /> 1 - The title is misleading and the film has nothing to do with romance - I assume it was completely intentional on behalf of the producers, but it is annoying 2 - the movie itself is really very annoying. I have some problems - firstly, the fact that the film is neither violent nor sexual and is therefore not a horror film. But this is a very disturbing film involving a child and his parents and a small town. <br /> <br /> OK, it boils down. The film is not suitable for minors because it contains sequences and images that are unpleasant and would be confusing for the child. Does it have strange quality and it is ONLY because it has a child that makes me feel unsuitable. As a parent, I feel strongly enough that I would like to tell people because I only read on the second day that he had a release in theaters. <br /> <br /> I hope he doesn't break the filmmakers by saying this, but I think it's my right because he gets liberated and only has M rating (because it's not violent or sexual). Just weird and disturbing, but pretty good.
