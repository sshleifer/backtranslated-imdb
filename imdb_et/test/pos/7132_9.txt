I saw it on a screening of GenCon in Indy. I had time to kill and decided to review it. It played in a permanent room packed around 1000 people. <br /> <br /> Wow what to drive! The script was tight. Action tense. Stimulation is perfect. Exposure to nature is great. One thing I really appreciated was that you knew it wasn't a big budget movie. But soon it became clear that the creators pushed their kit and effects as far as possible, despite their limitations. And it was more than enough. <br /> <br /> It is true that this film was aimed at certain audiences - gamers / board players - the creators did not try to hide it. But other filmmakers could learn a lot from them. Because after the Yugoslav mode of the scene and not worrying about whether the mother who is watching is watching it the most, they laugh again and again. But there is enough universality that the mother laughs even if she is not at every joke. I think too many times I see movies that try to make so few bars to the lowest common denominator so they turn to most people, but the film ends up suffering for it. <br /> <br /> Not that flick. Indeed, this film was so strong that the audience had it around with the finger opening loans. And while the viewers around me want to like the movie, they were not pushovers - players can be the most critical niche out there. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad I could see this big crowd. At least ten times the audience had such a good time that they would be joking or screaming during the movie. How often does it take place in screening? It should not be surprising that there was an enormous standing alliance at the time of the closing credit. <br /> <br /> For my part, I can't wait until it's released. After that, one of the manufacturers said they were shooting for simultaneous TV / DVD release. This date cannot come fast enough.
