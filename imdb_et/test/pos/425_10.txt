I'm sick with lots of young and helpless people, I'm talking about my "problems" all the time, independently, boring and totally annoying (popular; Dawson's Creek; Beverly Hills etc). "Hack" is a breath of fresh air with a great actor (David Morse), a completely different plot of land, trusted people with real problems (thanks to God!) And a very, very good history. I just love it !! I hope that "Hack" will continue for a long time, because it has grown for large TV series for people, for change.
