Lackawanna Blues is a great movie. The casting was perfect. Every actor and actor perfectly matched their role. Their chemistry was amazing. Action was great. I felt like I knew these signs. I can almost feel them. They reminded me of the people I knew as a child born in the 1950s and '60s. Oh, memories! My personal belief is that this movie should have been on the big screen to see everyone. I watched this movie so many times that I can almost draw the lines that characters tell them. I can't even list my favorite item because I have so many pets. Thank you for bringing back the part of your youth that I do not see on this day and age ... and it is the black people who love each other, looking at each other, respecting each other, caring for each other and doing everything we can to help each other. I have to go now. I have to see it again.
