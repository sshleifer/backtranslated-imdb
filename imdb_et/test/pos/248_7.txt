This is definitely an excellent 1944 music with great young stars and famous veteran artists led by Charles Vidor. Rita Hayworth, (Rusty Parker), "Charlie Chan in Egypt", sang and danced with Gene Kelly (Danny McGuire), "Anchors", Danny McGuire had a nightclub in Brooklyn, NY and in love with Rusty Parker, who was a dancer in her club with Phil Silvers, (Genius), Coney Island, who was a comedian, and worked with Danny, Rusty. Otto Kruger, (John Coudair), "Duel in the Sun," played a role in promoting a girl's magazine and decided that Rusty Parker would be her top model. The music of Jerome Kerni is heard throughout the picture and the song "Long Ago & Far Away" is the music of this music theme. This film was nominated for several awards and was a great hit during World War II, which kept the spirit of the nation at that time. Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly were instant hit and their career exploded on the silver screen for many years. Great music and a movie that you don't want to miss is really a great classic movie. enjoy
