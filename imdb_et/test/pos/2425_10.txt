This film needs a lot of patience. As it focuses on mood and character formation, the plot is very simple and many scenes take place in the same set - the apartment Frances Austen (Sandy Dennis). But the film is based on a disturbing climax. It is very interesting that Robert Altman led it, considering the style and structure of his other films. Nonetheless, there is the audio style of the Altman brand here and there. I think this movie is really a great performance by Sandy Dennis. It's definitely one of his darkest signs, but he's playing it so completely and convincingly that it's scary. Michael Burns does a good job as a "mouth" young man. Regular Altman player Michael Murphy has a small part. The sacred, spirited set fits very well with the content of the story. In short, this film is a powerful study of loneliness, sexual repression and despair. Be patient, enjoy the atmosphere and note the wonderfully written script. <br /> <br /> I thank Robert Altman. It's one of his many films dealing with unusual, exciting topics. This movie is annoying, but it is sincere and it certainly gives the viewer a strong emotional response. If you want to see an unusual movie - some may even say weird - it's worth the time. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is very difficult to find in video stores. Maybe you need to buy it off the internet.
