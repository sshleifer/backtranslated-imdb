If you haven't seen this movie, do it. Its genremix like I've never seen before. Some very surrealistic scenes, some fun funny things, a movie-choppy, a musical number with a swing, sex scenes (2nd best-played orgasm on a film supported by Sally alone), Orson Welles pitch, mixed into a work of art. As a work of art, it does not have to be logical at the end, at least not logical to everyone ;-). I had a copy of VHS, but I borrowed it for a former girlfriend and now I can't get it back. But the movie should be in Austria on 10.06.03 and be sure.
