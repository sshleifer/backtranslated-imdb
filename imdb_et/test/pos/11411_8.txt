The film is about a girl who is not going to camp just because she's a babysitter this evening. Something weird about it, right? Until ... The phone rings. Until ... The phone rings again. And again ... And again. These are not some stupid prank calls. This is real. If you want to see a girl react, just look at the movie. <br /> <br /> A great atmosphere full of frightening sounds. Very well done by young Camilla Belle, who took the lead. I see great potential in him to become a good actor. This is more than just a decent thriller, I have no idea why it is so underestimated. Anyway, I think this movie deserves more than just 4/10. 24% of all voters rated film 1. There was no better thriller for this title.
