The story told by The Cranes is not really all that original. Young lovers are separated by war; bad things happen to both. We've seen it several times already. <br /> <br /> However, we have not filmed it well with bold shots that take liberties to emphasize isolation or destruction or hopelessness. Even more remarkable is the Soviet Union and the reason to conclude that Tarkovsky is not the last word in today's Soviet cinema. <br /> <br /> I read Chekhov's "Three Sisters" on the second day and began to drive in the meaning of this movie title. In Law 2, Masha challenges the understanding that we must live our lives without meaning or understanding: <br /> <br /> "MASHA: Certainly, mankind must believe or at least look for the truth, otherwise life is simply emptiness, emptiness to live and not to know why cranes are flying, why children are born, why are the stars in heaven, do you need to know why you live, or everything is negligible - just nonsense, and Veronika is hard to believe that war and the suffering of others and others are Better to attribute meaning, to live as if life was important and not to despair. Perhaps the idea of ​​putting him in his movie for the final work. <br /> <br /> BTW as a minor correction to another comment here - may the film has a Vi pattern, although I had not noticed them, but the first letter of Veronika's name is not yet another example of it, in Cyrillic, its name stands for a letter that looks like English "B".
