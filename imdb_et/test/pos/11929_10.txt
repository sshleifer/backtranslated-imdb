These movies just don't get the credit they deserve. This is my 2nd favorite movie all the time (Stand By Me is 1.) The reason for watching this movie was that Wil Wheaton was in it and he is my favorite person all over the world and I think he did amazing work on this movie and so also Sean Astin. I just watched it last night and it just amazed me. Everything in the movie is very extraordinary. Script, a workable scenario. I was over 80% of my time and if my mother wasn't in the room, I would have heard absolutely when Joey Trotta (Wil Wheaton) died. I didn't see it coming! Overall !! I was really surprised to hear that it wasn't popular in the 90s. I was born a few years after she came out, of course, I didn't see it in theaters, but I'm sure I would be alive. If any of my friends watched it, they would be "uhh okay?" but it just causes them not enough cool to evaluate this job. If you haven't seen this movie and don't want to see something that is a bomb, this is the movie you're watching.
