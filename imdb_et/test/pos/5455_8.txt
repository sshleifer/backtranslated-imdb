*** SPOILERS *** This film depicts the brutal blood caused by Johnny Carson's retirement to determine who succeeds. The incarnations of David Letterman and Jay Leno are performed satisfactorily by John Michael Higgins and Daniel Roebuck, although the performances were not great. Reni Santoni is the best performer of "execs" (he plays John Agoglia from NBC) and Warren Littlefield (played by Bob Bali) is second. I was shocked at how Littlefield eagerly discussed dumping over Johnny Carson. That was Johnny Carson! This scene threatens the curve that you-have-done-me-lately in the world of television. Kathy Bates gave the best result to Jay agent Helen Kushnick. The other commentator confirmed that Leno was simple on film. I respectfully respect. The relationship with Kushnick was limited to domestic violence. He tells him to be around, and when he finally rebels, he tries to play a sympathy card (mentioning his dead wife and son); But when Jay ends her relationship, she turns violent again, shouting, "Don't miss me, then double bastard!" before mixing the picture on the floor. In general, the movie is fun and I want it to be shown more often.
