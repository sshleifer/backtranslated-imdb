I also joined IMDB only to comment on this movie, but so I can sing this praise. I had never heard of this movie (it's packed so awfully that it's easy to understand why it went over), but a good friend suggested it to me and I'm so glad she did. It's a pearl of the movie. The actors are great (especially Kathy Bates and Meredith Eaton) and look like they are really fun. Of course it was a bit over the top, but I don't remember the last time I laughed so hard or several times in two hours. If you love to laugh, it owes you to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
