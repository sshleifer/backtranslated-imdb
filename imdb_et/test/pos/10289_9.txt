It's a clever story about relationships and three main categories of players in the relationship game: playboys (Max), manipulating women (Alice) and fools who can really fall in love (Lisa, Muriel and Lucien). br /> <br /> Max and Alice are very unlikely and perhaps despicable characters, but are always in control of the game, leaving their partners in the dark. But as the proudly discussed end tells us that veteran players Max and Alice were, they would be happy to participate in every way they see fit, as if the game was just over and each of them doesn't care less to get their own life and play some other anonymous person when another opportunity presents itself. Lisa, Muriel, and Lucien could be the ones who felt that they were investing in a real relationship, but could not understand that they were confusing and ultimate losers (as far as we have shown that it is ...) who knows whether they are some kind of players on their worlds that have not been shown on the screen). <br /> <br /> This is a very fast paced, delicately designed and seductively funny story that is an appealing embodiment cast. It also deserves deeper thinking: how much is the relationship in the game real?
