Jill Johnson (Belle) lives a hundred miles away for grizzly murder in a small town. When children sleep and have a nice home to relax, they lock the door and put an alarm. But when a number of talks of foreign talks say he "controls the children," Jill puts panic. Fear of fear when he has pursued calls. And what the police find, makes perfect childcare work for the 16-year-old worst horror. There are no other leading players in this movie. Camilla Belle is the main star with a lovely face. On the day he arrives at the nursery, he does not really have a clue as to what actually awaits him in hell. <br /> <br /> When I was in the house like one, Jill was in. I'd explore everything around. The fridge would be the first person I look at, but I'm a man and I'm not a child. But what I found funny was the size of the house. I was wondering if the movie would be the same if the house wasn't that big? Everyone can get lost in this big house, but this movie needed a massive house. <br /> <br /> Camilla Belle is a lovely face, a perfect smile, but it's like a movie, the head actress needs someone with experience. I found Camilla not that good. I don't know he thought it might be his breakthrough. I like her, she's a cute girl, but someone who plays a role in this movie has to be someone who takes it differently. <br /> <br /> This movie was not scary. I also found this movie "chick flick". I think the only reason why this SuperBowl weekend appeared was that the guys stayed home and watching the game and the girls were going to see it. It also seems to be a movie type when girls enjoy more than boys. But I liked this movie, but how it is. Girls are just as afraid or screaming. It was just a pretty decent movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe someone would like this movie. There are many PG-13 horror films that never fail. It was on its own level. So I liked this movie. I'll give him 7/10.
