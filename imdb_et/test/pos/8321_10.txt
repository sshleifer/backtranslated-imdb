and quite frankly, it just adds up. <br /> <br /> This is a small computer animated series that has been filmed as an animal documentary .... <br /> <br /> Animation is almost flawless (I thought that dinosaurs with long neck dashed). <br /> <br /> But some of the model shots didn't seem realistic ... <br /> <br /> and I thought Jurrassic Park Better T Rex .. <br /> <br /> the usual British TV show thing, then I can't wait to see what they can achieve in movies. <br /> <br /> I give this 10/10 asterisk ... <br /> <br /> (and "video making" was also great ..... the dinosaur on the skate was halarious) > <br /> <...>
