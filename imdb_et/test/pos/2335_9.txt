This is one of the films that critics actually noticed. This film is practically in the McHale Navy in the 90s or at the Police Academy Sea. Grammer proves that he can play other roles than Frasier when his army crosses and attacks to get his sub. Rob Schneider is the same worm as usual, the same plays in every role, and Lauren Holly is a local sexpot, though in the brain. Ken Hudson Campbell is as funny as usual, almost every line. The film has a wonderful intelligent plot and a non-predictable script that still surprises me. Many naval phrases and concepts move over my head, but this is a small obstacle to the accuracy and realism of the film and its characters.
