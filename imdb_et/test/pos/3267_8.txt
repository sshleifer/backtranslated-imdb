Jordan takes us to Australia's adjacent crime in Sydney, following the desperate endeavor of 19-year-old Jimmy (Heath Ledger), which brings together work for a local gangster and has to make changes before they reach him. Gangsters (run by Bryan Brown) are a menacing bunch of humorous lines. This makes the movie work because we always look at the gangsters as a harsh cluster to screw you down badly. But this mob also sounds your funny bone. Intelligent structured script, written by Jordan, has characters that cross the road and try to catch on the web.
