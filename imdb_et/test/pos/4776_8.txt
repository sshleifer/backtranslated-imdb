Mickey Mouse was created in 1928 and was originally called Mortimer before Walt Disney changed his name (because his wife convinced him). I always thought that this cartoon was Mickey's first cartoon, it's actually his third, but that doesn't matter, in six minutes of animated short time it's enjoyable. The story shows that Mickey is leading the steamer until Captain Pete takes him out of the bridge, stopping to load the cargo and Minnie Mouse does not shine. Having lifted her up, she drops her music sheets and the goat eats them, Mickey helps her crank tail and play with the voice and get some other animals into percussion until Pete comes again to stop her. Mickey Mouse was number 100 on the largest pop culture icon and was number 100 in the 100 largest cartoon. Very good!
