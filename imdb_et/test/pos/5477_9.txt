This is one of the few types of films I've ever reviewed and enjoyed. Although Clint Eastwood is his usual self, the general story works well, even within Washington DC. <br /> <br /> Subject: The assassin monitors the president and there is only one person who can save him. <br /> <br /> It is not easy to make a movie when you enjoy these days with the audience. This film succeeds on several levels. Eastwood is his usual hero who wants to save the president in the Kennedy era. He performs well in this role, as does his foil, Reneee Russo (FBI agent). 9/10
