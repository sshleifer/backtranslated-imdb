I saw this movie today (opened yesterday here) and I was just glad. <br /> <br /> I saw a review that said something that the reviewer thought it would be just one teenage movie, but then found it was based on the twelfth night of Shakespeare ... and then started to justify this flick like in the Shakespeare areas. I think it goes further: the only connections I saw on the twelfth night are (a) the main demeanor of a masquerading girl; (b) extensive male-female humor resulting from its basic thinking; and (c) some names (including Viola & Duke). <br /> <br /> In addition to these names, thematic matches (a & b) are truly excellent topics for each script and the script for this movie is no exception. Nevertheless, it is really just a pleasant and very modern / traditional teen flick. And this is a perfectly legitimate genre, even when the earrings have to find an excuse to like it ... as well as referring to Shakespeare. full of teenage hormone and teen humor and male / female humor suitable for all ages. And this is really the best part of IMHO: really almost every male stereotype and every female stereotype is depicted in round entertainment. These stereotypes are inevitably, but gentle, so complex with inventions, that I'm still a little confused ... but don't really feel disappointed at all, it's not such a movie: things come to you fast and fun and you can laugh and and then move on to the next division. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes is really just as delightful as Viola / Sebastian; Channing Tatum makes a wonderful Duke; David Cross makes excellent gold. All the actions and characterization were good and targets. Cinematography was great. <br /> <br /> Great entertainment from start to finish ... look at it!
