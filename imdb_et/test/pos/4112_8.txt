I was 19 or 20 years old and lived in Utah, Salt Lake City, and I still remember a new domain theater called a century. screen and packed theater. We felt the thrill of screening a new preview of the movie. I can still hear the sound of the ringing trumpet and the cymbals crash. I loved the interplay of characters and filmed views. I know Peter Finch and Luv and Sally had some problems with lipstick, but hey, it was a good feeling to go about the movies! I regret how they cut this meaningful heart, showed the cut version and then called it a flop. I saw the cut version and I see that it lost its view of the vision made in the preview. Yes, I can get a little bit of Peter's love for music, but you know I didn't see it when I left the theater. when they asked us when we left, I regret all the comments I made, which may have changed the original. I liked it and still see it when I listen to music on my LP. Most of my family have heard that I sing a lot of soundtrack, and I can use movies as monologues in our games, what the film is. I wish the director would be available for the DVD. It is available in VHS, but it is not the same. In particular, I would like to have a full serious master of comments on the styles of rings, about its origins, struggles and triumphs. Picky people should leave things well enough alone. Bring it back !!!!
