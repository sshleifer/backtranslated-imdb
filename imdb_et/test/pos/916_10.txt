"Rouge" is part of the trilogy, but stands very independently. This is not a sequel. It is the end that I am not publishing that binds the three films together, but the other two don't see it too confused. <br /> <br /> This movie amazes me because it is so free, so subtle and simple, but it is as effective, emotionally and intellectually as any big budget spectacle or all starred melodrama. Kieslowski explores the phenomena of chance and destiny here. Both themes are loosely woven. The movie is a great puzzle, but the message is quite simple: everything happens for a reason. Love is in our destinies as long as we open it. The title "Red" refers to the French flag, where red stands for "brotherhood" or brotherhood. Color dominates the film visually. I tend to think of it as love or passion or blood of life. It's great if the movie lets you do that;)
