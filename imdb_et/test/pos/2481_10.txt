With the future of the English detention camp in English, the procedure for capturing an English film crew will be put to young students and political dissidents on the basis of a law of fictitious uprising, which will allow the US government to suspend its citizens' civil liberties in cases where there is no need for bail or evidence in an emergency. In such cases, the government has the right to detain and detain someone they believe may be involved in sabotage in the future. In the research group there are feminist, black panther and folk song. <br /> <br /> Conservatives convicted by the Conservative Court may choose a long term prison sentence or three days in a punishment park where they can achieve their freedom by reaching the American flag in the desert. They have to do it without food or water. They must also be executed by armed national guards and police, who can return them to the camp if they are detained for the sentence of each sentenced person. The reality is different; those who choose a punishment park, hunt and kill or be cruel without the hope of freedom after the police have died in the park. The Park seems to be a police and guard training site that needs these suppression operations to be used in an open American society. <br /> <br /> Shooting in 16mm and documentary style Watkins, marked by Culloden and controversial BBC war game; He communicates with prisoners and guards and monitors the unconstitutional trial that is cutting across to create a completely convincing political film that is still vital and relevant. Using his knowledge of the media, Watkins has created a driving, relentless, and ultimately frightening film on a totally fictional American political detention camp that does not convince him that it was not his flawless construction. Many actors are amateurs who improvise with a wide range of characters. Sparks fly to the test sites, where each case is heard, partly because Watkins kept them out of the trial until they were filmed. Watkins also argues that actors often express their opinions, which certainly explain the fierceness and credibility of their perceptions. <br /> <br /> The film has been severely criticized for polarizing the people who see it. It has been claimed that the film is reactive and unambiguous that conservatism and war are the cause of American social problems. While this criticism may be valid, it is important to consider that the film works on a fictional, metaphoric level, and perhaps this is a clever design of the film that encourages such a warm opinion about its content. In fact, movies are the most important issue in polarization. "Conservative" judges and brutal legal advisers are on the one hand and "liberal" convicts are clearly on the other side, without any concessions on either side. This seems to be what the film really touches. The new law and park itself is a situation where mediation between two political positions has disappeared. <br /> <br /> During the Vietnam War and its protest and against the war in America, the main themes of the films remain persecution of their citizens' government and conservatism affecting civil liberties in the age of the same patriot law and identity card. It also strikes a worrying chord with Guantanamo Bay news and the treatment of Iraqi prisoners by Allied forces. <br /> <br /> The risk of internal "terrorism" is such a volatile problem that a film cannot fail to connect with the current attitude towards the matter. Not surprisingly, the film has had a squared distribution history, which is extreme because of its content, but the disturbing fact that this movie is still so important that it is so important today that nothing is to be expected. Punishment Park is a film that has had to fight to see it, and it requires your attention.
