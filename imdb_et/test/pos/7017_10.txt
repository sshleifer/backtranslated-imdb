I think dirty dance was a great movie, they tried to make another night that was good, but it wasn't like dirty dance. I would like to see the same dirty dance with the same people. without them I think it would be a mess. Many times movies are made when they try to add more they start to make people make movies go down the hill. I would like to see that there is one more in black dances to see what happened after they were together. patrick Jennifer did so well. this film was made in 1997 to make another. but this time start where he stayed the same people.
