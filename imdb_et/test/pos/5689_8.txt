Gore's actions keep ... it's not your movie. This little nail bitter is very little blood and intestine. Basically, it's an open water version that's effective and worth it. But that distinguishes us from the fact that we really like these three interfaces (unlike Open Water) who get into the tree when the crocodile pulls their fishing boat and strikes their guide. We don't want to cause any harm to them. When they get into dangerous situations ... we really care. <br /> <br /> Now I am killed by the killings of killer animals, but I have not impressed Placid Lake to its ancestor (although I am still waiting for Rogue to see it and I hope it is as good as it is!) the mistake worked and did the job well. It is a frightening creative and it only expires in the mill's run, which is a frenzied crying that pulls and briefly tells the reality. I remember reading a real story that inspired me, where three men went fishing and two reached the tree when their friend was killed by a crocodile. But the thing that always influenced me to be out of the movie was that the crocodile didn't drive a friend. After hours and hours, she swam around the tree and shook her body in her mouth with her friends. It seems to stay when you come here, it will happen to you.
