MEREMA Alejandro Amenabar movie. <br /> <br /> Almodovar has been a Spanish cinema flag for years, nowhere did Amenabar come back to the genre and injected into a new blood industry that otherwise caused malfunctions. now, in a big game of luck, he turns into a psychological terrorist into a social drama, but would it be great if the audience is ready to swing and the flag is more important? This is the story of Ramon Sampedro, a sailor who, in his twenties, paralyzed the neck at sea and in his struggle with the Spanish government for his right to end his life. The story is in the footsteps of the afternoon made for the TV-melodrama and the only way it works is through words and honest performances and they both come in shovel. Mateo Gil and Amenabar write that the audience should not be blinded to death, but they are encouraged to make their thoughts in this process, and this is a great stroke, not a movie project of death, but a film for the ultimate illusions of LIBERTY of our time. There is little laughing for a long time, as when the church comes home in a wheelchair to deconstruct Sampedro's beliefs, but is mostly teared through the valley, even if you think you are a father, there is no point at all that comes up the film's most moving line. This is a heartbreaking experience, especially when Sampedro seems to be full of life, when most of the people who travel on the streets try to convince him of the miracles of life even for those who help him die? but if you dream of a person of your dreams? The film is almost entirely built for close combat, which brings a claustrophobic feeling that makes the audience more sympathetic with Sampedro. This is a great challenge for the actors, which must build their entire performance with their eyes and their eyes do not lie. Bardem was not given his second Oscar nominee, probably in favor of Eastwood, but I think he was the only one who could have concealed Jammie Fox. This role reminds me of the great Gregory Peck to kill MOCKINGBIRD, where vision was effortless, and I think Bardem has achieved this status if what is working and what is real has become completely blurry. I was never satisfied with my early work, but since Almodovari LIVE FLESH is in roll, LOS LUNES AL SOL, Dance Artists and Oscar nominated before the NIGHT FALLS, an international star and although he and Banderas came from the same Almodovar, the background is exciting to see how The different paths they did and how Bardem has now become a true reference to Spanish cinema worldwide. The Golden World, 14 Goyas, the jury's prize in Venice, and probably the Oscar with CHORUS BOYS's permission, Amenabar directs, writes, edits, and puts the music on a high-level drama, has it pulled away? What is some Science Fiction now? Whose life is it still? ****.
