Something that I think some people will fail from the big science fiction is that it predicts some part of the future. No other theatrical film I remember did not predict that when a space shuttle went to explore Halley Comet, a disaster would occur! Some differences were: "Churchill" (movie cab) actually went to the comet, "Challenger" was only in low ground orbit; "Churchill" was burned only inside, while "Challenger" exploded - hey, the vampires had to go back to the ground. One big similarity (and it is always a bad luck!) Both had a confused male / female team - the legend of Halley comets and disasters continues! this movie that has never been said before. In the case of outer space / science fiction / horror / sex film, he did not give anything new, but as with all large dishes, this combination reads. Together, it was a very original and satisfying combination. <br /> <br /> I just want Mathilda May to raise victims through another part of the body!
