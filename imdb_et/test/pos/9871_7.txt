I bought it last week in the budget department. I already had Halloween and Halloween II, and since I try to collect every horror movie ever, I chose it. After all, the first two were good. <br /> <br /> This movie is truly smart to tell the truth. it seems to create the right atmosphere and has a nice "michael myers" history. it uses old locations from the original, and the main character is the child, laurie babysati, that the fatal halloween was kidnapped in 1978 ... <br /> <br /> The climax is also quite satisfactory. anyway, it's much better than H20, which, frankly, is an absolute mess.
