Faulkner's small town is a very powerful drama that kills innocent black men by a local woman. The striking cinematography and good narrative (through repercussions) lead us to the son of a suspect and his lawyer. Still a powerful story that preceded Sidney Poitier's film of racial prejudice. Porter Hall has a great role as the father of a murdered man. Trivia: It was actually filmed in Faulkner's hometown of Oxford, Miss.
