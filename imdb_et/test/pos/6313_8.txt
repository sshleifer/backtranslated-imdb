Although I totally agree with the previous comment about Toni Servillo's wonderful work on Titta Di Girolamo, I would also like to add some beautiful filming and editing that will make this film practically painted. The young director, Paolo Sorrentino, had the courage to test different types of camera techniques that reminded me of Darren Aronofsky 's claim for a dream. They both used the same MTV-style filming with modern (alternative / techno) music to make a movie? Le Consequenze dell'Amore - different from other crime / mafia movies in his genre. While the film may start to get at a very slow pace almost "sec" compared to faster Hollywood productions, it should be enjoyed as a reason for its calmness, wonderful character and excellent end. It must certainly be for people who enjoy European / Italian cinema. PS Toni acts like we need.
