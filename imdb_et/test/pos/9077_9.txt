* Flat SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> Five Medical Students, Nelson (Kiefer Sutherland), David Labraccio (Kevin Bacon), Rachel Mannus (Julia Roberts), Joe Hurley (William Baldwin) & Randy Steckle (Oliver Platt) Decide to Test test; die for exactly 5 minutes (this is the maximum time someone can do before the risk of brain damage). <br /> <br /> Almost everyone is doing this experiment, Randy is a single exception, but they will be unwanted visitors; She sees a little black girl screaming at her, Joe sees all the women she has sex with (and what she recorded), asking her why Rachel lives on her father's suicide and Nelson is facing a small boy with violent intentions. <br /> <br /> Why are they here? And how do they get rid of them? This intense and interesting film, placed on the hallucinated city and the Gothic Medical School, is both an experience and a story and characters played by glorious stars like Kiefer Sutherland, Julia Roberts, Oliver Platt, Kevin Bacon and William Baldwin. <br /> <br /> Director is Joel Schumacher, who had already worked with Sutherland in "Lost Boys", and the second is even better than the first. <br /> <br /> A must have psychological-thriller-horror buds and metaphor lovers (this story is forgiveness and correction of past lies), it is one of the smallest classics of the 80s that will pay tribute even today, as mentioned by Rebecca Gayheart in "Scream" 2 or Tru Calling episode that used the film's premise. <br /> <br /> Flatliners: 9/10.
