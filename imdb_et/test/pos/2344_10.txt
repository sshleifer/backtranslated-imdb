I was fortunate enough to see this movie last year at the festival festival and was half waiting for it to be released. The fact that the digital video camera was shot has certainly hampered its success, but as I understand that the filmmaker did not want to see it first in LOOK LIKE FILM, it was more of a story characterized by characters and their relationships. Isn't that what movies should be? But it had a texture with a visual appearance, suggesting that Thomas Thomas is something we should pay attention to. For independent filmmakers and producers with a lack of talent and money, there is a lot to learn about watching this movie, technically it is all that it does, the use of light, music, etc. is far beyond any other digital film I've ever seen, and that's why it is worthy of praise. Actresses' performances are credible to some points, if not played a little, I felt there was much more, deeper, especially the leader of men, John Paul Clarke. But one thing that really disturbs me as a filmmaker is that the film is black and white and it has to cover a lot of sins if it were color? Do we have to learn more about the development of digital technology? Or is it a wonderful and affordable movie selection?
