Again, non-governmental bodies stop to obstruct the public's knowledge of some important events. In this case, a new underwater species is discovered that could endanger the planet's ecology. Although the creature is not E.T. it looks like he is a friend of one who protects it at all costs, but doesn't understand that it's just a child of the species and gets a lot bigger? and badder This 2005 series was a lot for it. It's a family drama, sci-fi, thriller with more than a few comedy moments. The characters are plausible, well-behaved and well-photographed. Exhibition keeps attention. Of course, as with any sci-fi show, an unbelievable stop has to be achieved. And I think it's here. Unfortunately, the series fell after the first season, so we never get a resolution. Infuriating .. There is a general comment that I think is worth here. Many TV networks and / or movie distribution companies are quite arbitrarily canceling seemingly great TV series? especially intelligent sci-fi. There may be some very good reasons for this now, although the target groups are treated with extreme contempt and rarely the reasons are given. This in itself is annoying. What actually goes to my goat is that after the series is canceled, they issue a thing on the DVD as far as it is, obviously trying to get the cow as much as possible. For a series of previous viewers who are OK, they know what they are, but ??? many of these unfinished series end with fishermen. The two that will instantly remember are "Surface" and "Odyssey 5". If you've heard good things from the series and haven't seen it, then buy an exploded DVD and buy the outstanding plots? it makes me very angry! I liked the Surface immensely and didn't know that bad characters were getting into a situation that seemed totally unacceptable? and we never know what happened. I believe that all such DVD themes should have a striking message that the story is unfinished. Nowadays, I check TV series purchases (IMDB is obviously an excellent starting point) to find out if the "complete" series is really complete or not. Beware of the buyer.
