... this film with a noir set carries a dull sound (at least as shown in the inadequate equipment of both Seattle and Maine film festivals) and the drawing of marmots, while Rickman suffers from American accents, old tennis shoes and bright sweaters. Nonetheless, he has moments of scenic chewing and the film offers Norman Reed, a polite Walker with an embarrassing vagueness and a surprising ending (frequent film players), giving a beautiful picture of both Maine and Rickman's physiography. Thanks to the release of the video (after the cable is incited) in March. The Rickman fan should not be missed. Ignore amanita hooey.
