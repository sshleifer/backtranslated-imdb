Sam Elliot is great as a tough San Francisco detective Charlie Fallon. When his partner is killed at the informal Fallon meeting, he wins death, kills the informant and kills his body in the river. The next day, Fallon will be assigned a new partner and will be tasked with investigating the murder of informants. Sam Elliot does a good job of portraying a man who tormented his murderers for guilt, and the sadness of his partner's death, who might have been involved in police corruption.
