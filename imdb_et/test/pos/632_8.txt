I don't know how that film was so unnoticed for so long. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie on television, had gone through the channels and found this unexpectedly well made movie. I missed the first, probably 10 minutes, but it doesn't matter ... this film is literally captured by me, it's a real backbone cooler. <br /> <br /> The lack of well-known actors in the film adds to the effect, u don't know what to expect from the actors because they're new. U never knows when they will be killed or what they are. so it's still tense. Although there are many new faces, their performances were top-notch. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers play your mind simply by revealing enough gores to change your imagination. The film is also marked by shock, fear, horror and helplessness. <br /> <br /> Well-written situations turn around, fast camera movement, sliding editing, and great direction make it a great temporary thriller. This movie actually moves between genres - a horror and a temporary thriller who leaves the viewer unevenly and tightly. Undoubtedly comparable to Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> I wasn't even able to move on television even when I left the business. I was a mUTE WITNESS with this great movie.
