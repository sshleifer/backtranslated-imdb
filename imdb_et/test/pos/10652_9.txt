Film photography and editing are exceptional over time. Eisenstein relies on the scene of every film that takes the seaman into a riot and massacre in the city. As far as film is the cinema's highest point, it is also an example of Socialist realism. By 1925, the Soviet government used art, including film, to spread the message of the revolution. Eisenstein depicts the rebellion of the battleship Potempkin, providing the viewer with an overview of the Soviet elite. Marxist theory and class struggle perspectives are shown as sailors who represent oppressed workers and officers who represent the elites of society. Much of the film shows the Communist Party's message and how the film was used as a propaganda tool.
