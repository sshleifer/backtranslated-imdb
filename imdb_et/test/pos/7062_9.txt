I caught it on television one day when I was young and loved it. In the 1970s, a bunch of flat comedies were trying to be too funny, so it was a nice surprise. This is one of the best comedies of the 1970s and the ultimate summer camp comedy thanks to Murrary's great comedians, which is still one of his greatest. This is a movie that really led Ivan Reitman. Reitman demonstrates with this film that he is the most talented comedy director of all time. Although this movie is fun and MEATBALLS 2 is so bad it is fun, MEATBALLS 3 and MEATBALLS 4 are absolutely terrible. Recommended for those who like STRIPES and GHOSTBUSTERS.
