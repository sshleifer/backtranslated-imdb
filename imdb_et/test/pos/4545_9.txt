Well, of course, critics hated it. This is not a film that is going to be critical for a long time. But the fact is that it is really very good. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you don't like this Chris Farley physical comedy brand or David Spade's extremely dry wit, you don't like it. But the rest of us have a lot of fun and quotes on the film, sequences and the plot is not a half-fool like "Black Sheep". Parts that are not meant to be humorous are actually well done, not what you would expect from the movie and the actor is really good. <br /> <br /> "Tommy Boy" is asking about Chris Farley's best movie. I'll give her A and suggest you look at it.
