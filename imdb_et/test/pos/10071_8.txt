I'm not doing you. Yes, "Who is this girl" is special to be one of Madonna's films that bombed, but I liked this movie more than "Desperately Seeking Susan". In Susan, Madonna's character, Rosanna Arquette, has a second violin and doesn't get much work. There is no respect for Rosanna, but in WTG, Madonna plays this generation, an outrageous character made in the style of the 80s only. Although it may seem "cheesy" nowadays, it is actually one of Madonna's best and one of her most underrated films. <br /> <br /> Madonna plays Nikki Finni, an ex-coni who is sent to the criminals. he didn't. He has been released from prison after four years of good behavior. Griffin Dunne, who is also a very undervalued actor, plays Louden Trotti, a lawyer with an unpleasant task to choose his jail to take him to the bus station. Of course, when these two come together, that madness happens. Sir John Mills has a small role as a wealthy businessman with a huge mansion in the middle of Manhattan with a rain forest (???) on his roof. <br /> <br /> This movie reflects everything. Rich People, Twilight Characters, Living in Harlem and Destroying completely Louden's Rolls-Royce, Homosexual Police Officers Following the City of Madonna and Dunne, and Dunne's Staggering Wendy Worthington, allegedly sleeping in New York cab driver (played by Haviland Morris, who was sixteen candles from Jake's girlfriend Caroline). Fun! Plus, Dunne is also responsible for the rare leopard breed that resembles Bringing Up Baby. In addition, Madonna was a big platinum blonde in the 80s who watch these days and have a great soundtrack. Throw it in the whole mix and you have the WTG zaniness. <br /> <br /> Madonna is the queen of the dead body. There are times in the movie where she says the line is straight and surprisingly funny! So you should play some of the best comedies - straight. Madonna should have done more comedy and was ashamed that she didn't decide to do it. Later he became much more controversial and found more dark, sexually charged roles in the notorious films "Body of Evidence" and "Dangerous Game". Some people say that Madonna can't act, and that's fine, people have the right to their own opinion, but I believe that the real problem is that people don't see the difference between Madonna playing the character of the movie. still only Madonna and this is the main reason why her music is more respected than her movies. It's still 80's fun and complicated comedy. Not for everyone, I'm sure some of you don't like it, so I'd recommend it to Madonna fans, but you never know you might be surprised and pleasant! Interesting note: One of Madonna's friends from the early 1980s on New York club days, Coati Mundi, who plays Raoul, was a member of Kid Creole and The Coconuts and Savannah Band.
