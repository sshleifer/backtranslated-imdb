It's just good not to be fashionable in the west .. not too complicated or long. It does not deceive you by thinking that it is just for entertainment. However, it is one of those Westerners who can be viewed and done once without return. It has former partners Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford, whose friendship is strong, despite the fact that Ford Cheyenne Rogers has been a part of bank robbery (he even steals Scott's sheriff from Steve Upton's horse without knowing it for his good friend to whom he steals). In the Red Valley, under the control of Upton, a bank robbery ended with several dead. Claire Trvor depicts Cheese's friend Countess Malette, who gives her and her friends a "Nitro" (Guinn 'Big Boy' Williams) place to stay. Cheyenne wants to go straight but finds Jack Lester (Bernard Nedell) and his bad bunch wanting to rob the bank of the red valley. It's actually Jack, who's behind the murders, but it's hard to get away from Cheyenne's difficult past. He and Nitro are accused of murder they did not do (robbery was one of Cheyenne's) and it is Upton who must somehow save the day before Lester kills. There are sub-plots that include Cheyenne's love for Alison McLeod {Evelyn Keyes; The irony is that Alison's father, Uncle Willie, is in reality with the Banker Stanley Clanton (Porter Hall) planned to steal a loser with Lester to steal the looting of the Red Valley city. Will Upton reveal the deceptive scheme of Uncle Willie and Banker Clanton? Can Uncle Willie go through it without his conscience always disturbing him? This film has an amazing baroque strike and a climatic shootout storm. Columbia could not choose a better genre to start the painting process, because this film has some fine mountain pictures, because the men give the horse a ride and such. Don't expect your socks to blow out, but the movie is simple and pace.
