This is the second Hitchcock movie that appears in the list, and the second Hitchcock movie I've seen completely, the first was Rope, which I really enjoyed. There was room for Hitchcock with Saboteur, but the rope was in one room. I didn't enjoy it as much as Rope, but it doesn't say it's a bad movie, it looks like a normal flick that could have been more. <br /> <br /> The film Hitchcock seems to be skipping between its heavier ones. As a thriller, I feel that it can't really get on the edge of my seat, nor does it deal with a leading character who runs around countries. The climax of the film is a feeling of being able to really increase tension. Sound is almost non-existent. You can hear their dialogue and the surrounding environment, but the important things are missing, the sleeves hanging from the sleeves, the need for music for a sense of tension. Intentional, no doubt, but this scene lacks an emotional punch. Then it ends sharply, leaving you empty. <br /> <br /> The film does not feel that it should be, they are almost off the ground, but they feel even narrower. The script itself is very average and it seems to be going to be more pieces of how to move the plot. <br /> <br /> There are performances, but nothing wonderful. Everyone plays their parts with the scripted words on the page. The relationship between the two drivers is weak and requires more work. One eye is Otto Kruger, who has this rich, ego, evil personality. <br /> <br /> Finally, I wanted more. I understand that this is one of Hitchcock's least exciting movies, but I had the time to watch it. I can recommend it, not just enthusiastically.
