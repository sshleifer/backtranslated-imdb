<br /> <br /> `<br /> <br /> 5 years ago, if you wanted to watch an Australian movie, you expect to see crocodiles, war stories, drag kings, kangaroos and koalas, and the Australian general is represented as Nitwits live from the earth, saying words like cobber and generally have a classic underdog. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Australian film has evolved over the last couple of years and is driving today? Classics like Blackrock, Moulin Rouge, Chopper, Yolngu Boy and Sample People. <br /> <br /> In this movie, we find two hands. <br /> <br /> Set in Sydney's Kings Cross Two hands are a black comedy about crime and survival at the tough end of the city. Pando, played by Bryan Brown, is Sydney Mobi boss. He is an organized crime king who carries straps, wears a stronghold and assists his son in his origami. He's cruel, but real. Like his mob, holding a gun with someone's head in one scene and then playing board games next. They are well-respected and if they ask you for a profit, they don't say it. <br /> <br /> Enter Jimmy, played by Heath Ledger. Jimmy is your average Aussie man in his twenties. He is a good man who wants to give himself a name without a bad side, so if Pando asks Jimmy for $ 10,000, Jimmy agrees. <br /> <br /> Things start to get exciting when 2 teenagers are able to steal money while Jimmy is on the beach. So now Jimmy is on a $ 10,000 mobile head. Here we begin to see all the interrelated stories with Jimmy and his quest for bank robbery to restore money, Jimmy and Alex (the interest of love played by Rose Byrne), Pando trying to find Jimmy and of course two teenagers and their new found welfare. The concept is exacerbated by the narrator, Jimmy's dead brother Michael, whom Pando and his gang killed earlier years ago. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the story was very well combined with surprise streams to shock and stun the audience. I enjoyed it thoroughly. <br /> <br />
