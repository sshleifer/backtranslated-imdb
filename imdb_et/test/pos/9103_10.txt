This movie is very silly and very funny. You can never criticize it when it has taken it seriously. Once you've heard your previous album or seen your HBO videos from the album, you can imagine an extremely unpleasant smoking, swinging good time, which is the film that tells you how the Tenacious D group was created. /> <br /> Full of aliens, it not only gives you a fictional account of Tenacious D, but is also a musical story. Humor resembles something from Mary that they often "go to places you thought they weren't" but lacks the South Park scatological humor. This film does not contain nudity except mooning.
