A good x evil movie tasted by James Bond, Romeo and Juliet, and maybe even Star Wars. <br /> <br /> The evil Von Bruno becomes a very dangerous yacht as a guest of English. Elga, a beautiful simple and deliberate woman who was forced to marry, gives a triangle of love. Missing eyes show a terrible past. The Englishman is not what he thinks he thinks and is terrible treatment. There is also a terrible intimidation, crocodiles and even a side view of torture tools. <br /> <br /> Boris Karlloff, here at the forefront, is a strong but somewhat rigid presence. Other participants (and direction) are a symbol of the era that is black and white. From the beginning there is no doubt who is the evil man who is good. Even raids and stiffness can be easily identified.
