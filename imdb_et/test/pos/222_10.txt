More fun show on TV, though humor isn't for everyone. I understand that it would have been difficult to keep the exhibition fresh if it had been longer, but it is a shame that only six episodes were filmed. The Gags fly fast from the opening credit to the end when you see Drebin and his boss Ed Hocken pretending to stay in the freezing chamber as the closing credits during which the offender (still moving) would see all other immobile and try to escape. In the second episode, the building began to collapse around them, as Drebin and Hocken remained in freezing mode. <br /> <br /> Leslie Nielsen was a comic shine like Frank Drebin and is perfect for this show? how he managed to stay out of some straight line. Because jokes and eyesight came so often and quickly, you can watch episodes 2 and 3 and try for the first time. If you're like me, you can watch them over and over again and still laugh. Even jokes that didn't make any sense and saw no reason for them, like "Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln" label line in the opening declaration, somehow? maybe they were thrown there just for that reason. <br /> <br /> In the 1970's Quinn Martin's detective / police exhibitions, the clever jealousy of police detaches the "Act Two", which appears on the screen, followed by "Yankees One" or another quip. In the case of opening credit, the episode title appears on the screen, but the announcer would declare a completely different title. My favorite jokes and the lines of this series are too many to list, but one of my favorites is when Drebin asks a down-his-happy boxer who has previously refueled, "Do you think you can win the Champ?" The boxer responds: "I can catch her!" To which Drebin answers, "But what if he's not stuck?" In a few minutes, Drebin tells him that, in the case of a small, blind apartment in a boxer, he says, "I will help you get out of this sewer." The next thing you see is Drebin opening up through the manhole on the street! In the second episode, Drebin and Hocken doubt the weak alibi of the suspect bomb attack. Drebin, he doesn't believe him, says, "Okay, let's say you went to the movies." After a short break, Drebin, Hocken and the suspect saw everything on the camera and say, "You went to the movies." A few moments later, when Drebin is forced to walk to the suspect bomber due to lack of evidence, storms and anger: "Tell this bomber!" Next is a policeman who gives the building a second world war-style plane outside the building! Although there were many classic Drebin quotes, one was especially memorable: "Sorry to double you. We would have come before, but your husband wasn't dead." Another classic was, "I'm a locksmith and I'm a locksmith." When the father of the visibly shaken victim asks Drebin, "What am I doing?" ? Drebin, a classic corpse in fashion, replies, "Well, as I understand it, you're in the textile industry." As I said, is humor not for everyone? many people just don't get it. In the short time of the exhibition, I remember that the reaction is very confusing. Some people thought it was totally hysterical and one of the funniest things while others thought it was stupid and sleepless. For me, the police team, even 20 years later, is the most fun thing I've ever seen on television. For younger viewers who enjoy this type of humor but have never seen a police team because they were too young when the series was originally presented, I highly recommend. I found that these six episodes are even more fun than the subsequent "Naked Gun" movies.
