Ray is one of those films that makes you stop. You are actually thinking about what you heard or thinking about what you read about this man and it doesn't even go. When I was watching my first Ray, I forgot to watch a movie I felt like the one who was watching this person's life through a window. This movie is so convincing that it pulls you in and it covers every emotion you pass through an emotional roller-ride and when it's over, you don't want to do that fast because it has such an emotional punch that other movies missing. Jamie Foxx deserves his Oscar, and quite rightly, that his performance is remarkable and should be considered a standard for anyone who wants to take a bio-image soon. This film is as good as its theme so they deserve the titles of classic and legend.
