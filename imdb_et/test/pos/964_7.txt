I did not expect much of the children whose paper on time has been stolen and become a film scenario. Who then travels to Hollywood to get even ... but .. hey .. it's still a fun movie. Frankie Muniz's "Malcom Middle" celebrity stars like a baby and is pretty good and Amanda Bynes as her friend is also very good. Yes, the movie works as an advertisement for Universal Studios theme park and is really a silly children's movie .. but I still enjoyed it. GRADE: B-
