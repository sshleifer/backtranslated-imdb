Do not wait for the classic military comedy that claims that the military are entertaining, but only for the militaristic prospect. Instead, those elements that make the army into such a murderous machine will be deconstructed. "Buffalo Soldiers" East German version. "NVA" works at the meta-level that it knows the efforts of its heroes to escape the drilling of the army in any way. It does not mean a loud laugh, but a long-term smile. Utopic, of course (one scene shows you a tough reality) but very thoughtful. <br /> <br /> Just to complete the required 10 lines: don't go to this movie if you've been an army officer and liked your job.
