Ross Hunter's 1937 fantasy musical remake, based on James Hilton's persistent bestseller, was critically acclaimed by the audience almost in 1973, sounding broadly against the musicals that gave the genre a bad reputation for years in Hollywood. A group of different British and American individuals escapes from a war-ridden Asian country for an extraordinary flight, but their plane is hijacked and runs on snowy mountainous terrain; The rescue party arrives and leads the group into an isolated community called Shangri-La, where the sun always shines and most people are youthful and blissfully content. Some of the stylish casting performances are not as stylish (the bubbly mood of the pieces, the lottery songs by Burt Bacharach-Hal David, as well as the easy direction that everyone agrees to make the performers a bit stupid). Peter Finch is an international peacekeeper who lives somewhat constipated with romantic Liv Ullmann; Sally Kellerman is a malicious person who spits out such features as: "I was tired of photographing people whose heads were blown so people with head on STILL - and usually also with hairdryers - could get one last kick before the newest recipe"; John Gieguld "like Chang," Asia, who learned to learn English while studying Oxford, is humorously self-conscious (but why doesn't Chang have songs?). Hal David's funny words are sometimes jaw ("Is there a good ship Lollipop / how does Christopher Columbus ride over the sea?") And this momentum bounces everywhere that speaks of the outside world and how nothing is pathetic today. But production is lush and the overall handling is strange. The two-dimensional characters are so serious that they really love and the film's stupidity is infectious. This is fun. *** from ****
