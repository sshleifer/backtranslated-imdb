"The Story of Two Sisters" is the brilliant psychological horror of South Korea that remained without hesitation. The movie offers a terrific horror and is extremely horrible. A memorable leading role. The direction of Kim Ji-woon is well-managed and the cinematic art is absolutely proud. The plot is a little confusing, but some scenes are wonderfully frightened. at least, I was very curious and intrigued. The house where the film takes place looks incredibly intimidating and isolated. The "Two Sister Story" is one of the most original Asian horror films with "Ring" and "Cairo", which I've seen this masterpiece as soon as possible. My rating: 10 out of 10.
