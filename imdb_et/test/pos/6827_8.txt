Jack and Kate first meet with a doctor Daniel Farady and then with the psychology of Miles Straume and show that they have not reached the island to save the survivors. Locke and his group find anthropologist Charlotte Staples Lewis and Ben Linus lets her. Meanwhile, the Jack group finds Frank Frank, a pilot who landed a helicopter with minor injuries that can be repaired. Jack is forcing Miles to talk about the real intention of coming to the island. <br /> <br /> The second episode of the fourth season will return to the island with four new characters, stopping confusing "flashes", and eventually it will start with explanations that I (and most fans and viewers) expect to "disappear". Why the government's interest in Ben Linus and how to inform him about the boat are some of the issues I am expecting in the following episodes. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not Available
