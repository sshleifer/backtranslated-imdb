It's one of the oddest movies I've been watching for a long time. Usually, if they're strange, I'll rescue it early and rarely condemn it. Fortunately, I kept it. Although I cannot say that this is a great movie (it is not), I can say that watching it is a good acid journey - just some really terrible moments and the rest full of "did I just see that?" Admiration. Lots of laugh out loud. Great characters with Meredith Eaton, who is dedicated to the dwarf. Keep an open mind.
