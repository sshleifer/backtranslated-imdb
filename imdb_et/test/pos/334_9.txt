This is an incredible movie that starts slowly. This will take you away from this thinking as a typical maudlin family drama. Then, on the other side, there is a twist on the plot, making it a completely global story. for some reason, stick to this movie. Especially since the second half this film is an amazing experience. <br /> <br /> *********** Small spoilers here ************ * I have only one complaint in the movie. At the end (dialogue between Amudha and MDS) it seemed very weak and the opportunity to bring war as a force that changes people's lives. It was supposed to be all the time, but there should have been something about the importance of fighting MDS.
