This one, produced by MGM in 1936, introduces the talents of two contracted young stars, Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin. In some ways, these short films were promotional carts that were behind or behind the camera. Felix Feist led what was the way to promote two talented stars to the public. <br /> <br /> The story is simple enough. The orchestra, which every Sunday in a public park, does not deserve attention. Enter two music enthusiasts, Judy and Edna, who love to hear one of their grandfather's leading band games. Two of the city's parents, who feel that such entertainment is not known to the public, have decided to cancel their Sunday concerts in favor of a popular orchestra that attracts a wider audience. <br /> <br /> Two girls will enter their own tourism campaign, which will only do what they know, call and run their work and help their neighbors promise that they will attend a park concert next Sunday. Well, this day comes and their surprise is hardly anyone when the music starts. Two girls decide to take things and ask the conductor to sing. The result is clear, people across the park are punishing talented young singers, thus ensuring the existence of an orchestra. <br /> <br /> Of course, the only attraction of a short movie is the two-star inspired song. who are wonderful in their transfer. Ms. Durbin's operative voice fits well with Mrs Garland's natural creation, creating a lovely duet. <br /> <br /> Don't miss it whenever it shows on TCM!
