Don't torture a duckling is an absolutely stunning giobo exchange for Lucio Fulci. Unlike other heavy loads, such as Mario Bava and Dario Argento, Fulci is decisively sharp, grounded and socially aware of this film's giallo narrative. There is nothing glamorous about the murders of children and border polophilia (1972 gutsy sub-block) and Fulci seduces wisely and terribly in his eyes, avoiding lightning, melodrama and director. The process is broken by pleasant and instantly sensible minds that are even better at Fulci's reality? a particularly deeply disturbing "witch-killing" scene, whose bald face is brutal, feels like a snuff movie. Composer Riz Ortolan writes these scenes with carnage strikes on a wild reverberating stroke. <br /> <br /> The film is simultaneously constrained by a lyrical and violent conclusion where theology, morality, fanaticism and superstition come together. It is a profoundly effective ending with the ability to leave the viewer intruder and disarmed torpor. <br /> <br /> Fulci didn't get a better location for this movie. Do not torture when the duckling was photographed in the old Italian town of Matera and its surroundings. As Matera continues to modernize today (emphasizing its transition from agricultural land to industrial enterprise), she is seeking a UNESCO-sponsored reputation as a reservoir of mysterious Palaeolithic ghosts. The concerns of the actual material are reflected in the characters of the film, who in their Christianity, wearing their sleeves, are terribly opposed to the exotic traditions of distinction (namely witchcraft), which is beyond the norm. <br /> <br /> It is interesting that Materat was also used in Jerusalem's views of Mel Gibson's Christ Church. If that is something, it will add even more to Fulci's message. Such a resonant combination is a catholic guilt and harsh killings.
