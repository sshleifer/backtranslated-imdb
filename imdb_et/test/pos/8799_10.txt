Human traffic is undoubtedly the most original and compelling film I've ever seen. It documents 2 days in the life of a group of young people, who forever eternally and dying for jobs and stepping into the weekend. It's funny funny and extremely annoying and sometimes very sad. In the same genre as "Trainspotting", it has a great soundtrack and has hot young British stars. The film was made with a small budget and I look forward to future offers from Writer / Director Justin Kerrigan, as big filmmakers discover his talent.
