It must be one of the best episodes of the doctor I have seen last year. There's a great mix of entertainment, fear, and tenderness that all blend in, equal to one amazing episode. Ode was wonderfully designed and I'm pretty sure there will be lots of fun in the coming weeks. I myself am guilty of this. I especially liked seeing the relationship between Rose and the doctor and ending in a different way; I can't wait until the next week's episode to find out how they come out of this mess.
