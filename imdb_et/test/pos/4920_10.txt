When I first looked at the trailer, I have to decide if this series would be ideal for my collection. But after that I heard, I decided to buy it. When I bought the whole box set, it was exactly what I wanted to see. It was very funny and the characters were pretty cool. The favorite characters of the exhibition are: Marion, Carrot, Haze Knights, Big Momma and Dotta. I also liked opening and closing the topic. There are also Tiffany Grant, Jason Douglas and others. But this exhibition is one of the biggest. So if you want to see something cool. Then it's the show.
