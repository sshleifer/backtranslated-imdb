Tim Robbins did a masterful job of managing this film. I say this because he ruled out the convention and clich√©s. He also watched great productions from Susan Sarandon (who won the Oscar for his role) and Sean Penn. Even more amazing is Robbins. He just talks about the story and lets the viewer remember the events. It is so effective because it allows the viewer to form his own opinion on the death penalty, one of the most controversial issues of our time, without being unfairly manipulated in either direction. I can't recommend this movie enough, 9/10.
