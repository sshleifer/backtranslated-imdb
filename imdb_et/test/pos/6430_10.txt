this is a haunting piece. It's only ten minutes long, but in the past I would pay ten bucks in the cinema to see it in a full-length movie that is currently in the making. this is a simple man's reflection. He arrived at this place with a young man and was mesmerized by this space and the music coming from it ... and now, as he sits here, he dies in the old age at the place where he connects his youth so tenderly. The music in this is brilliant, the guitars have this jazz room, like a nose young music dead man. if you get the chance, check out this movie.it's worth it. If the rutger hauer made more of these movies, I think he will get more respect than he gets. sure that this is not what the rutger would like to be, because he has also directed this film, so it shows that he is a very artistic actor / director. I hope I can see this rutger more than he is one of my favorite actors.
