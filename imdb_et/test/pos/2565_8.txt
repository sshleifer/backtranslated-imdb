As I read through the reviews, I was surprised that this film said this film was "not very deep." I don't have to agree, it must be one of the deepest and most thoughtful films I've ever seen. Yes, the actor and the music were great; they are increasingly praised in reviews. But I also praise the heart of the film. It resonates with a deep meaning and sense, this is the story of redemption. It is about two very different and very flawed characters that are beaten by life, but too strong to lie down and die. That means the man sees the girl more value than he saw. It strongly reminded me of Francine Rivers' book of love redemption, which has a similar story of redemption. Yes, pictures and themes are dirty and sometimes shocking, but if you look close enough, you can see these signs easily. Sometimes the real things of life are not pretty beautiful, but they are real.
