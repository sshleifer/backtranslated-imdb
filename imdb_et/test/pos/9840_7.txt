"The Mayor of Hell" knows the premature Dead End Kids movie, but has a much harder edge and very few light spots before Dead Enders appeared for four years. James Cagney has a full-screen opening credit, although technically, the movie's "Mayor" is actually Frankie Darro, one of the many boys who was sent to the reform school during the opening screen. Darro's character is Jimmy Smith, a young tough guy who has become a friend of "Patsy" Gargani (Cagney), and is elected to the position when Gargan takes the opportunity to humanize during the national restructuring. <br /> <br /> Warner Brothers made many such films, trying to offer conscience at different ages that knew only well about the effects of crime and poverty. This film is quite sharp without excuses for ethnic stereotypes, such as the black father's humble position in court or the way a Jewish child can run a candy store in a reform school. The rules of the reform are simple enough - work hard and keep your mouth shut; step outside and personally respond to Warden Thompson (Dudley Digges). <br /> <br /> The role of Cagney's role seems somewhat unclear, because although he is making serious efforts to improve the conditions for restructuring, he is still under the control of a criminal record. The film's attempt to juggle this dichotomy is, in my opinion, a little, things are trying to put things in the final package with clean packaging, because Gargan is waiting for the result of one of his henchmen almost deadly. Not just the role model that such a movie could look for, Warner Brothers would have cleaned up some of the elements in this story with the 1938 remake of "Crime School" with Humphrey Bogart. Cagney's role and Billy Halop's Frankie Darro. If you are a part of Dead End Kids, you probably like this latest film because it also features familiar faces like Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, Bobby Jordan and Gabriel Dell. However, the end is somewhat muddied about where Bogart's caregiver is dealing with the interruption of the prison. Both films offer a romantic interest in the leaders, "Mayor," Madge Evans, a reformist nurse who belongs to Cagney's character. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, James Cagney's early films are not commercially available, so you need to peel your eyes on Turner's classic screening or get a movie from a private collector. Personally, I do not get enough of this kind of thing and find interesting points of interest from films of all genres from the thirties and the forties.
