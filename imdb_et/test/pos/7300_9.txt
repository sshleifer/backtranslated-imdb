I watched this movie after reading the book and taking the character at face value, but having been introduced to them, I recently looked at it again. I got a completely different perspective from the movie. <br /> <br /> Without stumbling upon any character's focus, learning their churches and fixing, I promised to focus on the cultural issues in the film. The families of the Iowa Farm are so closely connected as they are in the Indiana region, where I grew up in the 40s and 50s because I immediately felt the background and motives of the characters. Perhaps Jane Smiley meant that we would look superficially around the world these people had to live in, but the viewers are so stuck in the "Hollywood" aura of individual participants that they can't get a rich lifestyle layout that is less and less than every decade . Another film with these features is "Madison County Bridges". Try watching both movies again to see the whole picture.
