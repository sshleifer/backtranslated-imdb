*** Spoiler in the fifth paragraph *** It was an amazingly sincere (uh-huh, uh-huh) picture in 1955. Otto Preminger and Carlyle Productions took this opportunity, a member of the American Movement Committee, a film that openly opens up a spam full of heroin. Frank Sinatra took the opportunity to play an addicted musician and fell on the face in a plane that required at least twice as much action as he had ever done. All in all, these games pay off, the movie is classic, although it's not perfect. <br /> <br /> The Nelson Algrenian novel can be great, but it's too much to fit comfortably into a two-hour movie, "The Golden Handed Man," 119 minutes, and often looks a lot longer. But in my opinion, the film is not only Frankie Machine (Sinatra), but other characters and their sub-plates, all of which are related to Frankie. Ultimately, not only does Frankie, who has addiction, has everything and everything seems to be dependent on her and she knows it very much. If the pressure gets too much, the drums will start to sound on their soundtrack with their well-dressed "friend" Louie and Frankie will step over the street. <br /> <br /> It is an exaggeration to say that Frank Sinatra's musical career was never really in the knees, but at the beginning of the 50s he was varied between big bands and Las Vegas. "From here to eternity," he founded a serious actor and his career as a singer, but the "man with the golden grace" was still an important challenge, the whole show sinking or floating with his performance. With this skill she pulls out that for a few minutes I forgot to look at Frank Sinatra, she must be aware of junk musicians and used this knowledge as much as possible. <br /> <br /> Set aside Billy's Wilder masterpiece "The Lost Weekend" is more emphasis on sociological causes of addiction "Man with Golden Grace". When Don Birnem (Ray Milland "The Lost Weekend") seems to be fighting mostly against himself, the Frankie Machine is by external forces and hides in the needle. Both approaches are not entirely correct or false, mostly because it is impossible to fully explain the addiction, but it seems that this film could have got a little more information about Frankie's internal struggle. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler ** * One of the problems I have with this film is the clich√©'s dependence on cold turkey. I understand that "A man with a golden arm" was probably a trend rather than a follow-up, but it does not improve it. At the beginning of the film, Frankie at all frequencies must punish her habit with the help of a doctor and some kind of medical institution. Of course, the film requires drama to be reversed, but I have found an all-American ideal that the man has to deal with his problems alone (or perhaps with the help of a good woman) from here. Driving cold turkey and riding a sunset with Kim Novak seemed too unreal. The end of the "lost weekend" was similar, but I think it was a little less rosy.
