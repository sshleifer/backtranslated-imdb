I just had to add my comment to raise its average. Paul Giamatti lets everyone catch this soul. He would probably have said it was easy, but he really does a good job and could have won it. We've had a DVD for many years and my kids (boy now 4 1/2 and girl 9) are watching it over and over again, and humor is enough for adults, so I don't want to hear it in the background (and I'm running on TV for really funny parts). A simple moral message, a lot of decent actions and strokes, "bad" adults who act silly to take down the edge, minimal bad language and minimal potty jokes make it difficult to beat the family standard.
