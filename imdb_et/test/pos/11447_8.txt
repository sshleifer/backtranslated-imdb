The Night of Demons (1988) was another long line of "teen" horror movies that appeared with video and pay-t.v. at the time of making the eighties film. But unlike most of the dust that had been around, it was actually a good watch. A group of boring "teenagers" will decide for Halloween at the infamous Hull House with paired sisters (Mimi Kinkade and Linnea Quigley). Your usual casting of stereotypical teens is called at the party. But the average teenage bash becomes fear of terror when they try to survive Halloween night when they undead residents of the Hull House decide to crash toward. Who lives this night with bloodshed and horror? <br /> <br /> A nice horror movie that is best viewed in an unrated version. If you look at the R-Rated section, every spray effect and nudity will remain. Stay away from the fun epilode! Gory film, followed by equally fun sequel. Only for horror! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
