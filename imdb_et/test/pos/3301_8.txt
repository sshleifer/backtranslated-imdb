Looking at this fun retro but very fun career story for girls, I was on the floor with Joan Crawford's first appearance. First I thought it was "My God, it's the same face as Michael Jackson in his notorious booking!" <br /> <br /> About 34 minutes into the movie, Diane Baker and Hope Lange get out of Greenwich Village. As they walk along the street, you will see a sign on the back of the sign, part of the Stonewall Bar, an epoch-based "rebellion" scene that is considered to be the movement of today's gay rights. <br /> <br /> Talking about the baker and the taxis, I had to laugh when he got into one, and says to the cabbie, "56 and Sutton Place, please - and watch out for bumps." Can you imagine the reaction led by today's Manhattan? He says, of course, because he's pregnant and doesn't want to hurt the fetus. But it won't stop him from JUMPING MOVING CAR if he finds Bob Evans wants him to have abortion! Well, they had to find a way to lose her child (1959 and all). <br /> <br /> Sue Carson is wonderful as Mary Agnes. Why was it his only film? There is no biography about IMDbis.
