Successful dentist Matthau, a swinging bachelor, is her blonde mistress under Hawn, telling her she is a married man with three children. After trying to commit suicide, Matthau decides to become responsible and marry the girl. Concerned about being a "homebreaker", bright eyes Hawn wants to meet her wife and explain everything to her. Matthau uses his faithful sister, Bergman, to act with his wife, and that is when things are really complicated. <br /> <br /> Farce comedy with irresistible leaders often hits the mark but is not credible within one second. The script asks us to believe our men are such one-dimensional turds that are truly incredible. But maybe this comedy doesn't need to be analyzed too deeply, but just sit back and enjoy the fun of Matthau, always so charming Bergman and duddle Hawn, who created the role of a bash-blonde.
