It was 1983 and I was 13. I watched Valley Girl at HBO one night when my parents worked. After finishing it, I wanted to talk to him right away. It turns out my best friend looked at it and it became our favorite movie. Every weekend after that, we looked at it until we could say it. We woke up his parents late in the night to laugh hysterically. We began to worship the main character Julie, played by beautiful Deborah Foreman. I'm not saying it's a great classic. Although it is for me personally. And I understand that the whole Valley Girl conversation is annoying, but it was in the 80s. But at the heart of the film is the love story and the familiar, but good. Girl meets boy and both sides have sparks, direct connection. Julie's friends don't like her - she doesn't fit, she doesn't go to her school, she doesn't have money. They love her better with her ex-boyfriend, though she's a jerk. She will make her proud happiness for her happiness. And he has these very cool supporting hippie parents. This is one of Nicholas Cage's first films and his first star. For one minute she is completely fun and next incredible and romantic. His friend Fred is too funny. If you were a teenager in the 80's, then you love this movie or at least it brings back memories. It's no longer my favorite movie, but it's still one of my favorites, probably in my top 10. You can go to the Deborah Foreman website to sign a petition to publish it on a DVD, and there are 2 soundtracks from the movie that must be the 80's music.
