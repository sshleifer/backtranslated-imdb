This is my first John Carpenter movie, I have to say that it was impressed. From the very beginning, the film pulls you in and never lets you tension. The special effects and models of the film are still good today. Other than Kurt Russell, I didn't know any cast members, but they were all extraordinary to give fear, paranoia and despair to survive. Universal DVDs are very interesting behind the scenes. Recommended, 9/10.
