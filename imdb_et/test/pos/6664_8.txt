"Warfare" is a Hollywood genre that has been made so many times and repeated that cliché dialogue, rage and overall sequences of action seem unavoidable in all kinds of conflicts related to widespread struggle. From time to time, however, there is a war movie that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and convincing story on the silver screen. Such a film is the Cold Mountain of Civil War, starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renée Zellweger. <br /> <br /> Then calling the Cold Mountain "War movie is not entirely accurate. The movie opens (quite literally) with a quick and dirty battles that shame" Glory "director Edward Zwick, but" Cold Mountain "is not so much Civil War but Time and People The story focuses on a satisfied Confederate soldier, Inman, played by Jude Law, who becomes disgusted with Cold Mountain, North Carolina, and the same beautiful sailors, Ada Monroe, beautiful wars and domestic cat. gives the audience enough sympathy to root out the troubles on the battlefield of reluctant soldiers. "Cold Mountain" is about to take a drastic move, because the terrible hero Inman turns out to be a desert (randomly storing the audience from a potentially confusing scenario that wants to root the Confederates) and starts a long odyssey homeland. cultivated Ada cultivated farmland in the farm little, soon it will become something wild. Ada's salvation is a course, the tough nails of Ruby Thewes, played by Renée Zellweger, who helps Adale put the farm back together and maybe even more important to deal with loneliness and isolation. <br /> <br /> These two settings show a brilliant, enjoyable and sometimes very worrying portrait of a war-based South. The characters that Inman and Ada interact are surprisingly complicated by Brendan Gleeson's superb productions as Ruby's deadly father, Ray Winstone as a southern "lawyer" and Natalie Portman as a deeply restless and isolated young mother. The "war of northern aggression" has all been influenced and greatly deteriorated. The dark, penetrating anti-war message, highlighted by effective, haunting scores and coldly beautiful images of Virginia and North Carolina, is transmitted to the audience not so much tough scenes, but also to the beloved land and traumatized people to whom the war fought. Although war weapons and tactics have changed a lot during the last century, this hurricane impact on the earth is timeless. <br /> <br /> Director Anthony Minghella is able to maintain this gloomy mood for most movies, but unfortunately, the atmosphere is depressed by a fairly thin climax that does little justice to wonderfully designed characters. The love story between Inman and Ada has clinged to the beginning and end of the film, although their relative, distant, abstract and even absurd nature suits the unpleasant nature of the rest of the plot. <br /> <br /> Don't make a mistake, Cold Mountain doesn't have a good sense of romance or an inspiring war drama. It is a unique vision of the timing that is sure not only to entertain, but also to live in the life of truly crushed people and totally desperate to get rid of their terrible consequences.
