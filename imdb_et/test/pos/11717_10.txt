Undoubtedly the best Burt Reynolds movie ever! Even better than Smokey and Bandit. This was probably the first true bloody police officer of the 1980s, who gave a great sense of humor, action, reason, and style that is missing in today's movies. Jackp up to PCP, $ 1,000 a night for girls, ninja assassins, and Burt Reynolds started slicing one by one. The film is based on William Diehl's novel, who also wrote the PRIMAL FEAR, another favorite of all time. This movie is worth watching to see how Henry Silva strikes six times, opens the window and falls thirty stories from the top of the Atlanta high-rise. This is probably the coolest stunt in Hollywood history, made by legendary stuntman Dar Robinson. Stick is yet another great Robot of Robins. Robinson falls from the Miami apartment house and sits down all six frames from .44 magnum. Very cool things. <br /> <br /> SHARKY MACHINE is my favorite police drama. I've never understood why this movie flop as it did. If Burt made more of these films, he would have a better reputation for himself. He is a talented director with Sharky and a talented actor. Burt is supported by Brian Kieth, Charles Durning, Bernie Casey, Richard Libertin, Rachel Ward, and Henry Silva's favorite bad guy. PLEASE remake this classic movie! Get Affleck and Samuel L. and some other hot actors and you have a great movie waiting to be filmed. <br /> <br /> I'll give him 10 out of 10
