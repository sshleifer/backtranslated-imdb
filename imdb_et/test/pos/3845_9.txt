If "Madame" decides to let her cats inherit her, it will cause problems. Snobbish Butler Edgar, who follows the succession, decides to get rid of the cats. It can start the story and cats can go on an adventure that would otherwise have been impossible. An adventure that lets them meet O'Malley, a charming but completely unreliable cat. It helps them through many dangerous and funny situations until the inevitable happy end. <br /> <br /> The power of this movie is its humor and music. Edgar is just as fun as an offended butler who can't solve the score and of course himself takes serious beats. One of the best scenes includes him when two dogs Lafayette and Napoleon ride. The result is great and like the "Jungle Book", you have scenes that are almost "musical" in the sense that the story does not progress and the focus is to let the protagonists express themselves through dance. And, of course, we like the score that is pretty Jazzy. <br /> <br /> And of course it's not just me, but also my kids who love it. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Simon
