I really enjoyed it both times when I watched it. And both times, I walked on to think about it and "story morals" a lot. I agree with another reviewer that the film does not focus on the sci-fi aspects that you might expect from a foreign film, but rather about the human condition. Psychiatric hospital characters give it a great insight and how they hope hopelessly. This film is about sadness with humor, that compassion for the final "whether or not he is". This last question was well solved, and while some might have argued that you do not know what ends and the question remains unanswered, I feel that it is done in much more detail than what you want to say, film Ronin (with Robert De) Niro), where you will never find what is in the box and feel very disappointed. I highly recommend K-PAX. 8/10
