Don't listen to what the critics have always said about this cute and charming little movie. Madonna is great in this smart comedy. I worked for many years in a video store and offered this movie to many customers - no one EVER brought it back and yelled at me to tell them to rent it. Everyone always enjoyed it. It's really a great movie for kids.
