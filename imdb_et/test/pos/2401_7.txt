I watched the movie with tears and smiles. The anger rose in me to see Hanoi's destruction after 12 days of bombing. And now living in the country with my parents who have lived in Saigon for 50 years, I understand that we are now much better and it would have been better if America did not bring war here. As I watched the film, I learned more about the different wars that the United States planned in Vietnam, and what disasters they caused. <br /> <br /> The series seems to be good for interviews with real people. But I do not like the fact that some people only give general opinions, as well as the analysis at the end of the series, I forgot my name. <br /> <br /> There should also be more documentary images, such as life in Southern Vietnamese and North North military camp (if possible). There's also a sharp change from 1972 to 1975 (I'm not sure if the intermediate was censored because I watched this series on television).
