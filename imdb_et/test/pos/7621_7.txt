I'm not sure if the others saw the movie - some probably couldn't follow the "complicated plot". He is a billionaire who owns an oil company, who ALSO happens to be a big game hunter - it is really far removed. In some way - his new "drilling machine" happens through the glacier and on the other side there is a world separated from our own time, where dinosaurs and cavemen migrate. Nothing violates this, but it is certainly not ridiculous. Anyway, the rest of the movie about the T-Rex they find (what billionaire Boone said was there) hunted and hunted them. Look - this is an old movie for a TV movie - of course the special effects are beautiful - they didn't have CG - they did the best they could, and for MFTVM they did hell by then. This movie should be rebuilt on the big screen - I love it and I would be the first in the line. Seeing that these guys with today's special effects dinosaurs would be great!
