Finally !! Sandra Bullock is really a beautiful woman, but I have finally found a movie that she will be an actor! Forget about the predictable Keanu bait from SPEED, forget about the predictable Kleenex bait when you sleep - it will test it! <br /> <br /> And he's great! The techno-feminist role that actually works well on the screen is very close to the bones. The issues raised do not seem to be widely drawn at all, and the whole experience that the subtle support helped make a few hours quite nervous. <br /> <br /> You must never go to another chat room again - in fact, I'm getting quite nervous just by writing this review ... er ... bye!
