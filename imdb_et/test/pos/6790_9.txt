First of all, let me say that I find films like Shawshank Redemption and Green Mile, and most Spielberg is totally frightening and turning to stomach. Although National Velvet seems to have the same genre on the surface and has what it should be shameful moments, I enjoyed it thoroughly, laughing and all around the film. <br /> <br /> The plot's premise is a little girl with an unknown horse from small villages entering the Grand National, so unlikely as it could be, but that's the only thing you need to accept to make it work as a fairy tale or allegory. The characters have a depth and a whole story. Ann Revere is absolutely stunning, one of the smartest women ever depicted in American film. His communication with cordial Donald Crisp is funny and sweet. While Liz Taylor is trying to be a bit too hard to be as gentle as Margaret O'Brien (her succeeds in btw), her passion and love for her horse stand out. Mickey Rooney gives the trainer nice nuances. <br /> <br /> It's not a perfect movie. Some situations and scenes are a bit nervous and dated (for example, antics for children and Rooney scenes on the track and pub), but that doesn't matter. The plot is left to the characters and leaves little to say. We have no unnaturally too dramatic and preaching moments - sometimes there is less. The final scene is a good example - the emotional dialogue remains for the observer to complete. <br /> <br /> Strong underestimated performances, rounded characters, intelligent dialogue, intelligent and internally consistent story. We believe in the characters and they are moved by their story. Yes - they just don't make them like that anymore ...
