I am an Australian living now in Japan. I saw this movie on TV and impressed that Western and Japanese ideologies are punctuality and honesty. Anyone who has written a script and directed this film must know what is like an alien living in Japan. The only part I thought was too Hollywood-y when Tom Sellec's character kisses her in the middle of her office and promises her. Public display of affection is not really acceptable here. Finally a film that highlights the true 'gaijin' experience! 9/10
