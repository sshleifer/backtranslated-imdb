It is not very well written. Songs are not memorable. Yet, the glass squeezes much from Martin and Lewis in the naval situation. They both look like young sailors. They are plausible. Submarine scenes show how narrow it must be for underwater missions in the 1950s and before. <br /> <br /> Many sailors in many scenes. Maybe hundreds of maybe in a big outdoor training area and again in boxing. <br /> <br /> You see James Dean in his scene. She stands out, though she's extra. In the scene where Jerry walks on a busy street, we see some of his "near-accident" comedy that he plays with Patsys many years later. <br /> <br /> The Dean, who gives Jerry boxing instructions, is a good comedy. Boxer Ring Jerry shows his great energy, which was his trademark in the late 40s and early 50s. Dean and Jerry dancing is a bit healing. Not big, but better than most non-dancing movies. <br /> <br /> Noteworthy if you don't remember black and white. Good end. <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
