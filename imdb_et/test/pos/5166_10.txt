This is a great movie and I want them to buy it on a DVD. It's hard to try to catch it on TV all the time. Because you don't know when one station will decide to air it. Can anyone tell me which file company does this, so I can write to them and see if they release it to the public? I got last week and a half and I saw it only last year. My sisters and I are looking for it in all stores that sell videos. John Denver is an excellent singer and actor, and the plot line is great. They put out a lot of older movies and I think it's great, but there are few of them that they haven't put out, and I think if we can contact the producers and express our requests, we can put some of them on a DVD .
