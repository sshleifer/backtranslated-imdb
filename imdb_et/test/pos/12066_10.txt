This exhibition is brilliant. It's married today ... with children. Scripts are witty because they are sprinkled with smart sarcasm. They are also realistic in dealing with the challenges facing many teenage parents today. Besides being the biggest parent in the world, how is it the best way to solve it? At the same time, he is able to remain light in heart and fun. What is a very pleasant and welcome change nowadays with the drama and action of television as a whole. This is something you can sit back in 30 minutes and relax, laugh and associate. It's not a more fun comedy in the world. Still make you laugh at least a few times in the episode. Michael Rapaport is a great leader in Dave. She fills in big shoes that are demanded by a strongly sarcastic script and then some. He and Anita Barone (Vikki) have fantastic chemistry and are very good at each other. This exhibition has a strong future if it is marketed to the right target group and placed in the right time. Also, when Fox releases it to the DVD, the following are bigger and bigger. (As a classic example of Scrubs.)
