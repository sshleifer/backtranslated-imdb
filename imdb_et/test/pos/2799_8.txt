The first thing I wanted after watching the movie was to watch it again (because I left a lot of laughter what I did). I am a European and I have studied abroad and I am as good as Spanish, French, Italian and German. The film was full of stereotypes that more often people were and I read some other comments that it was p *** out of people. But this movie gets stereotypes so right that I can't blame it. Except maybe the French guy became a drunken party. The English guy was the perfect "geezer" stereotype. Drunk, annoying, offensive, but shines in the end. In addition to stereotypes, the film also became an emotional aspect of studying abroad. At first, he is shy, does not know anyone, stays at home, does not know his way. As time passes, it becomes his home and when it comes time to leave it is extremely difficult. Feeling that people only understand when they have experienced it. I highly recommend this movie.
