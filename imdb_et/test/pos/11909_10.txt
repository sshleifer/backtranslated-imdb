I liked this movie. That's pretty much what I can say about it. Lou Gossett did a good job, although I am still very disappointed after Iron Eagle's films. And even when I smiled inside, when the first main teenager dies (I don't give it away), it was done in a nice, fit fashion. Pretty much everyone in this movie does a good job, so check it out! This is one of those movies I found really cheap, so I bought it and recommend it.
