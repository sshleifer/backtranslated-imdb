What a great show! Very undervalued dramatic show. It is nice how the main characters and all the other characters are missing, the main character (s). I think the best character of the show is Vern Schillinger. He is a tough, bad boy and a treasure who makes him a real bad prisoner, known to many. There are many murders in this show, I think it's a bit bigger than killing the show, but I have to admit that this is one of the reasons why I think the show is so big. be sure to mark your character. You can't compare things like Prison Break to this show, they're completely different. I think some of the exhibitors are also very good and undervalued and what they have. Great show, my favorite. An exhibition that should be considered great for the coming years.
