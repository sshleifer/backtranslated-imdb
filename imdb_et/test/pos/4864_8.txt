I picked up a DVD 1? a discount who has no idea what it is (but at this price I can't resist.) In short: I was positively surprised. <br /> <br /> So much I did quite a lot of research. On the German DVD (2nd series of the 3 series) episodes were merged into two 85-minute sections and failed. Here are my results based on the Wikipedia episode list: <br /> <br /> "Doomsday" is my boots + voice (final episode). <br /> <br /> "Machine War" is Hel & High Water (1, 2) + Pod Listener + Juggernaut Down. <br /> <br /> Well, what can I say. The mothers depressed are, of course, interested in older men. I didn't look at Charlie's angel so much that I couldn't compare, but the more I looked, the less I looked at the bikini heads and their fillings. Instead, the characters (both m and f) became more interesting. I can imagine that feminists also have fun. All in all, you may be guilty of joy, but the joy was: ^)
