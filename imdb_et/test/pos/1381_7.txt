Rating 7 is not necessarily dirty - this film was made with a small budget - but it did well within its limits. <br /> <br /> The usual pot-boiler plot - The ship carrying the prisoner is destroyed in the room, people and the prisoner flee to the pits, land on an unknown planet where their presence wakes up. Mayhem arises, how much ammo is spent. <br /> <br /> Special effects were in stock and well done, emphasizing future technology with holographic displays and controls instead of relying on bulky, cheap plastic products. In addition, the story changed without permission that the viewer could not lose the boredom when they started to change things. <br /> <br /> I'll confirm this one cool Saturday afternoon. You can get up and hit the refrigerator without stopping it and it's still enjoyable. Better yet, your girlfriend can talk about it without damaging your enjoyment - and she'll be happy: in the end she got to TALK! It is this type of film. <br /> <br /> In any case, the actual story line after the planet has hit some holes, but hey, this is the movie of the Guns 'n' Ammo action. A single story is not necessary as long as you have beer and chips. So don't get yourself to the end of the brain.
