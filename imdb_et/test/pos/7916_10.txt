Alexander Nevski is rightly a cinematic masterpiece. However, it is very outdated. People decide not to talk about it and talk about big battles and great music. The sound effects could then be good, but apart from the predecessors' bodies, all sounds are eligible. I can film it, but I'm sure Alexander Nevsky's modern viewer agrees that blatant propaganda and terrible music are damaging the film. I gave this film the 10/10 because it is undoubtedly a masterpiece. However, it has big bits. Teutonic knights' costumes are great and battle scenes are pretty good for the time. However, this is a masterpiece that shows its age.
