Like my 3-year-old and 2-year-old mother, I love AristoCats. It is a film that does not contain double participants, there are almost no swearing words like a devil or a bow, no parents who are not functional idiots, or any kind of foot-or-bloating jokes that are so common nowadays even in "best" children's films. The story is cute and interesting. Music is great. The love story is quite romantic. Kittens are divine and different characters are unique and remarkable. Action is simple and not overwhelming or confusing. The characters are also quite well cast. I love listening to Eva Gabor's velvety voice and there are so many others who are familiar with the child and the characters are so good. It's really a movie of love, tolerance, good ways, and faithfulness. Who doesn't want their children to come across these values? This is a movie that I don't mind watching over and over again, unlike Happy Feet, where I couldn't look at it all the time because it was so irritating. I want production companies to move towards making films.
