This movie has almost never been seen today - the only reason I can enjoy it again and again is the somewhat worn copy of VHS I made when the movie was shown on television in 1991 in England. <br /> <br /> The majority of an ensemble is obvious in itself and is reflected by the viewer. The razor's sharp script helps with things and when you have seen it, you want to watch it over and over again. <br /> <br /> Wayne Rogers is a "star", but everyone contributes to a great movie with a great jazz sound that begins. During the film, there are emotional moments, but never with the sweet sentimentality of the sick - these are boys on a lifetime journey, and they excellently deliver this excitement. <br /> <br /> Very recommended if you can actually see it.
