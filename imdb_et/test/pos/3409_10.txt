The "North and South" television mini-series is in the 80s, which was "Rich Man, Poor Man" (first TV mini-series) in the 70's. <br /> <br /> This is a fabulous customization of the first classic novel by John Jakes. The story itself covers the two decades that led President Abraham Lincoln to the election years and the soon-to-be-declared civil war between North and South. The surrounding stories evolve around the families of threats (headlines) and nets, and their two George and Orry averages, forming friendship, starting their West Point training in 1842. "North and South" is a great historical timeline, and when I'm out of date (and smarter!), it's very interesting to learn about contradictory attitudes about such controversial aspects as "slavery" and "abolitionists" and how these attitudes came from. <br /> <br /> The series also shows some great characteristic developments when we find out about friends and enemies in the lives of George and Orry, as well as women who stole their hearts as young men. This story also looks like a romantic story set against the turbulent background of the American Civil War. <br /> <br /> "North and South" with "Rich Man, a Bad Man" Hides in 1977 "Roots" is the largest mini-series of all time. But this is the second and third and shares the same schedule and themes as "Roots". But don't let it get away, even if it's just seeing big landscapes, costumes and a glorious star image, including Gene Kelly, Johnny Cash, Elizabeth Taylor, James Stewart, Olivia De Havilland, Lesley-Anne Down et al. <br /> <br /> The series is beautifully designed and firmly linked to actual historical events and it is a pity that Emmys and Golden Globe did not respect much more actors and actors for their images. Patrick Swayze and James Read, two virtual unidentified executives, are performing major performances with Orry Main and George Hazard, respectively. However, Kirstie Alley's riveting result is George's "Abolition" sister Virgilia, who steals the show several times. In addition, Terri Garber, David Carradine, and Philip Casnoff are Elkanah Bent, tasteful crooks who just love to hate. <br /> <br /> "North and South" Books 1 and 2 are now available on two DVDs.
