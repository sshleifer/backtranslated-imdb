This documentary follows the origins and lives of the Zephyr skateboard train crew, using film clips made in the 1970s (mainly by Craig Stecyk) with team members and other influential people. <br /> <br /> The first part of the film documents reveals how the "Dogtown" part of Venice (CA) began at the turn of the century, when the city was founded as a European city similar to Venice, Italy. In the 1970s, the rest of the local attraction, the Pacific Park, was abandoned, leaving a beach with many openable pier and other hazards. The poor children in the area had nothing better to do than surf, and they were excelled despite (or perhaps) their surroundings. Since the waves dissipate in the afternoon, they took the time to fill their time, and the empty pools and surfing caused by the droughts of those years allowed them to create a vertical skateboarding system, which is today the mainstream. I found that the film was much more about surfing than I expected, which seemed like a bonus, because before I was watching the movie, I really didn't know about surfing or skateboarding. Music, not surprisingly, was also good. I also liked how these children followed their passion and generally had a better experience. Some of the things that were not so good for me were the drama they were trying to create, which seemed somewhat forced, and the somewhat overestimated sense of self-esteem of the team (although this is probably just the street position they grew up from). This does not mean that they did not have a significant impact, but only that it seems highly likely that there are other factors. One note: my wife is more affected by nausea than the movies use what we call "SpastiCam" (camera movements). This movie is often guilty, so if you are so troubled, warn it. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone, but especially anyone who has skateboarding and / or surfing in their history. <br /> <br /> Revised 5/11/2002.
