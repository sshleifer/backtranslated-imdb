Beloved Today's Exhibition !!! It was a variety, not just cooking (which would have been great). Very stimulating and enchanting, always keeping the viewer behind the corner to see what's coming. She is like on earth and as pleasant as you get, like one of us who made the show even more enjoyable. Special guests, who are also friends, have also made a nice surprise. He loved the "first" theme and the audience was also invited to play. I have to admit that I was shocked to see that he has some things under his time limits, but he did it and golly wrote these recipes. Saving time in the kitchen means more time with your family. Those who have not yet been tuned in will find out what channel and time, I assure you that you will not be disappointed.
