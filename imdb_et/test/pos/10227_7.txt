This is a terrible story. But maybe not as you know it. Real monsters in this flick are people. When monsters are human and prey. As strange as it may seem, I can see it for fear film fans "Monsters Inc". <br /> <br /> Of course, its consequences are amazing film, monsters are like all monster-based films. Gore is also there, there is even Dr Decker in shape (played by David Cronenberg; I see Cillian Murphy flash as Dr. Jonathan Crane in Batman Starts here - or is it the other way round?). And this is Decker & c who are bad guys. Monsters mostly want to wake up their business by preventing intrusive people from being more or less wrong, wanting to join society there. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, you actually grow like little monsters (and a dog) - not what you expected from the first scenes.
