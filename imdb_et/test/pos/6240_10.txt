It's awesome! Everything from Score to Final Credit Role. This movie is a masterpiece. It's really horrible and its effective hysterical device is enough to slip. It is obvious that the film was NOT rushed and that David Schmoeller (who would later work in Fullmoon's Puppet Theater) had a clear and concise picture of what he was trying to steer. The professional aspect of the film is amazing considering its relatively small budget. It relies on fear without being affected (mainly due to budget constraints), but still creates a tense atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Stephen King said it was one of his favorite films and I can't blame him seriously! This is one of my favorite horror movies and always. This is my favorite Fullmoon Movie and since then I've bought it a few years ago. <br /> <br /> Money well spent! I have both VHS and DVD versions. <br /> <br /> 10/10
