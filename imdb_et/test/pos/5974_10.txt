Rise (1977) <br /> <br /> Larisa Shepitko is a very little known name. His bright career as a director lasted only a decade, and ended in a tragic car accident. Despite his short career, he managed to create the best Soviet films of his time. His latest film The Ascent is widely regarded as one of the best Soviet films of the 1970s. Nevertheless, his work remained vague in the coming years, usually only on rare and bad copies of the video. It has now changed due to people in the criterion. They have issued two of Shepitko's best works through their Eclipse department - Wings and his penultimate masterpiece "The Ascent". <br /> <br /> The darkest days of World War II in a snowy countryside in Russia have two partisans on their way around the world. Countries looking for food after Nazi patrols attack their parties. They are originally only on a nearby farm, but when they arrive, they find the Germans kidnapped. They do not want to go back with an empty hand, but continue deeper into the enemy's territory. Along the way, they must stand not only with enemy soldiers, but with harsh conditions on Russian plains, possible betrayal and their own souls. <br /> <br /> The film does not belong to the equipment or destinations of the simplified plot. It deals with difficult and painful rationality issues. It never makes a simple way or gives us comforting answers. The other side of the film is full of moral dilemmas. Shepitko shows us the intimate horrors of wars between Russian companions - those who worked together and those who fought back. Although she shows her associates a clear heel, she still shows why many turned to such tactics - survival. <br /> <br /> The film contains a number of religious references, especially for crossing. It is the spiritual journey, the heart, soul, and minds of the two partisans and those they come into contact with. Shepitko and his operator hit the road with beautiful black and white photography. The camera moves with a long frame, similarly to the camera work of Andrei Tarkovski, Russia's biggest filmmaker. Like many others, Shepitko was obviously influenced by Tarkovsky's style, and Ascent takes part in his rhythmic remarks about Ivan's childhood. This is a stunning movie to watch, and it does a fantastic job of capturing the cold and dreadful atmosphere of a busy Russia. <br /> <br /> Shepitko's wife would honor her big movie ten years later. Element Klimov made one of the greatest films of my warriors I've ever seen - come and see. The story and themes of this film have clearly risen from the rise. Although this film is also quite unclear, he paid more attention to the fact that none of Shepitko's films. But it worked as a bridge to Shepitko and has been one of the best tools to keep your work alive. <br /> <br /> Ascent is a really great movie and should be rightly considered one of the best films of the 70s. It's stunning cinematography; its mood is terrifying; and its lessons are unforgettable. It is something other than a masterpiece in every sense of the word. It is unfortunate that Shepitko's career was short as he hit his top.
