One night at McCool is a very funny movie that is more intelligent than what it should be. Its form is more complicated than expected and its randomness was great. Movie thoughts (mysogeny, sadism, foolish men) are infantile. That's what I have to say about this movie, that it not only hates women, but it carries people. It has no sympathy for any man. This seems to be due to the form, but the end says it all. No one cares about it. <br /> <br /> The form has the first two-thirds of the film that is spoken in three characters: Dumb Barman Dillon; Reiser, a mysogenist stupid lawyer; and Goodman, stupid, your cops. That is why the story is always perverse with their own images and changed reality. The traveler's BBQ fantasy is a great touch. Finally, we never know the truth and nothing seems to be true. Dillon was never so innocent and so on. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is funny. From the coincidence of the last 5 seconds of the movie to the overly obvious Tyler manipulations, it seems that the film has all its energy. Everything is just blue, and nothing seems reasonable. Do we really care if it is? No. <br /> <br /> It is also a very dark comedy, but it has a low performance. Think of Sister Betty or Jawbreaker. Very candy covered outside, dark chewing inside. If you like your movies randomly, in the dark or just clean, watch this movie. It will satisfy your applause for the oddity that is one night at McCool. <br /> <br /> 8/10
