This movie appeared at the same time as Pretty Woman. While the general theme is the same: a wealthy man meets and learns to love poor working class women, Romuald and Juliette characters are much more lovable and valuable with them. I have never forgotten them and I think the film is as much as a beautiful woman. Juliette is a remarkable woman and the smart ways she overcomes her problems gives you joy. The latest scenes include some of the most memorable lines in romantic comedy. Attempts for Romuald to win Juliette's love are hundreds of times more than a pretty woman's climbing place. Watch this movie, it warms your heart.
