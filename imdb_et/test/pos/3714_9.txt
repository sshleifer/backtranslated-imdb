Based on William Faulkner's short story, there are two soldiers short film, a movie that has enough story, emotion, and a big movie movie, which will eventually leave you more willing. The story includes two black poor Mississippi brothers, one child only, the other old enough to volunteer for war efforts just after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The younger brother, who played great with the newcomer Jonathan Furr, does not want to let his elder brother go, and he puts his efforts into the army himself. Ron Perlman gives grace to a colonel who decides to help a child, but it touches the soul, but touches it. <br /> <br /> Because it is only 39 minutes long, it is hard to find a pearl (probably limited to the festival district now), but remember the name of Aaron Schneider - this picture marks him as an observer.
