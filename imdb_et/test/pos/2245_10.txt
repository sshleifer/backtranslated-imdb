Once again, the doctor who delivers the goods to the bucket. It has humor ("You're doing it just the way you go!" "Yes, but I'm doing it great"), action, monsters (in this case, more kick-ass cyber-men), tragedy and intimidation tactics. In short, just what the doctor ordered (pun). The way emotions move from one to another is so well done that you don't feel against it. So, encrypt up to four of the last four episodes that have laughed at you, made you cry and put you in the "eek". <br /> <br /> As far as character development is concerned, it is obviously Noel Clarke Mickey (and Ricky). Being one of your medical associates, you know that he is doing the right thing and may even suspect how he does it. But it is still the emotional key when it affirms its future path. <br /> <br /> Although "Cyber ​​Men's Rise" had caused more frightening fear, "The Age of Steel" is all a blast. As "Alien" compared to "aliens" - so a real classic, but differently. Can the series be kept at this level? Hope.
