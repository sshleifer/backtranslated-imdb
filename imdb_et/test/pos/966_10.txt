After seeing Big Fat Liar, I felt Jason learned a lot more. When he was telling the truth about Marty's stealing, it was like a boy who called the wolf. People heard him, but they didn't believe him. Nobody did anything to help him. Besides, not only Marty's films smell, but also his advice. The truth has not been overestimated. I'm so glad she got what she really is. Everyone learned that he stole this boy, including his parents. He not only stole this boy and lied about it, but gave them another job and tried to call it his own, plagiarism. Does he not know that someone's idea of ​​plagiarism is illegal? Another reason he was fired. He's not reliable. He's a liar, a scam, a thief, a claw and a plagiarism. You got this Marty? You're a plagiarism. Plus, you have everything you deserve.
