I have read the last comment on this movie and I have to accept it completely and completely. <br /> <br /> I can see that I am a Portuguese citizen, and although this film can say a little to a person from Boston, it certainly says something to both the Portuguese and Brazilian people as well as to immigrants everywhere. <br /> <br /> And why, you wonder? First of all, this film deals with two brothers: Portugal and Brazil. Brazil gained its independence at the beginning of the 19th century (heir to the Portuguese throne) and since then relations have improved significantly. But it makes sense, because it may be, there are still many biases. Due to the economic climate in Brazil in the 1990s, immigration into Portugal increased massively. You see, Portugal is not just a country with a similar language, culture and beliefs as Brazil, but also a gateway to Europe. Some people were therefore forced to make a decision to cross the Atlantic and look for a better life, and Portugal was the first logical place to try immigration. <br /> <br /> Since this is still the case for many immigrants, they were below average wages and treated as "dirt" - only when the language is similar, they were constantly informed Another curious thing about this movie is this idea , which he expresses about how a person who is so familiar with the history of his own country still tried to get a little bit to export the coveted national resources. It is these people who are holding Brazil in a state of constant arrest, because the country is well equipped with natural resources and can easily climb the economic ladders if it is given a fair opportunity. <br /> <br /> In the sense, this means how colonialism still exists - Pablo, who represents the exploited, Igor, whose status as "noble" (or at least rich or "well off") is guaranteed by stranger colonial power which is in turn represented by Kraft. <br /> <br /> If you have seen other Salles films, you will recognize it as a recurring topic - the struggle against oppressive force. I don't want to read or be patronizing to teach anyone history, but I thought this film was very powerful symbolically. I am not saying there was no room for improvement (as always), but I think that the last comment written on it was not only narrow hands, but unknown hands. <br /> <br /> One last thing to say about this is to assume that you have watched this movie in the eyes of the American filmmaker. There is no harm to this comment, but I mean that "foreign" movies may not all be "beautiful scenery" - art is dealing with the problems of that time. For example, do you expect Otto Dix to paint all the beautiful spots in Bayern and Black Forg ... Why should you expect a filmmaker to focus only on the landscape if he feels there are more relevant questions? br /> <br /> In short, don't rate movies lightly and with just two or three criteria. This film is very interesting, its photography is pretty good and even the idea of ​​black and white color goes hand in hand with what it does. I believe the picture is purposefully grainy ... like reality, no? :) <br /> <br /> See this and get your conclusions ...
