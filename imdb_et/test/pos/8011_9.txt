I looked at this exhibition until puberty, but I still found that it reflects many situations that worry when we're teenagers, though it was a family show. Until the mid-90s, it focused more on young adults and their situations. <br /> <br /> That's why I loved "step by step". I mean, it offered situations of all ages, and unlike many of these examples, it showed expectations. <br /> <br /> Let's face it; it was not a very funny show, no, but it had some situations that could be felt, but only funny. <br /> <br /> There was a great charm between Patrick Duffy and Susan Sommers. Duffy shook! Sommers was gentle and funny. I was in love with Stacy Keegan because she was very sexy (loved her feet) and witty. But Sasha Mitchell stole the exhibition with her Cody character. He was a man a day ago! Oh memories. Nowadays, this exhibition was not suitable for the new generations and should therefore be kept in memory. It's just memories. <br /> <br /> Thank you step by step for making your puberty more fun.
