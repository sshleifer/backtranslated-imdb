Otto Preminger, director of "The Moon in Blue", touched even more on taboo topics in his controversial 1955 release "Man with Golden Shoulder". When he was in his 1953 mild comedy "The Moon is Blue" with "virgin" and "mistress" used the American Moving Image Association, Preminger went far beyond what each film "Man with" the Golden Arm, as Dick Powell did An epic of its laws and procedures at the end of the Earth (1946) on preventing the international movement of drugs, based on the Nelson Algrenian novel, which won the National Accounting Award of 1950, this funny, uncompromising, 119-minute monochrome melodrama heroin addiction. The American film association would not give its approval because the filmmakers depicted drug addiction. refrain from illegal drugs However, United Artists released this unique image of Frank Sinatra and rose to over $ 4 million. <br /> <br /> The critical and commercial success of the "Golden Army Man" ruled out the production code. As a result, the MPAA has changed the Code so that filmmakers could get into other taboo issues such as drug abuse, kidnapping, abortion and prostitution. The film received three candidates for the Academy Award. The Oscar nominees went to Sinatra's best actor, Joseph C. Wright and Darrell Silver to set up the best works of art, black and white and Elmer Bernstein to evaluate the best music, dramatic or comedy. Indeed, Elmer Bernstein made his name for his jazz score. Manufacturers had thought Marlon Brando was casting a title, but Sinatra beat Brando for a blow. With Ole Blue Eyes, Eleanor Parker, Kim Novak, Arnold Stang, Darren McGavin and Robert Strauss played. McGavin was especially memorable as an amazing heroin dealer, while Eleanor Parker played a dead woman in a dark, deep secret that is a real shock. <br /> <br /> "A man with a golden arm" refers to the ability of the main character Frankie Machine to manipulate the card. Frankie offers maps to Zero Schwiefka (Robert Strauss, "Stalag 17"), but he has left the federal drug hospital for the last six months, recovering from heroin addiction. Not only did Frankie licked the habit, but she also learned how to play drums and plans to start a music career. Optimistic, if Frank is about his future, he will find himself again with his past when he returns to his old stings. Schwiefka wants her to deal with her again, and Nifty Louie Fomorowski ("Counter-Attack" by Darren McGavin) tries to continue using heroin. Meanwhile, Frankie comes to an end, a wheelchair-bound woman, Zosh (Eleanor Parker, "Escape from Fort Bravo") who manipulates her with guilt. Frankie was drunk when she had a car accident and Zosh finished her wheelchair. Frankie appears with a lot of hopes and a drum set, but Zosh doesn't see him as a musician for the future and urges him to go to work with Schwiefka. Frankie is going to visit music promotion and one of her friends, Sparrow (Arnold Stang, "My Sister Eileen"), in the shops of the Frankie department store brand. After Frankie refuses to work for Schwiefka because she sees Harry Lane (Will Wright, "The Wild One"), Schwiefka turns to Frank and Sparrow. In the meantime, the shop charges can be canceled at the Schwiefka Brachs department store. The suit was worth $ 37.00. Frankie agrees to continue trading with Schweifka and hustler retreats him. Not long after, despite his resolution to stop using heroin, Frankie breaks down and pays $ 2.00 for a correction for Louie. <br /> <br /> Finally, Frankie meets Harry Lane and Lane warns her that she's trying Frankie to shoot her with nothing to do with her. What poor Frankie does not know is that Zosh has restored his walking ability, but uses his guilt against an accident to detain him. Zosh is also jealous of his lower neighbor, Molly Novotny (Kim Novak, "Picnic"), Frankie's former sweetheart, who runs drinks at a nearby stripe band called the Safari Club. When Zosh complains about headaches that Frankie is putting his drum kit into practice, Frankie Molly moves into the apartment. Schwiefka and Louie are planning a bigger poker game with Sam Markette (George E. Stone of Guys and Dolls) and Williams (George Mathews "Gunfight at OK Corral"), two long-time players who have heard of Frank and his legendary golden hand . Schwiefka and Louie persuade the reluctant Frankie to deal with $ 250. After an early winning scenario, Frankie will lose and will not be able to reverse his bad luck. In fact, Frankie spends about two days. Tired, his nerves shot and desperately repaired, he breaks down the other day and Markette and Williams cheat him. Louie refuses to fix Frankie, so Frankie strikes her and redeems her apartment for heroin. <br /> <br /> Preminger doesn't strike "Man with Golden Grace" and the film is quite disappointing. None of the signs here are sympathetic. Basically, they are either hustlers or hustled. Sinatra gives another dynamite like McGavin and Parker. Certainly, "The Human With Golden Shoulder" has lost much of its influence in the mid-50s or more, but it is still the most important film.
