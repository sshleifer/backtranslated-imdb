It's not as good as a movie that said it's cute kids. Okay, so the emperor has slipped again and turned into a selfish corrupted brat, accepts it and enjoy the comic as fun. It has a lot of fun and attention for children. It also has two original film artists. Earth Kitt, who has been in many films, but I'm sure many people know as Catwoman. And Patrick Walburton (sorry when I wrote it wrong), who has appeared in many films and TV series, but is widely known. It's really a rare and wonderful combination. If for some other reason I want the comic book fans to look at at least one episode to enjoy a dynamic duo. In conclusion, fun children's programs with lots of fun make adults laugh together. If you are looking for your educational value, it is not your show. If you're just looking for something funny, it's great Saturday morning!
