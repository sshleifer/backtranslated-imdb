Regardless of what his critics are following, I enjoyed exactly what it is. Eyecandy on both sides of the gender spectrum. Soderberg has played hard edges before, won the Oscar, is at the top of his game. Ocean 12 is a light, commercial, fluffy, Steve's Day in Midway, if you want. I'm not usually a fan of Zeta-Jones, but even I have to admit that Kate is FUTURE in this movie. It ends up shouting for future trequels and I'm one of the millions who ran to see George and Brad in 120 minutes and Matt parlay through Clooney's mines in Lago di Como, when they robbed again and again of abundant fish. If we tolerated the Lord's contribution to the 3 rings, would we ask if we could break the cover of Clooney's salt and pepper once more?
