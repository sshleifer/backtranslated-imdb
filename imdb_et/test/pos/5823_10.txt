One of the other evaluators has mentioned that after watching only one Oz episode you have to be hooked. They're right because that's what happened to me. <br /> <br /> The first thing that struck me with Oz was his cruel and violent hostile scenes that were over the word GO. Trust me, it's not a weak-hearted or timid exhibition. This show won't hit drugs, sex, or violence. It is hard for classic use. <br /> <br /> This is called OZ because it is the nickname offered to Oswald's state of maximum security. It mainly focuses on Emerald City, which is an experimental part of the prison, where all the cells have a glass chest and inward, so privacy is not on the agenda. Em City is home to many people .. Ares, Muslims, Gangsters, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and others .... so scuffles, death looks, malicious relationships and shady agreements are never far away. <br /> <br /> I would say that the main complaint of the exhibition is due to the fact that it goes where other exhibitions do not dare. Forget the pretty pictures painted on the mainstream audience, forget the magic, forget the romance ... OZ is not messy. The first episode I ever saw struck me as disgusting as it was surreal, I couldn't say I was ready for that, but when I looked more, I worked for Oz and got used to the high level of graphic violence. Not only violence, but injustice (crooked guards sold out for nickel, prisoners who kill and get away with order, good visas, middle-class prisoners who have become prisoners because of the lack of modern skills) or prison experience) Oz may be pleased with what is uncomfortable viewing .... this is when you can connect to your darker side.
