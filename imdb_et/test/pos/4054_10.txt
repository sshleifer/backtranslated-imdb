I first saw this movie on PBS. Then I bought the video and watched it countless times. Every time I watch it, I get something else. This is a real sign that you want to keep a good life, but now the world is changing. But you don't have to be parents to keep the past, even young characters like Charlotte don't want to change things. The overall tone and mood is great. The cast is outstanding with all the characters like Kathy Bates, Beau Bridges and Arthur Kennedy. And it's fun to see the upcoming stars before they hit more recognizable feature films, such as Kevin J. O'Connor (The Mummy) and Vincent D'Onofrio (men in black and legal and correct: criminal intent - one of my favorite shows). This is just one of those movies that will stay with you.
