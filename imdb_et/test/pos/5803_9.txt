This exhibition was so tiring to see and there are only two numbers in the sunken world (alternate of love) and paradise (not for me) if you can sit and just ponder it all. Opening this exhibition is historically the most visually exciting, as Madonna goes on stage with a giant Swarovski crystal ball that comes down from the ceiling and the large screens behind her show pictures of horses. Horses play a role in this show because Madonna falls. Madonna's notorious scene of the crucifix is ​​over 12 million in this show, as many African children are orphaned by AIDS. Finally, anyone who is interested in donating will appear on the website. Then we go to the environmental issue and again show pictures of politics and religion. There's in the meantime, and then the show will start again with I Love New York music and Ray of Light, which is part of the show, one of my favorites, where dancers make funny hand movements there. After all, the number of the music, along with the song Disco Inferno, is mixed with the song and the dancers know more about it. The end is full of energy because the show is packed with Lucky Star and Hung Up and at the end there are hundreds of golden balloons ending with "Have you admitted?" comes up. The DVD is worth buying and when it came out the show's soundtrack was added as a bonus. Jonas Akerlund did a great job with the material of this exhibition to match the style of the trip.
