I almost finished watching Hindi movies due to mediocre quality and story. One exception is Ramgopal Verma films. This is a nice movie with great productions. It must see a movie for those who are sick when they are watching dancing dances and love stories. The story's customization and characterization was exceptionally good. You should watch this movie for Nana Patekar. based on Mumbai policeman Daya Naikil, this film is more realistic. The film is different from the life of an ordinary person, who is an experienced specialist. I appreciate it as one of the best film of the year
