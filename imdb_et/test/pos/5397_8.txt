Enjoy this movie that completely deals with the middle family, so it will appear. Ben Travis (Jeff Daniels) plays the role of a father who is only interested in one son who is great at swimming and has won a lot of trophy, but he hates it very much and even his father. Ben has very little to say to his second son Tim (Emile Hirsh) and even his daughter Penny (Michelle Williams) who is fortunate to be away from college. Mother, Sandy (Sigourney Weaver) is trying to keep the family together and her husband has completely ignored it. In the family there is a very tragic event that changes the personality of everyone, the young and the old start using drugs, smoking the pot and drinking constantly. There is even a homosexual scene, and at the same time there is even a comedy room, and of course there is a very dark secret that Sandy Travis finally tells his son Tim.
