The film doesn't take itself seriously and if you follow its leadership, you will have fun (as long as you don't mind your murders being really bloody, and your horror has been added to the cheese)! <br /> <br /> This movie looks to every horror fan and then gives them a finger. She knows it sucks, and that's why it's the best of the "child's games" series. <br /> <br /> It's so good that it's a "strange humor," you find yourself more than just laughing, but with it. And trust me, all the time you laugh, it laughs back. <br /> <br />
