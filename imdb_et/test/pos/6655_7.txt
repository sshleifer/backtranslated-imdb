I went to this movie to think that I didn't like it, but hoping to be surprised, but like a movie ended with darkness and hopelessness. But don't get me wrong, Minghella gives every big epic and those who enjoy this experience and is ready to take this adventure and accept what it is, they don't have to be disappointed and it's the best movies of the year. The action is of high quality and is likely to disappear in the Oscar Zero Trinity Act by Kidman and Zellweger, although Portman's small scenes may be the most powerful in the film. Locations are beautiful and Minghella sees a good picture. <br /> <br /> For similar people who want the director to take them on an adventure, instead of inadvertently going off, they may be disappointed mainly due to Minghella. and his adaptation. The film is so boring that what I consider to be an epic of a pocket bag is a film that tries to forcefully capture feelings, but makes it so extreme and so often that I didn't have time to invest emotionally during the film or had recovered from the previous blow and that change unrealistic and consequently too difficult to care for, let alone predictable. All in all, the "cold mountain" almost gave the impression that even the good facets of the film, because everything I remember is death, which may be the original motive, but which is the focus instead of the characters.
