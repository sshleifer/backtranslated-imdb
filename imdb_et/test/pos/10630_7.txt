First, those who are heart-weak should definitely avoid this movie. Even those who are the most graphically violent and sexual acts of film making should be careful. I'm not telling you that you would drive away from the movie, but remember that what you see is some kind of disturbing material. Definitely not a pleasant movie to watch, but nothing will put the screen strictly on shock value. But I have to admit that when I was watching the movie for the second time, I have to go to the next chapter when "razor blade scene" appeared. <br /> <br /> The main character is one of the most sympathetic sympathetic symbols I mean, but we will later become more familiar with the character's humanity in another film. In one scene, in a broken glass, his pupil's jacket in his pocket after his dissatisfaction with his apparently unsatisfactory performance and nervousness when he lives in the audience. The student goes into his pocket and shouts as he looks at his blood color with his hand. Razor blade next to the scene that most disturbed me. The pupil's mother is not much more sympathetic than she is. When he gets the word that his daughter is unable to play, he says he was injured in his hand, being one of the spoiled mothers trying to torture his daughter for a surplus. <br /> <br /> Although the film has been of interest to me and has mostly been of interest to me, I felt the need to explain more about Isabelle Huppert's character. If a woman is fascinated by sadomasochistic porn movies and deals with this behavior, you want to understand the problem. The film finds that he desperately wants to be loved. So why disgust towards everyone? Why does he get sexual pleasure? <br /> <br /> Functioning is terrible and I liked shiny, stylized lighting. All in all, this is not the movie I would like you to be in for entertainment, but as I said, it is very interesting. And I'm sure if I watched it a couple of times, I'd be able to see some nuances that give more light to the film's aspects I didn't know at first. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
