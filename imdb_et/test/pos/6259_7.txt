Malcolm McDowell diagnoses Megan Gallagher's daughter and the form of her illness when they believe they see "Huldre", a troll-like creature living under "rocks and roots" (to cite a movie). > <br /> In principle, the family moves to an older house with a small dollhouse in the backyard. The daughter (well played by Sofia Vassiliova) starts making friends with the creatures until they become honest. The family also disappears. <br /> <br /> The psychiatrist at Megan Gallagher ("Millennium") and Malcolm McDowell are some good scenes. There is also something strange that happened to one McDowell patient. <br /> <br /> If you like this story, you may also like "Bad Ronald", which had a strange theme, and the house is a haunting bad Ronald (Scott Jacoby) only this movie is from the 70s. 7/10
