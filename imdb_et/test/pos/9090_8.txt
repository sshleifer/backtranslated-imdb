Flatliners has all the good ingredients of Joel Schumacher's film - intelligent, youthful characters, stunning cinematography, thrilling story and great performances. It's entertaining fun, but it's very well done and resonates with a positive mental message, despite cautious prerequisites. <br /> <br /> Schumacher has the ability to mark talented young actors and all the main ways to move on are things (see list). Their credible performances help to raise this film above average. Kiefer Sutherland stands out in his egoistic role as a med-student. <br /> <br /> Cinematography truly stimulates the better side of the brain that I love about Schumacher; using its light and location creates images. A worrying spooky atmosphere is hoping that will amaze you while watching a movie and haunt you at bedtime - reminded me of the missing guys. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that takes awesome space - curious students want to know what's after death, and watch it successfully on a frightening, gripping salvation table. One of Schumacher's best; highly recommended.
