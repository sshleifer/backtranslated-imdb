Although the film is not faithful to the novels of the original, it succeeds in creating a modern Gothic vampire vision. Someone tried to blame QotD, calling it a 1.5-hour music video. In fact, this is an addition. Continuous gothic music with music-video-like shots made the film so enjoyable - and "Queen of Damn" is a mood-driven story. <br /> <br /> I don't understand hard fans who complain about the story. The plot has been changed to make it less confusing for viewers who don't know the novels. The number of characters was reduced and I have no problems with changing the Lestat maker or skipping Mekare's character. The biggest change - the romance of Lestat and Jesse - seemed to me a very nice addition. <br /> <br /> In fact, I think faithful adaptation would be a complete failure. The slow and gloomy mood perfect for the 19th century in New Orleans and Louis was not suitable for the Lestat rebellion and his music. And while the book may be slow, descriptive, and combined with many elements that still deliver them well, the film just can't do that without chaotic changes. "Vampire Lestat" and "Damned Queen" can share at least three movies - the creators had to choose something. <br /> <br /> Some special effects, such as flying or flames, are the only things I didn't like about this movie. But Akasha's death was great. The cast was good, Stuard Townsend was convincing as Lestat, especially at the concert, but I preferred Banderas as Armand. I loved Jesse, Maharet and Marius. And of course Aaliyah was perfect with his almost-ancient-Egyptian accent. <br /> <br /> So if you are in Gothic music and the vampire dill of loneliness and eternity (and you don't consider books as movie scenarios), "The Queen of Fucking" is one of the few films that show vampires more than sucking blood. But please do not compare it with the "Interview" movie. It has a completely different style, just as many as Louis and Lestat. Personally, I find this to be a fascinating first look at the existence of a vampire from the point of view of the Louis bottle outlet, and then the transition to a moral but surprisingly outgoing vampire, Lestat. <br /> <br /> I'll give "Queen" to 8 out of 10 because she had technical errors, but I decided to give it 9 because hateful people hate just because it didn't match their vision of books, which can be clearly seen by looking at the distribution of votes.
