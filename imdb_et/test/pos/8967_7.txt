Mike Nichols' film "The Charlie Wilson War", which has taken place in the 1980s, tells us how the title character (played by Tom Hanks) succeeded in hiding the war with the Russians by helping Afghan troops. Of course, we know how well it turned out in the long run, but luckily the film does not reflect the unpleasant effects. <br /> <br /> Adults are cast, Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts are among Hollywood's most financial stars. As a bonus, you have a versatile Philip Seymour Hoffman characteristically memorable supporting role for which he did not receive an unjustified Oscar nominee. I'm not a Robert's fan, but Hanks is always dependable. However, I cannot buy her as a woman using a drug, although the actual Charlie Wilson seems to be just as pleasing as Hanks. In addition to the big three, there is not much to mention, even from a recognizable name like Amy Adams. <br /> <br /> The story is tempting and supported by the subtle script Aaron Sorkin. The verbal interaction between the key characters is excellent and it is full of memorable features. The subsequent events triggered by the war have not been ignored, although Wilson's respecting book scene scenes are, in my opinion, too serious to achieve the bittersweet feeling that was probably intended. All in all, the direction of Nichols is similar to that of the work, and it follows the script's action perfectly. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that, like Charlie Wilson, has some flaws, but which is amazingly pleasant. Definitely recommended for three star fans and those looking for an engaging political drama with a light feel.
