Still funny after all these years. Midnight Madness is a good entertainment for all ages. It introduces Michael J Fox as a typical 15-year-old problem maker. Melio and Blaylak are the funniest characters in it and Leon is totally busy as a game captain. The romance between Adam and the girl could not be cheese. Fagabeefe !!!!
