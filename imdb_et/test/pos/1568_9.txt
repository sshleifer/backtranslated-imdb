This is a very amazing movie! The signs seemed so realistic to me, it was hard to believe they were not real people. From the south, I thought that Judith Ivey's character seemed particularly real and, as everyone else mentioned, he did outstanding actions. The characters are not beautiful and do not see anything like the Hollywood stars - their imperfect bodies and personalities seem so natural and real. <br /> <br /> One reviewer noted that the main character, Alice, was not a good reason to get away from home, which is true - he had no moral or sensible reason to escape, such as abusive child abuse, etc. I thought she was just tired of working class work and wanted to flee to Florida, where her friend lived in an attractive and privileged life of a college student in Miami. The actor shows Alice's confusion, uncertainty and questioning as a decisive and willingness to control her life with impressive naturalness. The film also shows how Alice is trapped in situations where there seem to be no possibilities, to put her in panic, act and get help. At first, the terrible filmmaking style led me out and made me think that it was a very small budget or a homemade movie, but in reality it is very well done. The quality of home movies makes you feel like you are with characters, part of your RV journey across the country. This is definitely a movie worth seeing, although I don't understand all of its descriptions as a heart-warming story. It is sometimes quite vulgar and disturbing, even if it is not at all completely sad.
