Pretty funny stuff. Charlie was still at the top when he did it for a brave short soldier in the First World War. Dear, because after all, the war was still going on and it was a comedy about serious business. <br /> <br /> Gags are fun without having fun or tears. One successful scene follows another, like Chaplin, and his comrades try to sleep in a bunk deep in the water. (From there we got the term "trench leg"). Probably the most ridiculous episode of Chaplin's disguised as a tree and fixed any number of German soldiers as they try to fill allied soldiers who have been caught behind the lines. Edna Purviance, Chaplin's main rather then, is a woman who works with Americans and has been saved from being executed. <br /> <br /> Chaplin continues to have more fun and more ambitious things, but it's better than most in this short time.
