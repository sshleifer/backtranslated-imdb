A Japanese pearl, where so many of the world's best films are made today. Stylishly, this is nothing special. It's just a simple drama (with some comic shades) about recognizable people living in their lives. Yuko Tanaka, the most well-known Lady Eboshi in Princess Mononoke, plays a 50-year-old spinster. She is proud of her health, spends vigorous workouts every morning as she brings milk up and down the steep mountains of Nagasaki. After this part-time job, he does his usual job as an official in the grocery store (called S-Mart, who made this dark army strangle). His 50-year-old man dies through his milk. It turns out that a milk woman and a man, a childcare worker, are dated in high school, and apparently they still have something to break. The film actually has some important narrative problems. When a scriptwriter actually wants to connect two unique lovers, he uses a pretty incredible deus ex machina technique. The climatic sequence is also really forced. But most of the movies are from two main characters, as well as from many sides beautifully small and attentive. The film also has several subplots that seem to end up weighing the movie, but never do it. I think the best thing about the film is when Tanaka is a heartbreaking performance as a lonely milk woman who has left alone for the rest of her life. Regardless of the problems, the film usually exceeds them.
