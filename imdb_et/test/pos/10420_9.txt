Directed by Ramin Niami, the item is delivered anywhere in the city. This fun farce is, in my opinion, the tradition of comedy by Mel Brooks. Niami pokes fun in New York society, creating incredible, eccentric and tragic signs of one rental apartment building, bringing them to life with the very opening single images that introduce them. The performance of Peter Stormare as a homosexual Shakespeare actor is absolutely worthwhile and a worthwhile film is generally good to show the hopelessness and laughter of self-centered ambitions. Sandra Bernhard is poured into a perfectly straight, self-confident therapist. I really enjoyed Sandra's performance very much, especially since I'm not a very big fan yet. Bai Ling, Ornella Muti and Bulle Ogier offer an international ensemble par excellence. I loved the scene of Robert John Burke and his idiotic gang who could not kidnap if their life depends on it. With the appearance of Mayor Ed Kochi and a firm performance by the revolutionary mum Paul Paul Anthony Stewart, somewhere in the city will be entertained without beatings.
