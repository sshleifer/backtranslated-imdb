I watched this movie for curiosity and pure nostalgia over this main night. I liked (not liked) "Mork & Mindy" as a child, mainly for Robin William's vigorous energy behavior. This movie reminded me why. Was the original great? Not really, but Robin was definitely. What brings me to this movie. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised, waiting not only for the color, but also for the chronological exhibition (which was the way it was). But of course, Robin focused. It was interesting to see Robin on the road fighters fighting for the national statue and how such a drastic difference affected him and his long-suffering woman. And my hat is the star of Chris Diamantopoulos because he depicted Mr Williams with honesty, sensitivity and heart; not only a lovely impression, even though it was even dead. (In an independent remark, I noticed that Robin's struggles were somewhat similar to Andy Kaufman, who had been underestimated by the online TV, and creatively rejected, but that's behind the scenes of Taxi. to know about the man behind the hurricane, the action was hard for the melodramatic, as I suspected, and the story for the good. a great masterpiece (I would have liked to see more about Pam Dawber), but definitely traceable, especially for those Robin Williams and Mork & Mindy fans who were there.
