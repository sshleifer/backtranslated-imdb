This is a great example of the very few Hollywood movies that are probably provocative, touching, and not with a sense of humor, Kevin McKidd and Paula Sage are excellent. <br /> <br /> I watched it on television late at night and I can see why I was caught, this is not a movie that the multi-screen "mega" cinema shows today, regret. <br /> <br /> I'm looking for a DVD. Not for those who prefer, the current trend towards special effects and not the story. If you like the most sold book "The Curious Incident of Dogs at Night", you will enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is next to the best Scottish films, such as "Small Face" and "Trainspotting". All the movies Kevin McKidd is playing are very big. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
