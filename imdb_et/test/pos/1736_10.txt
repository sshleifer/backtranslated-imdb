I'm serious about Dr Who. <br /> <br /> Seriously, don't just leave me a "sci-fi person" because I'm not. I got stuck because my friend got me shut when they started. In fact, it is really funny and more often than it is fast paced. My whole family looks at it pretty much and it's a miracle. <br /> <br /> Christopher Ecclestion is pretty good, but David Tennant is great. I think it's because he made the doctor so manic and it's just nice that this bit of eccentricity on the TV label would be again. work like watches. <br /> <br /> Everything I say is just a try. One episode (probably the best if you don't choose a two-piece to the other).
