This movie was very good, not big, but very good. It is based on Ruben Santiago Hudson's one-man game. He played most of the parts. The paper looks like a stunt. Yes, we round up all the Hollywood black people and put them in one movie. Halle Berry even produced it. The only name I didn't see was Oprah, thanks to God, because it would probably be like a Hallmark movie. Instead, this film was not a sentimental mess. It moved, but not fake, the stars came and went, except for his wife Pauline and the writer concerned. The film turned around the babysitter, Mrs Bill Crosby's universe, and how she brought up the writer and took in people. Now that he's exhausted by New Yorker, he said he took sick people and old and then we see that they go to the spiritual institution to get the man. Getting people to jobs and taking Medicare / Caid control But not he explains Lou Gosset he just wants 25 bucks a week and didn't want the money ahead of time. I think this part was put on the film just for New Yorkers, carved for us, so we know he's not scanning poor people. (G) New Yorker wrote that he knows the deal (g). and looking at the little boys' eyes, I see why. She is married if she is good, who is 17 years younger and buggy. Terrence Howard was born to play this kind of parts. He was good, but I would like to see that he is playing something else. Markerson, who plays babysitter, is also very good. But for some reason, I was a person with a small role for Jeffery Wright. Where is Oscar? He already won Emmi and Toni. He was Shaftis and he stole the movie. I didn't even know who he was in this movie. He's a chameleon that is never the same. I've never seen him. It was a 5-minute role and managed to make me laugh and cry. I twisted the scene a couple of times back because I didn't know who it was. His wife Carman Ejogo was great. I've seen him in roles before mostly mousy stuff. But he's so good here. I really know people who act like her. So it was very real for me Macy Gray, who had one of the biggest parts, was also very good. I was very happy that they didn't kill Nanny. I thought he was a goner at the beginning of the movie. IF he was able to go home and start his old routine to take care of people. Such women are in most of our lives. People we know or even lived. Thank God for them, I don't know how they do it all the time. I have a friend who lost two children and was doing a lot of things, but when I feel self-conscious, I invite him and he always puts me in a good mood. This film is a tribute to all these people. I just want them to tell us what happened to some of the characters, such as one armed man, Pauline's boy, played by one of my favorite actors from HBO's Wire, Omar, Rosie Perez and Richard lesbian and Delroy Lindo. Arm man, he was mesmerizing another small role.
