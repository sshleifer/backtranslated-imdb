I saw this movie in Wales in July. It deals with the courage of Czech pilots who flew to several RAF missions after their country was occupied by the Nazis. This film takes place in the early 1950s when these pilots were beaten in a political prison in Czeckoslavakia and during the Second World War in Britain. They were imprisoned after repatriation because the Communist regime saw these warriors as a threat to their occupation in Czeckoslavakia. Pilots retain their dignity in prison and during many air strikes against Nazi pilots. This film contains a subset of love that makes sense because it helps us understand that both civilians and soldiers sacrificed democracy. The end of this film shows that the heroism of these Czech pilots was finally recognized in the early 1990s after the restoration of democracy in a country called Czeckoslavakia. This powerful and moving film was made with financial support from the Czech government. I highly recommend this movie.
