I've heard about this documentary as long as I knew I needed to watch this time. It is very well done in the documentary, as it takes a neutral look at their experiences. There are no voice transmissions or interviews. It's honest. It is true. It's also humble. After the movie, two comments were left with me. One was how it was said that boys wouldn't change like American boys who wear fabric pants, and how time is in Africa, but there is no money, but there is money in America, but no time. The biggest impact was how the boys were hungry for education and how one of the boys was relocated to go to school. I watched this movie with a high school graduate who said he was bothering him to see how the boys brought their new life to America without real orientation. He also said he knew so many American teenagers who simply couldn't understand that their lives were bored in America. I agree with both accounts. A strong film that leaves a lot of people thinking.
