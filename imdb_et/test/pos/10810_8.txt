Danton was the hero of the French Revolution of 1789 and one of the founders. This film was set five years later and the revolution has been rebellious. Although the revolution originally promised freedom, the leading small commission in this country is extremely repressive and dictatorship. Danton and his friends were angry about how the state was better in 1794 than it was before they came out of their king, so they would criticize the government. The film begins as a printer that makes critical government leaflets, beaten and destroyed. So much for "freedom, equality and brotherhood"! So, Danton et al. Because of this silence, publicly criticize the government. Finally, Robespierre (Head of the Commission) and his crowns raised charges, had an exhibition experiment and got rid of dissent. Some have mentioned that Polish director Wajda also saw it as a criticism of his own people, which was then dominated by the Soviets and very repressive. This makes sense when you see the film unfold - especially when the government destroys all the differences on behalf of the "people". <br /> <br /> The actor is good, a story that is convincing and I don't have much criticism of the film. But I really want the end to be different. Especially because the non-historical and French people probably have no idea that this execution helped the government to stop. After cleaning up Danton in April 1794, Robespierre himself was executed in July 1794, because the country was just enough - plus, those who had survived knew that they would also stand in front of the guillotine sooner or later when that sick system survived. . An epilogue would have been nice - for example, to show soldiers coming to Robespierre. He replied trying to kill himself, but he only managed to clean some of his face - still alive, he was guilloche shortly thereafter. It would have been a tiny little epilogue and it could have been done in about five minutes. However, the link between Danton's death and the fall of government is not a strange thing.
