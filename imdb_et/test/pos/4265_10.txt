Sometimes it seems that the mainstream media is run by a number of no-brain journalists. They just listen to each other and report what other reports are doing. <br /> <br /> This documentary shows what can be found when something is done. <br /> <br /> The true press should be to offer people different perspectives on things that happen to give them a fair chance to make their own opinion. <br /> <br /> This documentary, along with major media reports, will help you do this. At least for me, it provided a lot of important information about the purpose / motivation of today's frequent global protests at various political summits.
