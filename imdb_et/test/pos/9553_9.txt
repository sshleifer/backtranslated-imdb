Rented the video slowly on Saturday night. The first look I thought was funny. From time to time to get used to American cartoons (here we are more British grotesque), but very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> I looked at it again the next night and really warmed it up. The characters seemed even more humane - even more loved. The film can look several times and get more every time. But my wife * hated it. I don't think you have a sense of humor.
