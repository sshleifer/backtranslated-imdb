The Punishment Park is a great cinema. Shot in the South <br /> <br /> In the California Desert, using its patented faux documentary style, Watkins <br /> <br /> creates a movie like no other. He monitors two groups of prisoners (one <br /> <br /> previously convicted). After <br /> <br /> they have been tried by the military court, they can choose either <br /> <br /> imprisonment or they can participate in punishment <br /> <br /> Park (a grueling three-day hike through the desert, but not just the back of the clothes <br /> <br />), while local law prevents them from being filled. Live Action Training <br /> <br /> Earth. I can't say enough about this movie. Sometimes it looks like you are watching a real documentary. This is one of Peter Watkins' most accessible movies. I suggest you look at it. You won't regret it! <br /> <br /> Very recommended <br /> <br /> A + <br /> <br />
