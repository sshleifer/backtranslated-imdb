We have the symbol Evie. Evie just wants to be a good person. She is nice, friendly, often smiling, but strangely cruel. Evil also has a secret. His idiot-shining sister has been a lecture on the original poem, which is why the community is excited about writing a nurse. Unfortunately, this is Evie's poetry. When her mother is happy again and the neighbor's boy shows his interest in Evie, Evie just tries to understand what she really wants. <br /> <br /> What to remember while watching this movie Evie is really. To such a brutally honest person who doesn't mind that Ivy-type types say he doesn't respect them, it seems strange that he can pull the lie. If someone is so happy and cheerful, he is quite unknown on certain issues. These are not character flaws, they are a plot of land, and they mean much more than they seem at first. <br /> <br /> For the most part, this is something melodrama: character, personality of other characters to promote them through drama because relationships are in danger. But writing is very fresh and bold. The actor helps to write very well (maybe an idiot-shining sister might have been better) and it's a real pleasure to look. <br /> <br /> Leadership and cinematography are not quite as good. They are acceptable and Evie's world of color and light, which makes some very beautiful images, but it is not very consistent. It is not as small a mistake as a low production value, but the same value is the real storytelling and the actual care of the characters. So while it's not a perfect movie, it's definitely enjoyable. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
