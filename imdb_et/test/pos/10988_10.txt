What a great light of this movie. The timing was great and there were so many smart features - many times I was still laughing after they were handed over. I found Mann from Heaven to have some surprising moments and when I was doing what I was thinking, the way they came together was nothing more than predictable. This film talks about hope and improvements. I left the theater, which was inspired to do the right thing. Bravo to five sisters.
