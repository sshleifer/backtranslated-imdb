In 2023, in a world led by the economic interests of large companies (and not people or politicians), Kam (Bobbie Phillips) is a human hybrid and a representative of the IBI (International Bureau of Investigation). He is called "sub" (sub-human) and his genetic composition is 80% and 20% animal. It has a combination of coin genes that gives it strength and flexibility; a nut that gives it greater vision and listening power; and a chameleon that gives him camouflage power. In the first film, she was a very attractive and immoral woman who used sexual information. I haven't looked at another one yet, but in the third it is full. For fifteen years, a group of scientists has developed a new and dangerous form of energy production. The study has not yet been completed if one of them betrays another and steals the study. The problem is that this molecular instability creates a black hole and sucks the whole planet. He is recorded by Dr. Tess Adkins (Teal Redmann), a team of scientists for survival, and trying to find dangerous inventions from the bad guys. In this gang, there is a very strong subspace that causes a lot of trouble for Kam. This action and the sci-fi television movie is better than the first, recalling some of the parts of the plot "Terminator". Bobbie Phillips is a very beautiful actress and her outfit is very cool. I'm a fan of good entertainment. Fans of Sci-fi movies don't have to be disappointed. Now I'm trying to buy "Chameleon 2". My voice is seven.
