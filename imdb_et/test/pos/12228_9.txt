I found this movie when I drank surfing in one day; and decided to give him a chance. To my surprise, I enjoyed this dark film. I felt some real chemistry between Challen Cates and Malcolm-Jamal Warner. It was such a light and warm film that when I was gone, I felt happy. Of course, this movie was predictable from the beginning, but I give it high marks on how it felt when it was over. I have to admit that I've never seen Challen Cates before, but I feel he can definitely work. When you combine his good actors with his cute face and attractive face. He has at least one to become a known star.
