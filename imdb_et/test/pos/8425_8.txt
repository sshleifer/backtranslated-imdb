Despite the fact that the production has received many bad reviews, it is quite good for its age. Note that this is not a BBC program, but just licensed them to Granada Ventures when the Jane Austen collection was released on DVD. <br /> <br /> So how does this equate to other adjustments to the same novel? The best-known version these days is the 1995 film with Amanda Root like Anne Elliott and Ciaran Hinds as Captain Frederick Wentworth. This film was, of course, shorter, but a good story from the moment - in the earlier version, where Ann Firbank and Bryan Marshall had the same roles, the story was four hours and the story was more peaceful. <br /> <br /> Firbank plays a good role in his role too old, but he is very good - Marshall is great as Wentworth, a man who is disappointed with love and bitter interventions. Most are also hidden by people who also contribute - Michael Culver, later in Cadfael than Harvill; Richard Vernon, later in the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, Admiral Croft; Noel Dyson, formerly Coronation Street, like Mrs Musgrove. One of the criticisms I have is that the hairstyle is a little disturbing and the costumes are terrible! However, this should not be to the detriment of a very pleasant Austen adjustment.
