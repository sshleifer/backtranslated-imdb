This is the resurrection of other genres of the genre: a truly tense, intelligent, brilliant and visual stunning. Yes, the plot may be confusing - but that's partly what makes it pack. Look at it twice when you can. You look at it almost as much as you know the twist when you first look at it. <br /> <br /> Don't miss the fact that this movie comes from Korea, a country that is not familiar with most Western audiences. Although there are elements of the film that are culturally specific, the underlying themes are too universal - guilt, anger, loss, insanity and punishment. All of them are treated perfectly by Lim Su-jeong, like Su-mi, leader. Especially worth mentioning is Yum Jung-ah, who offers bold and horrible events as a stepmother. <br /> <br /> Although it is your frightening moments, it is not really a horror strike, as most people would imagine. This is a more psychological temporary story with a mystery. It grabs you from the start and keeps you up until the end - and perhaps beyond!
