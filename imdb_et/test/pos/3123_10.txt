I don't think there is really a spoiler here, but since I describe a couple of funny scenes, I check that the square says "may contain a spoiler" to be on the safe side. Now ... <br /> <br /> I don't know where to start. By now you know the main tasks of this story - the horse traders Travis (Ben Johnson) and Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) Take the western direction of the Mormon wagon train to their "allowed land" and pass various interesting symbols, especially the illegal Clegg family. <br /> <br /> Everyone can enjoy this movie. You don't have to be a western fan like this. First, Johnson and Carey are the two fastest pleasing characters you see in every movie. Especially Carey is animated and outgoing, almost like a big child, while Johnson is a bit calmer and smarter, sort of like an older brother. I'll get the scene where they sell the sheriff for one of their gentle horses for ten dollars; then tell him that the horse has "some peculiarities - you can say failures". The vision of his face when the horse finally breaks him is invaluable. <br /> <br /> Pay attention to music ... even if you don't think you're a fan of pioneers, listen to "Shadows in the Dust" when the train train movement is shown when some people drive between wagons. It's a really beautiful song - too bad for just half a minute or so it's in the movie. I want to hear the whole thing sometime. <br /> <br /> One thing that impressed me about this film is that much of it must be almost as difficult as the actual situation it represents. Teams of six horses pulling wagons up to steep mountain ranges, tightening to the top - it was not a simple and simple film. It must also be risky for actors, stunts and animals. In films, too, this film has a lot of authentic views that include the train's train movement. It should be mentioned that both Harry Carey Jr and Ben Johnson were extremely competent riders, with so many years of experience, riding, crawling and all kinds of cowboy-type things. Carey grew up on a ranch, where his family worked for many Navaho Indians and actually learned to speak to Nava before learning English. The rhinestone cowboys of this movie "Travis" and "Sandy" were not a real thing through and out. <br /> <br /> See when Denver throws wine from the pan at his wagon, hitting the face of Travis's horse ... the horse begins to hit, finally throws him off. Look at Sandy's face when Denver says to Travis, "I'm sorry you fell off your horse." My second favorite scene is when Harry Carey Jr. (Sandy) gets into a Mormon. They work back to get their gear done and after Sandy is outraged by another man, these two rear parts get hit, which quickly turns into a roll-around-on-the-spot attack. Even after the parent (Ward Bond) stands up and separates them, both fighters try to reach each other. Mormon (called "Jackson") gets one final hit on Sandy so high that it hits his shoulder. It's really a funny scene from start to finish. <br /> <br /> I don't know what else I can say about this movie except that it has a good story, very interesting characters, beautiful landscapes and a lot of humor and a bit of drama balancing. Oh, it's painted, at least in the version I saw; not the most beautiful color film you will ever see, but I think I prefer it to black and white. I'll give it one in ten and I won't give much 10. One of my favorite films, no doubt. Based on other comments, I have many companies in this evaluation.
