This is a movie I return for various reasons. As proof of the suffering of a conventional soldier in the Second World War, it is powerful. The film has a number of very powerful scenes that help to pull the fear of war, such as a tank battle. What's more, what I see from the experience of the film is "true" - when you read A. Beevor's book "Stalingrad", you know what I mean. The film is also successful in the sense that it does not allow this character or plot to dominate - it is just a story of survival that attempts to portray the battle mainly from the point of view of a normal (German) soldier. I've read somewhere that the original scenario had to be tinted, which wouldn't surprise me at all - if they really tried to show what the battle was like, it would have been almost impossible. However, there are still some moments that are hard to see - it was done before private Ryan, but it may be even harder to catch. Just one cautious word - don't buy a duplicate English version, it's quite terrible and violates the movie - try to get the original (in German) with English subtitles, it's much more powerful. In this case, you may need to buy a DVD region DVD movie as I did.
