This movie shouldn't be funny, but it made me laugh. <br /> <br /> It's not meant to be sad, but my heart felt a lot of vignettes. <br /> <br /> It's not written as an action adventure, but my pulse ran more than once. <br /> <br /> Just like life, this film does not manipulate your emotions and tells you how to feel. It is just and you react. <br /> <br /> If you don't find it funny or sad or moving, I suspect I'll tell you more than a movie. <br /> <br /> It is amazing and refreshing to see the director so heartily that we are all human, and embrace that we are all trapped here by doing this "life" thing again and again as long as we have to. <br /> <br /> Tomorrow is the second day.
