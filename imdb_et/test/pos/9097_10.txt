Just go see this movie. It's about rock and role play, the band comes up with some great songs (Classico, Pick of Destiny, Master Exploder, etc.). All this is with Teancous D humor, which makes it the best movie. <br /> <br /> Cameos is great on the back, meat Loaf and Dio sing to JB. Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins are great, I like the character of Tim Robbins. You can also find out who is Satan! Music and music references are fun and Awesome. Playin Songs Great songs The Who, Dio and others just stop it. Personally, I didn't think the band could write a top-notch D-song, but they made songs like Classico and Master Exploder. Seriously awesome music. <br /> <br /> Just go see it must be for everyone who loves rock!
