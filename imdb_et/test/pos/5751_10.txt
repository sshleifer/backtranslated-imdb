I can't even imagine why everyone hates this movie so much. It literally cried a lot of times to me with laughter ("I believe you slept well?" "Actually, we had a bit of a tough night." "Ah, the dangers of adultery."). <br /> <br /> Indeed, the end is a bit flat, but still has some moments (the booger ball's obvious fake that flew into the ocean, the "beach house paradiso"). <br /> <br /> Personally, I think it's the most fun movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 10/10
