I saw Marigold in a preview that showed a few days ago and found it to be a very appealing and enjoyable movie. The film speaks of a not-so-successful American actor who goes to India to act in a movie with a low budget, but found himself there when he finds that film funding has disappeared with producers and investors. A possible meeting with a movie near India strikes him for the role of a small dancer. Since Indian films contain a significant amount of singing and dancing, this is a problem for Marigold, with two left feet, not to mention a person who is so tight and complicated that he can't hear music, not to mention that he knows it, like the choreographer Prem , advises her. <br /> <br /> But "prem" - a word, not a human - means "love" and Prem - a person, not a word - it seems to embody that emotion as it deals with it, be it its production professor friends who introduced the spit to shoot, the narcissistic and arrogant leaders of the movie, or their own fucking and surprising girlfriend. Soon Marigold will find his feet under his professional guidance and love - literally and figuratively. <br /> <br /> I have to say a word to those who don't know how to use song and dance in Indian movies. Unlike the American musicals, this story moves through these dance numbers, as the development of the plots develops and changes in character occur in parallel with the dance. It should also be noted that Indian dance is much more than mere movement. An important part of this is the introduction of the dancer's feelings and emotions when talking about the dance story. This is the main goal of dance and dancer. <br /> <br /> The merigold reaches the stage of achievement shown by the stunning dance number about one and a half times the calendula, the dance he has to make in the film's in-film, also expresses his love for Premi. This is an amazing presentation from Ali Larter, especially when you think she's not used to dancing in her movies and not feeling her character through dance. It shows your skill as an actor, as well as how much work he put into his role. <br /> <br /> Of course, a romantic movie cannot work without a reliable Prince Charming. Salman Khan, who performs the role of Premi, fits T.. Even if it turns out that he is a prince who is not so charming, he will not lose the audience's compassion. Salman has been in Hindi cinema (sometimes referred to as Bollywood) for years, and it's worth remembering that Prem was also the premier leader. He's totally charming, sweet, divine, sexy and vulnerable. For those who haven't seen her before, she's ready to be hit when the mega doses are very magnetic! He and Ali Larter make beautiful couples and fit well with their looks. <br /> <br /> Do they manage to develop their own problems? It doesn't seem possible to hear the last song of the movie, a lovely mix of facts and fantasy, reality and metaphor. Finally, there was definitely some audience I saw as a surprise, but they were happy. The songs are used very cleverly. They are in Hindi, without subtitles, movie-in-movie sequences and in English in other cases. But their meaning is always clear from context and choreography. <br /> <br /> Merigold is a very satisfying romantic comedy - yes, there's also a lot of humor. Indian places and costumes give her a fairy tale that fits a story that can be compared to a modern fairy tale. <br /> <br /> If you are or have been curious about Indian cinema, but you have tried it This is a great introduction. It captures the color and vitality of Indian films not only in costumes and jewelery (which is quite impressive), but also in live dances and world music. <br /> <br /> If you are Ali's fan Larter, you should look at it as an excellent actor, depicting a selfish, demanding, "high-level" woman who still has an inner attraction that inspires the love of two men. If you are a girl, you will enjoy Ali's wonderful costumes and a gentle man. If you are a man, you can not only admire Ali in your sexy costumes, but learn from Salman Khan, who needs to bring out a loving heart even from someone like a sickle.
