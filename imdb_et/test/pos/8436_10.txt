This movie is definitely Fonda's best film. Plot is amazing, the actor is amazing and the management is amazing. All the time classic, it should have won the best picture, not kramer Vs. Kramer. Although not even nominated. Jack Lemmon and Micheal Douglas are also the best. One of the best ends ever. If you haven't seen this movie, don't rent it. It should have been afi top 100. Look at it not just for Fonda, but for everything. <br /> <br /> **** out of 4 out of 4
