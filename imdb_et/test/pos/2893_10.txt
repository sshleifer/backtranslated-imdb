"Rush in Rio" is undoubtedly one of the most exciting DVDs I've bought. Although I am almost a 20-year-old biased fan, I found this performance to be flawless. The music is heavy and sharp (which sounds on all spatial sound systems), the band is energetic, the crowd has a constant smile ... it's like they took all the concerts I've had. For a rush fan this is a black DVD; if anything, just see the documentary "Boys in Brazil" (which shows this rather isolated, personal band ride). For any non-Rush fan, this DVD is an enjoyable concert. Rush fans know their three Canadian talents. We have stood firm for them for years. I've shown this DVD (or parts of it) to those who have never heard of Rush, or to those who think Rush is less than good, because they don't turn to pessimistic rocks (ie sex, drugs) and drunk frenzy). The bottom line is that this DVD is worth every penny and more than worth watching it.
