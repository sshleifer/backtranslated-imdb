I went to watch this movie where my guy wasn't in the movies. But he enjoyed it. I missed the pieces and pieces of the movie all the time. This is the story of Edward Norton and the team who steals gold and Norton decides he wants it all. Then the people he betrayed will be restored. This is a well-assembled, intelligent, funny and action-packed movie that I have to see again ... all the way. One of my best summer movies. <br /> <br /> The great entertainment factor is Seth Green. I don't know anyone who doesn't like Seth Green, and he adds flavor. He plays a man who says he has created Napster, and in his room he stole it. He's a computer genious who's a miracle to look at. <br /> <br /> It was said that Norton didn't want to make this movie. But if I were her, I'd have wanted to sign up. br /> <br /> The only problem is that it is very predictable. The movement of every movie should be able to tell in its mind what happens before it happens. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint with the film is Eddie Norton's choice of hair. Thick but thin mustache and a little pike on his chin ... looks like an 80's porn star for gods.
