This is not a big movie because it is cast (especially for children) who reverently contribute to its very sad and well-established plot. Poor family in the mid-50s in America, a dying mother, an alcoholic father, 10 children (1 of them being epilepsy) and a terrible decision. Its very easy to watch and some kids' performances move without sick or naff. And little Frank and Warrne are stealing my last show, leaving me a lot of attention when I see it. A great rainy afternoon movie that I recommend to everyone. Only those with the hardest hearts cannot move it. Not with Sophies Choice, but with a good TV movie !!!
