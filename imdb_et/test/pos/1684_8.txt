For many years, there are some films that just slip and hardly anyone watches. <br /> <br /> Choose one of Conner's films. <br /> <br /> This little pearl that was played at a festival and had a short 2-week tour of a small theater in West Hollywood, doing all about $ This is now on DVD, which I hope many others will do now. see. <br /> <br /> This is a strange youthful politician who affects a very bright 15-year-old boy. This politician is also a beautiful nephew (about 17 years old) who interacts with a 15-year-old boy. <br /> <br /> The above point is a little vague about what happens, SO is a movie, I appreciate it, we don't get all the facts, much remains in our own thinking. You will hear a dialogue that makes it logical. <br /> <br /> Steven Weber (Wings) is our politician, his role is somewhat vague, this is another point that the audience has to ponder <br /> <br /> Alex D.Linz is our 15-year-old , he was about 17 years old when they made this movie, but they can easily get younger. She has been in films and television with young children. He is a very good actor and is quite convincing. <br /> <br /> Escher Holloway is a senior teen, this role is his first big part and he is also great. <br /> <br /> Now I save the last, writer / director, best, <br /> <br /> Luke Eberl is not yet 23 years old. The first effort is a big thumb. I hope that both her and our two boys have a long career. <br /> <br /> Ratings: *** (4) 86 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)
