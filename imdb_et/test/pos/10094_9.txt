For most of us, life is a love process. But others like Soo-mi are dominated by darkness and fear. The story of the Korean people, based on Jangha and Hongryun, is the genomic gothic horror story of Kim Ji-won around two sons, Lim Su-jeong and Soo-yon (Mun Geon-yeong). is part of a dysfunctional family living in a creepy Victorian mansion. The alienation of the world felt against each other in order to survive with the older Sooms, protecting the younger Souls from danger. In the case of Finland, this does not mean that the circumstances of his mother's death would mean mental illness and a contradiction in reality. <br /> <br /> While we may recognize staples such as haunting houses that have a clear meaning, doors that open and close by themselves, cruel and overwhelming strangers, and other very strange events, the story of two sisters excellently explores deeper psychological meanings, including the inability to get rid of internal demons and false desires for revenge. Soo-mi says, "Do you know what's really scary? You want to forget something. Fully wipe it out of your mind. But you never get a ghost." There's a timeline, but the viewer can leave it open. The plot cannot be summed up, but recommended and the film keeps us wondering whether the screen is objective or subjective. <br /> <br /> When you open a movie, Soo-mi is probably a disturbed young woman. in a place surveyed by a doctor that looks like a spiritual institution. When the doctor asks him to describe what happened "that day", the film flashes back when Soo-mi and Soo-Yeon return to their father's Moo-hyone (Kim Kap-su) and stepmother Eun-yo (Yum) home. Jung-ah). The stepmother is hostile and outrageous, and the father is passive and distant, but it is obvious that it is Soo-mi who really suffers. When girls try to correct them, they are constantly intimidated by the presence of the house, which may be nightmares or supernatural events. <br /> <br /> Soo-mi sees a figure at the foot of his bed that pulls over his black blood and oozes, a dinner where the visitor probably sees a ghost hidden under the spirit and goes into cramps, a monster appears between one sister's feet, people mysterious disappear from photographs and many other manic schizophrenic devices to keep the viewer crazy. While we feel that much of the story is a projection of someone's mind, we do not know who and the film keeps us constantly challenged, at least until the second half of the movie offers an important hint. <br /> <br /> Stylish twilight in light cinematography, the story of two sisters is a unique elegance and other beauty that transcends all fears and has many. It's haunted in more than one word, and its images can look back at you when you least expect or want them. Though the film may not offer a lot of light to tired travelers, it shows where we can reach the dark. In the words of the wise observers: "It is never the answer to blame - whether it accuses itself or others. Rather, the answer lies in judging - both yourself and others. Forgiveness and understanding are great healing powers."
