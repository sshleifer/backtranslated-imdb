These critics have to find a new job !!! This film is based on TRUE STORY, which has made history. It illustrates beautifully how even the love of war and tragedy can conquer everyone. The breathtaking Chephallonia of Greece has captured my heart and soul as I was there. Blue-eyed cage and pleasant Cruz were amazing! Together, they perfectly represented how the Mediterranean couple can only come closer during the war. This film is about your heart, like it is in the mine you need to see !!
