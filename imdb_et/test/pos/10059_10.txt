Why do they all feel they have to put down this movie continuously? It's cute and funny (exactly what it should be). Madonna wasn't about to prove herself an Oscar expensive artist with this movie! He did exactly what he wanted, and he did it well. I loved her in this movie; this is my second favorite Madonna movie after Evita. Music is also great. It's not better or worse than any of the 80's cheeses. For all critics, don't take it so seriously and you can watch it. Madonna is a goddess !!!
