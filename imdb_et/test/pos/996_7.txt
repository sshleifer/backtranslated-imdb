Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, who apologized for his active service, contributes to the war struggles that produce some prose in a propaganda company in Whitehill. <br /> <br /> Thomas has been depicted as a freelancer who believes in free love for a woman who has an equally demanding artistic streak and like unreal romance. Thomas writes and writes his poetry in a systematic domestic chaos, somewhat indefinitely, resting somewhat uncomfortably on his social ties and pulling the rank of war veteran who had laid down his house and who was married to the woman with whom he was the true story of the film, the love of two women, one ( Keira Knightley, whose first love was Thomas (Matthew Rhys), the second (Sienna Miller), Thomas's wife. Sometimes it resembles a singing detective, like a very good television, where tiny blind uprisings were placed on the absurd scenes of a surreal camp.
