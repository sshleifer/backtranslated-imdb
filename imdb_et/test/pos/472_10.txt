I'm filmmakers nightmare ... especially mega bits, multiple varieties. Although I'm not a student of art, I still have a high threshold for stopping unbelief and buying a filmmaker's vision when I find it. That's why such a gem like "You're Alone" is such an inspiring finding. Intimacy and stimulation pulled me in and never let me go. Jessica Bohl and Richard Brundage give a thoughtful nuance to the performance, and director Gorman Bechard demonstrates a regrettable hand to present a clearly disturbing day in the lives of two terribly damaged people. </p> <p> /> I bought a DVD version and shared it with several people. The reactions have varied, from the disbelief in the ability of Daphne to perform the task for which Buddy has paid him for not watching the whole film, because it was just too real and emotionally devastating. As a forced skeptic, I have to grab my collars and drive or ride to the filmmaker. This film took a later route for me and eventually I was so involved that I felt the Daphne's horror and pain in his role in killing Buddy. My reaction to this film reminded me that Peter Greenaway has been watching "Cook, thief, his wife and lover" for many years. Finally, I was fascinated and disgusted and could not tear my eyes away from this film. I've been watching this movie many times and I really appreciate the eye and ear that the director has shown. I am familiar with the other work he has done, including a couple of funny films, the "Galactic Gigolo" and "Killer Bimbos Attack", and the mixed pack "The Kiss", which was recently killed in the cradle by the manufacturer. does not really represent the vision of directors. Too bad because I loved the previous two movies and even found "The Kiss" interesting, but I want "Kiss" to be available for the director's entire original vision and music. I look forward to further work on this interesting director and Jessica Bohl and Richard Brundage.
