For those who have enjoyed Asterix's books and movies, you love this movie! Yes, I admit that it interferes with some books and movies, but the characters are brilliant and not just CGI left, right and center. I've seen it several times and laughed at my socks. <br /> <br /> Of course, this includes the main heroes of Asterix (Astérix), Obelix (Obélix), and Dogmatix (Idéfix), but this time they are new ... deal. <br /> <br /> With such a sense of humor, the Gauls continue on and on. Blessing.
