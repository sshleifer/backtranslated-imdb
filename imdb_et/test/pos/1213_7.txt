Wrestlemania 6 is a fun Wrestlemania, if not entirely successful. The final challenge is, of course, only worth the price of the entrance, but again, as with many early Mania, there is sometimes too much filler. The crowd jumps almost everything and always, giving us a reliable Gorilla & Body body. Having a Face vs Face game as Wrestlemania's main event, it was completely unheard of at that time, it only made things much more tense. <br /> <br /> Matches. <br /> <br /> Size B. Ware / W Frankie Vs "Model" by Rick Martel. In a 3-minute game it's as good as it gets. I wish it was longer, but what I got was pretty good. Martel wins with Boston Crab. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF Team Championships. Demolition Vs Colossal Connection | C | / W Bobby Heean. BACK TERMINATION. The game itself is quite boring, I often had problems. Andre really didn't do much, so in some ways it was more like 2. Here's a solid talent, and it's a shame that they couldn't do better. Demolition wins the title where Pattened Maneuver is there. Crowd blows to cover the roof. <br /> <br /> 1 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Earthquake / W Jimmy Hart. Vs Hercules I got what I was waiting for here, the usual boring filler where the earthquake does. I'm not really a fan of either, so it didn't worsen my interest. Quake wins with a sitting splash. <br /> <br /> Brute Beefcake Vs Mr.Pefect / W Genius. Dead for Pop Brut. Really a good match, unfortunately there is not enough time to develop. It really keeps my interests and one of my favorites on the map. Beefcake wins a post that has been approved by the crowd. <br /> <br /> Roddy Piper Vs Bad News Brown. Piper has a huge pop. Nothing more than boring beating that doesn't know what he wants to be. Some entertainment tips from The Hot Rod, but nothing else. It is remarkable that Roddy's painting himself is semi-black and called himself "Hot Scott". <br /> <br /> Hart Foundation Vs Bolsheviks. Save the breaking, but nothing else here. Harts wins, The Hart Attack. Barbara / W Bobby Heenan. Vs Tito Santana. Average over the time it is, but still traceable. The people were quite dead for that, except for Henan's intervention. Jessie's fun cracks for Tito's food are more fun, then the game itself. Barbarian wins the seemingly seemingly flying laundry line. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Mixed label match. Dusty & Sapphire / W Elizabeth. Vs Macho King and Sherri. I can add a big pop to Dusty and even more to Elizabeth, who looks absolutely stunning. I thought it was OK. It was at least lively, if not so great. I'm not a Dusty fan. Dusty and Sapphire win when he rolls Sherri. <br /> <br /> Orient Express / W Fuji. Vs Rockers. The people are quite anemic for it. Certainly there is no doubt, but with their associates it should have been better. Continuous focus with Fuji reduces gameplay. Exclusive win wins when Janetty is nailed with salt. <br /> <br /> Jim Duggan Vs Dino Bravo / W Earthquake & Jimmy Hart. Duggan like an idiot brings out the flag of Canada. This is also for Duggan, but it may be due to the Bravo Canadian heritage. Crappy game around, I don't care about Duggan, but it's not the reason he sucks. After all, too short to really matter. Duggan wins when he folds up Bravot. Duggan gets into his worries. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Million Dollar Championships. Ted Dibiase | C | / W Virgil. Vs Jake Robers / W Damien. Some slow places, but when everything was said and done, I had a good time. Two strong wrestlers, who give it all, took a fun game. Crowd gets noticeably during Ancy's parts, making a wave. Dibiase wins the Census. Jake has the last laugh, giving away his money, a lot of crowd joy. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> Big Bossman Vs Akeem / W Slick. Nice Bossmani pop. Ultimately, it's too routine and too short to actually say something. The scheme was a trick, I was never too fond of. Bossman wins his slut. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The rhythm and blues segment was pretty much a failure. The crowd didn't get in. Rick Rude / W Bobby Heenan. Vs Jimmy Snuka. It wasn't too bad for the main event before the main event. If you had more time, it would have been great. Rude wins with Rude Awakening. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Title Title. Ultimate Warrior | IC Champ | Vs Hulk Hogan | WWF Champ | It's all about a crowd's atmosphere and a split crowd reaction. The Warrior got a pretty good pop, but I think it was a little sneaky. Hogan fully wraps it together. This is one of Wrestlemania's best encounters in history. With two people who do not know the wrestling there, they managed to create an amazing game of age. I have seen it many times and my level of respect is increasing for everyone's efforts, given that I am not a fan of either. Even deadly fanatics who crave with pure wrestling can't bother about that. Warrior wins with his splash. <br /> <br /> 5/5 <br /> <br /> The bottom line. Wrestlemania 6 is an entertaining entry if nothing is too special. It is memorable for the main event, location and crowd, but it is not one of the best when you ask me. By saying this, I enjoy it, and I give it a recommendation to the co-workers. <br /> <br /> 7/10
