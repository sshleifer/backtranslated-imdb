The odd beam of light penetrates into the bedroom of Dr. Craig Burton (Arnold Vosloo) and his wife Sherry (Jillian McWhirter) when they love it. Approximately two hours are not taken into account as they seem to be undamaged. During a hypnosis session with a psychiatrist, Dr. Susan Lamarche (Lindsay Crouse), Craig discovers that his wife was impregnated with foreigners. Sherry is not so absurd with this idea that she is sending news to her husband that she is really pregnant. Extreme after they have tried to get pregnant, Sherry is frightened by Craig's survival for a fetus who is not her ... it is due to her low sperm count, which is particularly high so she could not in any way impregnate her wife. The frightening, worrying experience of the fetus inside her leads to some frightening discoveries by Sherry. Doctor David Wetherly (Wilford Brimley) finds that ultra-sound gives some unusual results to a developing infant, but it is Craig who says it is alien! Sparks light up electrical devices, even closing the Wetherly pacemaker! Hypnosis reveals Sherry's robbery experience, but Lamarche believes his problem is psychological rather than physiological. If no one believes in the theory of impregnating an alien's wife, Craig will turn to a sociologist Dr Bert Clavell (Brad Dourif) whose job is to investigate alien life and robbery. But Bert does not want to help Craig, who goes to the ends of the earth to save his wife's life from possible harm. The tragic results appear as Lamarche and others are trying to make Craig his "cut off things", believing he is crazy. Craig continues to do his job of trying to drag Bert with him. <br /> <br /> Tough, absorbing the horror that one man's struggle to save his spouse from being harmed by creatures is no one else. Fortunately, Dourif's character is not a smart one, but a smart doctor who wants to know more, but his pursuit of the truth of aliens is not hostile .. he hopes to learn from Sherry, but this is not a very demanding goal in this regard. The story is realistic ... it's easy to see why others could read Craig out of their rocker. Voslo does not take this sign too far, but expresses his current situation. How can he save his wife from this hostile and prove to others that he is not nuts? McWhirter deserves praise for the demands of heavy robbery scenes where his unfortunate character is naked with the table that these things blame and break. Crouse is fined in his limited but important role as a voice in a situation where his clients seem psychologically uncontrollable. Monster effects are icky and effective. I think the film works quite well and director Yuzna deserves credit for at least the film. For the last twenty minutes, when Craig tries to do her "removal action" for fear of Bert, looking at the mad situation, there is nail biting. <br /> <br /> You know that "Fire in the Sky" fans can slip it out.
