Before you see the hidden preview of Angels & Demons today, I looked at my thoughts on all the uncertainties that may hold me back to enjoy it; the enormous hatred against Dan Brown, the fact that it was written by Dan Brown, and because Dan Brown's name is on all posters. I went open and waited even worse, but instead of what I got, there were 2 and a half hours of Rome's cat and mouse game Forrest Gump, and that means good entertainment at all. <br /> <br /> The film hangs loosely on the real novel. The Harvard symbol, Robert Langdon (Hanks), exits Rome after the Pope's sudden death and re-election through the Pope's Conclave. It's organized by Carmelengo, Patrick McKenna (McGregor). At the same time, he will soon learn about a new threat involving a secret fraternity that makes his presence known, an anti-matter time bomb that the Vatican City is now targeting and the kidnapping of four cardinals. Langdon, using his intellect (and trust me, you hear a lot), is given the task of finding and saving them using the mysterious path of light. In his quest, CERN's researcher is Vittoria Vetra (Zurer), who is also a co-author of anti-matter. <br /> <br /> The film itself works at an uneven pace. One minute Langdon and the Swiss guard will speed up the recording of a branded cardinal. The next minute he will carry you with useless information about every random object he passes, probably slowing down the many expected activities / thrillers of the book. This makes it interesting to read on paper, but it may go on the screen. <br /> <br /> Characters are properly written on a large screen. Ewan McGregor makes convincing results as quiet, but aware Patrick McKenna, famous accent. Tom Hanks is somewhat more flexible, intellectually and physically, since the last performance in the middle Da Vinci code. Stellen Skarsgard plays Commander Richter, a straightforward member of the Swiss Guard. Unfortunately, neither her nor Ayelet Zurer's results are worthy or played. But angels and demons will achieve what DVC never received; an exciting fast paced movie full of satisfied explosions, beautiful St. Peter's Square and Basilica (including many churches) and a midnight pulsating bomb. Ron Howard is doing a decent job of managing this second Langdon adventure, this time taking a lot of criticism and almost completely changing the boring dialogue for tense (almost) breaks. <br /> <br /> Although newcomers may call it "national treasure 3" that is much more risky, there is still enough contagion to stop / thrill eye candy and brilliant shots in Rome to breathe. may have drastic changes to the film, but considering the size of blasphemy and its inaccuracy, A & D makes it extremely good to keep the viewer locked on the screen at that time, not on a sleepy shoulder. <br /> <br /> Customizing a good book-movie that both complains and entertains. <br /> <br /> 7.4 / 10
