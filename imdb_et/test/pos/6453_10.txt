I thought I was witnessing any crime that the crime / gangster was offering, but the Garrett-Marcin-Hammetti combination brings real excitement and surprises here thanks to the inventive, powerful Mamoulian direction. plus exceptionally sharp movie editing and flawless special effects. Brilliant also works. Coop gives his most convincing performances as a retentive hayseed-reverse-fearless bootlegger (a kind of character advancement he had to repeat in other roles like Sergeant York). Miss Sidney (Picture Center), in her first important role, is also an eye opener. Reeners get great support from Paul Lukas, Wynne Gibson, and Stanley Fields, as even Robert Homans' hard nail detector. The film has obviously been realized on a large budget, which is perfectly realized in realistic crowds.
