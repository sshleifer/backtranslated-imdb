This film easily displaces the "12 Angry Men" emotional power, dramatic impact and top performances. I rented it with a whim and was surprised that I had never heard of it before. <br /> <br /> I don't know if it was the debut of the director of Emilio Estevez, but the fact that symbolism, synergy, and character development are some of the clever features of the camera that Estevez is playing all point to a natural eye. <br /> <br /> The combination of Martin and Emilio is the same wonderful chemistry we saw in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie. Kathy Bates is a wonderful despair and esapism in her characters; variation of his characters in the "fields of the Lord". She is irritating and at the same time she can feel empathy. <br /> <br /> There are some moments where I feel the plot slows down and the moments between Estevez and her former girlfriend almost seem to have been written for another movie, Estevez comes like a second character all together. But these are small complaints. <br /> <br /> This movie must be based on a real stage or written by someone who lived on that experience. I appreciate it for 8 of the complicated 10. <br /> <br />
