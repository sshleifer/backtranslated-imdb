This movie would be especially fun for anyone who has been in the film industry, especially in any capacity. Those whose legacy includes a film introduction may not appreciate that much. I have a hard time in the documentary category. This doctor is different - its joy comes from the ground-level realism of indie filmmakers who is a hoot to be around and watch. Have you ever thought about what is in the movies, in front of or behind the camera, or whether you have worked your way through the sometimes painful and difficult but rewarding indie worlds, you can definitely get out of this movie.
