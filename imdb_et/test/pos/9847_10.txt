This is the best movie I've seen. All artists are old Turkish theater artists, they are great in this film. The director is also competent, you don't see many moving cameras, but camera positions are also good. But after the action, the most prominent part of the film is the content. It gives happiness, enthusiasm, desire to live, the importance of true friends to people. We all started to live individually nowadays, in this movie you see someone else is there. And most importantly, you see that the world's most respectable feeling is love, loving your friends, loving your precious. All people should see this movie ...
