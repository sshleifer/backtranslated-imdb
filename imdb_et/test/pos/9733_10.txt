First, I hate Sci Fi Stuff, and while this movie got a little Sci Fi at times, it's completely because at least it's focused on Andre Toulon. In the last 3, Andre's example was mentioned, but the stories never focused on him, which made me crazy. What makes me crazy is that it is in the 0 vote scheme. Give it to the people. If you saw this movie and liked it, then vote for it. Please. What I loved about this movie is that he went back to where it all started. When Andre first learned the mystery of life. I would recommend renting it if you've seen a Puppy Training movie before and liked it. But not to rent it when it is your first time looking at this PM collection, mainly because you think all the pups are like "boring".
