It was the first film I saw in my life in 1974 or 1975. I was then four years old and saw it in the theater theater. I didn't realize it was a historic class (I went to sleep for about 20 minutes). After seeing it on television - with two other favorite Car Wash films (my favorite movie) and The Wiz, which seemed to be around 40, 50, 75 times each year, I knew it was a movie I would have one of my favorites. These three films were the only living activities that show that I could watch as a child. <br /> <br /> I would not think it would be a blaxploitation film, but rather a film of city interest. Cochise and Preach reminded me of my uncle, especially the Wild Irish Rose, that they drank. My mother also told me about some of the quarter parties she attended and that some of the things in the movie were similar in nature. If you are one of two or three black people over thirty who haven't seen the movie yet, I suggest you buy a DVD right now. I'm glad I was about to witness this era.
