Marin was the most underrated film of the decade. Despite the efforts at home, it is still considered a bad film. I say hell to everyone with it. Not everyone understands that this is partly comedy, with a dramatic twist at the end. Danny Aiello plays the burnt director perfectly and gives a sad depressed person. The scene when he tries to record the last message is pretty good. Stones movie interludes are completely funny. "It's Harry Stone and today I'm a man!" The whole fine and unfortunately misunderstood movie. Plus big Richard Richard. Fun! I hope more people see this movie because 202 people are not enough to get a consensus. <br /> <br /> -Silence Dogood
