The American film is a great documentary. It follows the challenges and tribulations of a very solid independent filmmaker when he is fighting for his first film. <br /> <br /> The raw and understandable content of this movie is a great example of how to create documentaries. I also feel that the film can be very inspiring for those who want to be filmmakers themselves.
