My architect is a great film about Nathaniel Kahn's own quest through the legacy of his famous architect Louis Kahn, who has died since 1974. The film builds slowly but completely, and begins with a seemingly lost fortysomething identity crisis with a beautiful story that has a much deeper meaning about love, loss, family, and perhaps more importantly, the importance of our life's work. <br /> <br /> I had never heard of Louis Kahn before this movie, although I was vaguely familiar with some of his work. Through the words of Louis Kahn's colleagues (both good and bad) you get a very good idea of ​​what Nathaniel was supposed to know when memories were remembered and stories returned. Sometimes it seemed like these people would tell Nathaniel how to feel about their father. Listening to each memory, my own opinion would extend from that person to the beautiful scary, sometimes momentary, so you know for Rollercoaster that Nathaniel's emotions have to be driven. <br /> <br /> The latest in Bangladesh made me a movie. Sincerely, what the people of Bangladesh talked about Louis Kahn's work, all of the loose ends were nicely and hopefully linked to me by Nathaniel. <br /> <br /> I think Nathaniel Kahn finally found what he was looking for.
