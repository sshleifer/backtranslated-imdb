This is a little budget staging motion from the Brother (Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell) Piper ... and this is just what I would expect from such a product: an enthusiastic (though cheese) dialogue, some cute actors and lots of stop-motion critteries. That's why I've given the movie out of 10 out of 10 - because it gives you what I expected it to do ... and a little more: Brett doesn't see his critter on display. He casts a lot of finals in his captivity. And still, I love the monsters of the stop movement, which, compared to the CGI feeders of the bigger budget movies, just seem to be a great fun to watch.
