I like Linda Blair playing again in the real "horror" movie. I was disappointed with most of everything from "exorbitant" movies (which I loved). What was all these nasty "B-movies" about what he did? <br /> <br /> David Hassellhoff, on the other hand, all I could do is laugh. She's not cut out as a horror actor. David must stay with "Knight Rider" or "Baywatch". <br /> <br /> All this is a fantastic movie. Even in the eighties it was a fantastic movie. He has horror, action and drama. It's tense and loved how Linda Blair turned out.
