When I was a kid, I remembered this exhibition, but I thought it might be a bit outdated now as an adult. Well yes, it's just for me that makes the show more retro (and music very funky). <br /> <br /> This exhibition is mostly well written. I think it's travesty that this show was canceled after one season, especially when this show was more popular than the Incredible Hulk. I think fans should forget the bad special effects and enjoy the stories. This next sentence contains a spoiler: my favorite episode as a child was when there were two spiderman fighters who are fighting each other interestingly, a similar idea made in Spiderman 3. I liked the idea of ​​this TV show, which some hate. I believe Stan Lee was not a fan.
