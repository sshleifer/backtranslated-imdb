Peter Strauss, the essence of a mini-series and television shows, often gets an unfair amount of bad comments - usually from random observers who saw the movie in ten minutes, halfway through the channel. Well, I've just read all the other 20 comments on this movie and I'm glad to see no bad words about Jericho Mile - it should be enough to let this movie buy !! <br /> <br /> Peter Strauss won Emmy for his role in this film and even looked at it once, showing you why he deserved it so much .... <br /> <br /> Trying to be objective, i tried to criticize this movie. Instead, I found myself saying I was any possible. This is the real, realistic film making. It's not your typical Hollywood sensation where everything is superfluous - it's so realistic and viable that people have thought it was based on a real event!
