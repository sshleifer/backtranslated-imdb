I was actually considering investing in this movie when Gorman was in the funding. I loved most of the script but didn't like the end. Gorman demanded that the end be as it should. <br /> <br /> Seeing a complete movie must say I'm surprised. Reading the script, which I have not imagined, would be as powerful (and Gorman's control) as robust and mobile as here. These two leading works were amazed. They were very believable, and it is worth watching this movie only for the performances of these two amazing stars. <br /> <br /> Now, for the spoiler and if you haven't seen the movie, don't read more because you must first see the movie. (I really wish I never read the script so I could have experienced a movie that ended first.) <br /> <br /> ----------------- - ---------- SPOILER <br /> <br /> I have two major problems with the film. First of all, and I'm sure I mentioned that when I read the script, the woman should have died. If he were dead, the end would be much more plausible. As it is, we have the man who has agonized the woman who left her "years ago". If she leaves her and she is still in love, she must be seriously misleading. However, he does not follow the script. (There is also a problem why he didn't spend all this energy for the woman he still loves.) Plus, if the woman was dead, we would actually be able to believe that they have a satisfying, understanding love and therefore I believe the man is devastating enough to make the end reasonable. <br /> <br /> But I don't buy Daphne doing what he does. I need a lot of convincing belief that this naive girl (very hooked to the whore, but credible because of Bohl's performance) did what she did. The character is not just cold enough. And if he did it for some kind of love or something else, then the whole movie / story is missing. <br /> <br /> Much of this movie resembles "Sex, Lies, and Videolint." I think it could have been so popular if Gorman had chosen the end of the film's more faithful. <br /> <br /> So watch the movie, enjoy it. And remember your mind.
