... and I'm so disappointed that I can't buy a DVD or VHS anywhere. <br /> <br /> This is a mix, Uncle Buck and Big Outdoors and Molly Ringwald is fabulous as a spoiled teenager. This was done when Molly was still a brunette, just before she hit Pretty In Pink at a great time. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a good clean family comedy. <br /> <br /> If someone has a copy or you know where I can get one, please leave me a message - it's very welcome.
