I saw this documentary at the 2005 independent Slamdance Film Festival. This documentary is captured, staged and edited by the mother's year-long anti-cancer (Craig). The one-year film "The Closer it Gets", the documentary is in the true form and gives you an internal look at fighting the cancer, the viewer gets the effect of the cancer on the family and on the person throughout the process. I've never seen such an honest movie, it's a powerful and raw film, and because it wasn't captured outside, you get all the real emotions involved. Many documentaries remain outside, but the story the son speaks adds another emotional level to the film, unlike what I've seen on this subject or some other thing before. This is a story that everyone should see and can be related to. I would highly recommend it.
