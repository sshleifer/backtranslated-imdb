This is probably one of the best thrillers I've ever seen. It has action, but not this flight, good guys - bad guys, van damme - stallone action, but fast, realistic and nervous action, he has a plot, the reason till the end of the movie you don't know how it ends, he has characters , queen quinn, donald sutherland and ben kingsley are just perfect and have a relationship, this movie won't let you go before you see it over. <br /> <br /> Although there are only a few characters, it wasn't difficult for me to keep this story close and the story that it is basic (not too cumbersome, but simple and raw) and realistic <br /> <br /> you are a good story, for a movie that does some activities and great things to do, look at it and I promise you won't go away before you see it over. Its the end.
