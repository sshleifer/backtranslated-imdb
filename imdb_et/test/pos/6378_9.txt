I saw you in Devian on Friday evening in Doordarshan and they could hardly believe that such a remarkable film was ever made in Bollywood. Was it mind blowing? movie "modern" storyline, great music, three cute ladies and my fave superstar Dev Anand.In this unusual storyline, Dev falls in love with three women? simple Nanda, scary Kalpana and sophisticated Simi. They are also in love with him and want to marry him. This makes Devi's dilemma (which is the main point of the story) - to marry? He consults a hypnotist who asks the Devil to look at the crystal ball. Dev finds the answer and marries Nanda. Beautifully managed (probably Dev saheb himself and not Amarjeet official director) B & W classics have evergreen music? some of the best compositions of SD Burman (largely assisted by RD Burman). "Uff Knee Thadni Hai Yeh Ruth" is probably the sexiest song ever made in Hindi films. The credit should also be given to Majrooh Sultanpur for his memorable words, which Devian is a windshield music that fits perfectly with Dev Anand's style and he performed this role fairly. Unfortunately, Teen Devian has never received the recognition and popularity it deserves. <br /> <br /> You have to see every Hindi movie buffer, appreciate the eternal favorite from 9.5 out of 10.
