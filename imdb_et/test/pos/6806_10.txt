My daughter already wrote a review of this movie when I signed in, but I want to add a few words. <br /> <br />? National Velvet was one of my two favorite films as a child. (The other is "Oz's Wizard.") Cinematography, actor, script and all the music came together, is such a wonderful little heart that felt drama that it could still tear. Based on Enid Bagnold's book, the script followed the book quite well. The characters are so thoughtful. It's easy to get emotionally connected with the whole family and the peculiar little Irish village where they live. Assuming ... the perfect stranger believes in his horse and enough to try the world's largest horse race ... it's honest inspiring for every young person, especially the 40's young girls ... a time when girls were sometimes ignored because people not to mention the athletes. You should be terribly cooked to not understand it. <br /> <br /> But from the point of view of what I thought was the most expensive for this movie, it has unlimited innocence in its moral message. It's almost magical how the "mother and apple cake" movies were then. The IMDB surveyor who asked ... was really surprised, "was the world ever trusting?" And then the director began to comfort him for his discontent about the "twenty-four-hour travel" with two main characters. My answer to his question is clear YES !!!! The film's ongoing world was the one that trusted the 40s. <br /> <br /> My grandparents remember their mother when she released this movie when it appeared. Then my mother took me to see when I was young, and my daughter was fortunate enough to watch it on the video tape repeatedly. Now it's on DVD. It has been a generation of generations, though a generation of horse lovers. It was never sex ... it's about age! It means faith in yourself and hard work to achieve your goals. Even so old-fashioned was not even a prize money! It's about a girl who realized that she had the best thing on her horse? And yes, the director was really worried about the lack of physical development of Elizabeth Taylor, because the book made a great contribution to Velvet Brown (the character of Liz Taylor) who had to cut her hair and tie her to her chest so she could drive as she went to Grand National Steeplechas. . It was just boys guys ... I guess there have only been 12 women in this race. It is almost offensive that somebody should struggle to think about Lolita's thing about this particular movie ... besides, someone who had anything with a young girl and his horse would know that the only thing they ever think of in their letters is their eyes four fingers and a tail. And now it's a bit tricky ... the riding ride was now with the famous Horse Whisperer Monty Roberts. I believe he has been mentioned for the film's credit. <br /> <br /> I'll give this movie out of 10! I'm not tired of seeing it again.
