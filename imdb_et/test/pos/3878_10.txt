Thanks to this exhibition, I started to cut early why I never understood why I read this story recently. I felt that this exhibition had never received its taxes as one of the biggest exhibitions, this exhibition is by nature iconic and deserves a movie that was always supposed to be, if not with the original A-team that has been given at least a story or story, maybe it is finally commemorated by late colonel Hanibal Smith (Preppard). This cast gave us so much luck that they grow up because they deserve one last heat because the series ended openly because they reduced the series for good reason. This team and the cast made us realize when children are one of the good guys, especially when you see how the world is today, because I think the original lighter version I already read the previews and I know they are not plans, but if something is straight To DVD, I'd definitely buy it. I really can't see how crappy shows I'm getting a series of finals, but this big show, which is still running on a regular basis today and is probably going to look more than today's garbage events, we don't always remember the Incredible Hulk series, Knight Rider, Airwolf, and Team A , because these exhibitions take time, I'm almost positive. The knowledge you see about the detective does not even remember in ten years, so why not bring something back and show people the ability to stay and how these old exhibitions really are.
