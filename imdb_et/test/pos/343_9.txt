Sri Lanka ... not the country I have ever thought I have to admit. I didn't even know it was close to India, not to mention that there was a bloody civil war since 1983. It seems that the Tamil minority rebels are constantly in conflict with the country's military regime for years, causing a lot of death and widespread suffering on the island. <br /> <br /> Mani Ratman's latest film, PEKK KUJU, speaks of a young girl, Amudha, who has been separated from her parents by Sri Lankan war and young Indian couple. Amudha is a bright and playful girl whose life is reversed when her parents tell her that she has been adopted as a child. Although her parents love her as much as possible and have raised their biological children without any prior restriction, Amudha cannot find out more about her biological family. <br /> <br /> Mani Ratman is probably best known for his 1998 film DIL SE, which hides the story of terrorism and politics in the story of love (or is it the opposite?). THE FUTURE SYSTEM resides in the same territory, but perhaps more ambitious in this area. The central theme that binds the film is love between all the family members and especially between the child and his parents. It's a pretty honest and open look at feelings that can sometimes be very touching and warming up from the heart, and quite painful to others. This is an emotionally complex film whose characters are somewhat ideal but still behave in a very human way. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around the 9-year-old Amudha, played by young actor P.S. Turn to your first and only role. She is a princess and a monster, always getting into trouble, but so charming that no one can get her crazy long. The young actor is perfectly cast for this role and works enormously on the various and often difficult emotional scenes she needs. experience intensity. Such a small act has never had such an enormous emotional effect, I dare say. Film is a bold and artistic effort to explore issues that are often not covered on the silver screen. <br /> <br /> Mani Ratman's direction is excellent, very confident and mature - the most complicated work I've seen as a director. The film is very stylish, with some great camera work and pictures. A.R. Rahman offers a film soundtrack that is not as good as his classic DIL SE or BOMBAY music (based on at least the first shows) but still shows great musical talent. <br /> <br /> I am not aware of the DVD edition yet - I saw this in Tamil with English subtitles thanks to the San Francisco International Film Festival, which was undoubtedly highlighted. Production is a truly world-class effort and I am sure that it is popular among Western countries as it will become more widespread. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
