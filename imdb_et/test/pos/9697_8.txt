This movie was fun! From time to time it went too far, but was it what we were expecting from them? The theater worshiped with laughter and ooooooed with incredibly mad tricks. It's rude, raw and sometimes frightening. The whole gang is back and even more of its senses, which in turn provides great entertainment. I don't want to give away anything, but the little extracts of the online clips are nothing more than the following. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie for friends. Try to see it with a large crowd. You don't have to be disappointed. Just don't go to someone who doesn't take it (see above). It doesn't go well, you can be sure. But this is quite obvious. If you liked the first one, then loooo it.
