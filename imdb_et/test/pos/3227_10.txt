Gilmore Girls is the favorite TV of all time. they only provided the first two seasons in India, but I've watched the rest of the DVD or read it online. it is very refreshing to find an exhibition where the main character is not around her mother's back but is open to her. chemistry between Lauren Graham and Alexis Bled, who play Lorelai and her daughter Rory, is really great. all acting are great and the characters, though extremely peculiar, are still believable. Adult adults show all the fun of the small town's life, which is in contrast to the endless snobbies and social norms that make up the high social life of Lorelai's parents. On the one hand, there is a dance-athons and a fire festival, while you have cotillions, DAR meetings and a cocktail party. All the characters are developing a lot and more or less is a happy ending. there are dramatic elements, but also very funny humor. Rory's boyfriends are all incredibly hot as his friend Lane. Basically, this is a cool, funny, very satisfying exhibition that covers all walks of life and gives you the feeling that if you work hard enough and wait patiently, you get what you want, even if it wasn't what you intended.
