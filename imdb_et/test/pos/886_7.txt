After seeing the film in my local mall, where there is a stand for buying alien species, I thought it seemed a lot of fun. Before watching the movie, I went to IMDb to see what ratings and comments he got. I was worried when I noticed a low number and a negative rating. Despite the hypothesis, I watched the film and, surprisingly, found it to be incredible. <br /> <br /> The story was great (just pay attention) and the characters and their relationships in the film are amazing. I haven't seen such a good combination of leading characters for a long time. I really felt both signs and felt a strong bond. If you read previous posts about a movie that wasn't "epic" or the lack of martial arts, I couldn't agree. This movie is what it is, not Braveheart and its not entering the dragon, but it is still a great movie that does a great job that combines both story and action. <br /> <br /> While the sword in the poppy is not perfect (what is the movie?) is still wonderful and moving. Wait until the scene ends with music and cinematography, it's breathtaking. I only hope more people see this movie as a fair vote.
