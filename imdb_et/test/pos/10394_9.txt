I'm not sure what to do about this movie, especially after I saw a big movie like La Notte. Unfortunately, I saw it in the Franconian Film Museum at the Antonion Film Festival so I couldn't hear Malkovich's big voice. He should tie four stories about Italian couples. But as good as an actor as he is, Malkovich cannot save the most ridiculous four stories: a woman who arrives at a cafe near the shop where she killed her father. Then they went home for two, having sex and leaving. Antonion seems to have lost the fertility of earlier films (like the Passenger) when he was having sex and replaced it with blatant nudity. <br /> <br /> But it makes no sense that the film has two things that make it watchable: eye and ear candy. Actresses and actors are all beautiful people, and cinematography is wonderful - scenes in old Italian cities, contrasting with a little high-rise apartment overlooking the city (reminiscent of La Notte). <br /> <br /> But what really changes the way you watch the movie. U2 and Brian Eno collaborated with your blue space and beach queue, both of which set the mood in the film perfectly. Songs available in "Passengers: Original Soundtracks 1."
