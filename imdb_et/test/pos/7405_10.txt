I've never heard of Silverwing before, I saw it on Disney and loved it now! I also think it's not just for kids and people of all ages will enjoy it. It has a large plot, great effect and cool characters. I always love this example and I heard that it will soon arrive on the DVD, and I'll get it! I haven't read any books, but I'm going to do it. The exhibition is worth 10 out of 10 and I hope the books are just as good. That's all I have to say. But I have two more rows to complete, so ... who do you all think is the coolest character? Mine is Shade and my second favorite is Marina.
