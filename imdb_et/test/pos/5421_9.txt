This is a very weird little short film that didn't impress me at first. From an aesthetic point of view, animation is definitely not beautiful here - though after a while you will notice that simple and stupid drawings have some strange charm. This is probably because the script is as complex as it is, the animation works. <br /> <br /> The film shows an older couple sitting on the table while playing Scrabble. At the same time, they are fixed in this game or other formations (as the husband is forced to see things - even a chair and table)! And all this stuff happens when the television warns of the destruction of an ongoing atom - Armageddon is definitely here! Of course, the neighbors scream and run amok - during this time the couple will continue with this idiotic game. Heck, even their cats know that the end is coming when the couple starts teasing about someone who may not have deceived - leading to a truly surreal ending! The film deserves to be worshiped for both their unique and very funny. Although it couldn't win the Oscar, it was called the best animated short - which he earned abundantly.
