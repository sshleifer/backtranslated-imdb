"Hoot" In Logan, Lerman Roy Eberhardt, a new child at school, just moved from Montana. But Florida is much different from Montana. Despite the fact that there is a problem with mixing, Roy finds a bigger problem. A new franchise restaurant arrives in the city, where the families of blooming owls are in trouble. Will a new boy, tomboy (Brie Larson) and escaped (Cody Linley) stop big companies from destroying these owls? <br /> <br /> This movie was pretty good. Children (Logan Lerman, Brie Larson and Cody Linley) are the real stars of this movie. Luke Wilson (Officer Delinko) is okay, but really not a big part. Nor is Robert Wagner (mayor) or Jimmy Buffett (Mr. Ryan). <br /> <br /> However, it was a fun movie that the whole family enjoys. For the first-time producer, I thought Jimmy Buffett was working on quality work. Plus the owls were really cute.
