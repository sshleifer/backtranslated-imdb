I can't help but notice the negative comments this film has received. Frankly, I saw a preview of this movie and the premise seemed interesting to me. Yes, I rented it after reading other comments. They are right because some of them will leave much to be desired. They are also right that one of the best results of this film was Dr Graves. <br /> <br /> Also interesting is Scott Clark, who plays Grant in a wheelchair. I know the character he played, maybe because I'm in a wheelchair. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely worth watching.
