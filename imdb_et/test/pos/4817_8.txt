The world goes by John Frankenheimer. It was her first feature film, and it was four years before she led her, but didn't let her convince her to look. Frankenheimer's direction is certain and he will get some weighty performances out of his pain. <br /> <br /> Someone else has already pointed them out, but I also want to talk about James Gregor and Whit Bissell in two main supporting roles. Both would work again for Frankenheimer - Gregory's most ghost senator in "The Manchurian Candidate" - and they're doing a good job here. <br /> <br /> When the whole thing seems to be too easy at last It's just because Frankenheimer and writer Robert Dozier decided to talk about a simple story and they do it well. Watch it - Turner classic movies can show it again.
