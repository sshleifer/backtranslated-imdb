especially when looking at the amount of crap made on a DVD. I found this movie very funny. Rip Tower is a classic with its barbers; Rob Schneider, as annoyingly annoying as over-compensation; Bruce Dern makes a great "cable". The whole cast seems to be a blast and it's not at the expense of the viewer. If you just like fun comedy and you don't look too deeply, you can just fall in love with it.
