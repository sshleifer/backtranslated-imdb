This man is great. its funny, original and made me laugh so much that I almost sat down. the day I went to watch it in movies where I wasn't in the best moods (man in trouble), but leaving the movie I was plastered on my face. The story is a little where there is no one who does not notice that he looks too much like a girl, but hey, who I say, is plausible, jokes are big and some of these 2006 hits may fall in history. Amanda B. did an excellent job because the main role was and Channing Tatum seems too good to be true as her vice versa as a proud duke. So girls can see it because of her big laughter and there is a hot man and guys u go see it because you can just learn about girls! First of all, there is a brilliant, fantastic and fun movie I buy on a DVD when it comes out.
