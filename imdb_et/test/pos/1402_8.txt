This is a very strange film for Harold Lloyd - at least in relation to the sweet character he played in films from 1920s to 30s. Instead of a nice man, he's with Snib Pollard, who kidnaps all the blind. Particularly successful in the business world, Chester claims he has lost a "very valuable circle" and a little later Harold finds he is looking around. The ring is, of course, cheap and then Harold found it, but the greed of greed is so great, he "convinces" Harold to say something and sell him a "valuable" ring and then run their luck (?). Again and again they find themselves until they meet a woman who is a woman (who works with fakes). He organizes a nice con and takes all the money they stole - and he has a policeman who is sure they will give him money. <br /> <br /> If you were lucky, these two men would stumble. Lady's shady business if no one is at home. Soon the lady will return and interrupt her thoughts - release many dirty tricks to punish her for her evil. <br /> <br /> All this is a strange and natural movie, but it is also extremely funny because the jokes work very well and Lloyd and Pollard are doing an excellent team. Plus, though horrible and strange, I liked to see Pollard dressed like a lady.
