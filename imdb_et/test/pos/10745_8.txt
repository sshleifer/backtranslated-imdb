Postcards are a capricious batch, most of which are not close to the original. Sometimes you find a sequel that is considered better than the original, some critics (such as John Charles) have said that project A2 is better than the original, I do not agree somewhat, but this movie is still useful and fits well with the brilliant Hong Kong cinema and Jackie of the 1980s own creation. I don't know how to release such a great movie that his later films were not so good. In the 1990s, he has directed only two films and never before, but he has influenced many of his films, where he is not an official director. <br /> <br /> Earlier in 1987, Jackie was a brain surgery. The catastrophic fall of filming God's weapons. It encouraged her to work near her next movie at home. It didn't encourage her to end her life and risk her own stunt team for our entertainment. The result is that the home is cracked, which displaces the original ticket offices ($ 31 million compared to $ 19 million original). <br /> <br /> Jackie Chan is again police extraordinaire Dragon Ma and has been ordered to work with the "Three Wan" superintendent Chun (Lam Wai, Royal Warriors), who is the only Chinese police officer with a permitted weapon but thought to be he stops arrests to look better and ignore the crimes of the triad masters called Tiger Au (Michael Lord Chan Wai-Man, Dragon Lord). Apparently Chun has to take too much power off, but he is released from the Sai Wan area (now he is "Two Wan"), which Dragon I take over. This ineffective and corrupt office will soon become a makeover, and there is a big scene where three officials who do not know who they are dealing with try to attack Ma to teach him a lesson about police officers' complaints. Soon he will be the ship of this area and Tiger Au will take care of it. Fighting choreography and tricks Tiger and his men are quite awesome. My favorite stunt was a pretty brutal drop from the second floor to a large vase, and this vase didn't seem soft. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, there are a couple of subplots. There are pirates who have survived from the first movie looking for revenge and food. Then there are revolutionary ones, including Maggie (Maggie Cheung, In The Mood For Love) and (Rosamund Kwan, Casino Raiders) who are trying to raise money for Dr. Sun Yat-senile to overthrow the Qing government and government agencies trying to find these rebels. Throw a corrupt mixture of Hong Kong and British prisoners, as well as lawful ones, and you will be stewed, which will start with a little too many ingredients, but still seem to match. It works well when there is a Marx Brothers influenced scene (Marx Brothers has made this type of scene a few times when The Cocoanuts (1929) is the first) in Maggie's place where everyone is looking for someone to hide from someone. This scene alone took many weeks, and the effort will certainly show. <br /> <br /> There are several mistakes in the movie. There is a certain didactic nature that slips into a film that looks a bit outward? especially one small call to the end that Jackie gives to dealing with the continental revolution and the very simple transformation of surviving pirates from the first movie. Female characters are still underused and underestimated, especially Maggie Cheung. I was not so pleased that the plot was as big as the first film. Individual scenes dominate the knowledge of my film instead of thinking about this film as a whole. I do not blame this film for not being able to be Sammo Hung and Yuen Biaot first (I've heard the main reason these two filmed the East condos, but I don't know if Jackie could have expected a little though they could do it , they would be working for Dragons Forever last year, but they missed it. <br /> <br /> I found this to be quite enjoyable and a good movie and it is rightly considered one of the best comic films of the 1980s. This movie is pretty good in some unexpected places. The artistic direction is excellent (Eddie Ma Poon-chiu), the costumes are fine, the cinema is good and the film looks quite authentic. But the tricks, comedy and action are what I remember about this movie. There's a chase with a handcuffed dragon and a Chun, which is great (some of the scarf scene is used in Shanghai Noon). The last twenty minutes are full of frightening hits, falls, chilli-peppers as a mouth-peel (Jackie writes in his autobiography how he used real peppers in this scene; it ends) and that is a conclusion worthy of this film. The most famous stunt of this sequence is his respect for Buster Keaton from Steamboat Bill Jr. (1928), except that there is no hole and only a weak part where his head jumps through. <br /> <br /> Jackie and / or Hong Kong cinema should have it and watch it. I'm sure I will.
