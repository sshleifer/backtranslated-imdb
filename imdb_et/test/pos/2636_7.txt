At the time of writing (January 25, 2006), I am sad to hear Chris Penn from the last few hours. Other than Footloose, The Wild Life is a movie I remember most about Chris. <br /> <br /> I still remember the movie, with a slight affection, Chris wrestling and teammates sitting in front of their favorite restaurant, a huge French fries that drowned in a whole bottle of ketchup. <br /> <br /> Anyway, my comment is related to the title Bananarama sang. After these years, I still remember the rumors (Canadian spelling - lol) that Bananarama was invited at the very last minute to compose a movie journey and that they wrote a song on a recording studio attached to the song recording studio, and just after they recorded the song, they came your title track for a low price. I heard that the whole process (from start to finish) took 4 hours! If this is true, they are truly worthy to be the most successful female band of all time. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's just a rumor I heard back and later I remember the generation. Perhaps anyone who reads it can comment and explain. Thank you.
