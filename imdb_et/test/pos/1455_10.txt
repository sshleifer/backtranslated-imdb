Frank Sinatra has created so many great things in the entertainment world that are hard to come up with alone. If I had to name the best he'd ever done, his performance would be Frankie Machine, a heroin addicted musician and a poker salesman who just barely saved a good woman's love (exceptionally played by wonderful Kim Novak). The "cold turkey" scenes between Sinatra and Novak are frightening and heartbeats. In fact, the film is almost perfect from Saul Bass's headlines to Elmer Bernstein's groundbreaking jazz score. It may not be something that anyone thinks about in the 1950s, but it is still black.
