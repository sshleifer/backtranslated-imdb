This is probably the most funny thing I've ever seen - from the beginning to the end it was perfect for timing, atmosphere, strokes, background music, combat sequences and all other possible aspects. To be absolutely honest, I find this movie funny as their (Rik & Ade) sitcom "Bottom" - maybe even more funny. I laughed constantly throughout the movie and just want to see this movie ... but if you look at it without knowing (or pleasantly?) That comedy type Rik Mayall and Ade Edmondson have done it before, you may not think it's funny all - But I really don't understand who doesn't like it - it's a human! (People get hit by bumps, boys are running red rubber lingerie, green vests, corridors, boys are eating b ****** s and getting candlesticks - HOW CAN'T BE Funny??) 10/10
