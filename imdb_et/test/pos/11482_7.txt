It is important and fair to remember that at the time of this short birth, there was a state of war between the United States and the Japanese Empire. Add to it the enormous bad will that the beginning of the war began, as well as the Bataan Death March and other incidents, and the only thing that is surprising about these short and others is that they were no longer there. Another thing: my only problem with this short time is that it seems to be trying to be funny, but it is not. I'm not sure if someone who is involved has been trying to do the job or even take care of it. It would have been much better if they had done what Disney's exercise was doing with death and would have been quite serious. But this short can be a bad rap and it should not be evaluated out of context. The times were then different and this is an important consideration. Anyone who spends energy trying to save the world for a sixty-year-old comic must step back. Like me, I consume energy that protects the same comic. It should be available to interested parties, even if it is not widely disseminated. Not a nice comic, but sometimes life isn't great. Recommended
