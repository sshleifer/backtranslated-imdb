Robocop's writer seems to have attacked The Vindicator. This is a very sure horror / action movie about a movie that has been created in an accident and used in cruel trials. Anyone who has seen Robocop knows this story. Take care of Pam Grier, who is a clever and wary assassin. This highly effective, violent and bloody horror film may not be all that pleasing, but it is worth looking for a Canadian outing for everyone who is a fan of the genre. 8/10
