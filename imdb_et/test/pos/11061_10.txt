I saw this movie for the first time when I was in primary school in the 1960s. I was interested in the character played by Ingrid Bergman and that was my introduction to the French Quarter of New Orleans. The first part of the film is best when she returns to the revenge of her father's wife and daughter (the mother was disgraced). During this time, he meets the wonderful Clint Maroon played by Gary Cooper. The chemistry of these two is great. The other side of the film is in Saratoga, NY (with Saratoga) and I never enjoy it as much as the New Orleans setup, but it's still very good. I give this film ten - partly nostalgia, but mostly because it is just a good movie and the characters from Bergman and Cooper are equally wonderful (Flora Robson approaches Bergman's stealing stories). It was shown on television periodically, but it is rarely shown as ever - it would be good for classical film stations to incorporate into their programming cycles.
