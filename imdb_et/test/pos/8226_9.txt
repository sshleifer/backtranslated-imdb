This film, directed by George Fitzmaurice, who made so many great films, is well on its way to an excellent standard. It is crisp, witty, with some great lines and is unmatched by Ronald Colman's romantic lead. Colman plays irresistibly charming and richer English. He is financially irresponsible (for example, spending £ 15 on his last £ 20 in the world of a cute little terrier whom he calls George), but open, wildly generous, spooky, despicable at a political opportunity and hopelessly sentimental. She is so embarrassed that all women fall in love with her. His girlfriend is the star of the music hall and thus the demi-monde of 1930, who played with his younger Myrna Loy with a brilliant, narrow eye. Fitzmaurice was not a very close user, and on the gals of that day, the face of such terrible clinging hats was half-hidden, so we didn't look so good on the face of two heroes as we would like. The director still seems interesting from the charming Colman. The romantic female leader is the youthful and fresh-looking Loretta Young, who had not yet become Julie Andrews's prototype, which we generally know, but was still a redhead girl who distinguished the sweetness of the rose garden and laughed happily and heartily all the time. It is obvious that his appalling sense of humor was necessary to assess the snob-busting social anarchism of Colman's refreshing aristocratic character. The plot hardly matters, as is the case with a light and fun movie. It's just so much fun.
