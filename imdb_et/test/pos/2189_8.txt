Well I'm not the world's biggest fan of Sondheim, so even though I have a cast album and I listened to it a couple of times, I've never seen this show and I've never seen Tim Burton's movie version. I felt like I would see something more loyal before I see Burton's one and give him a chance like a movie. This version is not a movie at all, it is a filmed game with some original members, including the most important is Angela Lansbury's performance as Nellie Lovett. This is one of those performances that is like a channel to the heart of the Broadway magic and to the theater itself. He must be so fun with this role. Sweeney Toddi himself did not play Len Cariou, who initially did it, but George Hearn. Hearn is doing a fantastic job; his voice is not as good as Cariou, but he seems to be playing a little more. The only problem I really had was Johanna's character, played by Betsy Joslyn and to some extent her lover Anthony like Cris Groenendaal. Joslyn's voice can't hold high notes, but I wasn't sure if it should have been a point because I don't know the game very much. More importantly, I am not sure if the story of "Sweeney Todd" really holds up enough to retain some of the music, but fortunately it doesn't seem that its creators have taken the whole thing too seriously. Lark and a bit of comedy in the "Grand Guignoli" vein are quite enjoyable. I do not feel that this is just as important as the "Company" and "The Forest" or some of his other exhibitions. Some of the music is quite remarkable, but on other points it seems to exist outside the world. <br /> <br /> I don't talk much about this here because it's a movie website and it's not really a movie, it's just a movie that's filmed. There were perhaps 3 or 4 scenes where they moved around the camera, but that was the case. People want to see it because it preserves Lansbury's legendary performance, which deserves its legendary status because it is fun and insightful performance. George Hearn can also be proud of his Sweeney version. It would be a good movie to show children over the age of five in order to interest them musically because blood and cannibalism surprise them. Seeing for a self-evidently and so faithfully filmed performance, I would like to see more of such efforts in the music theater over the years, because I prefer the 20th to the 50s with their later ages. "Sweeney Todd" is an extraordinary exhibition of that time, but miles and miles above the madness of AL Webber.
