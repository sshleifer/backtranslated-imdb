I had no idea who Bruce Haack had seen before. I had just seen that the MOOG doc, which was fine, was the only problem Moog was leading with a very substantial life, and the doc was well ... content. The story of Haack is full of all the tragedies that are marketed by people these days, but with a lot of heart. Although the film does not go so far into tragic things, it can be understood that Bruce accepted the price of the music journey. Her legacy is made up of so many elements. The invention of Peopleodian, where Bruce could touch people. The documentation of Haack's "scattered-burned" output must have been difficult because it fell quite a bit in every conceivable music category (even rap music), but the director cut the piece very consistently and was able to hit the soul. And that ... what the group's characters, Bruce, surrounded, but what do you expect from a telepathic guru who has children fighting the music industry. I recommend this movie to anyone interested in music history, it's mainstream, but that's important.
