It may be easy to complain about the quality of this movie (you don't have to throw a movie to load a movie, nor does it guarantee that it's worth watching), but I think it's completely missing. If you are expecting fast cars, R&D or a movie that tells you, don't look at it, you're frustrated and buggy. <br /> <br /> This movie was really enjoyable, keeping us on the edge of our seats and making us think. The writer obviously put a lot of thought and research behind this film, and it shows that it is over, just remember that you have to remember. <br /> <br /> Note: School scenes were all filmed at McMaster University and most of the others were made in Toronto.
