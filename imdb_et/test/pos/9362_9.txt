It was a very sharp film about anti-Semitism. Unlike the GENTLEMEN AGREEMENT (which also deals with anti-Semitism), the film is outdated and does not seem difficult. In other words, it deals with the topic without seemingly preaching or triting according to today's standards. <br /> <br /> Robert Ryan plays one of the most insecure characters because he wins the guy's death just because he is a Jew. Robert Mitchum plays a researcher trying to get to the bottom of this crime. <br /> <br /> I give a movie to hate stubborn and insecure views. This is an example of Film Noir in many ways - although it is not a question of ordinary gangsters or robbery.
