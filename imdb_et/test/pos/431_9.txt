I promised that if I ever commented that it was less than free, then later I felt it different, I would come back and report a change in my heart. So far, this is the first time it happened. <br /> <br /> I really enjoy Hack. Something has changed clearly. The story is much stronger. However, the plot may be surreal, but the characters have evolved so deeply that the surreal plot will be forgiven. I attribute it to fine action. <br /> <br /> Not every show is able to win the outflow gate. Some need to speed up. I am glad that I have followed this program and I hope it will last.
