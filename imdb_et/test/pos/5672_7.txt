** SPOILERS ** Looking a little more excited to see that crocodiles are fed by native Grace and Pat, Diana Glenn & Maeve Dermody, with Grace's boyfriend Adam, Andy Rodored, decide to travel up in the desert and abandoned, human life, Mangrove, Australia swamp. <br /> <br /> Under his naval leadership, Jimmy, Ben Oxenbuld, managed to force four gigantic seawater crocodiles, who quickly grab and drag intimidated Jimmy with him. Grace Pat & Adam arrives at the jaw tree where Pat hangs on the boat. The rest of the movie has a hungry and determined crocodile that plays a cat and mouse or cake and a human game, with a trio ending in a mud bank where the dead and broken body jimmy finally created <br /> <br /> Both the film director and the actors are taking full advantage of the sex , making it sometimes more intimidating than the giant crocodile surrounding it. We can see that the killer crocodile is about one and a half times in the movie, but each one hits you and Jimmy Grace Pat & Adam, right in the gut. <br /> <br /> Alway had to miss it. The giant reptile does its damage below, which is so unexpected that it attacks much more impact than you see in the last ten minutes of the movie. You'll be amazed right from the beginning, who will eventually survive the crocodile attacks and finally live to talk to them. The confrontation of crocodiles ended with the weakest and unrealistic part of the film. <br /> <br /> The crocodile, who was so harsh and effective in the previous scenes, seemed to be beaten or swam, who hadn't grabbed his deadly jaws, or finished the expedition as the only caterer. In fact, the murderous murder was so ineffective that even after grabbing the victim or the victims, he was unable to hold them. Ultimately, it turned out to be deadly. <br /> <br /> Like the "jaws", the "black water" killer crocodile, like the large jaw "Jaws", is more interested in killing and sacrificing its human sacrifice. With all the food that was available in the swamps and rivers where he lived the crocodile, it was only after the quartet Grace Pat Adam & Jimmy, who was invading his watery domain, which he felt. And dare to make them pay for their lives!
