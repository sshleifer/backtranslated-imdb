I'm not a big TV person ... but when I saw the main episode of Greece, I couldn't wait next week! I'm not leaving anything for the show! <br /> <br /> THANK YOU God for DVR! LOL I'm in love with Cappie ... she's like a bad guy, but she's so cute ... Everyone has their own character, so we have a lot of people. You could, however, throw the Spaniards and obese people. he told me about an exhibition that I didn't pay attention to until he asked me to look at it and because I didn't have to do it better, I agreed. I laughed so hard the first night that I just had to watch it. I hope another, third and who knows how many more episodes! It's a really good show, very funny and fun!
