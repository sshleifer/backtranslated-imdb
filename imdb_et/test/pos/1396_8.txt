If a group of escaped convicts can escape to a remote island, they will soon find that their new home is home to a strangely threatening doctor (Richard Johnson, "Zombie 2" celebrity), crazy scientist (Joseph Cotten), his beautiful daughter (Barbara Bach) and the horde of superstitious natives . The tribes say that the physician has created grotesque semi-human, half-fish creatures for secret purposes. And while at first the prisoners do not believe because they disappear, one "Screamers" is a very entertaining combination of "Mysterious Island" and "Deep" humanoids. There are many gorees that have a really cool decapitation scene and throat tearing. so-so, but the movie is fast and entertaining.
