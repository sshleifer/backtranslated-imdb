"Steamboat Willie (1928)" is often mistakenly mentioned as the first Mickey Mouse film, although this title actually goes "Plane Crazy" (1928). "The source that nourishes this common misconception is probably the episode" The Simpsons ", which places Itchy the Mouse in 1928 with the short name" Steamboat Itchy ", which is obviously a parody of this comic. It is interesting that" Steamboat Willie "It was itself a parody of the last edition of Buster Keaton," Steamboat Bill, Jr (1928), "although the connection goes far beyond the setting of the title and general story. In this short Walt Disney, Mickey Mouse takes a river steamboat, which is largely captain Pete. But Mickey must not overcome the nastiness, and from the pleasant health of Mickey, which the last generations enjoyed, this little mouse only cares for an ounce, causing pain and dissatisfaction for many farm animals to deliver music for their amusement. <br /> <br /> First of all, there is a laughing parrot that stops the bucket and the big potato.

Let us not forget of course Minnie Mouse who suffers from the treatment he / she sues for sexual harassment today! Jokes can be crude oil and animation maybe even more, but this cartoon has a laugh bucket, and it's easy to see why this little rodent has become one of the cinema's history If you are a Mickey Mouse or a Disney fan in general, this is one steamboat that you can't afford.
