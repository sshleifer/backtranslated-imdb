in his CAA specifications, the southern platinum card in Hollywood, the psychoanalysis, the vacation in Provincetown, which he never took, and the free tours of Nicaragua, funded by Columbia pictures. <br /> <br /> It sounds narcissistic, but Spalding Gray, because of his unusual personality, attracts the audience, laughs (maybe because he didn't take the Hollywood thing oh-so-seriously) and takes care of us. <br /> <br /> This monologue is not just "Killing Fields" or "Swimming in Cambodia"; it is a pastime of events as he sees them. Some lines are classic, as when Gray meets with CAA reputable talents. The conference table is ... "full of them, tanned, healthy, fresh from the cyanobacteria of Lake Oregon ... there are no drugs in Hollywood". <br /> <br /> It was a tragedy before. Many of us lose their unmatched humor. 9/10
