Tenacious D in The Destiny speaks of a fictional story about the formation of the Tenacious D band and their quest to find the Pick of Destiny, a guitar selection with supernatural powers made by Satan's own teeth (played by Dave Grohl). JB (Jack Black) and KG (Kyle Gass), united by fate, must drive to the Rock N 'Roll Museum and steal Pick of Destiny to become the world's largest band. The movie is fun and laughs non-stop. Jack Black and Kyle Gass work great together for 20 years as real friends and associates. The film is partly musical. All (or most) music was written and performed by The D. All songs are new materials and many of them are classic. Sound track is definitely worth it. This movie is mostly appreciated by Tenacious D fans, but if you are not a D fan, I think you enjoy the movie. If you're a fan of D, you have to watch this movie. Action is not as bad as you think, and laughs and coarseness never ends. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to take off their socks and laugh as much as they've been laughing for a long time. Check out Dave Grohl, Ronnie James Dio, Meatloaf, Ben Stiller, Amy Poehler, Tim Robbins, John C. Reilly and Neil Hamburger. Also follow the extra scene after the credit.
