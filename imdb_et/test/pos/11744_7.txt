1952 On the basis of the autobiography "The Year of the Year", "Love is the deal of many people" (1955) tells the story of Han Suyin, focusing on the romance that Han, a Eurasian doctor in Hong Kong in 1949, was married to an American correspondent named Mark Elliott. "I'll never want to feel anything again," says Han Marki shortly after the meeting, but two soon to mutually reinforce each other and who can blame them? Marki plays William Holden soon after his hunky-dude period (the next year's "picnic" would be the top), the first of three films in the next seven years to find Holden in China (1960s) "Suzie Wong World" and 1962 "Satan" never sleep "are others. And Dr. Han has played here with Jennifer Jones, who is not Eurasia (unlike Nummy Kwan and pretty French from Nuyen from other exotic Holden movies), whether it gives a reliable job, Jones looks ridiculously proud, no matter what whether it's dressed in cheongsam, European frock, surgery or hubba-hubba! No wonder East meets so much in this movie! With its two attractive guides, the breathtaking Hong Kong landscape, the beautiful CinemaScope and the color, the Oscar winning costumes and this classic Oscar winning title song that travels through a movie like a lovely incense, "Love is a lot-Splendored Thing" to be quite winning and romantic. a, I can only imagine that with his source material great liberties were taken. However, I enjoyed it. And when the film ends with a tear, I just remember the words of Mark's wisdom: "The greatest tragedy of life is not loved."
