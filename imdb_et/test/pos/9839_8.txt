Frankie Darro was a wonderful child artist who looked remarkably small when playing harsh chips on his shoulders. He appeared in a couple of top films in the early 1930s - "The Public Enemy" (1931), a groundbreaking criminal drama and "Wild Boys of the Road" (1933), a topical depression film for children traveling on rails. He was mostly a younger version of James Cagney. Although his height is short, he kept ready to work his stunts to work in several programmers when larger studios didn't use him anymore. <br /> <br /> "Crime school" was supposed to be a "Hell Mayor" remake, but it had a lot more humor, and there was "Dead End Kids" and Humphrey Bogart as a very modest vice president. "The Mayor of Hell" is really a combination of "Hell House" / "Crime School" / "City of the Boy". Even if Cagney did not appear up to 25 minutes, his effect (as usual) was immediately. He plays a warm gangster who is on the payroll of a mobile-controlled political group. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Smith (Frankie Darro) and his gang (including "Farina" from our "Gang") drive a car wash racket, but bite more than they can rob the general store and push the owner through the plate glass window. They appear before the juvenile court and are understood as state reform. It is painted with glowing - a model school where boys are given the opportunity to learn about trade. In fact, it is a bustling place led by the sadistic guard, Mr. Thompson (Dudley Digges prominent game). The only compassionate person is Dorothy Griffith, a living sister (played by Madge Evans). <br /> <br /> "Patsy" Gargan (James Cagney) has become a new Deputy Commissioner. Upon arrival at school, he feels an unsuccessful escape attempt and, after talking to Dorothy, understands that the school needs extensive reforms. He will soon work in school and will introduce a system of "independent self-government" - rather than the "City of the Boy". Although Cagney has not much to do, the image is carried to the climax that comes with Darro's energy. When "Patsy" is temporarily excluded from the picture (he accidentally enters the cell and has to leave the country), returning Thompson and his brutal treatment resulting in the death of a boy ("Skinny"), turn the rest of the boys around an angry mob. They burn the sheep and Thompson falls to his death - "Patsy" returns just in time to calm down to speak peacefully. <br /> <br /> Certainly, it seemed that all the boys had talked about their crimes, but I disagree with one reviewer - Thompson was more than just "average". His sadistic treatment led to the death of the boy. At first, there is a place where the boys are delivered to some inedible shore - Thompson orders ham and eggs and keeps Dorothy talking about his bread. <br /> <br /> Allan Jenkins plays "Uncle" Mike and Sheila Terry, though they are only paid for as "blonde" with one of the most memorable features when she sticks and says, "I thought there were young boys here where are they? "!!! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
