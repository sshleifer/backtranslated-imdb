The reader is a great example of what a short film should look like. The Poignant story, simply written for dialogue, beautifully painted pictures, scores that tell smoothly through narrative, and characters that are thoughtful and gracious. <br /> <br /> I saw it at a film festival where other interesting movies and ideas were screened. But no other short shorts had any great film making feature for one movie, as the reader did. Reader ordered the attention of every festival visitor in the room, and for 10 minutes we took the emotional life. <br /> <br /> Duncan Rogers has created a beautiful movie and hope to see the director be more of a shorts or perhaps a feature film.
