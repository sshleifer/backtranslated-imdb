Music is the best aspect of this television film, which has better than average, but very surface and slightly changed biography. Dramatizes Richard's discovery "We've just begun" and Karen's marriage disgracefully ("Superstar" assembly was a nice touch), but ignores the disagreement between Neil Sedaka, Tony Peluso's guitar sols, and more. The Gibb Karen personality is sweet, but it does not include the tomboyish and gutsier sides of the actual Carpenter personality. Anderson is in creative form and takes Richard and Fletcher puts his trademark into a loving but overwhelming Agnes. The most strange moment of the original transmission is the use of "Goodbye to Love" in the background of business with anorexia on the hotline.
