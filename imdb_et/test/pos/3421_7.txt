POSSIBLE SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Nobody is likely to accept a Red Dust DVD without knowing that it is a South African truth and reconciliation commission. Hilary Swank stands for South African exile, returning to his home town attorney, representing Alex Mpondo (Chiwetel Ejiofer), a South African parliamentarian tormented by prisoner Pete Muller (Ian Roberts), seeking to escape from prison, recognizing the Truth and Reconciliation Commission . They could certainly have found an actor who is or could mimic South Africa's accent; Mrs Swank is not trying to cover her unmistakably with an American accent. Nevertheless, he is the only known actor in the film and it would probably not have been done without him or someone equally well known. He does a decent job. At the same time, Ejiofer and Muller (the German pronunciation for "u"), like police chief Jamie Barlett, is responsible for killing Mpondo's comrade and associate. Torture scenes are shown briefly, but they are lively and plausible. What is not plausible is the process of truth and reconciliation, except that it actually happened. "Red dust" should only be seen for this reason, because it was and is incredible that ANC prisoners could actually forgive torturers, and it is as close as we can probably see in the process.
