This movie ... I saw it 15 years ago and in recent years it couldn't be remembered anymore, a name or something else - it was about a Romanian man who was playing well with Anthony Quinn. The impression of this drama is eternal. Finally I found the movie name, I hope I can buy it. And honestly this film is worth 10 Oscars. Ten times BRAVO. I was pretty young when I first saw the movie. I asked my friends if they heard the story, but nobody knows about Anthony Quinn, who plays the role of a peasant in Romania. I remember when a German officer came and saw Anthony and told him he was a good "breed," but in fact he was cheating on him. For a few bucks you won't get rich when you buy a movie, but you have a rich one when you have it.
