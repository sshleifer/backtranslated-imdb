I really refused to see this movie. I refused to go to school and refused to go with my parents. Just looking at the trailer, it seemed stupid to me anyway. One of my friends wanted to bring me to the movies that day and he offered me 2 choices: "The Hazzard Dukes" or "Wallace and Gromit: those who were cursed by the rabbit." It took me 17 minutes to decide. Time was running out. I had to choose. It appeared on the screen "Few" as on a few tickets. By the time we had to line up our ticket and get our ticket, only one of us could go in. I desperately wanted Nikolai to see it. But he forced me. I went over my hands and was very moody and disappointed that I went to see this childhood. I walked in, sitting alone, ready for the movie and ready! must say that I was very surprised that I was sitting through this MASTERPIECE! It was amazing. I don't know what I complained about. Clay Animation was the best I've ever seen in my life. The story was great. A rabbit that cut off and crashes a carnival that was scheduled for over 500 years. Essentially, pest control protects people who compete in a vegetable competition. Anti Pesto, known as Wallace and Gromid (who is responsible for this company) is trying to keep all the rabbits away from the carnation. I'm not saying any more. It's just too good to say. I admit that the whole idea of ​​Were-Rabbit is incredible and ab-it childish, but Nick Park adds content that everyone loves. I mean, it's not 10 foot rabbit open and there's definitely a habit of 8 foot werewolves as said "Dog soldiers." Again, rabbits and WereWolves are not real beings. But in both cases it worked very well. <br /> <br /> Jokes had also grown more. Kids don't get some jokes. It goes over your heads. There were a lot of British jokes. If you love British humor, it's your movie. <br /> <br /> I also loved cast and voices. Everything about the film is so well done. The direction and pace was completely ... FANTASTIC! I recommend it to fans of short Wallace and Gromid short short films (And no, I haven't seen them yet) and recommend it to fans who liked "Shrek" and "Shrek 2 and most importantly, I recommend it to people who love Clay Animation
