Collect me as someone who doesn't see Hastings in this episode. Dr Watson, a poor man, does nothing to me because he just pulls down every scene he's on. Japp is often needed as an official representative, and a little Miss Lemon is good for seasoning, but Hastings swings painfully in the dark in different episodes. When I have to sit another empty "Oh, I say there!" I'll take the gas pipe. <br /> <br /> Generally, the more Poirotit Poirot's story gets, the better. Every Hastings line has been taken off from Poirot. And I've never read books so I don't care about Christie's characters. Many viewers / reviewers seem to be having problems separating the movie from books. If you want to write a book, read it. I do not see the TV viewing point if you know what is at each stage. Theater is not a prose - don't wait for transcription.
