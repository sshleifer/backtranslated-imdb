There are a limited number of fans in the world who would love a particular genre to go deeper into what this team has done to bring something that the original film writer had ever achieved. This is a great study of the true dedication and love that is needed to reach a potentially very successful cult film. <br /> <br /> Originally with Alex Cox's blessings, this team began producing one of his films in an absolute true punk way. They are just about taking full advantage of the atmosphere, as it should be a complete respect for the original "Repo Man" movie. <br /> <br /> This is a great story about dedication and deception that can happen along the way of making a wonderful movie. A truly entertaining story and guaranteed learning experience for the viewer.
