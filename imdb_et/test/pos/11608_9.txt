Chokher Bali appeared at DC Washington Film Festival on April 15, 2005. Director Rituparno Ghosh was there to give a brief introduction and answer questions later. <br /> <br /> As always, I think Aishwarya did a fantastic job. I understand that those who think he should be more aggressive or more funny, but would it be really realistic in 1904? Possibly, maybe; realistic, I'm not so sure. I think his interpretation was valid, although there may certainly be other ways. <br /> <br /> I don't want to use that word, but it was the most inappropriate of the Indian movies I've seen so far. I know a lot about Indian history, Hindu religion, etc., but the level of detail here was far from me. It is clear that the film would have a much better understanding if you were aware of Hinduism and its practices. as they were c. 1904. I left a lot of things - one of them was the fact that mother-in-law would want Binodin in the house as a counterweight to her daughter, Ashalata. Spoilers * Ghosh had a number of things to say, which made the movie much better for me. First, Bengal's original version was 20+ minutes longer. So what was left out? There are probably three main things: the beginning segment where Binodin (Aishwarya) leaves E. Bengal in Calcutta. According to the director, different characters speak of W. Bengali vs. Mr Bengal - some political comments later. Of course, it all loses in the Hindu version and certainly to non-India, as to me, it would not be important anyway - but the creation of Bengal would be certain. Next was the segment where Binodin wrote poetry - a sign of his independence, etc. So, while some people think it was too long, I think the original, longer version would have been clearer. <br /> <br /> Women's hair was probably another sign (Ghosh again) - mother-mother was short hair (short hair on widow's hair), her sister - even a widow - had longer hair (more modern!), and Binodini / Of course, Aishwarya had extremely long hair lengths (rejection of widow's status). <br /> <br /> The end really hit me - maybe Binodin, who had never had a political sense, writes a political manifesto? Where! Ghosh explained that he was at the Locarno Film Festival when the subtitles were made. The subtitles use the word "state" in Binodin's letter. Gosh said that a more appropriate word would have been (forget my exact word) something about myself or independence - he spoke about his liberation and "finding" - not about Bengal, India and Britain. . So, why does Binodin disappear just a day after Behar is found again? Obviously, during his stay in Ganges, he understands that he does not need a man - no man - to define him / her. He can just be himself. So he pushes Behari back, who's got him for a few months (?), And just goes down. Of course I'm not sure how he buys his next meal, but that's another question. <br /> <br /> The red scarf (Ghosh again) he buys represents both "revolution" and "passion". I'm not 100% sure why he puts a towel on a dying woman, but maybe he refuses a passion / revolution? The binoxins used by Binodin throughout the film (watching Mahendra and Ashalatat, the boat in Ganges, etc.). She is a voyeur to see the life she misses but can't. Finally, he leaves the binocular on the table with a letter indicating that he doesn't need them anymore - he's going to lead his life. <br /> <br /> Finally, Tagore cites at the beginning, saying how he apologized for its ending ... Obviously Tagore wrote it as a serial, combining his readers with sexy widows. Eventually he sold out to conservatism and had kneeled Binodin on the feet of Mahendra and Behar, asking for their forgiveness. One of his students (?) Wrote to Tagore that he stopped completing his sales ... and Tagore replied with an excuse for ending. Of course, Ghosh is going to the other side of the film.
