This movie is the smartest comedy I've ever seen, a lot of jokes about the parody of another movie (kung fu from star wars to dragon battles), or somehow related to any history (Otis creates a lift), there are also many jokes related to the modern world and fun as it was in the BC (As for the horse carriage spinning) Other jokes are just general non-common sense, but also fun (like the famous scene where the dog runs after the Roman boy with small music). any humor. I've been watching this movie 6 times and every time I watch it, I find other fine jokes. (like a scene where waldo is part of the Egyptian crowd). This is the funniest movie I have all, finally, a ridiculous comedy that does not contain a toilet or sexual humor. Numerobis also has what makes the movie, everything that comes out of this boy is fun. This film is almost perfect, except for some clich√©s, such as that Asterix gets its power back because it can be kissed, it is a common fool. But generally a great movie !! 9.5 out of 10
