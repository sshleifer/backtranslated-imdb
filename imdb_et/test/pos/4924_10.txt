Although this is not the first movie I have bought myself, it has almost certainly been the most watched. The animation is well drawn by the experts of Tokyo Movie Shinsa, and animators often used smart techniques, such as the creation of the sun, causing the "lens to burn", soaking the camera (and the "camera operator's hand" cleaning the lens!) And so on. Although the film did not become an "animation gadget", the rational but generous use of such techniques gave the film a much more "realistic" feeling than a typical comic. <br /> <br /> The story has many intertwined parcels that don't seem to be much related to each other until everything comes to a close, so even the writers who say themselves have lived. All major plot lines have their own music theme, ranging from "Pop goes from talent" [Hamton & Plucky] to "Romeo and Julia" with the theme of love [Fifi & Johnny]. Transitions between plans are slightly different, but consistent. <br /> <br /> Really great movie; there is not much original music, although the new words "Spinning Song" are clever and enjoyable. VERY RECOMMENDED.
