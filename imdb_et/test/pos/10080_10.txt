That was a great movie! It was a completely enjoyable youth fantasy. What makes a movie big? Technical details? I think that if this were the only criterion, our culture would be poorer for it. So this movie is "Godfather" because the new wave of music is for Mozart. The thing is that it is one of the best films I've seen. Women are all beautiful (as seen only on California beaches when movies are made). It has little to do with the sort of battlestar gallactica meets baywatch meets playboy centerfold video to meet Wayne's World. There's a lot of charm and a reasonable (albeit predictable) storyline that keeps you interested until the next eye candy is a bit of a grace on the screen. Joe Estevez may not have a career with his brothers, but he does a good job of bringing the focus to the story as an ever young Uncle Bud. Includes many anticipated absurdities, such as a female rock band that plays without a guitar. (Was it deliberate?) If you've attracted a box, rent a video, you won't regret it. As allowed, this is a good non-violent erotic fun!
