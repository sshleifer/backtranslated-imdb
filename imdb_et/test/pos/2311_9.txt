This is one of my three favorite films. I've been in the water already at the age of 13, so I got a lot of humor and I also recognized a lot of land-based landscapes (a film that took place in and around Virginia, filmed around the San Francisco Bay), especially the cave park east of Benothia Bridge, where Kelsey The character of the grammar was first introduced to USS Stingray, and San Francisco ports at the end of the movie (including the boat I've been working on). As other people have said, the actors seemed fun for making this movie and for entertainment. The line "We're approaching the bottom, sir! I hear a couple of lobsters who give it out" is at least invaluable to me. <br /> <br /> I am one of the many people who are unexpectedly expecting a Down Periscope letterbox DVD.
