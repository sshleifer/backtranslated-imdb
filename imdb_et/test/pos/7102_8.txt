I liked the House of Dracula much more than the Frankenstein House. Carradine is much more permeable and her action is not as ridiculous as it is in the HOF. Participants have strong results. The sub-blocks (eg, monster, village mobiles, village idiot, embarrassing sister, etc.) mix well so that none of them is a strange gap like HOF. Work better than sewn together. A modest nurse is as pleasing as a HOF. The doctor is very good. Lon Chaney also adds an elegant touch to his wolf. It's worth checking twice. The classic universal horror of this typical 1940s lost beauty. The strength of the doctor before / after his blood contamination with Dracula is particularly good.
