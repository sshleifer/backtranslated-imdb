When I first saw the movie, I thought it was a sweet family film. For the rest of the night and a couple of days, the smart moments and funny lines are back to my thoughts and back to our conversation ... There are many, classic farce elements, good character and Wendie Malick's story is just hysterical. Labeling this "good sense of film" does not let the spiritual and the fun - it is smarter than it seems, "It's a wonderful life".
