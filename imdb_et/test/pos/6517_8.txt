This film focused on a young lady who makes prayers to help her family and friends when they are in trouble. It made me think of other films like "Bernadette's Song" and "Francis of Assisi" and have a very strong Catholic faith in the film. Ann Blyth is first a very charming, Catholic school student and later a young woman who buys the statue of Saint Anne (which is the street name I live by, and makes many prayers for saints). custody when there are problems in his life. Frances Bavier (from Aunt Bea Andy Griffith's show) and Edmund Gwenn (Miracle's 34th Street) play with his relatives. My local priest said my sister recalled Ann Blyth and both had the same first and middle name. A nice good family movie that came from a time when life was a little easier.
