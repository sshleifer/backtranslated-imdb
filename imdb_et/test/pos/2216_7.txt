This movie was a big surprise to me when I looked at it at Cinequest's San Jose Grand California Theater. It's musical, which I usually don't like, but I have to say it was different. Robert Peters, who directed the film and watched it, did such a wonderful job. During his Q&A he told the audience that he had only two people for his team! Most of the dialoug was made for the flight and he made a movie in Germany when visiting another film festival! I can't say enough about this movie, the only bad thing is that you really tend to notice the camera's work and it shakes a bit. If you get this movie, look at it!
