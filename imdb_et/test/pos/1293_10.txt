I saw this Masterpiece Theater episode and immediately came to IMDb to watch it. I was welcomed by a comment from another user who believed that it was not special, 6 out of 10 and subconscious. I would feel morally unsuccessful if I disagree. <br /> <br /> Now I am an avid fan of Masterpiece Theater, but often these stories are a bit stupid on television, for example: "He knew he was right" was absolutely terrible. But the "Carrie War" is probably the best I've ever seen. All the cast work is a great job and it was more of my interest than any other recently seen part. Particularly interesting is the picture of Mr Evans and the fine pictures, such as the intact birthday cake or the pomegranate ring, which made my opinion really bad. Really. His ultimate death and story about how everyone left him with a cold hard man is what brought me the bittersweet of this story. <br /> <br /> The end is gratifying in every sense, but one; that everyone did not get what they earned, but general things worked out. I recommend it to everyone.
