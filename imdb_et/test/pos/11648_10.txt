After reading most of the comments I have, I feel I have the floor. <br /> <br /> What worries me the most is that most people here think this movie is either a pro or death-related fine and whether it worked with them. I remember reading back in 1995 when the movie was released (yes, it has been interesting for me as long as I heard that I haven't forgotten the articles I read) where Tim Robbins said he didn't want to do movie to convince the audience of no other. <br /> <br /> And I think it's absolutely right. I have to admit that I believe he did a little to death on the way of making a movie, but still allow people to choose. And it's very rare in American movies. <br /> <br /> I have shown this movie to many people because it has come out and I've seen all kinds of reactions. Death-sentenced supporters became opponents or became even stronger. And many death penalty prisoners (including myself) grew more strongly in their conviction that the death penalty should be abolished worldwide. But I've even seen that opponents are becoming supporters. This and the fact that people here seem to struggle show me that there are really many ways to look at it. So whatever impact you have, it is important that it makes you think. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few movies that will really give you a choice that does not abandon the poor or innocent of a convicted man with a simple way. It can be a difficult thing for people who prefer entertainment or lessons. There is no lesson you need to find yourself. <br /> <br /> Everyone praises the actor, leadership and music, but as it has been said so many times, I don't repeat it. <Br / So if you haven't seen it yet, do it - if you dare to challenge!
