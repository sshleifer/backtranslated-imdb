The visual efficiency of this film is incomparable with what I have seen. And the job you need to do this must be incredibly long and tedious (for this look, it's not just "Kodak Grainy Film" in the camera). Don't look at this movie entertainment, see it visually stimulated, look at this challenge and provoke in your thoughts a movie and any other topic that comes to mind, religion is probably one idea. <br /> <br />
