My first contact with the Japanese animation director Hayao Miyazaki and his studio Ghibli production company was when the English version of Spirited Away appeared about 7 years ago. What a wonderful creative and unique film experience! So I was able to see my film-lover friend seeing this new Miyazaki movie as he loves all the things that Disney (the US distributor of this movie) loves. Once again, all I can say is "Wow!" What awesome visuals about how water is portrayed as ocean ... and what is the transformation of the title character into goldfish ... and see how some characters' behavior change ... and see if you want to see this movie to know what I'm talking about. Oh, and the votes used for this American dubbed version: Tina Fey, Betty White, Liam Neeson, Cloris Leachman, and Lily Tomlin. All good choices. Is it all right? No, but it's part of a childish charm that passes through. There are a lot of funny scenes about Ponyo and the boy and many other people they come across. I think I've written too much to just suggest Hayao Miyazaki Pony.
