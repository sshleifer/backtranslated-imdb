Can you capture for a moment? When do you first hear the rain on the roof? Some things are beyond the sum of their parts, expressing life's poetry. Important things. The poet Dylan Thomas struck the seemingly inexplicable "Good poem helps ... to expand everyone's knowledge of themselves and the world around them." (Bob Dylan called himself after him). Why has it taken so much time to make a big Dylan Thomas movie? A simple biopsy could have missed this point. The writer Sharman Macdonald has taken a different, better approach. <br /> <br /> On the edge of love, he creates a world of passions and complexities that fill poems so that we can swim in them. The life of four friends. Dylan, who loves and loves completely. Spouse Caitlin (Sienna Miller), her sensual support. War Hero William (Cillian Murphy), who rescues him from street play. And then it's his baby's sweetheart. Vera. Dear Vera. Take the breath out of Vera. She is Caitlin's closest friend. William woman. And like a fairy tale, "star" in Dylan's dark sky. <br /> <br /> It all starts at the 1940s London Blitz with Underground Shelter Shelters. Enter Vera (impressive Keira Knightley) under the AC Stage Light. She meets Dylan for the first time for years, her heart rinsed. Their eyes look like smoke through the room. The purity of their former passion. Dylan (a native speaker, Matthew Rhys) is not a consecrated, disinfected poet. He must fully experience his experience. She introduces her beloved wife and then continues Vera. <br /> <br /> The edge of love is visual. The audio track will give you more desire. Performances are the best participants in their careers. The lush love story is pretty good. Like Dylan Thomas and the reality of poetry throughout our lives, it's not bad at all. And a tribute to a great person, inspiring. <br /> <br /> Production has been painful to develop Dylan Thomas's spirit without too much historical accuracy. Dramatic tension involves the drawing of artistic freedom and ordinary morality. Target audiences looking for the latter's experience may be disappointed. And it plays less well for the audience whose borders are on Albert Square. <br /> <br /> Sharman Macdonald seemed to be aware of the strong character of artistic freedom and its boundaries when he spoke with Rebekah Gilbertson (a real grandchild). William and Vera). "Think of all the things you don't want me to write," he said, "because I have to have a carte blanche." There were limits for Macdonald when he would insult Dylan's memory. But for many artists, especially men, the boundaries are what the woman and the family could put on them. The woman does not allow high ideals to interfere with practical common sense issues and even put the interests of her children in front of her (this happens from time to time, in contrast to the brutal genius Virginia Woolf refusing to love Leonard to love the earth). <br /> <br /> Despite the tension between Caitlin and Vera, these two women become the closest friends. This is one of the main (and very beautiful) themes of the film. <br /> <br /> The film's colors speak for themselves. In drab, wartime Britain, Caitlin and Vera are lively highlight of the ocean gray. Soon after meeting Vera's enlightened enlightened person, we meet Caitlin through her eye-catching eyes, blowing in a dark railway wagon. His dramatic red coat cuts the color of the homogeneity of streets on the streets, which is a beautiful staircase when reconnected with Dylan. However, Vera lipstick red brightness is less durable. For her, marriage is the second largest, even if she has received true love for her husband. <br /> <br /> Great cinematography extends to the use of montage to equalize images like poetry by collating extra words to create additional meaning. Tessalys is a terrifying war scene with Vera herds during pregnancy. Is childbirth or is it an abortion? We don't tell us right now. Pain is universal and goes beyond the time and place to our present day. <br /> <br /> The continuous echo of Dylan's poetry in the entire film leads us beyond the earthly contrasts. It reminds me of Marlon Brandot, who now read TS Eliot's apocalypse. Light outside the horrors of the world. Another way to see things. "I'll take you back to the time when bombs did not fall from the sky and no one died," says Dylan Vale, when they pass the beach. Elsewhere, Caitlin reminds Vaga of his childhood: "We are still innocent in Dylan," he says. <br /> <br /> There is time to leave your nails at home or to share a universal cigarette. (Not literally, maybe.) Time of inspiration. Enjoy what is the best British film of the year.
