I like movies that show real people "Americans" and tell the truth. The film is simple and it seems to be a big deal. It played a fine here in Norway (Amazon says it is US / Canda above, but the box says "All regions." I have to say it's not for American viewers. He played here at World Raw Views, theater theater. and later I ordered it. Cut was different and much better. Look at it and you like it or maybe hate it. Sorry Bush lovers, but this movie drives you crazy because it makes sense. All that is but I stand one It is long and too hard to keep up, but by looking at another, it makes more sense, I loved Owen's words, and the poem made me cry.
