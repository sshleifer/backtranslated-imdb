This movie is better off because of Vincent D'Onofrio (Law & Order: Criminal Intent), but this film is as good as the 1982 version. In some ways, the 1999 version is better because it is more up to date (27 years compared to the decade. The actors in this movie were great, like Terry Kinney (HBO's Oz) McManus like James Daly and Tony Shalhoub (US Monk) and Gary Blue (CSI: NY) ) Obvilubuly, the change of dialogue for the modern audience, much of the writing of the nut remained the same, there were things that were not in the 1982 version, which gave it drama and comedy, but in the end it was the same in 1982: Vincent D 'onofrio, who played Phil Romano, was great, better than Paul Sorvino, it was a match between Stacy Keach and Terry Kinney What about George, I would like to praise Shalhoub and between Martin Sheen and Sinsis I would say Blue wins .
