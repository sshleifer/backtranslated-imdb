When this movie came out, I had seen Geena Davis play only soft, feminine roles ... This film was nothing but soft and feminine. Big lines, great action ... and Samuel L really clicked. Children who are too violent, but if you and your other important others try to agree on a movie, try it for size. Go Geena! Go Geena!
