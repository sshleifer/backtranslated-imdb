I liked this series, but I felt that recording / mixing the sound was all over. <br /> <br /> For some reason, they had to use an awful lot of what is called an ADR, where participants replace the original location sound with this sound recording again. <br /> <br /> This is usually due to location problems or because somebody screwed up somewhere in the production chain <br /> <br /> It wouldn't be so bad if the ADR was well done, but sometimes it's just messy . This is not just an ADR, but a problem - mixing sound is not compatible with the quality of performances and images. <br /> <br /> I would like to know what went wrong.
