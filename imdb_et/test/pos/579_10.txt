This wonderful film captures so many elements that makes family comedy funny, fun, sweet and memorable, it's hard to decide where to start. Kermit D. Frog's honored score, which gives us a story of the whole adventure, the whole story, it's one fun movie. <br /> <br /> In essence, this is a journey film where Kermit travels with countries where there is a dream of being a "rich and famous contract" for entertainment. Along our way, our green hero meets several other aspiring actors, comedians, singers and musicians who randomly are muppets like Kermit himself. Is that how Muppets really started? "About how it happened," says Kermit to us. <br /> <br /> Not because "It is crazy, mad, mad, mad world", the comedy composition has been used both proliferatively and successfully. Expectant stars experience many recognizable faces during Odyssey; some just flash over the screen but others are very memorable. Steve Martin is a funny little rude waiter, probably the best. Encouraging the inspirer Jim Henson for inspiration, Edgar Bergen, is particularly relevant. <br /> <br /> Anyone who ever saw a Muppets TV show to see all of their favorite characters is all here. Puppets are excellent; especially look for Kermit cycling (how dey do dat ??). Jokes and references to old films are everywhere, but the best liners are reserved for Kermit. For example, when scammers terrorize Kermit and Piggyi, he gently says to his short, green and beautiful beau: "I wouldn't give something tonight together?" "Uhhh, make me an offer ...." I also love the arms fight in the OK Corral scene: superbly absurd foolishness. a benevolent film that can be enjoyed by anyone, regardless of age or the genre of the film. Highly recommended.
