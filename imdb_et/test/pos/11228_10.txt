The third film of Polish brothers is still the best, most beautiful and imaginative film. Although many audiences have a problem with the lack of Northfork's traditional dramatic structure, "Stick with it, Jack!" The plot is hard to summarize, so just know that the story includes: agents who try to evacuate the city, God cowboy in a hat, sell angel and a sick orphan (but it all works). The extraordinary photography of Mr David Mullen makes almost every scene exciting and wonderful. The actors' performances, which work with an inspiring successful script by Polish brothers, are perfect and give the film an emotional punch. A member of a strong willpower is accompanied by a story of mythology and folklore, comics and moving actors, and finally, the incredible courage and commandment that Michael Polish shows behind the camera. Again, all of these incredible and seemingly divergent elements come together in the most unbelievable way you should run out and experience. Great, great, great movie !!!
