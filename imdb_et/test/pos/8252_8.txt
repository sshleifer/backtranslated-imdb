I remember seeing it in the mid-1980s to see that it is well-paced and well-functioning. I work quite often on Berkeley Square and I had to get a copy of the DVD to remind me of how little the area has changed, although my office is just 30 seconds away from the "bank". Even Jack Barclays car dealer still sells Bentleys and Rolls Royces. <br /> <br /> It looks like the DVD is due to the release of Area 2 soon. Part I of Region 1 is of very poor quality. We hope they've cleared it. <br /> <br /> Only the terrible escape sequence will break what would otherwise be a great movie, but I think it is in line with the capri tag that the movie goes with.
