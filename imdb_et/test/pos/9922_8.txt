This is a standard price for a director who has long been among my favorites. <br /> <br /> Although it is very smooth compared to many of his other works, but his Argento and it may be biased, but I'll give him a good overview. <br /> <br /> It contains a lot of good ideas. Exquisite voyeurist element. Needles under the eyes. Deadly and disturbing death. And the recall of the Argento clich√©. <br /> <br /> Destroyers include sound, show and end of heavy metals. end of the year. <br /> <br /> Pretty good movie Argento, but he did it better. Much better!
