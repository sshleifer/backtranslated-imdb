Here is the unrivaled Charlie Chaplin, who gave up his past in order to tackle the serious issue of anti-Semitism and intolerance in general. He depicts two characters - a sweet, innocent Jewish hairdresser - a war veteran and a robbing and ruthless dictator, Adenoid Hynkelit. The Jewish ghetto of this country is not safe for a long time because of the whims of Hynkel and his armed tangles, who routinely scream their residents or leave them alone, depending on his mood this day or week. The hairdresser is among them, but friendly is his former chief executive, Schultz (Reginald Gardner), who seems to keep things quiet for a while until Hynkel understands him in a concentration camp. She is seeking refuge in the Jewish ghetto, especially at the hairdresser and hostile young woman, Hannah (Paulette Goddard). The premise is - who is one of those Jews to put their lives on the line to get rid of Hynkel and his crowns? We do not have to find the answer too difficult; The hairdresser is the dictator's dying ring, and he is equipped with his picture, accompanied by Schultz, with a complete military move. Hannah flees with a number of her ghetto friends in the Osterlich state, where Mr Jaeckel (Maurice Moscovich )'s cousin is on the farm and can live for a while. He is now arrested by Hynkel himself, thinking he is a notorious hairdresser. The latter has in the meantime sent a podium to Schultz to talk about conquering Osterlich. The next ten minutes are pure Chaplin, who speaks in his heart of abusing tolerance, love and freedom, and greed and hatred. Although Chaplin started producing the film in 1937, it can be forgiven for some naive. He allegedly did not know this level of persecution and hatred and said that if he knew it completely, he would never have made a film because he thought he would have been trivialized. He has a wonderful supporter: Reginald Gardner, Henry Daniell as Garbitsch, his assistant, always the wonderful Billy Gilbert as the bumblebee herring, Paulette Goddard, Jack Oakie as the dictator of Napalon, his contest for conquest, veteran European actors David Gorcey (leo father), Maurice Moscovich , among others. The scene he choreographed into the world, but a musical accompaniment, is thin, bright inspiration and luminous, is also at the end of Paulette Goddard's movie, smiling at his tears. I've seen this movie before, but there's always something new about it. Last night, when he finished, I was sitting in tears. I don't think anyone would move it.
