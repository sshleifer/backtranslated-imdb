I loved this movie. A great, realistic look that is one thing and a real story. The joy of the joyful, underscored, Franta, makes her very pleasant. The human relationship with the story seemed so typical and possible when you expected the war. The link between Franta and Carel shows that loyal warrior comrades can be one another and is often described in interviews with books and veterans. Subtitles do not diminish this story at all, and indeed stress the problems that Czech pilots had in the RAF. The postwar story is a great reminder that many WW2 sufferings did not end in 1945, especially in the Russian occupied countries. The film was also very good. I'd like to have seen it on the big screen.
