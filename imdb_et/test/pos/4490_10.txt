"Five-character exit search" must clearly be one of the brightest and best "Twilight Zone" episodes that have ever been made because of abstract ideas and a thoughtful plan in which characters have to look for identity and end up as a surprise. You have an army ambassador, a female dancer, a bagpipe player, a clown and a hobo who all wake up to the bottom of the wall and no one knows how they got there and they don't know who they are. Thus, the episode starts from the very beginning with a very interesting drama and mid-term review, which makes it so soulful to look for viewers who want to know the real identity and backgrounds. In addition, the episode adds even more intrigue, as it puts different types of characters into different views and lifestyles, with a common goal of escape and finding identity and peace that is very convincing for the viewer. Only finally I do not want to spoil those who have not seen the fall of surprise! By proving that many times you might stay where you are in your small shelter, and away from the masses of other people in the world, as you can see, people have loved many different forms. Really great and wisely made a real shock-surprise that makes the viewer's unexpected and brutal destiny, which sometimes happens when you search and seek.
