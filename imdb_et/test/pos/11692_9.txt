Beauty in Trouble (Kráska v nesnázích) is not a great title. Not all the descriptions in this movie capture what it really is? adult fairy tale. The poor girl is wounded by the prince. "Girl", Marcela, played by stunning Anna Geislerová, owns Isabelle Huppert with beauty, red hair, face and figure that is light, sexual and endlessly exciting. She has a husband's weakness, but they have great sex. Children listen to love through the walls. It's tough and passionate, because it seems that the working class sex is often on film. But we must also admit that this is the thing that binds them together in an otherwise incompatible marriage. Man, a professional car thief, is finally caught in prison. How he got into this marriage, which we do not know, but he is not a high class himself. But he is beautiful, intelligent (we expect) and we love our great and durable children. He deserves more. And he can get the life he deserves - finally. (not a spoiler!) She is forced to go back to her mother when her husband is sent to prison. Mom is a hidden second spouse (read an ugly stepfather). He's a real horror show. He is confined to child abuse. He is obsessive with purity, but he strikes at the table insecurely, at the same time demanding customs and decorations from children. He is a real low-class socially disabled hatred. Mom puts her, like Marcella's wife, at least she's strange, but horny. Ambivalent, confusing, layered testimonials are what makes the film so powerful and interesting. These characters have some flaws, some of which were inspired by the class, some are innate. These character flaws and details are charming one minute and the next despicable. The audience must really negotiate on the role of the opposing class, sexuality, ambition, commitment and the role of a woman as a mother and woman in a rapidly changing landscape. Like many movies like the wonderful Icelandic film "Thicker Than Water" (Blóðbönd), children can be victims. What is ultimately what is best for children? Who is our salvation and future This is a topic that is played in these days in films ranging from Pan's maze to male children, the cinema admits in complicated morals that life is confusing, brutal, unfair and as adults we have to act together so that when we give our own basersinstinki, we could lose ourselves and the world in this process, the extraordinary and complex and colorful characters in Kráska v nesnázíchi talk about what makes a man led by women, which embodies the hope of being a class - is it the economic status of the fabric of its character? The film is abundantly human, represented by the last 2 shots that brought me unbelievably and unexpectedly. so subtle and smart to compare it to an American film is unfair. Sometimes it seems that Americans do not want to consider that paradoxes of human nature do not offer a resolution. But here are dangerous moral issues here, for adults, obviously in the fairy tale. Don't just fool yourself; this is a great movie.
