Located in Venice, mainly in Lido, Visconti's "Death in Venice" is a triumph of filmmaking that combines expert photography by Dirk Bogarde with the resort's area of ​​expertise in all its daily moods. For those who love Venice, this is a film that needs to be cherished. <br /> <br /> Mahler's music, which is often heard in the entire movie, increases drama. Modern mood is not always happy. But what else do you expect with such a title? <br /> <br /> There is not much dialogue in the movie. Rather, it is actually sparse. It is mainly background noise and entertainment and laughter. The intriguing part is to interpret the shift between Gustav von Aschenbach's somewhat famous composer and the young teenage teenager Tadzio, who see each other from time to time in the hotel dining room, on the beach and in odd unexpected places around Venice. They seem to acknowledge each other's presence at an early stage with little more than a smile suggestion, but later with a strong, riveting and urgent look. <br /> <br /> Each viewer has its own interpretation. The composer has lost his child. Does this behavior express the longing for the child he loved? Is it perhaps a sexual attraction to this fragile young man whose enthusiastic somewhat grim spirit is? Could he discover another inspiration for an unwritten musical masterpiece? Who knows? <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, this movie captures the true spirit of the 19th century Venice. Women's elegance, sand loungers, their neck-knee swimwear, sunset glow and overall satisfaction with the world. While some may think that the pace is slow from time to time, the film has a general delicate quality, but there is glowing indecision among the two repressed people. Get ready for a sad and beautiful ending.
