"Captain Corelli's Mandolin" is in itself a fantastic film. It is not a book that can hinder your terrible followers. Yet the film itself is a masterpiece. The views are remarkable and the actor is not too bad! Nicolas Cage was brilliant in his usual hero type. Penelope cruz is great and really keeps the movie together. I think this movie has to be evaluated as an individual project that is not related to the book. Louis de Bernieres gave up the film script's rights, so the film is an interpretation by John Maddon. Go and watch this movie with an open mind - you love it; because below is the story of love and war.
