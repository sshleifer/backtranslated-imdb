I've attracted this movie interestingly because I saw it at Showtime in the early 80s. I say strangely, because it's rather a ridiculous fluff with a soft heart, a genre that I don't particularly care about. The dialogue is a bomb attack and a pointlessly philosophical (undoubtedly thinking only of its French-Italian producers) and the plot is completely out of the question. What it does is a wonderfully hypnotic and thoroughly pleasing mood. Landscapes (beautiful Philippines), soft focus nudity, and wonderful scores contribute to a strange and highly observable exercise in a movie that is rarely seen today. It's really one of my "innocent pleasures". I was fortunate enough to find this old laser disc and I looked at it more than I thought it was healthy. Valuable mood.
