Before watching this movie - clean your ears, take your eyes off and tell your girlfriend that you can't kiss you. He doesn't have to. This image will give you enough heat to keep your relationship long enough. If you are a Jewish / Russian / Ukrainian / immigrant - yes, then what a popular-movie minority will ever - laugh at your memories. If you are anything else or whatever you are, laugh at the importance of friendship and family. This movie, nothing seems strange, if it is weird. However, I fear that few will see this movie because it is not what people watch when watching movies. But please, do it for humanity and don't forget to get a soundtrack for entertainment.
