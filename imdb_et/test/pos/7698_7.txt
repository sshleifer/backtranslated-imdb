"Basketball Sally" plot is a normal melodramatic stuff - orphan, rich rich - but the movie rises for most silent people thanks to three people: <br /> <br /> This is not, of course, DW Griffith's masterpiece, but it shows its film-making Savvy i with full maturity. He uses all of his innovations, which are now self-evident techniques: close-ups, cross-sections, a mobile camera, and the ability to transform theater into exaggeration into cinematic finesse. <br /> <br /> W. C. Fields also present their skills - not their signature, but their remarkable skill as a physical comedian. He does some inventive juggling actions, cut too short to be fully appreciated, and some very empty pocket preferences, but it seems that every hand in hand is manipulated with a comic - hat, cane, car roof, dog, cash. He has seen joy. <br /> <br /> Finally, Carol is Dempster. There has been much talk about this actor, but his performance here is also comical. She was 22 years old at the time, playing a teenager and her approach to the role is a combination of grace and inconvenience that may not be completely convincing, but she really deals with the eye when she is on the screen - especially when she dances. She is not a beauty - although she is positively luminous in one scene where she is a talmy sister as she is, but she just adds Sally's character, especially in many moments when she shows a very obvious affection for the fields her guardian / "father." Few, if any, Hollywood performers could compete with the Fields comedy, but Griffith gives her leading woman all the chance to match her co-star, and Dempster has absolutely her own.
