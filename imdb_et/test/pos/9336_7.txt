In 1983, Michael Jackson's popularity was that when he wanted to make a "US werewolf" team with a $ 1 million horror music video and Vincent Price, he did just that. Never has such a music video made such a feeling before or after ... when it appeared on VHS, this 13-minute short of the world's biggest selling music all the time. But the probability is that you already know this, because whenever there is a list of the biggest music videos of all time, it almost always takes the top. <br /> <br /> It starts with Michael Jackson, walking in a dark street with a date after a car break. He explains to him that he is "not like the other men" (the right of the devil) and then the full moon appears behind the clouds. His girlfriend is standing there and shouting and screaming, and then screaming somewhat, at the very transformation stage, when Michael Jackson becomes a werewolf. He drives him through the forest, catches him and we ... cut the cinema. Ah, it all just happens in a movie that Michael Jackson and his date are watching. <br /> <br /> So we are five minutes and still have no sign of "Thriller". Extravagant, much? Anyway, you need to know how it goes here ... dancing, singing ... cemetery ... Vincent Price ... zombies ... "What's the problem?" ... then end credit. Stop credit for friggin music videos. "Thriller" is not one of Michael Jack's most memorable songs, but even according to today's standards it is a bitch of visual experience. If you have not seen it as a whole, then you will soon have to come soon.
