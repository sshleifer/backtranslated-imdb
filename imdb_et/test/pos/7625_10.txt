If an Indian wise man said, "First they laugh at us. Then they hate us. Then they fear us." Know that yes this movie's budget was a bit behind, but even then your story will still take our interests many years later, no matter how it has been seen. But soon you know, Masten Thrust will come back to the big screen in time. Then he and the new transformed T-Rex will start to shock you more. It scares many centuries! This movie is in pre-production and there is nothing you have ever seen before! <br /> <br /> It is outside the THX format ..... in 4-DX format. <br /> <br /> "Don't be afraid, don't be afraid!"
