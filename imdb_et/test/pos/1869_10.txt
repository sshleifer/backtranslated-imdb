I was a big fan of this series. Yesterday I looked at it again on DVD. I was worried about whether you were laughing or not? However, in some episodes I smiled hysterically and some episodes were good. Reasonable Rakesh Bedi (Raja) & Satish Shah are brilliant, while Swaroop Sampat is a common bad, but I think he does the job done. Perhaps she could have used a better actor to show her what a good, clean comedy is. <br /> <br /> If this series had reached the air in the current year, I would have given it 9/10 and think this series is almost 25 years old and its comedy is still good. 10. I would highly recommend this series for DVD viewing.
