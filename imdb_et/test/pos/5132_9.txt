Hoot was terrible. The owls are divine and the film highlights an interesting environmental issue that I did not know. Florida is full of so many fun characters and the movie makes it the screen. My kids especially loved all the different animals, from snakes to owls to alligators. This is really a simple story, but also what they have to hear at this age. When children are young, they really develop their sense of value, and one of them must be caring for our environment and all beings living in it. I think it was nice that the film even made conversations with them at home and how to help them. It was just really cute and lasting to hear how my little girl was talking about how to save her baby birds. Anyway, it was usually a great time and I would recommend a movie to anyone looking for something fun and meaningful.
