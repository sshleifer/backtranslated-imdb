I have seen some of Mr Boorman's films and they didn't like much. Not that they are bad films, on the contrary, are good movies, but not the content I personally entertained. But I think where the Heart is, although it is made to satisfy less than the Savvy American audience, it is masterful as satire and as a social commentary when it was made. I had to replace this movie at least one and a half times in my collection, because every time I know that someone I know can appreciate its artistry at all levels, my copy can't come back to me, lol. The last time it was printed for VHS sale was 7 years instead of replacing it, never made a DVD that I know, and I had to wait until one of the premium cable TV channels was recorded again before. <br /> <br /> My favorite aspect after the nail-on-good social commentary is Timna Woollard's paintings. I've been looking for 15 years to find someone or somebody who could take me to where his work is available. Or better copies of the paintings in the movie without ending. There is a room in my house where I dedicated copies of my paintings, and nobody seems to know if he has ever released a coffee table or a video aquarium or documentary about his work. If anyone knows where I can get any copy of Timna's work or if her studio is in England, please contact me by email.
