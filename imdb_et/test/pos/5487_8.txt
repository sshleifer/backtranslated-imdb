Back when I was a working person, I remember having a really terrible client who had to deal with it, who demanded everything in person. I told him something that my office could do and could not do, and he firmly believed that I personally earned him what was rightfully his. I swear, but I was thinking of this man when I looked at John Malkovich and Clint Eastwood in their brainstorming. <br /> <br /> On the fire route, Clint Eastwood will be serving as a veteran secretary at work in Dallas as a young man when John F. Kennedy was murdered. Her doubts have been since then and they have been given a drink and her life was real at the same time. He has now reached the details of the White House and as a potential assassin knight to his tenant secret service, Eastwood and partner Dylan McDermott, who are pulling this case. <br /> <br /> But the assassin is not an ordinary crank case. He is a professional at his workplace, trained and used by a central intelligence agency. John Malkovich earned the award-winning Academy Award nomination for the best supporting actor. He lost this year to Tommy Lee Jones for The Fugitive and I'm not sure, but I thought Malkovich was better. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, Malkovich was better, but he saw Eastwood as an agent in return for his apartment entry and he insisted that the whole thing be personal. He calls Eastwood's entire movie and condemns him. And after a while, Malkovich says and makes Clint real personal. <br /> <br /> Presidential assassins we have had in our history have been happy amateurs if you don't believe some of the conspiracy theories about some murders. A man like Malkovich, a professional who has a real or a perception, is the most dangerous enemy. <br /> <br /> The others you notice are Fred Dalton Thompson as Chief of the White House (and would be a real-life president), Rene Russo as the second agent to fall down to Eastwood's masculine charm, John Mahoney as head of the secret service Gary Cole White House Head Secret Service, Gregory-Alan Williams as Second Agent and Jim Curley and Sally Hughes as President and First Lady. <br /> <br /> But when Malkovich is, he has a fire. He and Eastwood's climax are unforgettable.
