Original Movie lovers may actually love this example if they just complain all the time. <br /> <br /> The Emperor's New School brings out some old jokes from the movie, like pulling an episode between Yzma Lab and Kuzco. But because it's kids, it's just classic and is in the right place. While the style is much easier, animations and characters keep their personalities very well and actually surprised me. Eartha Kitt makes an excellent voice for Yzma and J.P. Manoux makes an amazing work with Kuzco's voice instead of David Spade, who played Kuzcot in the movie. Great plots, fun moments and the amazing appearance of Kuzco make this exhibition worthwhile. (Just stop complaining!)
