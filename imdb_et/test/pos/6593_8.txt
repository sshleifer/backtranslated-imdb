I also watched it at the Petersfield Hampshire Junior School in 1975. The odd thing is that I occasionally think about it (I'm now 40). lots of episodes 6?) was the identity of a motorcycle rider! â€œI asked my friends about this series in the past and they have no idea what I'm talking about and I think his strange dream was. I've never understood the educational benefits of it until today, but I thought it was big, but a little scary. I think I remember that there was a break in the middle of every episode. No idea why. I'd like to see it again. The BBC Culture website became a short clip.
