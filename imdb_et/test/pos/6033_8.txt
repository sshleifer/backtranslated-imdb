It is not one of the best or smartest written Columbo movies, but the film is very well done, with excellent leadership and a truly subtle effect. <br /> <br /> Especially the operation of this movie attracts attention. Director Nicholas Colasanto did a great job with the filmmakers. He probably promised to play a lot of space for Peter Falk and John Cassavete, both being credited as unauthorized directors of the film. There must be a part of his leadership style to allow the participants a lot of space. It works very well for this movie. Perhaps he did it because Colasanto himself worked as an actor. He is best known for playing the role of coach in "Cheers", since its inception in 1982 until his death in 1985. <br /> So Peter Falk looks better than ever before as a college colleague. The veteran actor John Cassavetes also does a great job as a murderer movie and is a good lynx. Next to them is Myrna Loy. Big star in the silent film era and also in the early role of Pat Morita. <br /> <br /> But not only is the movie's operating guidelines really good. Visually and technically, this is also a really great movie with slow long shots without any cuts. There is probably also a reason why this movie is longer than most Columbo movies. It really takes time to create things and tell your story. The film also has some nice artistic and experimental shots. Of course, everyone is fit for the 70s. <br /> <br /> But as I said before, it's not wise to be one of the best Columbo movies. The hints left for the lieutenant are also a bit too obvious this time. It makes the murder terrible, as he didn't think his plan was good enough, while the character was obviously an intelligent man. This time, Columbo is trying to irritate the suspect and other signs, if he usually tries, to deal with crime. This and Peter Falki's different ways of acting are the reasons why his character may come as different as in other Columbo films. But a different one does not mean worse in this case. <br /> <br /> The film also has a pretty good musical performance with Richard DeBenedict, who then became a stable composer for Columbo's films. <br /> <br /> The great Columbo movie to watch! <br /> <br /> 8/10
