The reason I look at this is that the previous review was written by someone who walked out of this movie, not even halfway through. Unfortunately he was left with an amazing film of beauty. It was agreed that the film started very slowly, in fact my friend had slept briefly, I awakened him before snoring disturbed the rest of the audience. Fortunately, the film has evolved from love, drugs and what was young and free in the experimental 60s. A fantastic show of two rooms and a great look at the film that gave him real authenticity. Be patient, like many of the great movies you would expect, and there is definitely a movie I look forward to! 8/10
