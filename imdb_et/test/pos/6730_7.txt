So after years and years of watching this movie finally! I died to see how it lived in my memories. I clearly remembered the shots of the boy worshiping the mine, and I waited on two wooden plates that went to the bridge, just in the middle of the white face. This one-time blow was probably the coolest move in my childhood, remembering the rigors running behind me. Looking at it now, its obviously not as scary, but rather subconsciously strange to see the same images again. If someone wants a copy, a private message to me. <br /> <br /> The story itself is quite common in BCFF stuff. However, it is strange that this message is quite unclear this time - it has no real morality (except that "ghosts are here to help us?" Or "don't hurt the ghosts!") Greed / capitalist angle that desires the mine send. But the master's tremendous irresponsible act of encouraging these two children to follow the vague consequences of the ghost not only in the mine, but in a new mine, which is completely dangerous. The captain then encourages the children to climb large ladders, deep into the mines, just because he thinks the ghost wants them too. It's also a bit strange that a ghost chooses a boy to help trapped adults and not just help trapped adults directly. Oh well.
