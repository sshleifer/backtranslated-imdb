I really liked it. I know it is rampant, which is now the plot of the clich√© plot, and abundant, but it was a lot of fun for hell. <br /> <br /> In our quest for 70s and 80s horror cheeses, we have come across so bad that they are good. We also have some that are so good that they suck, and then we have some that are so bad that they are just bad. It's definitely so bad that it's good. <br /> <br /> Some teenagers who are traveling are somewhere in the middle of the 'oasis', not forgetting the slice on the roads in America, and they decide to control it. They cross every inappropriate line until it is absurd and pays for it. They pay dearly. <br /> <br /> I usually don't give this movie to 9, but girls are the type we miss between the 1970s: ditzy, scatily-clad and FIT. These are not anorexics of today's horrible horror. they see admirable shorts. <br /> <br /> I'll give her 9 out of 10 kids.
