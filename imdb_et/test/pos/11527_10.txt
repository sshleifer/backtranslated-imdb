I have to admit that this is one of Cameron Diaz's famous films and I was also surprised that he played an important role, but he was not leading. I had touched it very much, because I can really identify the pain of a losing one because I have experienced it from close places. <br /> <br /> Both Camilla Belle and Jordana Brewster were really good at depicting the protagonist Phoebe and I have to give it to the voters to find two actors who look so similar that I really thought they were sisters (in real life). This is one of the films Cameron did and not for the constellations. He looked at a part of this magnificent, rebellious hippie who wants to change the world, but sometimes he becomes a rebel without reason. > <br /> When you look at an uneven family where his only source of power is his great sister's faith, a little girl Phoebe is of course very upset when faith leaves Europe. When he grows up, he goes out in search of a nurse and gradually becomes a disappointment that touches the truth of his sister and falls to his sister's boyfriend. <br /> <br /> A great story and an equally great place to shoot. again.
