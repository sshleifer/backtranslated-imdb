While in the middle of last year there was dirty dancing on TV, I was out, so I couldn't see it, my mother swore that I saw it and that she was there on tape. Anyway, she couldn't find her video, so I bought her a DVD at Christmas, but she didn't look. He sat for a while, then one night I decided to look at the top floor and I fell in love with it. It's a great movie with lots of cute scenes! I love the plot and enjoyed it every moment! This is definitely not for everyone, but if you love the story of love, you will want to watch Dirty Dancing again and again! Dirty Dancing - The Way To Love Must Be!
