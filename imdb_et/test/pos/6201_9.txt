I do not understand why this exhibition did not go where there could have been different ways to continue on Darwin and Fariku after the 2nd season, apparently Darwin could not be infiltrated and sabotaged by UC agents, but still they should show this exhibition at least for another season. <br /> <br /> The exhibition is well cast, plausible and looks at Islamic religion from both a normal and an extreme point of view. This concerns in detail controversial issues and has a dramatic meaning, which can be said of very few today. I'm really sad that I didn't know about this exhibition until the end of 2007.
