Very memorable comedy. It's fun to see how many situations are evolving and, after a long journey, they are approaching this greatest eclectic collection of humanity (and the world's largest honky tonki) - the great American highway. Like "... mad, mad world", it has many modern talents, old boy politics, good comedy and dialogue. Unlike the goal, not the unwanted seekers, they have no idea what they really want when they drive along the great American route. Nor does it bear the weight of having a big fall man who will be saved by the big stomach-laughter at the end. However, the sequence of endless stunts is not remarkable, with excellent movie editing, humor and timing, and the metropolitan bank scene is fun and very original, working with very talented features. The urban fear of chaos leaves one feeling like a flight of a flight. The thrill is funny, but Honky Tonk Freeway deserves to be listened to and looked carefully, because it is surprisingly full of nuances and character reactions that are easily missed. All in all, a very funny reflection of who we were and we were, good or bad, and funny situations where we are in. It was just meant to be FUNNY and it is!
