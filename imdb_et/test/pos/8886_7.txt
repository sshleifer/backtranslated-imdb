Inspired by Hitchcock's STRANGERS, who speak of two men who exchanged murders in exchange for their disapproval, TRÜK MOMMA TRAINIST is an original and very inventive comedy. It is a credit to Danny DeVito that he wrote and celebrated in this little comedy. <br /> <br /> ANNE RAMSEY is the mother who inspires the title of the film and understands why she gets a sharp tongue under her DANNY DeVITO skin and inadvertently puts it down for any minor violation. BILLY CRYSTAL is a writer whose husband has stolen the idea of ​​his book and is now Lionized as a great new author, even if it appears on Opra's exhibition to rejoice. So DeVito gets the idea of ​​exchanging murders to get rid of these unpleasant factors. <br /> <br /> Of course, everything can happen if the writer Carl Reiner allows his imagination to go bare up with endless ideas about how the plot develops. And it's all the fun of the road, giving way to a lot of laugh and smiles, as well as lots of tension. <br /> <br /> For those committed to black comedy, this is guaranteed.
