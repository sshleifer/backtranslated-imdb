This film is about Xavier, an Erasmus exchange student from Paris who spends one year in Barcelona. During this time, it will make and grow with all new impressions. When returning, he has a much clearer picture of his life, and finally he gets it. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most mobile movies I've ever seen, and probably because I have been in a very similar situation. I am from Germany, not from France, and for me it was Madrid, not Barcelona, ​​but I can assure you that this film is a very accurate description of what you are doing in Erasmus in Spain. What I hear is an autobiographical story, and this is probably why it is so realistic. <br /> <br /> Let me give you some examples (light SPOILER warning) - Xavier shares the apartment with other students in Italy, Denmark, Germany, Belgium, Spain and England. The apartment looks like all the Erasmus apartments I saw in Madrid. The main characters are well-developed and some funny scenes stem from common stereotypes. The Spanish landlord is also 100% accurate. - The story of Xavier and his girlfriend Martine, who stayed in Paris, is also very typical. During the Erasmus semester (or shortly thereafter), about 90% of all relationships will be broken. - There's a wonderful scene where Xavier tries to convince Wendy, a particular companion from England, who is sort of "uncool" to go with others. Eventually he will succeed and Wendy will probably have his life in the evening. <br /> <br /> Another great thing about this movie is that it is really a trilingual: students in the apartment speak Spanish or English and Xavier speaks French mother and girlfriend. There are subtitles for everyone to understand what is being said. I certainly hope that this movie will never be given anywhere. <br /> <br /> I can imagine that for non-Erasmus people this is just a fun comedy, but all my companion Erasmus can only say: it's your movie! If you haven't seen it, do it. But be prepared for nostalgic feelings ... <br /> <br /> 10/10
