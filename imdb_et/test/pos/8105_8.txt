Once I got about 20 minutes of this movie in Turner classic films about 6 months ago. I thought every minute of what I was looking for was gold, and because it was somewhere in the middle of the movie and I didn't want to ruin the whole thing when I looked at it from the start, I decided to rent it right away. Well, in a video store that I didn't often get, there was no copy, so it took six months to finally go somewhere else and rent it. Before this experience, I only saw some of Chaplin's short pants, funny but not very sensitive, but after I saw a big dictator, I checked three of his other films, city lights, golden speed and modern times (the City of Lighting was great, I found Gold Rush is a bit overpriced but still worthwhile and I found that Modern Times is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen (the second more fun, behind Keaton's Sherlock Jr., more specifically.) Finally, the whole dictator, frankly they had both comedy and also drama moments, but these moments are not always well mixed, Chaplin's comedy was a well-mixed melodrama (city lights are the best example of this), but it didn't always work with social commentary. Plus, the reduction in dialogue reduced the impression of Chaplin's talents. this is a little consequence, I would have given him a definite rating on the 7/10 rating scale. If not the end. Yes, it is addressed to the 1940s times and morals, but its message fits perfectly in today's world. The call brought me tears and I find it one of the best end I've ever seen. Final Score: 8/10
