After the release of Snow White and Seven Dwarfs (1937), Walt Disney Productions has continued to produce high quality animated full-length children's films, many of which have still not been seen. "AristoCats (1970)", directed by Wolfgang Reitherman, was on the twentieth film on Disney's official canon and is a romantic musical comedy that rises around the family of aristocratic cats living in Paris, France, in 1910. Adelaide Bonfamille (expressed by Hermione Baddeley), does she love cat pets? including the Duchess (Eva Gabor) and her three young kittens? are the most important residents. When a swarming butler, Edgar (Roddy Maude-Roxby) learns that cats inherit the wealth of an old woman, he destroys pets by destroying them in a rural area far from the city. Lost and confused, the Duke and his children are introduced to the sweet jazz cat, Thomas O'Malley (Phil Harris), who agrees to show them their way home. <br /> <br /> "AristoCats" is not particularly remarkable, much earlier in Disney movies like "Snow White ??" and "Fantasia (1940)", which shows a similar or even higher visual style. But the story is interesting and exciting? especially for younger audiences, I bet? and the musical numbers I want more are terrible. For the sake of Trivia, I call my two favorite songs "Thomas O'Malley Cat" and "Ev'rybody wants to be a cat", the latter being a psychedelic setback to the end of the 60s, with a jazz band and delirious flashing colors led by trendy cats called Scat Cat (Scatman Crothers) . The family trip back to Paris is eventful and adventurous, and we meet friendly characters like Amelia and Abigail Gabble {two talkative horses}, Uncle Waldo {couple of drunken relative}, Georges Hautecourt {Mrs Bonfamille's ancient but creepy lawyer} and Napoleon and Lafayette (two twin dogs with a butler starvation).
