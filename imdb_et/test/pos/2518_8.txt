Drive was an enjoyable episode with a dark ending. In principle, a man and his wife are infected with their inner height by a great warfare emitted by some military equipment. Some of my episodes of this episode are the Mulder dialogue in the car and the scene where Scully goes with Hazmat's team and finds a small old Kurdish woman they thought was a virus. Of course, this is a realistic tragic one, because it leads the viewer to believe that they can really displace this plan, but when Mulder arrives, the man is dead. 8/10
