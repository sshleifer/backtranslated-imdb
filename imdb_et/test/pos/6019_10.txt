It's just one of my favorite music all the time. Bette Midler is on the screen as pretty magic, as someone in turn is the spooky, boss, brave and very scary mother of the Roma Lee. It creates a feeling of despair that is sometimes comical as well as tragic, but always real and quite beautiful. Such a charm and fear is indeed a cutting-edge woman without bounds. This limit has been discovered for children. Who in turn must own his dominant mother in the ruling world. <br /> <br /> This particular version is, as I understand it, a whole, including the brilliant choreography of Jerome Robbins, as well as the directions of the original stage.
