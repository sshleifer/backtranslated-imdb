Spock's description, an omnipotent flap with clutches falling on the company's team. It was one space that should have been avoided: the first Sulu & Kirk just disappeared; The landing party follows them on the surface of an unknown planet and encounters Trelane, a seemingly aristocratic man dressed in clothing for many centuries. But he proves someone or something beyond people and doesn't register for a McCoy medical tricycle. The officers are able to escape the ship, but like some bad cosmic pennies, Trelane continues to open. He takes them all back, including some female entrepreneurs, to continue their games. Dilemma is now taking out the elements of "The Most Dangerous Games" in Space and the complete helplessness of the team is an overwhelming, even scary aspect. A memorable result of the Campbell letter as a powerful but not all-encompassing alien. His character is obviously an early version of Q, which was introduced 20 years later by a TNG pilot. The Trelane confrontation scene with Spock stands out among all the strange dramas that open up. As usual, Kirk will quickly look for possible weaknesses in his new nemesis, even though he is quite old. The answers to exactly what Trellane is or what is in front of us are all the time, so if we understand the truth, it is perfectly reasonable for Campbell to work perfectly. He promises himself constantly, feeling a bit of an unknown audience, noting things that are infectious, but not quite right - we can't get stuck at first, but here's something missing. Every few minutes his tone turns dark and the team seems to be in serious danger. In a sense, you can't take his eyes off, always waiting to see what he's doing next. Actor John de Lancie struck a similar tone as Q in the next generation.
