My wife wanted to see this movie and went harshly. I've never been a big fan of the bio-region - believing that cinema is more exciting than it is structured in non-fiction. In addition, although I like Ray Charles music easily, I do not consider myself to be a fan of him or his music. <br /> <br /> I expected to carry it through the film or on the coast. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. <br /> <br /> This is an appealing story that is spoken in a classic cinema style. Reality is in nuances - the tilt of a character's head after a dramatic moment or their eyes in their eyes when they sing. I literally found it during this movie while watching it. <br /> <br /> Jaime Foxx, which has been said a lot, is leading not only the time, but also the creators of the ERA. , LIFE, never for those who were under forty, ever existed. This film sinks into the audience's era without Titanic's tricks and large panoramic photos or other periodic pieces of its ilk. This movie does not give you the 50s and 60s music scene, it takes you there. <br /> <br /> This is a movie about Ray Charles, but you appreciate it not only for his story life. It's a movie like "Saving Private Ryan" or "Schindler's List" that does what the movie should do - bringing you to the second place.
