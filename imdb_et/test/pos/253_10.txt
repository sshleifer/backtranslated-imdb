When I saw this movie, it reminded me of all the biggest dreams I had (mostly filled with robots). <br /> <br /> I can relate to Eledore's problems and have a similarity with Shiroga and it's a great movie to watch (if you're Goth who is bitter and eccentric like me!). All in all, check it out before it is printed!
