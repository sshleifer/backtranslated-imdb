This is a film about a six-year-old child in Maharashtra village (India) and his grandfather who come to treat Pune's (Maharashtra City) child's eye. here the grandfather knows that the child has cancer in both eyes and that they must be removed to save the child's life. the movie has everything about the main characters and their feelings and actions until the operation. <br /> <br /> The film is not an ordinary clich√©-indian film, so expect to see stories or romance or to see the melodrama. it is a highly designed, sensitive film, rather than a silent expression, above the top dialogue to get the point out. Recognize an event where the grandfather is told about the need to remove the child's eyes. the actor is great, the dialogues are broken by heart. your heart goes out to the grandfather, who has the inadvertent task of telling the child and the mother about the surgery. <br /> <br /> The object's handling has been great. the film was made by director Sandeep Sawant, who had to knock a lot of doors to collect R. six million (about $ 130,000) budget. even then, the final product appears to be polished and has proper production values. There is also a subtle contrast between the city village shown by the director, which includes some casual shots of the boy's life in the village. Sawant certainly seems to prefer village life. <br /> <br /> Everything works great. Amruta Subhash, because the social worker is competent, adds the necessary human touch to his role. Sandeep Kulkarni, if the doctor is big, shows the perfect way for the doctor. Ashwin Chitale as a child is natural. he doesn't seem to work. everything about him is natural and does not seem to be forced. <br /> <br /> But the grandfather is Arun Nalawade. he is amazing in his role. mere words cannot describe his work. it is a performance that must be cherished forever. <br /> <br /> Shwaas is a sincere effort to make good cinema. it should not be ignored precisely because it shows that when things are simple, the results can be very surprising. 10/10.
