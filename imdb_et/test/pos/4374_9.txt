Unfortunately, this is Carlini's last HBO concert lasting over 30 years. Although it may not be his "best" job, it is great, funny and thoughtful. This recording is also different from most of his other concerts, which is a bit longer than most of his other concerts. <br /> <br /> Throughout his long, fruitful and influential career, Carlin has moved more humor and funny jokes, towards a "humanitarian" position in society and culture. His focus on English and euphemism has grown over the years and has culminated at this stage. But I would say that his audiobook "When does Jesus bring pork?" best shows your great spirit in terms of language, euphemism and the division of our values. This is bad because Ya apparently shows her long transformation from a comedian to a writer. <br /> <br /> If you are offended by an unpleasant language or church failure, you probably don't like Carlin's upright material. However, if you enjoy mentally stimulated and language and blasphemy, you can probably enjoy this concert.
