I don't usually comment on movies because I'm in the movie, but I have to say it's one of my favorite films. Operation is fantastic and the script is even better. There was no cheesy speech or exploitation of disabled people to create a "movie" for Hollywood. James McAvoy is such a prominent actor, I couldn't look at him when I tried. Steven Robertson had also impressed me. I can't believe it's his first real movie. Brenda Fricker plays a small role, but as usual he is outstanding. It's a movie to see how happy we are all. If you like Awakenings and Mask, you will enjoy this story. You fooled yourself to control this movie.
