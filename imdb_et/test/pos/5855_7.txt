Cassie (Sandra Bullock) is a hyper-serious police detective. When a former boyfriend once tried to kill him and left him seriously wounded, he decided to bring those who harm others into justice. As a result of his death experience, Cassie also favors one-night views and does not trust anyone. One day a woman is in the woods near the Cassie community. He has been murdered, seriously beaten, and left alone to die. Of course, Cassie stops to find the murderers. His job is to be married to Sam (Ben Chaplin). Soon he will discover Cassie's relentless attitude and all-inclusive instincts when he asks him to take a sample that has been left out for analysis. They will soon be run by two high school students, Richard (Ryan Gosling) and Justin (Michael Pitt). Are these teenagers responsible for designing and implementing the perfect "joy" killing? This is an interesting movie, but viewers need to be warned that the subject is really gloomy. The killing of this "sport" is rarely the subject of "all sweet and light" films, and it is no different. This means that the cast is great. Bullock, without the clues of his comedy, is terrible as a cop whose own past forces him to lock the world into evil people. Chaplin is also pretty nice as a detective who is attracted to and powerful by Cassie. As for Gosling, he gives the most memorable result as a brilliant mind with a satanic soul. The film's production values ​​are also good, with fine fine costumes, settings, and photography. If you're a fan of Bullock's smile, it's not for you. But if you love mysteries, even those who have the worst plots, you'll find this story pleasant.
