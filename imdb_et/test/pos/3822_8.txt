Ah external borders. I love this example. It was surprisingly horrible or secret. I loved all the genres of the show from horror, thriller to mystery, regardless of genre, it was good. I think I had to start watching after the interruption when Sci-fi showed it again or played marathons. It was a really good show, I don't know everything about the seasons and everything, but I remember that every time I saw the freak of the screen and the voice of the TV say, "There is nothing wrong with your TV. Try to correct the picture" I beat with joy. It was a good show, and I enjoy it if it happens. I'll give her the whole 10 out of 10.
