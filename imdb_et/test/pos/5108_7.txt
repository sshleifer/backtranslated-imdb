Thirty years after the classic film of 1939, Robert Donat won an Oscar and made Greer Garson's star, "Goodbye, Mr Chips", before the screen of the music version, got a lot of problems. The original stars Rex Harrison and Samantha Eggar replaced Richard Burton and Lee Remick, who in turn was delighted - thanks to Peter O'Toole and Petula Clark. Andre Previn's score was rejected and eventually used - unfortunately - by Leslie Bricus. First-time director Herbert Ross was given the monumental task of making a simple love story - a man for both his wife and students - a big budget. The fact that it succeeds as well as many obstacles is a testimony to its two stars. <br /> <br /> Arthur Chipping is a Latin teacher at Brookfield, a boys' school in England, where he was educated. Introverted and socially wrong, he is dedicated to his students but unable to inspire them. Before the summer break, the former student will take the London Music Hall to see entertainment featuring Katharine Bridges, the young woman she hopes. The post-race meeting is inconvenient for everyone and Chips - as it is well known - is trying to explore some of Italy's ancient ruins. Unexpectedly, she runs to Katharine, who has booked a Mediterranean cruise to allow her time to mourn an unfortunate love affair and think about her career. Together with the time they spend together, he discovers some kind of gentle man under the invaded exterior and goes back seriously to return to London. When the autumn process begins, Chips returns to Brookfield with his young bride and two to a quiet home. Complications arise from the aspects of Katharine's past surface and again when they are affected by their lives during World War II, but Chips is reinforced by his wife's support and his new sense of security makes him a favorite among students. <br /> <br /> In addition to a couple of musical interludes - a pleasant music hall product number "London on London" and Katharine's Love Declaration "You and Me" - most of Bricusse's songs, some of them were spoken, when the characters of your emotions are easily forget and in no way enhance the film. Eliminate the score completely and "Goodbye, Mr Chips" is working dramatically. Terrence Rattigan's manuscript retains the elements of the original, extending it and renewing it for a few decades. She has created a number of scenes between Chips and Katharine, which embellish their commitment to each other, and put a few pictures of the comic relief of the real woman of Katharine's friend and cohort, actor Ursula Mossbank (amazingly played by Sian Phillips, O'Toole) ). He also hits life in a British public school that is a private academy equivalent in countries with perfect perfection. <br /> <br /> Ross is a very first-time director, freely moving the film into the fascinating moments - the sequence of opening credits during which the school's anthem is reflected in the school's large corridors, determines the tone of the film. Costumes and sets are valid for the period. Students represented by non-professionals at Brookfield School are doing well with their small supporting roles. <br /> <br /> The highest praise is for Peter O'Toole and Petula Clark. O'Toole has long been a first-class dramatic actor, so his Academy's award-winning competition is not surprising. Clark, about twelve B-movie veterans in the UK and last year's "Finian Rainbow", is an absolutely luminous music hall soubrette who surrenders to a theater teacher who is the spouse of a life school worker. His golden voice enriches his songs and lets you almost forget how big most of them are, and he fits more than O'Toole in his dramatic scenes. The chemistry of the two is felt and leaves us doubting that it is a couple in love. <br /> <br /> This version of "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" is not as classic as its predecessor, but it is hardly a catastrophe described by many critics when it was released. Ignore the score, focus on the performances and enjoy the atmosphere that Ross put on the screen. This is a pleasant way to spend a rainy afternoon with someone you love.
