There is something about real stories that makes them more interesting than fiction. I think this is the fact that the truth has always been alien to fiction. Falcon and Snowman tell a real story about Christopher Boyce and his friend Daulton Lee. Boyce (Hutton) is a former boy and intellectual, trying to find an occupation that can support and attract him. His FBI father can pull some strings and get his idealistic son's job in the Ministry of Defense. Boyce has little responsibility and seems to be satisfied with drinking and moving around with his colleagues. But as time goes by, Boyce begins to learn the ultimate secret information that makes him question the morality of his government. Idealist Boyce will soon see the illegal operations carried out by the CIA everywhere in Australia. Finally, Boyce decides that he will leak some of the most secret data to the KGB. Of course, Boyce's mistake is the assumption that because the US is doing bad things, the USSR is a good man. Over time, Boyce and his drug addict Lee (Penn) will sell their secret information to the KGB. What was once idealism becomes capitalism and espionage. The strength of this film is the incredible performances of Hutton and Penn. Although one of them starts with the best intentions, they will both soon find an infinite downward spiral. Great direction, music, everything. Not just a big movie, but one of my all-time favorites.
