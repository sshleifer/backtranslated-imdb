I look at Lackawanna Blues every time it comes. It brings me back happy times. I grow up in a big city in the west. It reminds me when I was a child, although my situation was a bit different, it seems the same. It makes me wonder if everything we ever know about the family is gone. The great mother of the day is under 55 years old. Do they know what is the inspiration for others. I hope I was not the only one who loved this movie enough to associate it with my past. Music was great in this movie. I really felt that it should have gone to the theaters I would have paid for it. When I was watching the movie the second time, I was wondering who the movie was in life. He did an excellent job of writing and producing this film. I guess who better prepares a movie based on something other than your life. As soon as I get, I get a copy for my home use. I always enjoy black producers or directors who feel that such a movie feels like you actually lived on time. Thanks for this great movie.
