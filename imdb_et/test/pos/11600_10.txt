Many Europeans and Americans seem to see Indian films for the wrong reason; I see some people complaining that this film did not have a dance series! Bengal films are more realistic than their Hindi counterparts. Rituparno Ghosh is one of the best young directors in India, widely known for his choice of films and the strength of his scripts. Chokher Bali is a great example. The faithful adaptation of the Nobel laureate Tagore's novel, which deals with the sexual pleasure of the Bengal widow, gives the director a new dimension to much recognized and controversial work.
