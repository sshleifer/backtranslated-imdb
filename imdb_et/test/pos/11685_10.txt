The rise in punk music was hardly documented on the film and most people tend to focus on events in other cities such as London or New York. Penelope Spheeris managed to maintain the '79 -'81 Los Angeles snapshot, proving a lively and diverse art / music community that had rivaled any other. Some have bands like those who are now legendary American punk; Black flag, X, round hare, germ, fear. Purists say that vital bands were missed (Weirdos, Zeros, Flesheaters) and that the film was the cause of the attack on suburban poses and macho violence. However, the issues discussed in the film remain relevant, the intensity of the music remains unbalanced and the impact continues to be seen and heard by clicking today.
