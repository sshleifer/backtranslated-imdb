Finally a real horror movie. It's the first time I had to cover my eyes. I'm a horror buffer and I recommend this movie, but it's pretty expensive. I'm not a big wrestling fan, but Kane pulled out the whole monster thing. I have to admit that I didn't want to see this movie, my 17-year-old pulled me into it, but I'm very glad I did. During and after the movie I watched my shoulder. I have to agree with others that it is enough that the whole remake horror is enough. I think this is the reason why this movie gives good comments. It's a refreshing change and takes you back to Texas Chainsaw (first), Michael Myers and Jason. And not CGI.
