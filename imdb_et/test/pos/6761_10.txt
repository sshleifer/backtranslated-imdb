This movie is a more fun Danish movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The plot is funny, surprising and extraordinary. Danish humor is different from others and it gets you every time. The whole audience laughed 90% of the time ... it was incredible. The characters are so well played and two actors, Mads mikkelsen and Nikolaj Lie Kaas, are playing their best ever! <br /> <br /> I would love to watch this movie, you won't regret it, believe me: -)
