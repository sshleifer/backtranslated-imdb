A sweet, rich valley girl develops an abyss in the bunker and if her snobby friends don't praise her, she is forced to choose between her heart and popularity. A very funny romantic comedy mixes the elements of black comedy and 80's cheeses, making it even more fun to watch. The film not only follows the life of the valley girl and his punk; but also his friends when they go to the store, party, season and mall. If the dialogue does not see a smiling weekend, then music. Songs like "Johnny, Are You Queer?" has been found all over. Also, Elizabeth Daily's funny existential nature and Prom King & Queen call at the end is fun!
