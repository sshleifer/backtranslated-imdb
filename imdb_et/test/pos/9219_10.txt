I watched this movie as a child and still enjoyed watching this nostalgia factor. When I was younger, I loved the movie because of entertainment and interesting characters. I still love symbols today. In addition, I think of a higher respect for the plot, because now I see morality and symbolism. Rainbow Brite is by no means the worst movie, and although outdated, I'm sure I'll show it to my kids in the future when I have kids.
