There are very few movies that are capable of so many levels as well as Mishima: living in the four chapters of such a complex story to say. One of the most difficult aspects of narration is the ability to play back and go without losing the speed of the movie. Not only does this film blink back and the fourth with the greatest lightness, it also flows through some of Yukio Mishima's greatest stories. This film transcends every aspect and is a pleasure to watch. Not to mention the incredible Philip Glass Soundtrack.
