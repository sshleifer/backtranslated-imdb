This early film by future goremaster Lucio Fulc is a great addition to the giallo sub-genre. Located in rural Italy. Add some familiar characters to a mix of giallo cinema fans? madwoman, newspaper reporter, ineffective police, sexy siren, priest, girl, lonely slow motion, etc. It is one of the best thrillers of the 70s in Italy. <br /> <br /> In the unusual case of Giallo, the victims in this case are young boys, making a change from the more typical dangerous corners of women. The fact that this is a child who is a maniac target is just to make things a little uncomfortable. Fulci pulls the envelope a bit here and goes even further in a glorious surprise dishonest situation where a young boy is subjected to a somewhat inappropriate attention of a sexy naked young woman (Barbara Bouchet), whose task is to drink. He shows himself openly and actively invites young people to him; asks him if he wants to sleep with him. Although he has clearly played with him, it is still a rather unusual scene. True, there are one or two inadvertently funny dialogues, but it is very well photographed and Barbara Bouchet has a high self-confident sex appeal. Separate scene. Even if you feel it a little wrong, check it out! <br /> <br /> With Barbara Bouchet, another standout is Florinda Bolkan, who plays madwoman, accused of killing children. He is not directly responsible, but the viewer has decided whether his black magic may or may not be the next death game. Whether it's hunting and chained, the car radio explodes for rock music. This scene is very strong and unpleasant. Its outrage shows the way that Fulci's career goes on. <br /> <br /> Despite the visceral effect of the above-mentioned murder, it may be a little surprising that other killings are either bloodless or dedicated to the screen. The only other death image that is comparable to a lynch mobile is the end of the killer at the end of the movie, although this sequence is kind of stupid. The plot is twisted and red herring, although I personally found the killer's identity somewhat predictable. However, this weakness is less problematic for later viewing? Like most gialli, do not torture the duckling is extremely traceable again. <br /> <br /> Technically, is the film well done with impressive camera work, solid actor and effective music by Riz Ortolan? especially good is the repeated unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like a distant mountain. Fulci obviously made more graphically violent horror films, but here he has a somewhat more modest material talent. It's still a wild stuff and it's highly recommended for giallo cinema fans.
