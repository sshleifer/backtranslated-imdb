I remember this movie in 1984 when I was 6 years old (you are doing mathematics). I loved it completely. I was in Tarzan for 2 weeks after I saw it (climbing furniture, jumping to make monkey sounds). It started to fascinate Tarzan and the monkeys, but strangely, the long lasting love for Christopher Lambert (remember that I saw Highlander very soon after that). 1984 was the last time I saw this movie until about a month ago. It happened with a cable when I was in bed at 3:30 pm and though it was late and I was tired and I was working at 9:00 am, I missed the movie I loved like a child. <br /> <br /> When I saw it, I realized that it wasn't such a big movie and even a odder that Andie MacDowell's voice was dubbed by someone else. Of course, Ian Holme was sure, as usual, and surprisingly, the monkey still fits in, but the most surprising was how good Lambert was Tarzan. He was great! The depth he managed to capture with so few lines, his primary body language, and most importantly his ability to bring this character through his very large ship was just amazing. <br /> <br /> As I have said before, I'm a Lambert fan, but I'm used to Highlander, The Hunted, and Fortress. In this film he was really quite good and it is a shame that he never got the chance to characterize that depth again. <br /> <br /> So for a short story too long I was a little disappointed that the movie wasn't so good, but I was glad to see Lambert was good and I wouldn't regret letting it stay until 06:00 to see it.
