I give it to 10 out of 10, not because the plot was hard to detect because it wasn't ... but because it leaves one of the characters looking after it. Acting by actors is great, especially Joan Hickson, and it's a wonderful episode because of this heart. <br /> <br /> Miss Marple is summoned by Jason Rafiel's deadly request to investigate and solve the murder that happened about seven or eight years earlier, and she has to find out who, why and when she goes. Mr Rafiel is the same as Rafiel, which was in A Caribbean Mystery, and so there is an idea here. <br/> <br /> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is definitely among us amateur psychologists, and if you are one of those who are satisfied with just a lot of blood, guts and blinking action sequences, then you don't like it. But if you're like me, who loves knowing about people and discovering what makes them wet, Nemesis is what is for you.
