It is a very moving film that takes a new twist somewhere where we have all been: a relationship that is about to end. Kristen Thomson's performance at Tessana, desperately trying to link her with Bobby in just one day, is extremely convincing and moves and takes you straight. Who has not completed the relationship and at least wanted to tear: "Just another night!" If he gives him another night, then the path that these two people share will make you stop and think about how valuable any truly close relationship can be and how everyone - whether permanent or not - should be treated with respect rather than just thrown away .
