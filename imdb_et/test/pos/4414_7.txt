In many ways, this film defines everything I love about cinema in terms of capturing the moments of these strange, difficult to understand, unattended truths. In other ways, this is undoubtedly an amateur, unreasonable result when junkies themselves fool around with the camera. Ultimately, it goes somewhere between pure shine and unseen (fortunately, much more than the first one). Some of me want to reward this for the sake of this absolute innovation and pure sublimation moments, but at the same time I cannot completely ignore the sometimes terrible "acting" and openly bad production values. Initially, editing seems mostly sloppy and unnecessarily distracting (or maybe simply "innovative"), but after a while I got used to what is ultimately a sign of whether or not the film succeeds on its own terms. I think this answer summarizes my all-around feelings about the film. This means that, despite being ignorant, it is very good overall. And if nothing else, such a movie really shows how wrong and understandable the faux-documentary film, the shaky-cam style can sometimes be when it is so obviously applied purely (for example, in films like the otherwise admirable Roger Dodger). Here the aesthetics are obviously due to the needs of the filming situation and are not simply used arbitrarily to make it "cool".
