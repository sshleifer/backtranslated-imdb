Another enjoyable Warner flick. I really liked John Garfield, although I don't know why Cagney wasn't in that role. Maybe it was too similar to ANGELS, WHO HEIGHT? I mean, this is another Dead End Kids story, but I really appreciated them here and this movie had a nice comic touch with some good serious drama. Boys work great with Garfield. The nice order was the whole "swimming" scene that starts without caring but breaks too close to the disaster. As a detective, the fine actor seemed to be a whore as a nun.
