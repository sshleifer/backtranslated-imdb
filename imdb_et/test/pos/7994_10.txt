I always thought that Batman's return was a great success for Batman. The story was interesting and Danny Devito, Christopher Walken and Micheal Keaton performed great performances. Plus lets face, Tim Burton was a genius and made the comic book more justice than Joel Screwmacher ever did. <br /> <br /> Plot: Oswald Cobblepot also knows Penguin (played by Danny Devito) to deform his parents as a child. He uses it as a pretext to mask a happy plot to rob Gotham's first-born children with his red triangle gang and very shady dick Max Shreck (played by Christopher Walken). Later, Max Shreck becomes Penguin Mayor of Gotham. Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) is out of Max Shreck's window and cats are reviving. Later he develops cat-like features and tries to destroy Max Shreck and Batman. His reasons for destroying the dark knight are not explained. <br /> <br /> Opinion: Batman Returns is classic. It is darker in the atmosphere. Tim Burton always had the opportunity to make dark backgrounds attractive. Micheal Keaton is still sharp as Batman. Danny Devito steals the exhibition as Oswald Cobblepot / The Penguin. If you think about it, he would have done a better offense for Spawn than John Leguizamo. Michelle Pfeiffer gave Catwoman more personality than Halle Berry ever. Max Shreck is one of Christopher Walken's best roles. The main reason I like Batman Returns is that it is fun. Its not only creative, but also fun. There are a lot of great budget movies these days. The Batman series goes to the dogs after Tim Burton decided to do more. You don't believe me, look at Batman Forever and Batman and Robin. Thanks to God, Christopher Nolan breathes into the Batman start series.
