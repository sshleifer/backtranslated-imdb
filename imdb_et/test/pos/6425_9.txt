A very insightful psychological thriller! Footprints is a stylish example of a 70s powerful Italian movie. And Luigi Bazzoni, a misguided director and a visually amazing auteur. The film develops its unusual plot with an incredibly intermittent atmosphere and never loses, especially its sad and dramatic final! Florinda Bolkan delivers excellent performance, rich nuances and sensitive sensitivity, capable of depicting a dark lady who is not only exciting but also painfully real and tragically lonely. Lila Kedrova, Nicoletta Elmi (mysterious boy on the beach), Italian screen legend Caterina Boratto and amazingly beautiful B movie Queen Evelyn Stewart with a short but haunting role of the protagonist's friend! And Klaus Kinski surprisingly disturbing home! It's unique when you notice how incredibly well-made movies like Footprints were! Vittorio Storaro's moody and creepy cinema, stylized places and kits, the ghost result of Nicola Piovan and, above all, the story, so intense and distracting, so intelligently layered and structured! A thriller with fantastic elements, especially with soul and personal vision. I want movies like footprints not forgotten! I want movies to be more sharp and personal in the 60s / 70s! And yes ... I wish someone will make this small masterpiece soon a digital remastered wide screen DVD!
