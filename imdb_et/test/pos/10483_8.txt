At the end of the last century, Stephane Audran is the name of a beautifully measured study by a small Danish community. Two beautiful and musically talented sisters gave up their luck and marriage prospects to see an aging father. One day, a French woman, Babette, will work for them. After a few years, he wins the lottery and has decided to do something for those sisters who have taken it. His solution is to prepare a subtle and gorgeous party that will change the lives of all those who are invited. It is a film about human and cultural exchanges that is reflected in the changing language of dialogue between Danish and French, especially between the conscientiousness of Protestant Northern Europe and the sensitivity of the Catholic South. It also concerns the needs of the people and how the warmth and goodness can be expressed and stimulated through the growth of mood. Deeply exaggerating film.
