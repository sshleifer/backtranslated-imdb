SPOILERS Edgar Rice Burroughs' famous character was adapted thousands of times for a screen that has been deleted, especially for the thirties and forty years by Hollywood. Its producers made Tarzan one of the most successful cinema signs. Several years later, Hugh Hudson decided to make a more ambitious version of the monkey man, and that is more natural, wild and ground-breaking Tarzan, which he gives away. Hudson cleverly avoids the clich√©s you usually give to Tarzan, like his famous scream or his friendly pet, Cheetah. Not only are we far from the character created and invented by Hollwood, but we are also far from the film used to make his stories. The film was made partly in Africa (more specifically in Cameroon). The film introduces two obvious parts: the first in the jungle, where Tarzan lives among his adoptive parents, monkeys, and sees himself as his master. But he ignores his true origin. Another in England where Tarzan discovers English society. Ian Holm is a link between the two parts and Hudson avoids all that could make the film ridiculous thanks to a wise scenario. Indeed, Holm teaches Lambert basic rules to behave correctly in English society and the result works. In the second part, nobody ever laughed at Tarzan and he is even really welcome. Finally, it is both a bitter and a happy ending. Happy because Tarzan comes back to the jungle and meets his adoptive parents again. But also bitter, because this home-making means that the Greystoke line is not guaranteed and he's gone missing ... Christophe Lambert finds out here, his first (and last?) Big role. Unfortunately, he is never equal to the achievement in this movie and he plays in poor and quiet movies. However, as I said earlier, there is a smart scenario, a rare quality performance, some impressive natural landscapes (both jungle and English and we get a great movie. It's also a popular novel reading. Was it just barely (6/10) )?
