A man who knew too much is a remake of Alfred Hitchcock, a film of the same name, made in England in 1918. In my opinion, his later efforts are much better. Many critics and fans of Alfred Hitchcock claim that the remake is mediocre and has no original vertebrate tension with Peter Lorre. In both films the plot is essentially the same, except the original is in Switzerland and remake in Marrakech. It talks about the couple {James Stewart and Doris Day} who is resting with his son and meeting a suspicious person who is very curious about their past. It just happens, he is an agent who is looking for a couple who is tied to a plot to kill a world leader. Then he hit the Marrakech market because he learned he was a spy and he went into Stewart's hands. He dies, tells him the whole story of the plot of murder. Stewart and the day find that the other couple they met were the spouse the agent was looking for and kidnapped his son. The film includes a straight dramatic role in Stewart and the great performances of the day, as worried and frightened parents. This film proved that Doris Day can act in both alternating dramas and in a carefree musical. Alfred Hitchcock's direction is top-notch. The film keeps you at the edge of your seat every minute. The scene in Albert Hall is classic. The original is so slow and drab. I don't know how people compare these two. Just look at the remake and enjoy it. I give the movie from 9 to 10.
