I love this example. It is smart and worked very well. David Morse and Andre Braugher have great chemistry. Writing is wise and sub-blocks generally give great comics. After every new episode I am always surprised at how this idea is provocative and at the same time entertaining. My only complaint would be the absence of Donna Murphy at this time in the second season. Like David Morse's former husband, Heather, he added this character to the exhibition. <br /> <br /> I think this show is a credit / drama genre credit. That said - I can't figure out why my exhibition is so low for my life. Would anyone who would show it show 1 rating with criticism?
