This film works on many different levels. This is the profile of one very cool couple, social comment on aging and nursing homes, love story, musical. I have sometimes seen Uncle Frank and every time I look at it, I'm not sure who to call first - my parents, my wife, a friend I have lost. . But it has the opportunity to change the most important relationships in your life - and you want to reaffirm those that continue. Expect a lot of laughter, and probably some tears if any of the characters living here hit the chord. I'm pretty sure they're doing it.
