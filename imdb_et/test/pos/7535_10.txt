I think this movie is underestimated. It felt like fresh air to me. Some people complain about the unreliability of the plot, the longer sequences and the lack of sex (the latter, in my opinion, is the 'main reason for the improbability' and how drunk teenagers are not messy?)); but it's not just their thing and good for them if they can't relate the story. The performances are great; I would really like to see more movies in other movies. Emotions are genuine. The whole thing about the failed love is hidden. And it gives you a sensitive feeling that you're looking for a good movie.
