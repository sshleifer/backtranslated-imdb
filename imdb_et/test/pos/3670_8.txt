Yes, at times, "unconditional love" amazes when it bounces - not as it is ricochets - on one element of the element in the most unusual use of thematic elements and signs. In fact, I only started when I watched the film for the second time that I began to understand what I think P.J. Hogan could have done this peculiar, unusual flick. Perhaps the whole film itself is a metaphor for unconditional love for which Grace (Kathy Bates) is waiting and describing the film later. Grace insists that unconditional love is precisely that without conditions and without qualification. So with this in mind I looked again at "unconditional love". I laughed much more than I did for the first time, I was more involved with the characters, sometimes I started to understand, the absurd thing the story was about. The performances are often up, but no more than they have to fit in with Hogan's strange and dirty vision, the vision that led me to tears, longing and outbursting laughter outbreaks. Yes, Hogan asks a lot about his audience. But I really loved one of my films - unconditionally.
