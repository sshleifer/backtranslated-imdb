It may be wine talking, but it may be the best movie I've seen for a long time. Allowed to spend most of the first half, I wondered what the hell was going on, but when I agreed that I didn't understand everything about the subtitles, I could enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> I hate a movie where the workers become a bird flock who is overwhelmed by the enemy? What characterizes the development of character with the lesbian alien princess whose people built the pyramids? Why does Buddha wear seriously flattering diamond earrings? Whether any of this issue is faced with visual manifestations and humor of the characters. Every battle from my heart was won when I saw the main protagonist dressed as a spider - awesome! Many people complain about the lack of cohesion, but a fun movie of laughing with couples can't do better, especially when you do every time someone says "I love you 10,000 years".
