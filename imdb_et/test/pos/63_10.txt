This is really a great movie (after she has been able to ignore the Blake Edwards Pink Panther references she seems to be obsessed and very inconvenient). Julie is as usual, wonderful - sings and works great. I remember seeing it in the Odeon Cinema in Haymarket, London. But Julie didn't appear in the STAR premiere! was unfortunate and (apparently!) due to the filming of Darling Lili's aerial shots in Ireland. Reasonable apology when he appeared in some of these techniques, but he didn't. Two ticket office flops destroyed their film career for a few years. But Darling Lili, like STAR !, deserves much more public recognition.
