If you repeat the lie, will it be true many times? The journey of 15 parks is a story of an alternative reality of schizophrenia (Mith). The aim of the film is to search for a home in a fictitious address where his imaginary wife and 5 children live. Aparna Sen offers another masterpiece. Every movie actor was better than the other. Konkona Sen sees incredibly convincing schizophrenia. She pulls the role as lightly and as mature as her age. Shabana Azmi is incredible as usual. She plays a dominant and furiously independent Mith sister who takes care of her heavy sister and aging mother. He refuses to accept that, despite all his strength and courage, he still feels lonely. It should have been a very simple film for Rahul Bose. This role was the least demanding and everyone could have done that role. Timing the end of the movie took time. It left me confused and maybe even a little disturbed. But later it began to sink. My eyes are black. But when everyone says they are blue, do I believe his black?
