This is a skilfully designed cinema that deals with teenage boys' confusion about sexuality. Cut scenes can be long, but cinematography is beautiful. This film does not appeal to many people, especially those who are uncomfortable with gay teenage relationships, but people who are more open to it may be puzzled by the embarrassment of the protagonist.
