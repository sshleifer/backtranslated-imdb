I know what most people don't think about thinking about this movie ... "A typical movie from a famous singer ... It's a pink movie, a teenage movie, it's stupid ..." and things like that ... And yes, that's it. .. I mean, it's a pink movie ... But you know what? ... I loved it. Seriously ... This is a very romantic movie ... I think all the girls in this world have dreamed of something like "Popstar" plot ... Met her favorite singer, know her as a person ... and even romance with her .. right? ^^ I really enjoyed watching it ... In addition, it's really funny ... <br /> <br /> I think the actors did a great job ... There are many loving characters ... And Aaron Carter (JD ) is not an exception ... To be honest, I thought he would see it in the first five minutes that it was terrible ... But then he surprised me pleasantly ... <br /> <br /> I must also say that music performances on film are great! I loved this part when JD (Aaron) sings without music (guitar only) a very beautiful song ... This guy is really talented ... Time says ... <br /> <br /> My advice to you ... Look at this! Don't bias ;-)
