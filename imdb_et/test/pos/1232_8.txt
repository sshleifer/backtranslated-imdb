The film for which it was intended succeeded. This is a short tragic film. While my movie selection is the ones that really shape the characters and their relationships, this movie is just for taste, leaving you with the factor "what happens next". After that, I really looked more, more characters back to the story, what effects they had to make on the people they were. I think this is what the makers saw to think of the audience. Operation is amazing. There are not many features in the film, so their body language, facial expressions, and overall presence should have kept the scene. Both France and Miner have this element and it shows. For those (especially Franco) to do this, he probably says they believed in this movie and wanted to be separate from it and appreciated the movie for what it was. I am also happy to embrace it, so I can share it with other people who have never known it.
