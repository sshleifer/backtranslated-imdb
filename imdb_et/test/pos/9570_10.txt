This is the best film (so far) that Christopher Guest has created with his very talented ensemble forms. Previously, they had a great expectation for GUFFMAN and, after BEST IN SHOW, they made a very enjoyable A MIGHTY WIND. As for their last, YOUR OPINION, the less you speak better. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be a documentary on dog shows and especially on several competitors. You follow these pre-preparation preparations for a couple of selected dogs to a great night, where one of them is the best show in the fictional "Mayflower Kennel Club". But none of these people is a real show-man but a talent improvisation actor who parodies many of the ordinary people you meet in the exhibition world. Surprisingly, though the characters are quite extreme, the people they parody are a lot of truth - as I had decades ago, I had some experience with dog shows and this is a very bright group of people! The favorites of my dog ​​owners were the incredibly high pressure and the tight yuppie couple who just referred to anger and volatility. I also loved the gay couple openly because they were terribly funny and clever. The best performance was probably not a couple, but Fred Willard, who played the world's most stupid and less talented givers in human history. His comments were evenly disgusting and he was often betrayed as an incredibly silly person - how he could be said to be the preacher of such a prestigious exhibition. Other contestants were also very funny - a high-end professional woodcutter and its rich owner, a boy and his hound, and Winkie's "parents", who could barely catch up to show it. /> <br /> Despite the improvised style of cinematography, all the pieces fit perfectly together and a very funny and delightful story - not just for dog owners. Exceptional action made it one of the best comedies of the last decade. Smart and consistently funny. <br /> <br /> By the way, try to find it on the DVD because the attachments were really worth it. While I was a little hurt, I loved seeing Harlan Pepper and his beach ball collection!
