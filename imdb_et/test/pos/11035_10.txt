If it would be possible to enter 10+ ... this would be one movie I would like to choose. <br /> <br /> I remember this movie in many, years ago on television, and fortunately I made a video of it. Now my video is getting older, video technology is outdated and I'm starting to worry that I may not enjoy the joy of this movie for much longer. <br /> <br /> As a wildlife, it's great. As a film between man and nature, it transcends something before or after. How can the film industry go unnoticed and forget about such a classic? If such a thing as a lobbying / pressure group is to restart this movie, create me and send me the details of pronto. <br /> <br /> My guess is a coin made by anyone who can unlock it in today's market.
