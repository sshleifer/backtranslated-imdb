It's a plot-based movie and a lot of fun. Nothing surprising or original is inside the plot, but it is very important that it moves very quickly and therefore keeps your attention. I didn't really notice what I think is good. John Mills was good, but it seemed that he took all his steps, considering how his life had collapsed around him. He would burst his head, stand up 20 seconds later, dust himself down and continue as if something had happened. A little felt in a movie that has a strong story, authentic locations and a plot that keeps you steady until it finishes.
