I was 10 or 11 years old when this movie came out and it has been with me for 35 years. When the movie came out, all of St. Louis area theaters as a "decoy" pack of flower seeds with the name of the movie, etc. She read so many words on the back of the pack .... plant those seeds at midnight. When a white flower grows, it will be saved ..... but when the red flower grows, you are doomed !!! Suffice it to say that in the case of an eleven-year-old child, no seeds were planted, which may occur. Here's a spoiler: When a movie starts, you'll see a small toy tank moving in the dirt. The little family leaves the city and suddenly turns the camera back into the tank and it is full size. It rolls over the car and you can see the bloody limbs protruding from the wrecks, but the tank is again small. <br /> <br /> The reason why this movie stayed with me for so long was that I had a precise toy tank as a movie !!!! Unfortunately I do not know what happened to it, but I kept this thing carefully !!! <br /> <br /> Turn off the lights on the DVD, make a sandwich and watch this movie. It's very good !!!
