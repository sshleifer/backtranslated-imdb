Three children were born at exactly the same time, during the dead body. "Bloody Birthday" is a typical beginner of the 80s. It's a pretty average stuff with a lot of nudity. evil children never create any danger and there is almost no tension. "Bloody Birthday" is neither gore nor fear, but the film is a little entertaining. Unfortunately, there is no real explanation for the sudden mania killing of children. pretty harsh, for example, we have death with handgun, baseball, jump rope and shovel. So if you're a fan of the early 80s, look at it.
