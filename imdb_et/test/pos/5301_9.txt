Although Hayao Miyazaki's films have always touched me, they are remarkably prominent, with a simple animation in the background of creative images. Ponyo sticks to this formula, whose character is so divine that I would like him and the plus skin of the landscape so beautiful that it would not look like a frame as a wall. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I didn't enjoy as much as his last two large-scale publications, fascinated by the stranger and the city of movement. It was just too young a juvenile who got more to the kids and left the adults just to enjoy the animation. <br /> <br /> I was also disappointed that Joe Hisaishi, who is also the price of the above points, was the result. the two films mentioned were not nearly as memorable at that time. Although I can't quite remember Howl's score, I still remember that it's one of the most beautiful I've ever heard. Ditto Spirited's - although I only remember it is a very complementary movie. Perhaps this is because Ponyo is more of a juvenile fare, so the score is not so strange. In any case, this movie is still anime or Miyazaki fans.
