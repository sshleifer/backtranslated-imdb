This is probably the biggest war movie and certainly one of the biggest films. There is no sentimentality, no patriotic agenda, not even a promising message from the universal brotherhood in this dark glimpse of what we can only call. It is this silent rigor and the lack of manipulation that gives the film amazing power. There are no attempts to make the hero of Tamura, the protagonist of Ichikawa. He's just a badly dead juice that is trying to keep the horror in the world that is hoping, but he's not sure he can keep up with his humanity. The absence of Ichikawa's acute shortage and illusion makes fires alone in the normal state. Ichikawa died in February 2008.
