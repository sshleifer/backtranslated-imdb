One of the IMDb message center topics was the two women who spoke to Colin Firth about how they watched the movie just for him. Apparently these two young women were; but what hit me is when the audience is generally evaluated for this movie. Not only the audience, but the academy and most of the critics did not only notice the great performances of Michelle Pfeiffer and Jessica Lange. <br /> <br /> I think why. First of all, the plot - or actually the setting - the Shakespeare King Leah's deadly, crazy patriarch, and the girl of three hereditary daughters. Their names begin with the same letters, Regan, Goner and Cordelia - Rose, Ginny and Caroline. And I think "Larry" (Jason Robards) works for "Lear". Jane Smiley's vision of her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel was to tell the Lear story to her daughters, and to tell her a sort of realistic 20th century way Bard didn't have to consider. The problem is that the story of Smiley and Moorhouse is two older daughters with strong and weak points, while the father is the most despicable character without much redeeming qualities. His only strength was his ability to achieve financial success; we may even underestimate that because his father and grandfather built a farm before him and he inherited it. <br /> <br /> Another problem - and this is one that I personally can't prove, not reading the Smiley novel - is the film only a limited and partial interpretation of this novel. However, it is almost impossible that the great novel, especially the long and ambitious, with many psychological nuances, cannot be sincerely transferred to the screen. The film's vision and sound claims flood the story's nuances, while time constraints do not allow the full development of the character and motivation achieved by the novelist. After five or six hours, maybe Moorhouse could have made the movie Smiley better. The third problem is what Moorhouse alone is. He started his career with the very well-made Aussie film Proof (1991), where Russell Crowe played. He watches for American Quilt (1995), which marked women, especially women of certain ages. But it was a bit heavy and clearly and decisively a chick flick. In a sense, a thousand hectares will rise, showing us not only the perspective of women, but it will make it politically motivated for some. Larry Cook is probably a bad, bad dad. She beat her daughters and knew them. He ran into a household with a iron fist. Jess (Colin Firth's character) seduces inexperienced Ginny and breaks her heart more than a little fun. And then he goes to Rose, who is obviously behind the new owner, and connects with him, at the same time inviting him to end his life in a drunken accident. The rest of the men are one-dimensional in their nuances, how they often appear in novels. I think most audiences bumped into a hard-hitting incident, adultery, and sexual treachery. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I think the critics and the public are wrong. I think the direction was biased towards the men, but that story was supposed to be. I think Moorhouse did a good job of making an emotional and interesting film about family dynamics that was not too beautiful. And Pfeiffer and Lange's actions were not sensational. They looked at each other in a way that I found completely authentic and deeply moving. Especially Pfeiffer was riveting when he predicted his anger and hatred. The way Moorhouse was given to us gradually discovered the respect for the great performance of both the director and Pfeiffer. And the skills that Moorhouse led to the change of Ginny's character when he went ninny, as he himself called, someone who had self-consciousness and some understandable bitterness was also great. The fact that he left his wife was as shameful as anything else. He had to go and forgive and return. And Robards was also very good with his intensity and madness. <br /> <br /> I hope this movie, which was bombarded in theaters, will be better rated in the future when people see it on the DVD. My question is, what happened to Moorhouse? His talent is obvious, but he is still a director with his fourth feature film. If he doesn't believe he remembers what he believes, but also fair. I think he was fairly honest with the two leading character of this movie, but he didn't pay enough attention to others. Jennifer Jason Leigh's Caroline was unfinished, but did not dare to dad, leaving us wondering why he did what he did. And the men had to be more than mannequins. They had to be involved and involved.
