It happened just on television when I opened it, and because I felt too lazy to change the channel, I was watching it. The man was lucky. <br /> <br /> This film is rather a fairy tale as a demanding drama and sometimes openly sentimental. This is definitely what could be called a sensitive film and usually I find it boring or irritating. But this movie is so well done that I couldn't but love it. The script does not brain your brain; it is normal but flawless. The actors are great, everyone is perfect for this role. There are not many scores, but the music plays the movie nicely. <br /> <br /> If you appreciate things other than expensive pyrotechnics, malicious murders, or world recordings, check it out if you ever have a chance. 5/5
