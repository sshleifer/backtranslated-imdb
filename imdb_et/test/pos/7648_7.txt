Didn't know what to expect from this movie - and I was pleasantly surprised. I picked it up because I recently stumbled upon Norman Reed and tried to find more movies she's had. <br /> <br /> I am not a big movie or movie, but I have to say it roped me in a minute. Probably because I couldn't figure out exactly who worshiped it. This movie is stylish and fast paced, a story that is plausible thanks to location and fantastic performances. <br /> <br /> Although I was most impressed by the film, I have to say that Dagmara Dominczyk was just great. br /> <br /> Give him a chance - it's a really fun movie.
