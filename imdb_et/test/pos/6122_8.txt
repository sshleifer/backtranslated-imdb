For me, Pink Flamingos lived as a shocking, disgusting, reluctant, trashy film, according to my reputation, which I was expecting to contain everything except the kitchen sink. We are treated for almost two hours, which never lets up: rape, sex, sex chickens, transsexuals, castration, murder, cannibalism, and a terrifying display. It is a strange couple who will start a race with a family of trash bins trying to steal their title "live dirty people". Divine (fat boy) is an incredibly insecure person who actually becomes painful. Trust me when I say that this movie is not one that needs to be quickly forgotten, especially the end scene where the divine eats the dog on foot. I've always thought John Waters was overpriced and I can't say I like this movie, but it's an experience if you have the chance to see it.
