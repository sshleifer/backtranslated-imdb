"The Sister of Two Sisters" or "Janghwa, Hongryeon" is a true masterpiece. Stylish psychological thriller, heartbreaking drama and thrilling horror all packed in one beautifully orchestrated package. From the complicated plot to the beautiful cinematic art until the perfect casting, all aspects of this film are extraordinary. <br /> <br /> The fear that too much of the plot will reveal, I just say it is very satisfactory. Although it may seem somewhat difficult to understand at first, it does a good job at the end. And if you prefer a psychological thriller, drama or horror, I promise you won't be disappointed. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, it is almost flawless. Set, cinematography, lighting and especially sound are all exciting. Waltz first seemed like a strange choice, but turned out to be an inventive choice. <br /> <br /> In casting, we are talking about absolute perfection. I'm Su-jeong is completely convincing as defiant but worrying Su-mi. Mun Keun-hong is equally convincing as the emotionally traumatized sister of Su-yeon. These two girls were magical on the screen. I'll definitely watch these other movies. Yeom Jeong-ah is deceptive and cheerful as a stepmother. In the end, Kap-su Kim gives excellent performance to a tired, broken father. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. If you haven't seen the A Tale of Two Sisters yet, I suggest you find a copy. It's a real gem that deserves someone's collection. <br /> <br /> (10/10)
