I saw this movie when it first came out and has never forgotten it. My uncle Antoine is much larger than the sum of its parts. The film is loosely about adolescence sent to live with a relative in a small town in Canada. There are adventures that seem more or less typical, but below is the current building. MUA is at a slow pace, but bears patience. I believe that the film was titled and, as with all non-English-speaking films, it is worth avoiding duplicate versions. Inevitably, the films will be duplicated from the attitudes of the new director and the actors, in addition to the need for the lines to synchronize the lips. English-speaking Amarcord is, for example, travesty, while the sub-version version sings. My uncle Antoine is well worth the time to find and watch it in French.
