Don't forget whether "National Velvet" (1944) is a bit hacking and sometimes convincing, Clarence Brown's riding fabel is a loving and very pleasant story with good morals. After achieving modest success with the release of Lassie Come Home (1943), a young Elizabeth Taylor, who was 12 years old, landed her first leading role as Velvet Brown, a passionate schoolgirl whose obsession with horses. Although filmed in California, the story - adapted to Enid Bagnold's novel - has been placed in a small hamlet in an English countryside, and Technicolor photography has been fully utilized to showcase the vivid and beautiful landscapes of the blue sky and green shrubs. Mickey Rooney settles as Mi Taylor, an erroneous exotic exclusive intent, with a relationship with a young Velvet that awakens his dignity and opens up a new, optimistic chapter in his life. Although he is in a significant struggle when he has to recognize the traumatic experience that led him to fear, Rooney is as enjoyable as the arrogant but passionate young man who has to prove his worth. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it is good that Elizabeth Taylor had those who were wearing violet eyes because her ability to act at this young age was rather limited. His more emotional sequences, in which he shows courage and honesty in the face of accidents, strikes one rather hollow and naive sense that simply "believing" fulfills everything that has been repeatedly advertised ever since. every eternally inspiring sports film ever made. Nevertheless, Taylor is bright and enthusiastic, and he works well with Mickey Rooney, who was not stranger to be a parent. Anne Revere plays a very important role in Velvet's mother, as a famous athlete, who not only did not flood the Channel, but loved them by a nice other than Mi Taylor's father. I liked Mi not talking about it until the last seconds of the movie, Mrs Brown, rightly judging that the young man must first develop his personality, not use his late father's memory to gain financial gain, as he would have undoubtedly done at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> The film reaches the top of a large national competition, where Velvet decided to ride his horse, Pi, at the last minute. world famous competition. In the shadow of a Latvian man, he continues to win, as expected, but later disqualified - whether he is a girl, or because he fell from a horse before he was allowed to demolish (which stupid rule!). This extended ranking is extremely well done, effectively capturing the secondary nervous tension of these nervous seconds and the confusion of the event that puts us in the same position as Rooney's character, high spectators, and unexpectedly waiting for someone to provide an exact update. It is not really important that we know that this is a double stroke, which makes most of the difficult riding - in many scenes we see the wig obviously terrible, but the positive message remains the same. I'm suggesting that National Velvet has brought the imagination of millions of young girls over the past sixty years, and its ability to inspire little has diminished over time.
