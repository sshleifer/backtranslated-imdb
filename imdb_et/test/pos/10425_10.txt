Not sure what movie or version Jeff saw, but this whole movie was fantastic, not just Poitier and Going. The story was riveting, tense and interesting. And a man who complains about historical accuracy is real. Yes, there were some black deputies on Indian territory, but they had no authority to arrest whites outside Indian territory. As a rule, they did not "patrol" but only used criminals. I found it odd that Corby did not see any Indian friends, I know their number has diminished, but it is still strange to me, even if Corby returns to his people, his Indian cohorts remain invisible and unnamed.
