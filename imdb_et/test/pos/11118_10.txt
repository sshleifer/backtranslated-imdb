This film speaks of nine ambitious teenagers trying to follow their dream at the notorious New York Performing Arts School: Coco, singer, Bruno, contemporary Mozart, Lisa, Leroy and Hilary, fighting dancers, Ralph, comedian and Doris and Montgomery, actors. While they all think they need to achieve their goals, they need much more than just their talent. To achieve their fame, they must deal with rejection, heartbreak, education, pain and love. <br /> <br /> "Celebrity" is one of the most entertaining, classic and inspiring films of all time. It has everything to do with teenage drama / music: extremely memorable, fun, Oscar winning songs by amazing Irene Cara, stunning dance numbers, a very attractive stuff that makes you believe characters, and a great story, including Coco meets your camcorder with a heartbeat . <br /> <br /> As I said, the cast is fantastic. Irene Cara can really act and it's not just her song, but also Coco. Lee Currer is very good as Bruno. Barry Miller brings a lot of humor to Ralph. Maureen Teefy is great when you exclude Doris, and look carefully and see Paul McCrane from "ER" to Montgomeryna. <br /> <br /> This is a really amazing movie. "Celebrity" really touched me and inspired me to follow my dreams as an actor and singer. Every movie that moves me a lot is a winner of my book. Must-have! The film touched me and inspired me to follow my dreams as an actor and singer.
