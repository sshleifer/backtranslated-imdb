Mr & Mrs Iyer's author, Aparna Sen, directs this film on the struggle of young girls to cope with their weakening state. <br /> <br /> Meth (Konkona Sen) has been a child in childhood and has shown signs of fraud, no one knows why. The sluggish tendency, however, slips out of control when the task takes him to a neighboring Bihar, where some political goons are raped. In addition to schizophrenia, the resulting trauma causes episodes of manic-depressive psychosis. Over the years, he takes care of control, gradually deteriorating and sinking deeper into his "private" world. <br /> <br /> The juxtaposition of a "divorced" (divorced) parent's sister, and how her dominant ways already make a bad situation worse, shows what a subtle line between abnormal and seemingly normal * is. Ms. It also makes an excellent comment on the social alienation of such individuals. Social Rehab is a common treatment with all lethal sensory drugs. But the poor and the poor who have always been left to take care of themselves and usually fall aside? <br /> <br /> Romantic relationship between Dr. Kunal and Anu was not necessary. Also, the caf√© scene where Dr. Kunal explains to Anu how real their world is for them was superfluous. Anu should already know this. The English dialogue is sometimes somewhat uncomfortable, although it compensates for it. Konkona and Shabana prove that their reputation is worth it. Waheeda, Rahul and Shefali play their limited role very well. Extensive research on this disease appears to be very obvious. But it is not clear whether the MDP can coexist in the same patient with schizophrenia. Dr Kunal also recommends early ECT (shock therapy), while acknowledging that it does not work for schizophrenia, but for extreme MDP with suicidal tendencies and other forms of bipolar disorder. <br /> <br /> Ending a remarkable story refers to an unknown solution (perhaps not a solution). The film could have come out with a more beautiful note because the world is mentally ill and leads to balanced and fruitful, if not very perfect, living under good medical care. <br /> <br /> Despite this, it's an extreme extreme film sensitivity to the subject. HATS OFF pr. Its! No one in India would have done better.
