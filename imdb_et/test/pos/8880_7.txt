I'm surprised at people, after such bad movies that arrive in the top ten or just in the 7.0s, I thought more people would get out of the female train. It was a great comedy made by two terrible comedies, Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito. Together they made a big duo of madness and obsession. Billy is a man who lost his million-dollar story to his ex-husband and wants him to die repeatedly, Danny is a crazy and old-fashioned mother who is abusing her. When Billy gives Danny some "misunderstanding", Danny proposes to Billy when he kills his former wife, Billy must kill his mother. It's a crazy and funny story that can always laugh. Please, sit back and enjoy this movie, people! This is good! <br /> <br /> 7/10
