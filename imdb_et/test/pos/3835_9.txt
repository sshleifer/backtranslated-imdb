When the ruins come, they do not carry gifts; no, they bring war and war. As everyone familiar with this episode, this is the redux of the 50's warfare below. The obvious difference is that instead of a battleship and a submarine (or an American destroyer and a German U-boat) dealing with deadly war games, there are two spacecraft in space. In the history of Trek, about 100 years before the events here, the Earth struggled with this rhythm for Romulan wars. Due to a conflict lasting about 5 years, the deadlock created a treaty and a neutral zone, which is the border between us and the Romulan Empire. At the moment, it seems that the treaty has been broken because our attacks have been attacked and destroyed by some huge force weapon. Yes, the Romans are back, testing their new war toy, and Kirk must now earn his salary: he must make decisions that would affect this galaxy sector, for example, how to avoid ... oh, I know - maybe an interstellar war? I think that what makes this episode so effective is that it does not bother the gloomy aspects of war, as one would expect just in the sixties television episodes, especially the science episode. fiction. It's all very tense and engaging, like the best war films, such as when Kirk sits with his main officials, the military council. Writers and actors do not joke here: it is all preparations for a terrible conflict that may be the start of another year of battlefield. Ultimately, Kirki aims to keep this battlefield on only two of the ships - but even then, this is a threat that is endangered and likely by the victims. In fact, I believe that this episode will keep a record of marine casualties. Right at the beginning of the episode, we can see that such a battle can bring such a supposedly well-protected outpost. Then start the cat and mouse war games between Enterprise and Romulan - it's just as exciting as any conflict we've seen on the big screen. Of course, if you are not in war movies, you have to look for other things to admire in this episode. <br /> <br /> What makes this episode even more so is what and who Romulans are - this is an electric shock. Now we have more inter-team conflicts on the Company Bridge - war tends to bring out the worst in some people. Due to the fact that in this future there is still an unpleasant attitude towards race, the tension remains even more - Kirk holds in his hand. I think one of the weaknesses is that the understandable problem is over. On Romulan's side, actor Lenard appears for the first time in the Trek universe as the commander of Romulan; He is in a terrible role, Captain Kirki, or on the back of the captain's pike, take your pick that is more like a little bit like Spock. Surprisingly, his character is not hungry for war, as we would expect, the opener of another eye for this episode. The actor returns to this universe like Sarek, Spock's father, so he's nothing, if not versatile. It also tells how the first appearance of letters such as romulans is usually their best picture, as is the case here. Next, they appeared in the "Incident of the Company".
