Jim Hacker is right after the last episode of the previous series. <br /> <br /> Jim Hacker is now in 10th Downing Street, replacing the British Prime Minister as a government minister and government member. He now directs his Majesty's government. <br /> <br /> All this after some of Sir Humphrey Appleby's leading maneuvers after the previous prime minister left at the end of the YA Minister. <br /> <br /> Sir Humphrey Appleby is now Head of Public Service. <br /> <br /> I thought this series was better than the first series or even though it won't last as long as the first in the series to the disadvantage.
