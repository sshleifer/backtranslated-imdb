I liked this Columbo film, with an atmosphere that was a true thriller, and his approach reminded me of the movie's tweet, the first 30 minutes in the movie or so. It's really nice and good old fashioned, with the right camera angles and light usage. This does not mean immediately that this film is brilliant, but strong enough to be considered a late entry into the Columbo movie. This is definitely a better movie than the average "later" entry of the Columbo movie. 26 years after his previous appearance of Columbo film, George Hamilton again plays with Peter Falk the main leader, again as a murderer, which is of course a different and new role. I liked it in his role, and he was a good Columbo 'villain' who gave good old lieutenant a good competition. They had a nice sequence together. The problem with "modern" new Columbo films has always been that he was not well known to Peter Falk as an actor. This film does not damage this problem. But I have to say that this film doesn't have the best of Peter Falk. He has definitely played a better character and his performance is not consistent enough within this film, which is probably also due to his film director Daryl Duke, who also led a really terrifying film "Tai-Pan" between many other projects. It has a fairly good and enjoyable story, but the fact that the same type of plot was used earlier to cover the murder of a Columbo movie will not help. It was used earlier in the 1975 movie "Columbo: Playback". However, it still has enough "original" moments, of course, although, of course, every Columbo movie is about the same. But that's what made the Columbo series so big and consistent. If it's not broken, don't fix it. <br /> <br /> It is also true that in this movie, the Lieutenant has more usual hints, which does not mean that a movie with a murderer is more stupid or sloppy, but I see more because writers are more enthusiastic about others. It doesn't make a movie or story bad, and maybe even makes it more enjoyable to see Columbo work hard and discover all kinds of small but important tips. Luckily, the movie is full of enjoyable, effective, effective Columbo comedy. <br /> <br /> Just a good late Columbo movie. <br /> <br /> 7/10
