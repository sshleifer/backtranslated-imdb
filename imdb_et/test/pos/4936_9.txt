One of my favorite films has already seen it three times. It does an excellent job of summarizing Isrelai's life spheres, the sense of humor and seriousness of Israel, and many of the problems that the Israelis are going through. A universal subject you want to receive and be accepted by you. Good exquisite humor and this is the charisma of the characters that makes this movie magical and says a lot about Isrlaei's culture, irony, contradictions and humor, with the great actor Oshri Cohen. I recommend it to someone, and this is a film that fits practically everyone, the film of a family, a boyfriend / girlfriend / girlfriend, and says besides the Israeli culture who wants to be accepted, especially the importance of the family, with all its diversity and drawbacks. <br /> <br /> Great movie.
