What I'm saying about this movie. well for beginners, I thought this movie was okay, not the biggest not the worst. I said as a reason that I thought the script was large and original, really different and refreshing. Now, I wouldn't say it is the biggest movie I see as a cause of behavior. Participants who played every role seem to have played them without emotions as if they had taken it out of life. If a woman laughed or shouted, for some reason it didn't seem real to me, it is just an example, but sincerely all the characters are not real. I wish I could say more positive things about this movie so you can see it at least once, but how do I do it because I know I can't see this movie again. I rented this movie from my school library without listening to anything about the film itself or the director. I took the opportunity because the story I spoke sounded very interesting and it was really.
