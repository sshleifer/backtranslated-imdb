Frankly, I do not understand why there are so many contradictions over this exhibition. It includes the elements of the original, extending them. The storytelling has been updated and although some episodes seem to be a bit "quick", this is good. <br /> <br /> Christopher Eccleston has a perfect role to play. Just as good as Tom Baker. <br /> <br /> Rose is one of the best companions, parallel to Sarah Jane Smith or Leela. <br /> <br /> I like the notion that deadlines have been destroyed - There is no more politicization with a doctor who acts as an emeritus president. And it adds something to the character that is the only left. <br /> <br /> SFX is outstanding - especially when compared to the original. <br /> <br /> Take it from me (and I was a huge dr Who geek - I really took notes when I look at an example of Dr Dr 1 to Dr 8. I threw a terrible movie out because it is now the best television show sci fi, maybe ever. Check it out and buy a DVD.
