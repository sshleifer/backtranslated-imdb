A comedy comedy to laugh at fans of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. I think this movie was made for those who enjoyed two GRUMPY OLD MEN movies because there seemed to be a number of friend teams who had their comic duo in their dark years. The idea is a solid fire: Matthau, a bumble bee player who owes thousands of dollars, unites his unsuspecting friend Lemmon to take a free cruise with him, where they can meet rich old ladies; the catch is, they are signed as dancing citizens and Matthau can't dance. <br /> <br /> BIRTH is a funny movie, and not all checks find Lemmon and Matthau. I found Brent Spiner (best known as STAR TREK: NEXT GENERATION) very funny as a snobby ball-busting dance coordinator. As a boss of two aging actresses, she manages to match them in a laughing department. Although the film doesn't really need, it's also a love story or two, involving Dyan Cannon (who looks pretty good for his years).
