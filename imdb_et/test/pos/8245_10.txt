In my opinion, this film is an excellent example of the reality of war and respect for soldiers of all nations who fought and threw Gallipoli in the soil. The lack of violence did not in any way reduce the story of the hand. It is honest, real and bold, like men who fought and died in Hellespont. The absence of violent violent images is just and right. These men suffered for freedom, freedom and self-determination in a free and better world. They never wanted to see such a scene again. This is the legacy of the Gallipoli event. It is not the best to demonstrate the suffering of the impatient pyro-techniques and the blood and the brain in order to maintain proper respect for the fighters of this national crucible. <br /> <br /> This movie worships those men who are struggling in their lives, with glory, courage, dignity, and irreplaceable spirit, and with humor in their appalling reluctance. This movie is not interested in seeing the fools. The brutal results of these men's personal struggles are not the thing that those who lived wanted to see the screen for entertainment. They saw it enough at that time and would never have seen it before and never wanted to see such scenes again under the name of "entertainment". The cruel horrors of the reality of the cruel fighting in Gallipoli were scenes that haunted their waking and sleeping places during the rest of their natural day. These were painful internal scars, men of all nations who fought within their graves. They all fought, and many died in front of it and somehow they were able to laugh at the death of constant fear because they didn't insult their companions when they were not ready to die beside the game. This is an Australian brave game, but it has been applied to a greater or lesser extent to all fighters, but according to the boy who fought, Johhny Turk was a game, it is as daring as you would ever like to be a soldier. <br /> <br /> ANZAC and the Turks fought to create their place on the world stage, and from 25 April 1515 their national minority equality requirements were made known and undisputed to their world. The director has made a masterpiece that truly respects the spirit and memory of their soldiers, and is a reminder for future generations of all ages, children can be taken without fear of scaring for the "horror" of the visual and a pointless complaint. And children should participate in this film to find out what happened on this sacred shore before their birth. That they remember. Because it is the nature of people that they will soon forget.
