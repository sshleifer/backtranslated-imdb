With a clear pattern after the first gangster film Warner produces in the same year, Little Caesar (1931) and The Public Enemy (1931), this gangster film is one of the best efforts to see. Although it is not in the same league as the previous classic, he has a young performance by Sylvia Sidney. Its great and offers its features more natural than perhaps someone did at the time. Gary Cooper is at this stage a better career than usual and shows signs of following the years after he rose to the top. In the film, Paul Lukas (none of the unseen) and Guy Kibbee (what a shock to see him to see the hoodlum) are enchanting crooks. Rouben's Mamoulian direction is very inventive, probably the first voice that shows the thoughts that appear in this film. If you get the chance to see this little gangster, don't let the chance go.
