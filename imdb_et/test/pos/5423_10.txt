... the world may never know. (The film that made the "best animated short" Oscar this year, "Anna and Bella" is very good, but it is not a "Big Snit." Both are available for the "World's Greatest Animation" of extended entertainment if you want to compare. ) <br /> <br /> "Snit" and its director Richard Condie has attracted so much attention that I have little to add. However, I would like to point out that the film contains one of my favorite single "strokes" in an animated short, where the man opens the door to let the cat out. I don't want to give away the actual events here, but for the first time I saw how I was hit by one mood and then another after a second. Such a shot has never affected me in this way. For this picture and Condie builds moments that "The Big Snit" deserves a "masterpiece" label.
