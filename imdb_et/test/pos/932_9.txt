It is not difficult to comment separately on the three trilogys of Kieslowski, it seems obvious that the filmmaker wants us to do just the opposite: look at them in order, blue, white and red, and look at them together as one. It is true that these are different themes that have different themes: freedom, equality, fraternity and each of them has been developed with unique intrigues and artistic applications. Each of them deserves to be viewed independently, but I believe that they are best regarded as one work. Collectively I would appreciate trilogy as 9; Separately, I put everyone in my ten-year-old 1993 and 1994. <br /> <br /> The red color is the most memorable in the third film as the background of the billboard advertising, the profile model of which is central to the three main characters of the film. The other two characters will be double counted when they first enter the city at the junction. This ad is not the main part of the plot of this movie, but its image becomes prominent and is one of the reasons why I called the Reddish "Brainstorming" movie. This is the third Kieslowski tri-color trilogy based on the three parts of the French flag's blue-white-red and his motto "Freedom, Equality, Brotherhood". The films mainly focus on these topics, bearing in mind the basic levels of one, two, or three main characters, but the complexity of the plot increases with each film, as the three principles essentially move from personal (freedom, blue) to relational (equality), white to social (fraternity, red). Red is the favorite of these films and I will give it to 9. This is in itself a great movie, but to get the most effective effect, you should first see blue and white.
