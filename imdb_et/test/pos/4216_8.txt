It's just that. Chucky 1 was good. Chucky 2 was better. Chucky 3 sucks. Now, series four, which I think is the best in the series. Jennifer Tilly was very good in this movie. In the case of dolls, they were better than some of the actors who remembered (Freddie Prince Jr. for one) and more fun than many comedies seen in the past. <br /> <br /> The plot wasn't big, but I really don't care about it. Just to see Chucky and Tiffany temptation and fight each other. And the ending ends for the fifth stage (which I hear is works). Premiere of Idle Hands next week and seeing another horror / comedy, but I doubt it is up.
