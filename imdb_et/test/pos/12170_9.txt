These three directors are a good start. The three stories are very well done for very independent productions and capture these "coming" traumatic feelings if you are not sure that this is a good idea. I laughed at their reflected eyes around "Pool Days"; I smiled at the idea that the fans of Bette Midler, Judy Garland and Barbra Streisand are "Dorothy's friend" (ie, browsing CD instruments) gay. and I threw "Jock" over "The Disco Years" whose memory of the sweet sex was now "blurred" by the nerve. It all seemed so real. I look forward to receiving more of this director's trio offer.
