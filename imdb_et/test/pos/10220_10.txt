Nightbreed is one of the best horror films I've ever seen. All in all, I'm not a big fan of fear films, but this film has something in the atmosphere and is different from the other movie films I've ever seen. Many of the horror films I've seen have been watched, but because they're based on horror, I know the stories are unrealistic because they're fancy, so I can't take them all seriously. Nightbeed, by contrast, is a unique horror genre because it feels the reality I've seen in very few other horror movies. <br /> <br /> This movie talks about how a man is murdered and ends up living with Undead in an underground cemetery shelter with Undead monsters, a story that a person would get from his dreamy Nightmare with his unique and original story. Most of the horror movies I've seen have been pretty counterfeit, but because Nightbreed was so incredibly complex and geniused with great action, especially Craig Sheffer's (Aaron Boone) amazing special effects, great light and fantastic dialogue, I found the depth and maturity of this movie, which has no foolish fake parody that many other horror films have. Nightbreed, as well as horror, are thriller, romance and action elements. If you haven't seen this movie, then I suggest you watch it because I appreciate it for 10/10.
