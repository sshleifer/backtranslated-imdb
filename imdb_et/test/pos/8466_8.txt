There have been many books that have called it the earliest gay cinema. I don't see it as homosexual, especially in a homosexual sense, but then we see two men dancing in what must be the world's first movie music with its own attraction. <br /> <br /> There have been many previous comments on this movie that leave homosexual records. As for those who are just fools and experiments that have been made late in the night after too many drinks ... for the quick release of this movie ... Well, I've heard this story before. <br /> <br /> This movie is interesting as strange and if people want to be considered the first homosexual movies, be it. Better than depressing 1919 Anders als die Andern.
