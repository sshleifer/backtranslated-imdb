This three-hour Chinese epic, which was erected in 220 BC, may ultimately be a familiar topic by uniting the emperor's idealistic peace dream, mutating into a mutilated isolation, and the film has nothing naturally challenging, but it is a powerful narrative, cramped intrigue and passion, and betrayal and epic events speak in vivid punches. Even for those who have not paid attention to such historical glasses for their own sake, this is an amazing eye party: The scene depicting the Marquis coup is one of the most amazing memories of physical space and glory, and the scenes of battle are memorable both in their scope and in their direct impact. The title summarizes the use of the film, accompanied by compelling contrasts - great simple prospects set against intimate horrors; with the most insecure motives in the worst situation; I hope you turn to dust. If you have never seen a three-hour Chinese epic, then this would not be a bad place to start.
