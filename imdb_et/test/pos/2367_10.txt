In the 1980s, there were many "alternative" comedies in the UK that were isolated, erroneous, too political and uncomfortable, and the worst Comic Strip Presents ... stuff fell into this category. <br /> <br /> But it's on the other side - a remarkable movie that works on different intellectual levels. <br /> <br /> Is Dennis a criminal master or is he lying? <br /> <br /> Does he speak the truth, bluffing double bluffing, double-bluffing-bluffing anything? <br /> <br /> I've probably watched the Supergras 20 or 30 times and I still can't decide 100%. This is a great thing. <br /> <br /> In addition to Ade Edmonson, there are also great roles for other early Comic Strips - French and Saunders, Pete Richardson, Alexei Sayle, Keith Allen, Nigel Planer and Robbie Coltrane. Strangely, Rik Mayall is not. <br /> <br /> The entire comic strip - though I didn't like the hidden action of some of these members - is a compelling actor and turns to great performances during this big-screen outing. while the work of the Richardson-Richens writing team is so often a genius with little details. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, it is a study of crime, criminology and human nature, which is all that wonderful complexity. And very funny. You don't have to be disappointed.
