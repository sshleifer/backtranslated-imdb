I have to say it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> Mike Judge is looking at things that no one notices about the Office space. Hemakes expresses an opinion on the slippage of society and the survival of the most suitable people is just a dream after 500 years. This pop culture and the mass marketing of wealthy companies tend to dominate the day. Yes, there is a lot of potty humor and that is that the story moves and its point over. But the real disappointment of the private Joe Bower's face is invaluable and in some cases we can all be involved. <br /> <br /> If you don't know humor, check it out from a different perspective and watch it again. I watched it twice to really evaluate this movie for what it is? And after watching it twice?
