So you want to be a rock star? Watch this movie. Don't you like rock? Or are you really a heavy metal? Then put your favorite album and dream of yourself, this movie has nothing to offer. I have rarely ever seen a movie that is able to portray a dream that it is so good in a rock band. In the late 1980s and early 1990s I had long hair and I have been playing guitar for the last 15 years. Did I like Rock Star? Oh yes. The music is good, not big, the actors are good and credible, even Jennifer Aniston plays her part perfectly. And Mark Wahlberg is perfect as a wannabe rock singer. So you know what you get. The film of dreams that has come true, stepping forward and finally explaining what life really is. That's a good seven out of ten, not anymore, no less.
