At one time, "Buddy Cop" film boxes prevailed. It seems that every Beverly Hills Cop wannabe summer flock descended into our nation's theater. Not anymore. Recently, faeces have barely dried up. The drought has recently relieved Showtime, a movie that is really funny and consistently entertaining with the genre. <br /> <br /> Mitch Preston is a committed police officer. He's in no way a dirty Harry type. He is just an incredibly focused professional who is completely intolerable of anything he can do in his duties, such as T.V. Mitch deals with the operator in a socially irresponsible manner and it falls on Chase Renz, the manufacturer who is looking for his "reality TV police show. Put the Trey Sellars, a patrol-cum-actor who looked too much at the police story again, of course, a mixture of Mitch and Trey, like oil and water, and a lot of cheerful chaos. <br /> <br /> We know that Mitch and Trey will be the best friends at the end of the movie, so it is believed that friend-policemen are working. In fact, Showtime rarely deviates from the history of clich√©s written by Lethal Weapon and Tango & Cash. In this case, there is an automatic rifle that burns to a large extent to stop the tanks. There are commands, shootouts, and explosions. We all know that this is happening and we have a fairly fair idea about it ie, how it all gets. There's nothing wrong with that. Yes, we know that well-worn bases must be touched, but the fun here is a trip, not a destination. Showtime does not carry the original. Instead, this energy moves into its characters and humor. As a result, Showtime does a series of competent works with operations, but it really looks like in its comedy. <br /> <br /> Robert De Niro is as funny as Mitch. Previously, I have thought that De Niro is a cold and expressive actor who has terribly called for comedy. Recently she has grown up with me. He seems to inject more humanity into his roles. Eddie Murphy is fun like Trey. The best way to describe your actions is that Trey is what Murphy would have been if Murphy wasn't so talented and wouldn't have hit a lot of time. Rene Russo has a play time for a motor show including Shark Chase Renz. He draws a Nielson high-rating film that is honestly inspiring. In his zeal he improves Mitch's life to make it more camera-friendly. He even calls T. J. Hooker, William Shatner, to show Mitch how to be an "authentic" cop. Shatner is funny, playing just as we expect him, loudly, unforgettably, and lightly unpleasant. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I really look forward to Showtime and I wasn't disappointed. Ten years ago this film would have been guaranteed. It is doing the best business today. Sorry, because Showtime is a lot of fun.
