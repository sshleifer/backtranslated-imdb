The story is not much. A young woman steals some money from the harsh Vermont supermarket she works with, decides to flee to Florida, where she has dreams of going to school with her friend Julie and meeting a strange couple on the road. If you remember the older pair of "Rosemary's Baby," you have an idea of ​​what the two are. Bill has a comic face and has left the army. Sandra is an ex stripper who will now become a hoist whore, though we can't find it right now. They are loving, helpful and full of common sense. <br /> <br /> They mostly or less use the girl, Alice, and allow her to ride in her complicated RV, even though they do not go straight to Florida. <br /> <br /> This is where the movie could have gone one hundred percent wrong. All filmmakers had to make older couples change their evil personalization. They took a virgin alice (bed or any handcuffs) and would sell their body to any grease ball leader who has a lot of money and wants to have tough sex. "There would have been a time before the final shootout, which had a lot of interrupted attempts." But, yes, the couple really are pretty and Alice is not a virgin. Alice listens to Sandra with the client, asks about the company and tries to trick her. they do something and require him to do the job right when he does it. They don't talk to him. They run him. <br /> <br /> Alice makes several hundred dollars, which is several hundred dollars more than he had Bill and Sandra are holding your money in a safe place where customers can't find it. Alice misunderstands. She doesn't find a very pleasant job, and she thinks she will never be paid off, because every time she asks her to put her down, Sandra says, "What? Not here, honey. Not anywhere." But after he talks about transferring his weapon to Sandra, he gives him the money he wants, and lovingly releases him to continue his trip to Florida. <br /> <br /> You know what I found most tragically in the movie right now? It had nothing to do with prostitution or theft. Alice has been waiting for a room with her friend Julie after her arrival in Miami. After all, Julie is a legitimate student. But when Alice calls a friend in Alabama to confirm her path, but arrives late, Julie hesitates and says, "Well, my mother doesn't think you should give us room. My roommate is not cool either. I called you down , but I thought it was like a week or something. Go back to Milford, Alice. br /> <br /> Only one shot (some white shots from the movie) and no one hit, tears appear only once. One car did not explode in a fireball No police officer pressed Interstate. <br /> <br /> The direction is occasionally clumsy, too much cross-border between Sandra trying to bomb Alice and Alice's revenge There's hardly a musical result. There's a short nudity for men and women and it's uncomfortable because it should be. Alice is not unpleasant, but she's not babalicious. She's sporting Asian eyes, a particular version of Molly Parker. and the colors are washed out it is easy, with some enlightening setback. Nothing is wasted. And all this was probably shot around Danbury, Connecticut. The city stays in my mind because I drove through it after a flood and I remember cars that were clad with sludge film until the door handle. <br /> <br /> I don't know exactly what Alice found. (I am even afraid that the answer to the mystery is that "he found himself.") Operation is not at all bad. Judith Ivey is better than that. It is definitely worth watching, a quiet, correct film that treats the audience as adults.
