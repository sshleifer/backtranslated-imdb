I'd say this movie is annoying. Brutality is depicted in a very ill way, like a psychosis within 40 minutes. At the same time, it is cruel to people's behavior. The scenes are wild, starting with the horse meat industry and ending with brutal sex in the kitchen. Every emotion has been used to be extreme, but the butler's disappointment, love for his daughter almost incest, rage when he discovers that he has been abused, every feeling is so natural and wrong. This film gives truth about human nature with great honesty and cruelty. The film's message is that a person's life can change as a result of another behavior, and that the most primitive emotions are the most powerful and able to determine their behavior. I loved the unique way of filming, simplicity and cruelty, accompanied by silence, where only internal thoughts pass.
