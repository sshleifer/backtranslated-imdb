I saw this movie today at the Philadelphia Film Festival and enjoyed it in general. It is an interesting and poor analysis of the overall revelation that our parents' marriage was worse and more complicated than we originally imagined. In addition, this film is an excellent example of a process of discovering the truth of our parents' lives after their death and related issues. However, I found that sound quality (recording and editing) is relatively poor and tedious. *** It can be very related to specific theatrical and project conditions *** I am not a filmmaker / student or something and does not require a true understanding of the sound production process, but as a consumer, I find this part of the sound disturbed by the film. Specifically, I heard very unpleasant lips noise (especially one long interview with a younger sister), and often the background noise was higher than people's voices (like a scene where a small group sorted through mothers papers). Has anyone seen this movie, noticed something sound ... thanks
