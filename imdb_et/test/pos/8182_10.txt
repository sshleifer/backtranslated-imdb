The film calls for comparisons with Shakespeare. Mandarin is beautifully written and spoken, and the plot is intricate and intriguing. Gong Li has never been better before, there is no glory that is better represented on the screen. The balance between political instability and personal intimacy that the Gladiator hinted at, but never really, is a spade here. Just incredible.
