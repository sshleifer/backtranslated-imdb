Not after the Bette Davis' Ex-Lady 1933 vehicle has seen a movie that was so much better than its star said it was! Years since years have come from the horror stories that Stan Laurel talks about his production, most of the "rapeseed" Atoll K, "Utopia", a.k.a. "Robinson Crusoeland". Considering that during a stroke he is suffering from a stroke, it seemed that death was warmed through a large part of it (twice opening it, it is not believed that Laurel survived in eight years) and was later diagnosed with diabetes (when he had adjusted his diet accordingly) rejuvenated to health), understands why Laurel didn't think this movie was the most enjoyable experience of her life. Yes, it is faulty: the cheapness of the production is manifested, the duplication is terrible and Laurel and Hardy were too old to make an energetic blow to their biggest films. But it's still really funny, and the story of LÃ©o Joann introduces the elements of political satire (sometimes liberal, sometimes communist), expected from more socially conscious comedians like Chaplin or Marx Brothers, but never Laurel and Hardyst. The film deserves credit for being different (although its debt to Ealing Studios' classic Passport Pimlico, made just a year ago, is quite obvious) and the integration of Laurel and Hardy's comedy into a rather uneven context that is completely different from just them used before. It's not a great movie, but it's definitely better than the eight evil Fox and MGMs they did in the early 1940s. I suspect that only the technical affection of the film kept it from the cultures that followed the founding of the young baby boomer Marx Brothers' Duck Soup in the late 1960s / early 1970s.
