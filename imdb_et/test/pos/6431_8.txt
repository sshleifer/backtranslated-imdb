It must be so difficult to tell a story that does not happen much, but still the attention of the observers. I think this short film will achieve this effortless quality. Rutger has an amazing voice that is very soothing, smart and dad, (I'm not gay), it resembles the qualities that Robert Redford is narrating. The end is very sad, but beautiful. One asks how long has Harry left, is he lonely, and does he say goodbye? Mr Hauer is also annoyed that he did not participate more in this caliber. We hope that he will continue his good work in the Netherlands and stay away from Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Worth viewing
