Here is a film that fits perfectly for everyone involved in the post-industrial world: those who sit in their privatized homes, earn money, buy and sell sensitively less goods and maintain a system that values ​​little but retention. <br /> <br /> Beautiful filming (I always appreciate the 35s and soft boxes) makes it a strange place to travel, so enjoyable to look at and scary to understand (maybe it's too dramatic, but it's true) . <br /> <br /> Andreas's passage to hell is predominantly tragic. His aspiration is respectable, commendable and valuable. The conclusion is necessary and we are not sure if it is better, which is the perfect conclusion. <br /> <br /> Breve! Recommended for all people who are critically looking at their world and especially for those who do not (perhaps it encourages thinking or two).
