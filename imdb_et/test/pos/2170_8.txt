This movie was better than I expected. I don't think it would have earned an R rating. I've seen PG-13 movies with a poorer language and violence. I found this movie amusing and enjoying it. If you are the person who breaks everything, you can get into it a lot, but if you take it for your face value, I find you find it fun.
