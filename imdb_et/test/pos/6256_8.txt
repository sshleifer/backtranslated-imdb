Okay, this wasn't the biggest horror I've ever seen in my life. Although it is a lower budget, it's a pretty decent movie. Monsters are unique and plausible. Heck, they are even scary in scenes that they show them briefly that it is disastrous for a poor family. Although, when you finally see the monsters completely, you really think "WTF!? These things things are after them!" The only part that bothered me was when they * smelled kitty to kill! Not kitty, noooooo, why? Seriously, if you're looking for heavy violence and gore, it's not a movie for you. Go for renting the hills with your eyes or something like that. If you have small children, I would not recommend watching them together; probably give them nightmares for trolls in their room.
