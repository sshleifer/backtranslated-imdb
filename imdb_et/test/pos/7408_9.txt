It is characteristic that this film is not better known. Obviously, most of the elements needed by successful theatrical films are: heroes, villains, conflict and resolution, romantic interest in love. <br /> <br /> Everything here is extremely arduous, nothing is working as it should, everything is awkward, sad , angry, painful and hungry and no one has a solution. In short, it's war and it's hell for everyone. People try to do the best, but interests, respects, and so-called commitments intervene. The picture brings us back to the civil war, the intensity of which is rarely seen in today's cinema. Honest beautiful pictures. The actors are very well cast for this story and they make these characters truly alive to our eyes. <br /> <br /> The silver dollar heap nickel!
