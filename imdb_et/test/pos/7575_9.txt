He is slow to reveal his identity. When they find out that he is Jacob's father, John Witting thought long ago, difficult questions about the past are hard to come by. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close is great as a loving mother who only wants the best for her whole family and is constantly wrestling with the forces that tend to separate them.
