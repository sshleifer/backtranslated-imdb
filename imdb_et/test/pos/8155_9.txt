Hey, this movie is all about choices. All the time in your life you have to choose something or just go ... And this movie proves it! Of course, life is not really like a beautiful picture because this movie shows ... it doesn't really show, but some may see it. I'm trying to say it's full of pain, love, and words of life. Aaron, the missionary of Mormon, is a real shepherd who digs a beautiful thing in Chisthian, a skinny guy ... <br /> <br /> This is a great ending and you always believe in fate because it will surprise you or your other life last day ... <br /> <br /> Great thing to look at !!!
