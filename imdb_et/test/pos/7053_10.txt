Imagine spending your summer with your family or friends at school and meeting new people. Or else, it's your first time you're the one and the only person you can count on is a camp. "Meatballs" offer a lot of comedy in this movie. The camp has an eccentric advisor (Bill Murray) who knows how boys and girls can spend time. Enter a child named Rudy (Chris Makepeace) who has no one to search for. He doesn't fit anyone, only Tripper can have fun with him. The remaining jars are as mad as Tripper. Camp Northstar is the average camp team. On the other hand, Camp Mohawk is an elite camp where they run for their money. In the basketball game, Mohawks got their pants! And at the Olympics, Northstar got the revenge they needed when one of the members took out the sabotage. And Morty (Harvey Atkin), this poor soul can ever try when he tries. Very, very funny comedy and it's a great keeper. This movie shows that the camp can be fun if you want to be! 5 Stars!
