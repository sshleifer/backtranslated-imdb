This is a well-made film. There are many fighting scenes, the actor is convincing (for this genre) and the RS1 is fantastic. I don't know why people feel compelled to force the RS1 trash, I thought his effects were being executed very well and his design seemed great. The plot was acceptable for a martial arts movie. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I have to tell you that Richard Sun is one of Hong Kong's worst actors I've ever watched. At least RS1 had the right idea to kill him. Now, for all of you who thought Sam Lee (Alien) was a bad actor ... he didn't have to take it seriously! I was just glad to see Gen-X Cops (prequel) and Sam Lee played the same character! <br /> <br /> Now, please, all of you who are watching the highly acclaimed Oscar winners: DO NOT MEET THE GAME OF THIS CONCEPT! NOT RECOMMENDED! Just had to enjoy it, that's all. I hope they do one more.
