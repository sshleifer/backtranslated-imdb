Hal Hartley has been compared to the modern William Shakespeare because he gets his actors to send his ranks to the iambic pentameter. He certainly knows how to pour and Martin Donovan is once again sensational, while Thomas Jay Ryan plays his role with unforgettable intensity. Though the movie is only 1 hour, the schedule works great and keeps the audience busy in other competitions until the end. Undoubtedly, Hal Hartley is one of the best directors who has come out of America in the last 20 years, with a vision that is unique, funny and warming the heart.
