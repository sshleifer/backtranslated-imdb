Ah, how refreshing to see the 18th century England vision with mud, smallpox and gibbets ... and it comes with a delightful techno-soundtrack that launches. This is the story of the fallen road from Plunkett (Robert Carlisle) and the Gentleman-fallen-on-hard-time Captain Macleane (Jonny Lee Miller) and how they get together and robbing the aristo pigs. Plunket is a hard nut, but MaCleane is too polite for it, and it becomes a "gentleman for highwayman". She falls in love with Lady Rebecca (Liv Tyler), who, frankly, is the only weak part of the sheep and wants to impress her. <br /> <br /> Costumes are fantastic. Large, colorful, historically strange beautiful beauties. Alan Cummings gets all the best yarns and best lines like Lord Rochester, who play very non-18. the eyebrows of the century. The music shifts between a variety of famous choirs and bustling bass-stored techno, which doesn't hurt as you think it should be in a historical film. The script is fast moving and equipped with modern speech; Merchant Ivory, it's not. There are fun parts, nasty parts, a poster-your-nail-your-nail-nail parts, but the whole thing chugs together and is a wonderfully fun whole. It's a lively cinema. Impossible.
