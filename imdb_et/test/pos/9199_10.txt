This show is entertainment and does not try to be a Greek drama. Certainly, it contains all the elements that everyone changes with the twists of the plot, but it is very interesting and fun. Las Vegas is the perfect place for the show, and they certainly have no lack of material! Something and everything happens! The actors in this show are extremely satisfied and you really want to see what they do for the week. The exhibition is also very funny. Humor comes from characters and situations. Don't just throw it free. In this regard, it is well designed. Definitely makes me wait for Friday nights and I'm glad to have my first two seasons on my DVD!
