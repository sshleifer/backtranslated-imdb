I learned about Favela Rising via the IMDb website. I have a special interest in Afro-Brazilian culture and films. Favela Rising is one of those gems that gives a new meaning to human transformation. Beautifully documented and filmed by Jeff Zimbalist and Matt Mochary in their story Anderson Sa, a former drug dealer in Rio de Janeiro who, after the death of family members and friends, becomes Christian, all Malcolm X and Ghandi rolled together. You formed the AfroReggae, a grassroots cultural movement that uses the Afro-Brazilian hiphop, capoeir (Afro-Brazilian Martial Arts) drum and other art forms to make hopeless and most angry young people lively, viable, caring community-loving people. A few years ago, I remember going to screen the city of God (Cidade De Deus) and walked out of the theater with utter dullness. These pictures were still strange and you couldn't take your eyes off the screen. I remember the hopeless situation in Favelas and how the decadence of society was caused by the negligence of governments. How drug trafficking was a way of life when the indifferent citizens of the slums were, because death was every day. Like God City, Anderson tells you how the people of the favelade were desensitized. He talks about police corruption and how drugs and gangs in both communities immobilized you so that you could not visit other family members of Favelas. Unlike God's City, Anderson's grassroots movement offers AfroReggae anger, hopelessness. <br /> <br /> The documentary had one part where Anderson looked at some of the youngsters in the spirit of the preacher and asked them to join AfroReggae. These young people were so intimidated by their daily survival and violence. Their role models were drug dealers and they wanted to be. Anderson said drug dealers were not living very long. Of course he was reluctant, but five months later he was able to join some of the young people in AfroReggae. <br /> <br /> The visual images of Favela Rising are amazing. It's clear to me that Jeff Zimbalist and Matt Mochary are not only great storytellers, but also a visual artist. This is a documentary! There are some very magical and changing moments in this documentary. I don't want to spoil them. I want you to see it yourself. Please tell your friends, academics, youth advisors, family members about this wonderful movie. It will take care of the world and our children. <br /> <br /> I'd give her 11 stars!
