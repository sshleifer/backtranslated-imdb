Eros and Thanatos, Love and Death command the dialectics of life. By the end of the 19th century, a distant village in Japan had a younger man and a married woman who was older than her, and who decided to kill her husband to enjoy her love. But they can never enjoy this freedom, because Remorse will tease them, as usual, the weakest member of the couple, of course, the woman. From now on, in the atmosphere where the dream (nightmare) mixes with reality, the ghost of the murdered man first appears to the woman, but then to the man. It also haunts the dreams of other villagers, creating a suspicious environment and rumors around the couple, which is aggravated by the arrival of a police officer to investigate the disappearance of the murdered spouse. But it makes this film more interesting after this almost general story of adultery, the development of a few feelings in Shakespeare's deep psychological and dramatic development of regret, fear and fear, which makes their love relationship a nightmare until their final destruction. The exemplary expressionism of the Japanese theater or film is also in the performances of the players, but not in an exaggerated form. Just as a necessary measure to show more effectively the most depicted characters. This is really a good movie.
