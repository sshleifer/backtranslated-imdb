This is a tough film that needs to be looked at as there are many factors to consider. Let's filter more judgment. Ok, are you interested in the facts about the series killer Jeffrey Dahmer? Can you resist an independent, low-budget movie? Are you objective enough to NOT like the movie just because of the lack of a star or professional look? Well, if you said yes, you should have enough spirit to handle one. This film is almost 100% accurate Dahmer adult life and the dramatization of the ensuing murder game and is designed as an autobiography. This is not a glamorous, unrealistic account, which was unfortunately a theater film "Dahmer" (2001). The film begins with Dahmer, which Carl Crew played quite convincingly, sitting in a police car while robbing his apartment. His thoughts on what he got there are presented to us in an earlier narrative style that explains exactly a lot of Dahmer's psychoses and motives that made him kill almost 20 times. We get to know both the character and the side as well as the side that was moderately close to living a normal life. It's not someone's fault, but Dahmer that 17 people died, but being a student of psychology at the criminals, I was more satisfied than just his natural side, which is really represented in this movie. You see her loving relationship with her grandmother and try to find her companion, but of course we know her what everyone remembers. It should be noted that there is little actual violence on the screen, much of which refers to frames such as blood squirting or a body caught in a blurred curtain. You see two deaths that I remember, one of which is a slash of a bloodless throat and another person who is lifted into an acid barrel. Although you don't see anything graphical, this cruelty and the convincing behavior of both the team and its victim make it a disturbing scene. And while the actual screen shot is low, you'll see results. There is a hand and a head or two, but it seems to be disturbing the viewer and does not seem to be exploitative. Moreover, these are the fake anatomical pieces where budget constraints are visible. While they are acceptable, they see enough as counterfeits that are not too distracting. The film actually ends before Dahmer's death in 1994, as it appeared a year or two years earlier. This is the only big difference between the real story and the information that is left is, as I have said, very factual. Movie quality may be better, dialogue often seems too quiet, and multi-character operation is a bit hammy, but it's not overboard. In my opinion, this is a flawed but ultimately honest and serious look at one of America's most memorable serial killers. I think it is safe to say that the film is also memorable and I respect it for overcoming its limitations in order to convey the story with confidence, which is strongly supported by the magnificent Carl Crew as Dahmer.
