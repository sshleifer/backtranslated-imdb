Good movie, all good movie elements were there, story, actors, script and direction. I was at the edge of my place all the time. <br /> <br /> There's no question about this, it's a low budget movie, but I liked it more than many big budget movies. <br /> <br /> Andres Bagg plays Martin Sanders, who deals with his unfaithful wife. Then voice in the phone and then just fear. Virginia Lustig is beautiful and brings great performance. He's a great part of the movie. <br /> <br /> At the end I liked the growing vagueness, although we know that the main character may be involved, we continued to look at it from the perspective and ask: Who is the killer?
