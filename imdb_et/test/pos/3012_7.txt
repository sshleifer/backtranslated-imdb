Despite all the boundaries of style and cinematic invention, it is basically another yet killer sport, following the same type of drawing that is favored by old favorites such as silence of lambs? The police team is following (especially disgusting) the path of murders, someone else can and must somehow find out where they are before it is too late. Only in this case is the only person who knows the killer himself (powerful Vincent D'Onofrio) is in a coma and we need a psychologist with a psychologist Jennifer Lopez to get into his head and force him to say everything. This is where the film gets all new and different as we enter (Dr Who's Kaleidoscopic Favorite, Trendy Tunnel of the 21st Century), a sort of Hellraiser-y strange world where scary crazy stuff happens. The place ruled by D'Onofrio, a kind of resurrecting commander of his twisted spiritual world, inside his comma body. The queuing of the inner minds is well realized and often quite stunning, all the executives fill enough, the greatness is maximal if you like this thing, but the whole thing jumped to frustration, as I had been expecting something completely new and differently from what was done before, not that that the series-killer and special-effect horror genre clips were successfully mixed. Sometimes talented filmmakers have been careful and attentive to a crappy, often quite engaging story, but it is by no means a big leap into the unknown.
