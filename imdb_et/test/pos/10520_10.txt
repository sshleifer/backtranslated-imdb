These immortal lines begin with Jack Starret's The Dion Brothers. In the middle of the plot there are two blue collars from West Virginia brother (Stacy Keach and Frederic Forrest) who are robbing in the hope of using the money to open a seafood restaurant! The following is quite an adventure and many comedy events. Action scenes are all top-notch and consist of some nicely realized shootouts. The latter is absolutely amazing and takes place in an abandoned building that is demolished by a crushing ball! The film has been written by the famous director Terrence Malick and the early appearance of Margot Kidder. All in all, an excellent 70's hidden pearl and one of the best deeds / comedy hybrids. Hopefully a good wide-screen DVD will soon be available.
