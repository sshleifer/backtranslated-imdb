Wow! An amazing, lost piece of Australian and lost 70's glam-rock film rolled into one. This movie just needs to be seen to see what can't be done next to the budget, but a lot of enthusiasm. By reusing the Oz story, the film becomes too obvious, but it is recorded with its eccentricity. An opportunity to glimpse at how glam rock in Australia thrills fans of the genre. This movie was double with the Rocky Horror Picture Show, which shows what Oz is. Although not as frivolous or well-designed as RHPS, it is not difficult for Oz to have fun. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, Oz has become obsolete - or as a by-product of the 1976 real Australia. . History shows that many of the ideas being explored will eventually reach the mainstream. The film's readiness to highlight homosexuals is remarkable, especially since it extends to the Australian "revolutionary" period. <br /> <br /> The performances range from amusing to subtle nuances. The direction is inadequate, and a large part of the dialogue can benefit from an additional project or two. Somehow, these bugs make a gracefully addictive film. Like in Australia in the 1970s, this film has some naive charm. <br /> <br /> Rocky Horror Show's original Australians have several connections that keep their toes from attacking. <br /> <br /> Oz is definitely a small class and a potential cult favorite that deserves to be reviewed. Laugh in the fashion of the 70s, with AusRock's soundtrack, leave all your expectations on the door and Oz rejoices.
