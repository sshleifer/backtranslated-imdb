My mother always told me I was sitting and watching this movie because it's one of her favorites, I've never done years before I captured one night on television. This movie was great, I don't even know how to explain it. Not only is it great (Julia Roberts, Keifer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, William Baldwin and Oliver Platt), but the story is fantastic. It's terrible, but not too scary, and it makes you think. After this movie, I stayed up and amazed how the actors and actress all these five people really are. Where William Baldwin went, he's great. This movie must be visible to everyone, if you don't see it, it's not a pity. Amazing!
