Movies may not always be deep, provocative thoughts. Sometimes they are just meant to escape from reality. Out to Sea fits the bill perfectly. <br /> <br /> The light-hearted "golden year" romantic comedy that goes out to the sea may not be a big budget, maybe you can easily tell if they are acting in front of a green screen, but it is still a much-viewed movie. A sweet movie that needs a break. <br /> <br /> It's just good fun with a light heart. It's not meant for a deep movie. It's worth watching. If anything else, you must see Brent Spiner's humane rigid and harsh transfer to Oye Como Va, then Gil is what you love to hate, and Mr. Spiner pulls the perfect evil comic for two beloved comedy gods.
