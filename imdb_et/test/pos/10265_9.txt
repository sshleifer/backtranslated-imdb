It would not have come from another country or from other times. This film just forgets about psychiatry that influenced Italian cinema in the late 60s. So, pseudo is serious and sexually free. Rich settings and dreamy music make it a visual and aural joy. Plus, we get cute Dagmar Lassander, definitely his best looking. Kinky's moves make a wild ride, and when the rams in the middle of Mimosa look too long, this is another pretty charming feature. You were likely to divide those few minutes between the screen and your girlfriend and, of course, proclaiming the twist. Perhaps it would have been better for Philippe Leroy to see his funny red hair and twisted facial expression rather strange. He does well and has many quiet moments where Dagmar is cavorting and he has to show a mixture of love and hatred. In no way is the usual narrative film, but for those who like something else, it is definitely so.
