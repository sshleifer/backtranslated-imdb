First I am a teenager. OK, and I have to say that this movie was pretty good. I think every child who is ten and below likes it, but people whose age is up can be small, well, we would describe the movie LAME! But I liked it. I may be like a child, or I visit cattle farming every weekend, but this movie was cute. I liked how the actors were like kids, not small blonde cutesy pies, wearing three layers of clothes, a trendy hat and about a thousand assecories (like most shows today, to name a few, Drake & Josh, Lizzie Mc Guire, well every kid shows.) And the device was perfect, but there was an error. The family was in debt, right? Why did the world look like something out of the "western" store in its interior? It was a mistake. <br /> <br /> Lighthouses are large, about five hundred of them, and the only one to explain is Julia Roberts, the main aunt of the girl. How in the world did they all come from? This movie seemed to be a tight budget. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie, it was fun to watch, and I thought some parts were far removed (like a cow selling $ 750,000? Ha! my butt cow is selling so much!) it was good, I liked it and I can watch it again. But I would never buy it, the DVD doesn't even have special features! What is it about? But rent it, especially if you have small children around the house.
