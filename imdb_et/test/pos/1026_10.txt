It is just a reminder to anyone who just read the reviews published in 1981 about this great BBC mini series, it wasn't available on DVD in recent years. Since then, it has become available, but initially only in British format (for which I bought an "international" DVD player, which you have to hack - illegally, I suspect to see it), but the series is now available through amazon.com - 3 discs - between $ 19-21, which can be viewed in the US on DVD without hacking. There were 41 reviews, on average 5 stars. This mini-series is one of the best Oppenheimer or Manhattan projects or almost all produced by the BBC.
