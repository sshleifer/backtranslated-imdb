Like many, I saw for the first time water words as children / young teenagers in the late 1970s / early eighties. Since then, it has remained with my memorable stories, memorable images, less-successful animations, and a story full of heart, cold and ultimately exhausting evil. Recently, I sat down and saw it at least two decades ago and I noticed that this time is with this striking resemblance to the Ozi's wizard. No, they are not bold similarities but hear me. Here we have a boy and his dog, who have "home" personal problems and run something and the scene right after escaping, changing the content of their appearance. In this one, boy and dog become animated. The Oz Wizard has Dorothy and Toto colors. It says that the boy and the dog are required to find the Water Babies and then the Kracken, and have the ability to let Tom go home if he shows he has the courage and so on. Oz, Dorothy must also find an authoritative figure that tests her before she allows her to return home. In water babies, Tom meets three characters to help him on the water - Dorothy also has three helpers. If every helper is filled, we have entertainment "Hey, Hi, Hi, HI Cockallorum ... We're on the road." The wizard is that we're off to see the wizard. Dorothy has a good witch who takes care of her; Tom has the same number of women (Billie Whitelaw). If you look at these two closely, there are many other similarities. That said, Baby Babies are not intermittent in any way, I just comment on the unfortunate youth. This movie has some bad guys Bernard Cribbins and always exciting James Mason. Tom and Ella are good kids. The vocal talents of Joan Greenwood (love my voice!), David Tomlinson, and John Pertwee and Lance Percival greatly support mixing. I have to admit that animation is less than a pound of time, but it is enough to challenge. Three animated characters that help Tom get home are all fun. I always find it difficult to choose my favorite between French swordfish and John Inman / Mr. Humphries like a seahorse. In the scene where we hear this robbing, manic laugh ship from the ship just to see a seahorse with a huge polka dotted belt, I've always been running! Water babies are very fun. Of course, this is a children's film, but it is and must always be in the heart. Most of the success of the film must go to director Lionel Jeffries. Jeffries is a wonderful comedy actor and his sense of humor is clearly visible.
