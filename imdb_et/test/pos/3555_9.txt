After reviewing 3 Perry and Croft sitcoms, I thought I'd get them all now. Dads Army, is my all-time favorite sitcom, it's not half hot Mum is also classic like Sang Rang M'Lord. I don't think Hi De Hi is classic, but it's still funny. <br /> <br /> This is a holiday camp that resembles Butlins, but it is a yellow coat instead of red coats. It is led by Jeffery Fairbrother, who is a very meaningful man, but has a sock personality. Employees include the fun entertainment manager Ted, his sidekick Spike (he got into the swimming pool for almost every episode), the yellow coat Gladys, the careless maid Peggy, who longed to be a yellow coat and Punch and Judy, Mr Partridge, who hates children. The situations were mostly at the pool where someone was thrown into every episode (of course, there is clothing). <br /> <br /> Not classic but funny. Jeffery Fairbrother missed the halfway, so a bit like Fools and Horses were welcome. Jimmy Perry was actually a red coat in Butlins. <br /> <br /> Best episode: Peggy Big Chance, Series 2, Episode 2.
