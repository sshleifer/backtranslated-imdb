Piper, Prue and Phoebe bring Dr Griffiths to the manor to save him from The Source's personal salary man, Shax. While Phoebe looks in the Book of Shadows to shoot a spell at Shax, Prue and Piper attack Shax and pursue him on the street. Without listening to Prue and Piper, they were filmed by a news reporter and his operator using his powers and transmitting them directly on television. With Phoebe in Underworld, Prue, Piper and Leo have to find a way to make the damage. Leo goes to Phoebe and tells him that the charm has been witches. Piper is photographed by manic witch-wannabe and Prue has to take her to the hospital. The problem is that the crowds block the driveway. So Prue must use her magic in the crowd and go to the hospital. Piper has been pronounced and the SWAT team is moving in. Leo learns about Piper's death and goes to Phoeb to talk. Cole is asked to ask the source to reset the time and the source agrees; only when Phoebe turns to the blind. Phoebe agrees, but the deal breaks them. Over the surface Prue and Piper fight with Shax. Prue screams for Phoebe, who doesn't know them, is the underworld. Shax throws Piper and Prue through the wall and Dr Griffiths out the window. Prue will not be declared dead until the 4th season premiere episode "Charmed Again, Part One". <br /> <br /> "All hell is loose" is a thrilling episode and it made me sit on the edge of my seat. It is sad that Prue is dead but happy to have five more Charmed seasons. My voice; 10 out of 10
