I just saw the movie that should have been on time to feed the second level of MOW during the lifetime ... but trust the Irish language to be nothing but saccharin. Setting everything apart from SCREAMS "Here's a message about what's really important in life," but filling was the way to "Let's see what we can get here." <br /> <br /> This is two fantastic actresses - James McAvoy (like Rory) and Stephen Robertson (Michael). While Rory is offered for the foreseeable future, not the language and the attitude, he is in this life a "life force" and can easily be tolerated in his "caring" attitude - McAvoy keeps him sharp enough to keep him too sweet. But the revelation is Stephen Robertson as Michael. Since Leonardo Di Caprio's "Gilbert Grape", somebody has been so excited that I really believed he was an actor with brain damage. And his eyes ... my God, he can rip you. <br /> <br /> This movie is Rory paraphrase, f **** n 'amazing. Look at this. Take the Kleenex box and enjoy every well-earned tear ... and laugh.
