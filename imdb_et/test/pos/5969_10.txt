Reading Comments I have seen the obvious impact that this wonderful film has on the viewers. But how can you watch this movie and not reflect that artificial dialogue was subtle and so appealing to the authorities "under control" in this history of the USSR? It was not the souls only during the activity and the place where it was revealed. The superficially asked questions are naked provocative when they are here and now. Who are the real "companions"? I wonder that the writer was out of prison. I read somewhere that high stress can be a catalyst for high art production. This film is a masterpiece of malformation that seems to be in one direction, asking the audience to "look over my shoulder, what I'm actually talking about." With courage.
