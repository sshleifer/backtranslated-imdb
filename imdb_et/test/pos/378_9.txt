In Truffaut's book length interview with Hitchcock, it is clear that Big Ali's fear of the police comes from his childhood. His father sent him to a police station with a note. The note said, "He has been naughty, imprison him for an hour." Police officers are obliged, and since then, Hitchcock has had a deep fear that the police are accusing and taking it wrong. <br /> <br /> "Strangers on the train" is probably one of the best in its "wrongly accused" series. The film is based on Patricia Highsmith's novel. This is the same author who wrote the Ripley series. The opening of Hitchcock is very strong and will take you to the main characters: the famous tennis player Guy Haines and the aspiring criminal Bruno Anthony. Two men share the chemistry that was probably much more than that the audience could chew on that day and age. Bruno is trying to convince Guy that they can make a perfect murder (without hints) when changing victims. Bruno kills Guy's wife who doesn't give him a divorce, and Guy would kill Bruno's father. The motives are love and money, respectively. <br /> <br /> Bruno's performance is meant to be seductive and homoerotic. It's not accidentally done. In fact, Hitchcock changed two versions of the film: one from the United States, one from the United Kingdom. In the US version, Bruno's seduction volume was rather rejected. <br /> <br /> "Strangers on the train" is a very deep movie, but more importantly, this is another great Hitchcock thriller. An excellent example of an exciting scene is when Guy climbs into Bruno's father's room. Hitchcock argued that the audience should be distracted at this point so that they do not understand what the Guy finds in the room. Hitch treats us with a gigantic and menacing dog at the top of the stairs that distracted me. <br /> <br /> The most famous movie in the movie is tennis. Bruno has been constantly tracking Guy for Guy to complete his deal (kill his father). When the Guy watches the viewer, all the heads turn back and forth. Everything but one - Bruno. He looks directly at Guy, who is "i'll-get-you" with a smile. <br /> <br /> The end is another example of arrest. Both men are fighting for one of the main evidences on a frightening circle that is rotating at a mad speed. The employee indexes it so that it can get under control. When we finally get out of this race and the film ends with proof of Guy's innocence, we've been exhausted and nailed less (for those who still bite our spikes!). <br /> <br /> "Strangers on the train" is just one of Hitchcock's best "wrongly accused" movies. Some also credit him with one of the best crooks (Bruno). All in all, the film may be somewhat dated, but it is a lesson from the master of the thriller. I don't turn to Leonardo when he came to teach me a Renaissance painting, so you shouldn't. <br /> <br /> << The review was posted on FilmDailies.com >>
