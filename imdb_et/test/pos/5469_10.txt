There is almost no information about this movie or its dates. After an ongoing and thorough search, I found a DVD available on DVD from 3.99 on February 28, 2006. Try Yahoo / DVD and video. To send this information, I will continue to report that this is a well-made film with a real and exciting story about a mysterious carpenter who builds a very unusual staircase in the church. This is an opportunity to see William L. Peterson before C.S.I. made it a star. The story is just as respectable to Barbara Hershey - does anyone remember when she was Barbara Hershey Seagull? I have to write this in writing. Thank you to the previous commentators for taking the time to recommend this somewhat hidden television film, which obviously leaves many people with a lasting impression.
