Mark Walhberg has a great role to play, idolizing the rocky hill to the extent that he is aware of all his songs, imitating him to perfection and dressing him. If he has the opportunity to take over his "idol" role in the band, he jumps as far as possible. However, the role of a rock star may not be what it is cracked until ... and relationships can change .... This movie definitely hit me because the subject you are getting might not be what you think. when you get it. All in all, it is a really good movie that has great performances from both cast and two, Mark Walhberg and Jennifer Aniston. It made me feel sad, especially when Emily (Jennifer Aniston) met Seattle with Chris and saw the depth she had sunk. If someone has dreamed that you are a rock star or a groupie, they should watch this movie to see that the lifestyle, although glamorous for a while, is very lonely, and ultimately not what you want.
