I am fortunate to have a good quality copy of VHS on DVD so I can watch it again and again. The characters are so well played that I can't find the wrong way in any way. OK, so there are some differences in the book, but the old way of love that conquers everything is so strongly depicted that it doesn't affect. The reality of living in rural England in the early 19th century is apparently in contrast to the changing seasons, from the biting of the winter to the brilliant summer days, and it is reflected in various characters, from Prue's temptation to Kester's all-inclusive love. The story that changed my life.
