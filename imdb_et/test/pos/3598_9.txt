Forget all those people who say it's not as good as a book. So what? It's a movie. It's a joy to watch what's completely made of Cephallonia, with beautiful photography, but also with dark distracting moments. The only problem I have is the obvious confusion of Captain Corell as Nicolas Cage. In addition, the film was a very pleasant surprise.
