I would buy it and "thirty seconds over to today" if it exists. I also saw this movie after seeing Jack Webb on the big stalls in my Dress Blues highway at the age of 12. Always admired Jack Weeb as John Wayne and America all the time. Almost this film made it just 32 years ago, but it instead served as a reserve for the Air Force, Air Force and Army. Don't have seen this movie on TV at all and love it on a DVD. At least when it was on TV, I copied it to VHS and use it up to DVD. I also have a large number of WWII and Korean war movies, and I'm always looking for new releases on DVD.
