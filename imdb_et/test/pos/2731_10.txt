I've just seen the movie "15 Park Avenue", which was the first night-time movie at the Asian Society Human Film Festival in New York. The subject of this movie and the real "mith" imagination have really moved. Leading Actress Concon Sen Sharma.i There is only one word for everyone who reads this comment, run to get this pearl copy and look at it sincerely thanks to the director of the machine who has done a great job again. it was once in the blue month and I was lucky enough to see this movie on screen and also took part in the sharma after the film discussion / questions and answers session.
