I don't usually go to see my romantic comedy and maybe I want to come back to me after returning. The plot was simple and secret after advertising. You don't have to be Einstein to guess what happens after the first 15 minutes. What you can do is relax and let the world lead you to a world where "chemistry" is abundant and good guys win and you can just laugh and spend a good time. I love this movie .... and let the DVD order!
