This very fun short is considered to be one of the best short short and I definitely do not dispute it. Even in a country where high-quality animated shorts are regularly created, this film can stand out. If you have the opportunity to watch this movie, do it. It is only ten minutes long and it has a man who is obsessed with saws, a woman vacuuming in the bath and a nuclear war. What more could you do in the movie?
