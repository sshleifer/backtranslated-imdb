It's a kind of hidden gem. It has little or no promotion, fanfare, classic status, and it deserves all of the above! Fritz Lang, a great cinema director, has created a real heritage in this magnificent western part. Randolph Scott's fine casting (probably one of his greatest performances), always a strong Dean Jagger, Robert Young as a surprisingly achievable guy and many veteran players: Chill Wills, Slim Summerville, John Carradine, Barton MacLane and other Zane Gray story about Western Union Cable Installation country. It has tense drama, sense of humor and great effects. It resembles DeMille, but Fritz Lang leaves his temple. At least it's a fucking good west!
