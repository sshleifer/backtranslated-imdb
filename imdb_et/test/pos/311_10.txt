This film changed the art of film making, giving a complex story in a powerful new way. The film mixes brutal realism with fantasy, combining modern war with strange technical colors. The film uses music not as a later score, but as a practical part of the scene that plays from speakers, radios, and so on. Coppola uses classical literature, scenes and characters as inspiration and puts them in a completely different environment. It's a difficult and daring thing. Then he will take the superstar, Brando, pay him luck and film it so you can hardly see your face. The pure courage that such a move requires is amazing and works beautifully. This movie belongs to the top ten.
