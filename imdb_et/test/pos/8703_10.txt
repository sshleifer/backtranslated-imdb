for the first time I watched this movie years ago with my daughter, now 13 years old and in love with a vampire. we both thought it was a top film, then I looked at 11, then sub 111 now find that there is sub 1v that I can't wait to bring in my fangs, and also has a fifth in the piping. if no one has seen the movies. they are the best. I think it deserves thousands of Oscarees. I could watch them from morning to night. I love it because all the story lines continue from movie to film. these are typical vampire films that are better. I love to live in a life that is protruding in movies. it would make all my dreams come true
