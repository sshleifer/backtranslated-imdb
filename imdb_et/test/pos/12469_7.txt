I liked the first part of the movie in Africa for about an hour until the cruelty of a civilized animal in Scotland reached me the other half and made me so sad that I couldn't see it. But it was made by the filmmaker to make sure that the early scientists destroyed all the living things they did not understand, "exploring" it literally to death, without exploring the rights and comfort of the animals we studied, which we do not know today. Learn everywhere, but in the natural world where they live, and as prominently as possible. I recommend this movie because it was mostly a serious and honest story of Tarzan, which showed that in the 19th century science world, safe livestock farming and a clean and simple, beautifully primitive life were in Tarzan. a young man found as a child and chicks after his parents' violent death in the African jungle. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lambert was excellent in his life as Tarzan's role and very soulful, as did Ralph Richardson in his last film role as Tarzan's superb, noble-german reeker in Scotland. Andy MacDowell was beautiful and pretty good as Tarzan's gussied-up and civilized "Jane" in his first film role. From his charismatic activity in this film and from his very haunting eyes, I do not understand why Lambert did not become a big star later, but his really bad film choices could later make him. The amazing Ian Holm, as a wounded Frenchman in Africa with the help of Tarzan, who then sent Tarzan back to his previously unknown Scottish ancestral home, was as great as ever. <br /> <br /> I am so glad that Tarzan became ill and was not in an animal-cruel civilized world at that time and finally went to Africa to live his life with his delicate and loving non-human relatives who brought him instead to stay in Scotland and live like a royalties that would have destroyed him if he didn't kill him first.
