I discovered and love this movie. Just a fast moving story, entertaining characters, fun moments (but not superfluous jokes) and fun performances from Kelsey's grammar, Harry Dean Stanton, Ron Schneider, Rip Tower and more. Buckman is especially good, and I really enjoyed watching Stapanick playing the man. <br /> <br /> I also find it interesting that they used a real submarine, Pampanitot, to play from above and emit it almost exactly for their kits. The set decoration is really impressive when you make a online tournament in Pampanito's network and compare it to movie scenes. They did a great job with this movie. <br /> <br /> What a light, entertaining and truly enjoyable movie!
