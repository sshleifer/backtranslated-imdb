This sequel proves that Tim Burton was the best choice for managing Batman for all purposes and purposes. The story focuses on Baman, who takes three enemies: Penguin (played well by Danny DeVito) Catwoman (slinky Michelle Pfeiffer) and Max Shreck (great Christopher Walken). <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best item in the series, it's all: complicated themes, complex characters, and a dark tone that really looks like. The cast is just wonderful, although the obvious condition is DeVito as a multi-layered penguin. Here is a guy who is evil, merciful, funny and perhaps the most important, scary. The infamous scene with Shrecki's image consultants still sends his backbone. In other words, it is just a pleasure to watch and turn to first class performances. <br /> <br /> I do not hesitate to say that "Batman Returns" is my favorite of all Batman favorites (sorry, Dark Knight fans). If you want a superhero movie that has a little more to offer than flashy effects and great action, then watch this badly underrated movie. <br /> <br /> If nothing else, it's the best movie, Tim Burton.
