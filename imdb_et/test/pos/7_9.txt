Our family (and the entire audience of the sneak previews sold) enjoyed The Guardian. Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher gave convincing performances as the fictional helicopter rescue characters, Ben and Jake. After seeing this movie, you can't imagine how hard it is to be a USCG helicopter rescuer and finish one day in real rescue. <br /> <br /> While this is a fictional film, it provided quite convincing virtues for team spirit, dedication and bravery, which were exhibited by all US US Coast Guard members. <br /> <br /> The special effects used to create rescue scenes were incredible. In fact, you felt you were involved in real salvation. <br /> <br /> I feel the movie could have been done without the Hollywood bar scene (if you see the movie, you can agree) because the actual Coast Guard does not agree with this behavior. <br /> <br /> Very fun, very action packed, definitely worth it. Thank you, U. S. Coast Guard and REAL Helicopter Rescue Services, "So Others Can Live". I highly recommend this movie to everyone.
