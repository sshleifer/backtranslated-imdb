It was a great pleasure for me recently to look at this beautifully filmed wide-screen adaptation of the revival of the 1943 stage (unlike the original 1935 production), which contained extensive recidivists. It was fashionable at that time, so blame the film for its 16-year tradition. The film should only be seen when Sammy Davis Jrs is a great cat show like Sportin Life, hiding in and out. His seduction from Dorothy Dadridge's BESS "New York City will soon be a boat ride" is one of many highlights. Almost all basic music is healthy and beautifully sung. Definitely not what the latest PBS and MET versions did. It was a pleasure to see that time has not reduced the film and hopefully will be made available to generations who have not had the opportunity to experience it in the near future.
