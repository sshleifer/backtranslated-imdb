Dirty Dancing is one of my MOST favorite movies. I watched it twice in ABC because I haven't had the opportunity to buy or rent it from Blockbuster. I had no idea that Jennifer Gray was 27 years old when she was a teenager, because she was a teenager. Compared to some Hollywood women, she has a very flat chest, so I was so easily fooled by her age. So Gray pulls both physically and emotionally well. I also loved dancing - who doesn't? Both times I've watched Dirty Dancing, I want to search for dance courses. I also love the soundtrack and I feel some songs when I was eight or nine. I would like to see it in my drama class and I will ask my teacher at some point whether the part of the film he can use for educational purposes exists. This is much better than what he was following last year. And the end was completely FANTASTIC. This is one of the best moments in the movie. <br /> <br /> I can't believe I'm waiting for the first day of school because Dirty Dancing! Who could have a better impact on this movie?
