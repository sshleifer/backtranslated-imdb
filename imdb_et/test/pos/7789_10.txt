I love this movie. Shehzad Khan is a Bhalla a.k.a. was so much fun. When he hit during the fighting phase, he heard him worship. Viju Khote is silly Robert Rabbit. I love this Shakti Kapoor a.k.a. "Crime Master Gogo". The double role of Paresh Rawal is so awesomely fun as it represents Ramgopal Bajaj & Shyamgopal Bajaj. Raveena Tandon and Karishma Kapoor are out of this world. My brother really makes a good impression of saying Bhalla. "Relax. PLEASE RELAX." I love the scene where Aamir Khan puts on Salman a laxative "Muscles" Khan food that caused irregular bowel movements that forced him to use the toilet several times several times.
