NOROI follows the documentary, Masafumi Kobayashi, as he slowly discovers something mysterious and evil that again leaves the corpses behind. After interviewing a woman who claims to hear loud baby shouts coming from a house next door (where there is no child), Kobayashi leads the neighbor. He welcomes the hostile, dirty woman (Maria Takagi) who responds to the door (and hitting it immediately on her face) and looks through her window to her 6-year-old son. Strangely enough, both the woman and her son disappear only a few days after her visit (leaving behind dead pigeons) and the woman who first complained about the noise and her daughter are both mysterious. The accident is not long after that. That makes Kobayash's interest and he's trying to find out what's going on. He soon discovers that people with psychological abilities and sensory perception seem to be tuned for something bad, inexplicable, and even apocalyptic. A well-known 10-year-old psychic and TV celebrity, Kana (Rio Kanno) seems to think we can all be doomed, but it disappears mysteriously before it can help much. Involved with another female psychologist / actress (Marika Matsumoto), as well as Mr Nori, a mentally unstable cake / psychologist who carries a hat and jacket made of aluminum foil and thinks that people eat what he refers to as "ectoplasmic worms". Finally, the hints return to a small village that is now covered with a lake, and a legend of an ancient ancient demon known as Kagutabana ... <br /> <br /> Unlike many other hand-held horrors, as much of a plot depends on being reactive to the first person intimidation. Fortunately, there is a story here, very interesting and complicated, so it doesn't depend on the glimpses of terrible things through spastic camera work every time for some time to keep your interest. Traveling to Masafum in search of truth around the following leaders - well-placed with runners along the way - reminded me somewhat of THE OMEN at this pace. The film does not fully reflect the material recorded by the documentary, but the news programs and the television series show that what we are watching is already a documentary. This helps break down some of the monotony that is usually associated with movies in this particular style. The performances are good enough not to damage the realism of the actual material. In general, it is a well-made horror film with lots of parcels, some distances, and quite a few really horrible moments. My only real grip is that he could have been little here and there and there seems to be a little too long. Otherwise things are good.
