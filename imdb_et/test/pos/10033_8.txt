The historical inaccuracies of this film are well documented. It was never meant to be serious in history, but a fun saga and it succeeded. Errol Flynn was never better because this role was customized for him. Olivia DeHavilland was never more beautiful. Arthur Kennedy is never worse. Anthony Quinn is never superior to Crazy Horse. It had a lot of humor and stamens and kept your interest. One of the historical aspects that I most probably found inaccurately was the last "Last Stand" that took place at Little Big Horn banks. The film version was filmed in a desert where there was no river. However, I consider typical Hollywood entertainment.
