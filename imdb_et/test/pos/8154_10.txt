I watched this movie today on LOGO television. I was completely fascinated by the powerful messages and plot line of this movie. I don't want to spoil it. I say this, I'm connected to Aaron's inner struggle and upbringing. As a gay guy growing up in a small town, I communicated well with the "big secret" and the choices I made. This film has had a tremendous impact on me and I intend to buy a copy for my personal library in the near future. I'm no longer than a movie and I started calling my friends to recommend it. It had such a profound effect on me. For those who read this comment. Look out. Try to get as little attention as possible. Also keep an open mind. This is not a movie that can be viewed as a Disney movie or a weekly movie. Instead, take the time to watch and actively listen to the dialogue, as well as read the rows and participate in the plot. You can find yourself in tears. Not because "Steel Magnolias" has brought the film into tears. It did just that. Thank you to the creator and writer, and to the team that produces an emotionally charged romantic film about homosexuality and religion. It's been a long time.
