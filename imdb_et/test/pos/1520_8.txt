Cabinet land is not a happy movie. Nor is it related to any social realism. This is probably its strength. The distance from a particular time and from the nations reinforces the message, makes it more powerful and removes the burden of nationalism and propaganda that you often understand in films that criticize countries as opposed to (I am, of course, US propaganda) some commercial films). <br /> <br /> The Bit Chapel is so much more than a message. This is a pure, surrealistic film with beauty that is filled with the same clean, clinical form as in 1984 and is equal. <br /> <br /> I am an old Alan Rickman, a man with a golden sarcasm (and I can add, an incomparable sex appeal ;-)). The game between him and Madeleine Stowe is great. Every time I see him, he seems to play the last character of the character ... <br /> <br /> But quite down. No movie. I don't want crashing cars, but I want something to happen, except for pure talking. In a few hours, I got from the interrogation room, from the foreseeable activities, and more than anything I wanted from a comprehensive perspective, the world, the past lives of the characters, and the other missing framework. Some people have a nice touch. Something less positive for me. <br /> <br /> In any case, Closet Land is worth the movie, which is the right time for you to make a trip to the human nature abyss. <br /> <br /> And for us who really loves Alan Rickman.
