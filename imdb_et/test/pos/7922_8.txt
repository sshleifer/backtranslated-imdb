(Warning: spoilers! - although it's hard to comfort the story with details.) <br /> <br /> Eisenstein's black-and-white propaganda film is not for everyone. It's very old and it's clumsy. This makes me an excellent soundtrack, not the original, but an updated soundtrack. Better yet, the orchestral version of Prokofiev has been created (my favorite film is Fritz Reiner and Chicago Symphony). <br /> <br /> Film is sometimes funny. It is reminiscent of the old "John's Day Dream". Some outdoor conditions are quite large. Some actors are also quite big. (An actor who played Nevsky could have been a superstar today. Ditto's warrior chick, Vasilisa - definitely a rocker.) <br /> <br /> It may be the world's best compilation on film, in Russian. (many tons of them - they make up the majority of the lines under discussion). <br /> <br /> Battle scenes are actually much more realistic than most high-budget Hollywood flutes. These men are as clumsy as their fight is a real peasant. Weapons are looking nasty, so the actors tried to avoid each other's wounds. <br /> <br /> German "grand marshall" playing actress tries * really * hard to watch the frightening movie at first, but she looks like she was really pussycat. After he's caught, he looks so pathetic. (Speaks about the volume per target group, da?) <br /> <br /> A truly humorous touch is that the German army brings * an organ * with a game played by black clothes. See how the Russians lay down this man when he plays. <br /> <br /> After the battle ends and almost all Germans are dead, the best part of the movie (and music) will come. for dead soldiers who have died in defending their homeland. This part is so sad that it is almost an anti-war statement. <br /> <br /> Ten times more men than women have rated this movie. Wonder why? <br /> <br /> Warning: Joseph Stalin liked this movie. Ironic - he killed more Russians than anyone else. "Those who come to Russia with the sword will die through the sword."
