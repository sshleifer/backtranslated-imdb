French people are not known to be big filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Although Amelie appreciates the high scores of Oscar. Asterix et Obelix is ​​a very different film of what I am used to in French. This is a great movie especially for kids. The only thing I liked was that it was spoken in French and subtitled. Normally, with English-speaking films (here in the Netherlands), I don't have to read subtitles. But in French you just have to understand. The story she is about is just for Obelix, who doesn't remember her fat fat, but there are also nice details in names like brucewillix and malcomix. You all know the story of comics and this movie shows the entire slide by slide. Everything is about braking the Sfinx nose until the red-red beards are lost from three more ships. I'd say an excellent movie with the kids over the weekend.
