The approach is what contemporary attitudes to films like Boogie Nights need to be changed. Approaching is terrible! Compared to Pulp Fiction, looking only at pornography and all its aspects .. people come in, this beautiful movie is more than that. And for all skeptics, Paul Thomas Anderson has not valued himself again and again? Magnolia is one of the main reasons I watch movies at all and still believe in this "industry" that making movies is nowadays. And how's the blood? This is a movie that stays in the film's history, whether it likes it or not! Yes, you! The so-called consumer .. you know something: F # * k you! you don't deserve it, you don't deserve anything. So many artists today struggle to gain recognition and have become more and more difficult to make serious films, even the mainstream, because people just want to see celebrities doing stupid things. This sells Britney Spears. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it was very painful for me to say, because I don't want to see it, I don't want to believe that today it's all about the importance of adding numbers. Sales revenue and sales revenue. I want to see magic, the magic that Fellini, Bergman and Kurosawa brought and created through the cinema language. Because what PTA does is doing magic !!
