what was the quote from the archive at the end of the film about the person's past? this film was very disturbing to look in the sense that it was a real story and to believe that mankind is still so cruel after these years that I am ashamed. <br /> <br /> Everyone is human and everyone has the right to live their life in peace and harmony <br /> <br /> live and live <br /> <br /> if anyone knows the quote, please let me know Thank you you should show this film a lot to the public as to the real events that are terrible, as shown in the movie, should be known to everyone in the hope that things will change sooner rather than later.
