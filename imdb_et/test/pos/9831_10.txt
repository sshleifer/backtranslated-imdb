I have to get older because I was swallowed by this movie when I first saw it. I'm looking at it right now at HBO. It is a very simple film about 2 people who fall in love when they discovered that the spouses had a thing. The plot is very thin, but the actors acted very well in this movie. When mixed with Kristen Scott Thomas Congress and Harrison Ford Home Affairs Officer, these two are unfortunate and in love. I love the soundtrack. Perfect fit. One thing I couldn't understand was the budget of $ 68 million for this movie. Did it take? Is there a crash or a Harrison Ford salary?
