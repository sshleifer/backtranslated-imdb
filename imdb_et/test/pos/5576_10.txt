I love this play. It is refreshing to take in some older sci-fi feelings and styles. they are not afraid to shoot and when they do, they die. Too much fear is fearful and, ultimately, they point to weapons and then it is separate. Farscape is also equipped with a large number of heartbeat signs. They all grow up with you up to the point where it's confusing to hear how they're discussing taking some animated tricks to make a mini-series. From start to finish, farscape leaves you with hope and stigma when new and unexpected things happen, and then people live and die, surprise you every time. It's worth a look, even if you don't have time.
