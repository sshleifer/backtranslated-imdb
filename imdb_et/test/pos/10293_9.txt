When I looked at L'Appartement with my girlfriend, she sighed, "How complicated!" And of course he is right. If you're used to simple, monotonous plots, especially violent heroes and convulsions, L'Appartement is difficult to follow. Here, too, some negative reviewers have forgotten one or more important points. Other confusion about the confusing flash. Come on! This is not a movie that can be visited, returned and put together again in seconds. This requires full concentration and a special look at the details. Then it is not that difficult to understand what is going on and when. The director has left more than enough clues from all the scenes. <br /> <br /> The first 3/4 movie focuses on the question: why did Max and Lisa divide? The film, as my girlfriend noted, begins with romantic love, suggesting that two lost lovers will find each other again. Having gained experience with French films, I predicted that the story would soon be sick and I was right. At the end of the first part, it turns out that after several turns Alice has manipulated Max and Lisa. Max didn't know Lisa had left and why. Lisa didn't know why Max hadn't contacted her in Rome and left her mark when she came back to Paris. The only one who was Alice and had her reasons to keep her mouth shut. <br /> <br /> After both Max and Lisa have found the truth, this will of course become a question: can Alice's manipulations be withdrawn? Of course not, time has passed and things have changed. <br /> <br /> Many European films use story technology that I fully enjoy. There is no basic conflict at first, after which two (or more) interested parties try to decide for themselves. Instead, the spectator is gradually fed with plot pieces and barely familiar with the main characters. L'Appartement is a fine and exquisite example of this technique. In the first semester, Alice seems to be lateral; slowly it turns out that he is a key figure. <br /> <br /> Action is just great. Vincent Cassel is a perfect, somewhat na√Øve and impulsive character who just threatens a safe life from a past dream. Monica Belucci is, of course, very beautiful, but also competent. Jean Paul Ecoffey offers the necessary comic touch. Roman Bohringer is very convincing as a neurotic woman who is afflicted with guilt and regret. <br /> <br /> The only reason I didn't give it is the somewhat dissatisfied end. Of course it was necessary for symmetry. After all the events, Max is just where the movie started, but wiser and sad. Alice has paid for her sins. But still the small twists at the airport are a little artificial. Max is just changing Lisa to Alice; Too easy, Alice decides to reject Max who has been her dream for so long; Max goes back slightly to his groom. But then again, I don't know how to achieve it without sacrificing elegant symmetry. I think sometimes artists have to give up the realism of beauty.
