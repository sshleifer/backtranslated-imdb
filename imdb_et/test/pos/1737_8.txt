In September 2003, I heard that the BBC is going to rise to DOCTOR WHO and make it "bigger and better", but I heard these rumors in the press and thought it was all they were - rumors. But then it was mentioned that Russell T Davies is going to show and write an exhibition and then one Saturday afternoon in March 2004, Channel 4 news interviewed the actor's role play - Christopher Eccleston. Yes, Christopher Eccleston is an actor I have always impressed with LET HIM HAVE IT and his television interview. Since months passed more and more information leaked, Billie Piper was cast, the Daleks came back, and The Mill, a Hollywood influence company who had made FAD for GLADIATOR, signed the show's special effects. Already for several weeks before the first broadcast trailer announced the return of the new series massively, London-based billboards informed the public about the return of the exhibition, tabloid newspapers made huge spreads of alien photographs, and Christopher Eccleston appeared in such diverse programs as BLUE PETER, MASTERMIND (which was a special DOCTOR WHO at night) edition). In fact, it was DOCTOR WHO's new series in the British television history's most hypnotized program, it was a better bloody good. So it was bloody good? Undoubtedly, it has been a great success for almost every episode that prioritized TV cards. In order to give you the tip of your rating success, only one episode of the old series (The Ark In Space episode two - Febuary 1975) led to its top ten. The open series episode transformed two more episodes into three, which beat or equaled the previous record, and this is an era when there is much more competition for TV channels and choices. We laugh and rejoice that DOCTOR WHO FILLING HIT ME BABY ONE MORE TIME, CELEBRITY WRESTLING and tasted ANT AND DEC'S Saturday night. Of course, much of the progress is still on a breath-taking vision and a prominent prestigious actor. In most cases, everything you see on the screen is equal to everything you see in the Spielberg / Hollywood movie. There is the Dalek invasion force, numbering tens of thousands, exotic aliens, 19th-century Cardiff, which looks like 19th-century Cardiff and night-time filming, which is actually night-time filming and is not being darkened by a dark filter over the screen. I promise you will hear a lot more from the directors of this series, especially Joe Ahearne one day on the Hollywood A list. <br /> <br /> The new DOCTOR WHO series has some bugs. and all these should be put on the door of Russell T Davies. Perhaps it is debatable whether the soap opera and postmodern elements are successful or not (I do not think it is), but what is not disputed is that the weakest scripts are written by TTA. As I mentioned in my CASANOVA review, he deceives the public and he does the same thing: when armed soldiers are confronted with his weapons, the doctor makes a "delta delta", which does not make sense to anyone, but allows him to escape from a tight place, pulls naked Captain Jack abruptly expels the laser he hides and RTD scripts are full of this type of fraud and the end of the end machina type machus. In fact, the last episode is a very corrupt concept of what the "bad wolf" has felt, that it seems to be more dense on the spot than the doctor. And about the endings I'm trying to remember if any of them was actually a doctor? More often than a supportive character or medical associate who saves the day. The exhibition is called DOCTOR WHO does ROSE TYLER, so we see the title character to save the day please, as it did in the classic series? One last point about depicting a doctor is how he has written a laugh. Eccleston is the best known for his serious and gloomy roles and he is completely breathless when he sees sadness as he is a tear that falls on his face at the end of the world, but more often than he has written as "Tom Baker's speed" character. It is obvious why Eccleston has not done much comedy during his career - he is not very good at it. <br /> <br /> Will I start to show myself in the rain? I'm sorry I didn't want to, but it's just that, while some expectations have been met or exceeded some others, and they're almost all that Russell T Davies, who fortunately contributes less scripts to the next series ARST, KES. Let's look at more traditional stories from a human outpost threatened by monsters, as we saw in the 1960s and 70s, imagining a story like The Sea Devils with a huge budget led by Joe Ahearne! Oh and one last application - do we see these "NEXT TIME" trailers demolished? They show all the best bits of the next week's episode
