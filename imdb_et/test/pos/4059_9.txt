Robert DeNiro and Eddie Murphy, which team. Although Rene Russo, William Shanter, and this guy from everyday video, are next to the ride. It's a funny and wonderful movie. Not only that, but it's a good friend, it tends. <br /> <br /> Tom Dey (Shanghai Noon) controls this movie in hell. From the beginning to the end it was a masterpiece. There is no sense of humor here. But the good old time laughs. Have fun with all the other police art (naming some of Lethal Weapon, Beverly Hills Cop, fifteen minutes ...) <br /> <br /> If you want to see the movie, look at it. You love it. It's a great cast and a team. So, go out with your ** watching "COPS" and see "Showtime" for the police officer. And remember that they are protesting your neighbor um ... um ... oh! Friday night at 8.00 (man, everyone says I'm a bad writer).
