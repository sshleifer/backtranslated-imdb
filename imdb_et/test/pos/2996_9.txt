When I saw this movie from a video camera at the department store ... I was interested. Considering that I thought I loved and I was in the same age as the youngsters in this movie (although I understand they are old enough to be my parents), in addition to Elton John & Bernie's soundtrack Taupin just before, when they made "big" in North America ... I thought I had nothing to lose. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> So far I have shown it to many men I've ever been to, and my current boyfriend ... they probably didn't find it as cute as I did. .. preferring to call this "chick" movie ... but I still laugh and cry. This film was ignored. It is good to see that it is rentable from one of the local video stores so other people can share magic. <br /> <br /> So maybe it is a bit far removed ... but it gives you a sense of brilliant innocence ... and renewed faith in love.
