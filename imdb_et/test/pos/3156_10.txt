USA The film is like this: you are warmly welcomed on Sunday afternoon. It seems good to close your eyes and let your worries go away. Soon you will be lost in one of those intense dreams where you know that you are dreaming, but you still can't wake up - not what you want. You are going to flow, and you must be a kind of strange Alice in Wonderland story that contains letters you didn't think you could dream of. They tell you about all kinds of crazy things about war and peace, bringing you through the past and even the future. <br /> <br /> The dream will become more difficult and you will feel that it goes along a road that cannot be controlled. You may want to wake up to try to open your eyes, but you can't. Now the destruction and sadness and confusion and frightening voices that tell you what might be the truth or what might be wrong. You see pictures that are flashing and changing and then appear, but do you even want to see what the brain is creating for you? Finally you are lost in the myth world and you realize that the ending is over. The end of the world and the end of the dream. It's over. What do you wake up? What are you doing next? <br /> <br /> You may be writing this dream because you know that dreams like it don't happen too often - and if they watch it better. Or maybe you burst beer and forget the whole thing. Bad idea. Do not forget.
