I thought it was a very brave representation of the so-called "Tarzan" concept so popular by old Holoca, Weismuller, and others. <br /> <br /> Yes; there are many stupid things. But then the idea is stupid. It is almost unbelievable that the human body can breast-feed chimpanzees. I am tempted to say absolutely unbelievable, but this idea has never been tried. And it is a bit too much for the convenience of anthropomorphism. In such circumstances, I see how it would be very difficult to avoid it. Now we also have a much greater insight into the issues of acculturation, and we know that a person raised from childhood without human behavior will never learn in adulthood. <br /> <br /> However, when you get your head around it there is a lot to admire, which is as imaginative as bold. Lambert makes a huge amount of beast things. I am tempted to say that this is the most convincing and compassionate role I played for him. There are also many other great performances. At least they are Sir Ralph Richardson and Ian Holm. <br /> <br /> What is particularly worrying - and rightly so - is human. We see ourselves from the point of view of almost poor, foolish, helpless brothers, whom we control so routinely. And it shows well how the fake "civilization" and "morality" with which we conceal and justify our behavior are not merely an expression of selfishness and arrogance. It may seem somewhat overvalued, especially in outrageous museum dissection rooms, but what we see is not just the truth about Victorian; the truth about how we are today. This is one that needs to be noted and that cannot be said often enough. Holm's obsession with "ray-zor" as a symptom of civilization - if it were to have facial hair was a primitive condition to be intimidated - is an excellent example. Primitive bearded readers note. <br /> <br /> The story is frustrating. Ultimately, it is a tragedy. For though he returns to the jungle and freedom from moral tyranny, which is truly human civilization; we know he's doomed. Before the third millennium, the 50-year-old wild simulations have been abandoned as shrub meat and their environment has been developed to utilize agriculture and minerals to satisfy an unsatisfactory person. <br /> <br /> Finally, this is a story about yourself. People must finally follow the other end of the simanas. <br /> <br /> It is highly recommended to be ethical, despite hockey moments.
