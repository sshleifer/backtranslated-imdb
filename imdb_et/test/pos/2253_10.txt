"Everything is Illuminated" is like watching a fine museum of high quality artwork. It penetrates the emotions through a very wide spectrum. Jonathan Safran Foer plays with Elijah Wood. She is looking for her father's estate in Ukraine. His trips bring him together with Alex, played very well and with extreme humor Eugene Hutz. His grandfather is the most emotional tie of this film and is represented by Boris Leskin skillfully. If human beings have little humor in this cinema, it is only necessary to turn to Mikke, a true dog called Alex and his grandfather named Sammy Davis Jr. They also call him "the eye of vision". Cinematic art is remarkable. Colors are a very important part of the film patch. This is a movie that is worth the time and emotional investment.
