I would just like to tell you a few things before seeing this movie. If at one point or another you thought you had seen a good camera job, be prepared to surprise this movie. For this film, this film was made in Russia in 1957, but the technique used here is probably something we have seen in the western world much later ... about 20 years later. The level of sensitive emotions through the film varies a lot: happiness - a joy of war-despair, but in the end you become something quite unique: to see a masterpiece of a film making. Young filmmakers of our time should study more of these films and maybe they can create something like that ... although I think such movies are very difficult to get ... If you've seen "I'm Cuba" then this movie would love you very, but if not, be prepared for a unique experience. Russian directors have something in common: very small budgets, great actors and the joy of creating art ... and yes, they can create more masterpieces than the whole western world together. I'm not a big fan of Russia, I really hate everything that is communist, but making a film in this part of the world can create feelings that are hard to describe. <br /> <br /> Enjoy it. br /> <br />
