I really love this movie !!! I have not played Final Fantasy VII, but I still loved the movie, its really funny and I love the work that has been done by the voters. The visuals are so fantastic and all the lines are so well done. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I have a pretty good imagination, so I was able to fill most of the gaps I made, and I suggest you look at it twice, because a lot of "suddenly" is reasonable. <br /> <br /> Also (it's pretty funny) you should watch it with subtitles, because what they say and say is sometimes completely different. It really is usually pretty funny, but sometimes it helps to understand what they say better. <br /> <br /> Look at it !!! I love Marnie
