Certainly the highlighting of this film is cast. <br /> <br /> Diana Rigg, George C. Scott, Bernard Hughes, to mention some. <br /> <br /> I have accumulated more time in hospitals and with doctors over the years as I think. <br /> <br /> This comedy is attacking bounce and pretension in all aspects of our society by setting it up as one of the most "naughty" ... Medical profession. <br /> <br /> The idea that such events might be possible can be a shock to some, but it is a pleasure for anyone with experience. <br /> <br /> Dr. Brock (Scott) is going through a crisis of living in our monumental proportions, as we and he will be happy to participate in Miss Drummond (Rigg). <br /> <br /> The Absurd yarn is woven into this marvelous mess in the form of irony that the hospital seems to be killing its employees when they mismanage their affairs. <br /> <br /> The climax is unpredictable (if you don't think it's even more fun than you think. <br /> <br /> It's not everyone's sense of humor to be confident and surprisingly funny "Dark Moments "when you are open to them." I loved every minute and was glad to see it on the DVD.
