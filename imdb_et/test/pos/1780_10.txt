Decalogue 5 can be considered a violent accusation against the death penalty, according to the fifth commandment "You must not kill": it does not accidentally put the concept of the state fully into line with the provisions of unfair law on the same plane as the murderer. "But the law may not mimic nature, it can fix it," says counsel protector Piotr, the true nature of the catalyst, "punishment is a form of revenge that aims to bring evil back to evil without crime. On whose behalf the law takes revenge? Really innocent? on behalf of? The frightening and detailed sequence of the last half hour of a person sentenced to death makes it a worthless deterrent to the death penalty to intimidate all possible criminals. "Desperate calamities do not require desperate measures," says Kieslowski in his message, teaching us how unjust may be the commandment of disobedience to God's command, which understands the punishment in the same way as a crime. There are three different moral attitudes: MURDERER rebellion, which is aimed at irritating the hostile generation of the surrounding environment; The strong sense of VICTIM's chronic indifference that tends to laugh at other people's needs; The force majeure behavior of the SIZE is always ready to fight accidents against human life. Fighting for life is always shamefully revived; The characters are deepened into scenes of distress and stress, with the green tones highlighted in the urban landscape reflected by the taxi windscreen. Everything in "Dekalog 5" gives a terrifying sense of alienation and isolation: descriptions of the underworld of violence and stupid waste, scenes of precarious working conditions, real visions of anonymous aura of bad buildings, purposeful trips to a despicable environment. The main character, Jazek, is forced to struggle with his opponent's strength when the city is surrounded by deep indifference, apparently hostile, deaf to all of his silences, while the lost photo of the first communion dress. goes to the soul of your soul. He irreversibly directs his steps toward the disassembled route through 18 mm deformations. A wide-angle camera lens designed to distort every detail, making it a reality, making it distant and alien echoing. Kieslowski does not support the attenuating circumstances of melabrama honey-tongued tones in favor of the defendant, unlike some Hollywood stereotypes such as Robert Wise ("I Want to Live"). It does not slip uselessly to alleviate the guilty scenes of the miserable scenes of Jazek and to alleviate the brutality of the crime, not at all in the psychological motivations that justify displaying extreme or violent behavior and refusing to use some useless legal procedure. In other words, according to Kieslowsky, "crime is always a crime": according to the principle of "par condicio", he puts the prosecutor on the same level as the convicted person, using many signs or symbols to represent the society seen in the most sinful light. And we cannot remain indifferent: even if we disagree with him, Jazek's anxieties touch our hearts in the same way as Terri Schiavo's pleasing eyes.
