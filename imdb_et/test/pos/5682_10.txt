I've read a lot of comments about movies and the only things I've seen are common to all of them: "boring" and "unrealistic." <br /> <br /> First, they used a real frickin 'Crocs! How much more realistic do you get? No CGI, animation, miniatures. Just croc and meat. Have fun, husbands! <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that this movie will start slowly. It takes a while for the character to develop, which little they were, and I think it is, above all, where this film is missing. <br /> <br /> But when the movie goes, I found that it has grown dramatically. I do not want to say that there are many measures. If anything, there are more moments where the crook can't be seen at all and people are waiting. But we know there is no relief, and that croc is limited in time. It had a similar horrible feeling to other films that got their fear out of action, like Open Water (another film that some viewers have criticized as "boring"). Personally, I think that viewers who can't feel the tension have surgically removed their attention during the event, but it's just me. <br /> <br /> Finally, the characters feel real and the situation is that it can really happen to anyone in the right situation. In addition, deaths are completely real and sometimes it's a bit tough to look at. <br /> <br /> All this is a winner.
