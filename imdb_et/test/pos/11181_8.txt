Considering that unfortunately they could not be found anywhere, I have not tried any of the other series entries, although I certainly do not mind and trust me, I've seen. For anyone who doesn't know, this is a point-to-click adventure. This means that the mouse is what you use to join everything you can do with it, although there is one specific case where it is inaccurate. I don't break it here, anyone who hasn't tried it yet. Nonetheless, you can sit down and try, no matter how little computer experience you have. It doesn't even have a lot of bits where you need to have a quick or quick reflex. Heck, you can adjust the text speed (if you have subtitles) and talk about it and it's not slowly inconvenient or forced. Access to your stocks is easy, but you can also connect or use items. Clicking and holding a button that you can influence will give you three ways to use it (be it a person, a part of your surroundings, or an object): hand (push, pick up, open, etc.), eyes (explore, look through, etc.) and mouth (eat, chat, etc.). All this adds to a friendly and friendly environment where you can approach rich riddles (their amount is varied, depending on which of the two hardships you try) at your own pace and explore and take dozens of individual, creatively made symbols and areas with your heart's content. Its length depends on how much time you take to do it (you don't hear me, they are worth it) and your skills in finding solutions. There are some points where you can decide if you want the harder way or not. It can be enjoyed by anyone, from any age. There is no material that is not acceptable to children. It is one of the products that help prove that it does not mean that it is unbearable for older target groups. Animation is quality work, smooth, everything moves as it should, and the third dimension honestly doesn't try to try it. The story is well done and you never know what's going on. There are many well-targeted scenes that are kept in the same colorful, mostly bright 2D world as the rest of the well-made camera movement. "Cartoony" is the right word to describe it and not just visual style. It can be applied to all of this. Its whole world is very similar, but not quite the same as we, with the mixture of the past and the present, inhabited and filled with things that we can recognize or understand at least parts, but the absurdity makes them funny. It should be one of its greatest strengths, there: it's fun. A lot of what comes from the lines that are being spoken (what is said about how it is), and those who dig British efforts, focusing on verbal, like "Allo Allo" or the BlackAdder franchise, want to control that infant. There are, however, many different kinds of jokes, including, but not limited to, satire, wisdom, blind, stupidity, irony, comedy (not exactly my favorite aspect) and much more. There is self-consciousness, for which you happen to be personally and, for example, explaining why it is not going to do what you have just asked for. For decades, there are references to pop culture. Almost everything works, hardly anything falls, and if you are not stitching at that time, my best guess would be that it is not just in line with your sense of humor ... a situation that does not require and if it is suspected that it may happen, and want to know, i offer a demo version where you can see for free whether you care for the game badge and / or laughter. The plot is well written (almost everything is really), progressing well and keeping your interest well. Sound is all great, crisp and well done. Sound effects are on the ground. Music is well drafted without exceptions. Voting is impeccable, celebrity or two. Armato is fantastic as Guybrush Threepwood (whom I love this name) you control. Boen is incredible as LeChuck, a dead (and still threatening) zombie villain. The designs are extremely well made, very imaginative and all fit. In spite of our hero's relative limitations when it comes to pirates, you must participate. Control the ship, steer it with others and match the blades in a rather unique and admirable sense. The playability consists mainly of choices, during dialogue, etc. It is linear, where freedom is within the order so that the buccaneer who sits with it at least twice hasn't got that great deal of opportunity, if it is disputed, unless he has forgotten what to do in the meantime. Ah, nothing is perfect. Anyone who cares thoroughly for a well-designed and fascinating fictional universe and unexploded countless times should really come out of it. Good, not the ones that hurt and can make bruises. Don't forget kids, don't * don't eat books ... it's just paper-cut. I would think those who love others would appreciate it too. And they are not the only ones who can get into it. In addition to the members of the above mentioned group, I also recommend this to the fan of this VG genre as well as to anyone who likes this review. 8/10
