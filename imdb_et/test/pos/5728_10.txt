I myself am a student of physics and I have to say that I think this is one of the best "popular" introductions to string theory. The elegant universe manages to change the whole string of the topic (though it is actually M) theory available to a wider audience. <br /> <br /> Some "popular science" programs feel that the best approach is simply to throw the audience deep, casting them into technical jargon without explanation and theory in a boring, outdated style. This program passes concepts such as general relativity and quantum mechanics, and explains the issues that need to be resolved between the two so that we have a coherent theory that can be applied in the universe in both large and small dimensions. <br /> I think some might say it's slow and take too long to get interesting things like extra dimensions and wormholes, but the thing is: it's against the point. The explanation of string theory from the beginning is almost impossible, at least not mentioning physics on its basis and how it is explained in the elegant universe is clear and fun. <br /> <br /> Do you really like this program really depends on whether you are ready to start with some of the ideas Greene presents: extra dimensions and empty dimensions are not common in everyday life, right? But if you continue with the more exotic concepts of this program, you will find that it gives you an insight into the research that leads the world of physics today. And if you learn physics, this is great entertainment and you will probably be able to follow it and even more appreciate it!
