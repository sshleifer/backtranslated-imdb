Maybe I'm biased because F-16 is my favorite fighter plane - although F-14 is probably the second or third - but I liked this movie. Iron Eagle II and III do not measure the actor and the pieces, but the first - with Top Gun - has great flying and music with sensible plots and action. II and III probably have much less "budget" but their main drawback is plot and action. I doubt that Iron Eagle's relative fame and popularity over Top Gun is almost a reflection of Jason Gedrick's fame and popularity compared to Tom Cruise. Another plus (for me) is the short look of Shawnee Smith. 7/10
