For the first time, I introduced this movie to San Antonio, Tx. This movie was another. double function. Unfortunately, the theater where I saw it was broken. In any case, in 1972, five fingers (also known as King Boxer) appeared and were introduced in the US next year. Like many other "Kung-Fu" films released during Enter's Dragon's "coat", this particular film was really pretty good. This is the story of a statesman who is sent to the martial arts institute to make himself better and his fighting skills. Meanwhile, the "Opponent" martial arts school is planning to block our hero using dirty tactics to try to kick him down and try to prevent him from participating in the tournament. Surprisingly, I thought Warner Bros had been distributing this film in the US because Warner Bros released a DVD. It never happened. As far as I know, this movie is published in both English and Cantonese, w / sub-titles ..... the latter is a "cleaner and clearer" version. Although the combat sequences are a bit funny to watch (ie fly in the air and strike, jump to buildings, fighter who uses his head .... literally .... to hit his opponent, etc.), this is the classic kung-fu action perfectly planned and done. If you like to enter a dragon, five fatal fingers would be a great addition to every movie collection ..... if you find it.
