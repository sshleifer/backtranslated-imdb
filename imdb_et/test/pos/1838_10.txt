The charming pearl of the film is back to me. What is absolutely the star of the studs who can go wrong with this modern fairy tale? It also includes a lot of funny girl-made jokes written by Bonnie Hunt, who wrote and directed this film. David Duchovny is also very good showing a different approach when his favorite show shows x-files. great date movie!
