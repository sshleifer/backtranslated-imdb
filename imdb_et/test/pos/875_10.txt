This is one of the best films I've seen in recent years. Belmonndo and Deneuve stand out in their roles, he is the owner of a naive plantation, and he is a mysterious trickster. Words do not make this masterpiece justice, it is enough to say that this is a film that explores the darker side of love and the associated pain, humiliation and self-deception, although it is dressed up as a movie. Forget that a weak remake with Jolie and Banderas, instead, look at the real artticle and hold on to some very cinematic beauty moments.
