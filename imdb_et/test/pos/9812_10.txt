Just an amazing bittersweet movie that depicts a life party often skipped over feeling good movies. I saw it as a child and came back to it recently and fell in love again. <br /> <br /> As a child, it only interests me to build an airplane because an adult to whom he liked the dark world and the young man escaped from this world. <br /> <br /> The king's portrayal was great, the camera's style was chosen with small frames and shots, focusing on action and hand movement, I thought it was well done, I personally can't remember something like that style and adds to the character and depicts him as a force that is not nearly human (which may not be far from reality), it makes interesting developments <br /> <br />
