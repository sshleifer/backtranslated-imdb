Maybe one of the first films that came out after Halloween (though made by Irwin Yabalans from Halloween), I have to say, honestly, I found that "Tourist Field" is terrible and funner. "Tourist Trap" is one of the most remarkable places you will find now and later, and will have the most pleasant surprise. It was the fate I am telling you, but one night I was in Blockbuster (one or two months before finishing business) and I had nothing to do. Then I stumble upon this movie, I think it looks like a ridiculous B-film, I rented it and took it home, the boy was good at scaring me. "Tourist Trap" comes out as a bad movie, it is definitely a cheese option, but in the end you have to take care of it. <br /> <br /> The things that hit the absolute most, and the things that made this movie one of the most frightening, are number one. A movie without a good setting is not fun, not here. I just love the love of the place, it seems we can be connected, it almost seems we've been there before. What makes it more creepy. Next are characters, not really stereotypical, and they all have real personality. For example, they are not stoners, alcoholics or even sex obsessed people, they feel like a normal young adult. Plus they look realistic and then they are Chuck Connors. Who delivers an excellent performance as Mr. Slausen, whom we all love right now, because he is so real he feels this nice boy grandfather sees us love. The last and probably the most important thing that makes this movie frightening is how they make us (audience) jump halfway from our seats and turn on the right reasons. For example, most of the time in horror movies, we jump mainly because of a sharp change in the music pitch, but in the "Tourist Trap", prepare yourself, that's not the case. With this perfect illumination, dummies and wonders, you'll feel completely out. Plus I love it because although they can go a bit over-top with some things you still feel like it could happen. This is exactly the fear film that requires such laughs and makes us (the audience) insecure and frightened. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, if all the major problems go, I have nothing but a strange thing, sometimes a bit weird. Ultimately, Tourist Trap keeps close and close in my heart, because it is one of the few horror films that makes me dangerous to turn on lights and travel.
