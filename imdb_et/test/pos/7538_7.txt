For those who do not know Alisdair Sims, he is, of course, the movie of all these Christmas songs. (I? I think I'm really bad. I haven't really seen the thing). I think those who have seen the Christmas song and so used to their character can find the Holy Trinine watches quite surprising. You see, in this movie, Sims has two roles. One, he plays a harder and on the other side he is the director of the girl's school! So, if you get it through your thick skull, this movie offers a lot of joy. The plot is about how the school tries to make the necessary money with horse racing. It is actually a bit more difficult for little children to go, but I think they would be busy with their horses and really with their horses. Adults can also get over all the thick accents that are also thrown away. But again, this story is quite easy, it is crazy and crazy because one is really aware. PS, kids all look like they're from Eloise's school age.
