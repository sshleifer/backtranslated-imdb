I really hate musicals because music numbers just start from sudden and usually offensive scenes, but it's completely different - it's just great. Plot may be a challenge for viewers, but the simplicity of people's stories makes this movie great. <br /> <br /> I've seen it at least a dozen times and I'm still tired of the plot. , characters or music (I just love the soundtrack - this is the only soundtrack that I really wanted to get and probably the only thing I owe). <br /> <br /> For me, this black has seen such a movie, great signs that have been made with entertaining songs and many things to think about after the end of the movie.
