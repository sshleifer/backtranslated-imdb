I'm not going too deep, but Showtime was a pretty funny movie. There weren't any blow-and-knee funny scenes (which I remember), but that was moments. The cast is pretty good, Robert De Niro is good as usual and Eddie Murphy pulls a pretty funny report. Rene Russo was in the film as fine, there were no complaints. There were two characters in nature that I liked not to explain at all. The first was a friend of Trey Sellars (Eddie Murphy's) with Ken Campbell. I thought he was just a Trey friend, but I wanted to know more about him. Another sign I liked was a partner / partner of Mitch Preston (Robert De Niro) played by Nestor Serrano. I think he was just one cop who worked with Mitch Preston, but I wanted to know if he was his partner or not. I think maybe I'll put too much thought into the film, I mean, after all, it's comedy ... who cares about the characters? I think so. I was really glad that it was led by Tom Dey, who also led Shanghai Noon. Ever since I saw this movie, I was waiting for my next job. I think he did a good job with this movie, and I look forward to my next job. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was a good movie, but I wouldn't recommend paying a full ticket if you're not a fan of Robert De Niro / Eddie Murphy / Rene Russo. The theater was worth seeing, but not for the full price, I would recommend seeing it at a matinee price. <br /> <br /> Here, too, are some movie trivia for ya. The man who played the camera man, played Judah Friedlander, is the music video "Everyday" by the band Dave Matthews. He was also a judge "Meet the Parents" who also played Robert De Nirot. ... And besides, he also played Derek Zoolander's brother "Zoolander" (both Zoolander as well as Ben Stiller's older star). Just some useless stuff for ya. <br /> <br /> I hope you enjoy the movie. Thank you for reading, <br /> <br /> Crisis
