With small mistakes, this film is a masterpiece and certainly the best film I've seen. Not to mention that this is one of the best films I've seen in all genres. Maybe I would have written it to No Man's Land earlier, but now I think it's better. At the end, it is very sad, and I was in almost two shocking scenes that came within 5 minutes of the film's finals. <br /> <br /> Karel's main character was exciting even though he had to be a beginner in his age. This film makes you think a lot, makes you cry (or at least gets close to you) and makes you hate any war and political BS. Feedback from the prison hospital makes the film even more delicious. <br /> <br /> One small film shortage is allegedly British non-British accents. Most of the people on the British screen were actually British, but how about those who should be British and speak with a foreign accent? It did not fit into this divine film. But this is pretty much a mistake I've noticed. The effects can also be a little better, but again we remember all the movies from one particular country with a huge FX and something else. In short, this film is a complete masterpiece and every individual should see it. If you want to travel to the Czechoslovakia in the 40s and you want to see a lot of emotions right now, this movie is for you. If you don't want to do it, this movie does it.
