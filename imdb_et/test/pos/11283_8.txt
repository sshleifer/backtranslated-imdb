Over the last 30 years, many (well, more than a few times) have tried to create a film that has a "different" look. Assuming it is a film director's desire to stay away from other films or just a shiny little budget and a dirty look, "Begotten" has the top advantage of this pile. <br /> <br /> Anyway, "Eraserhead", any "Eraserhead". <br /> <br /> Merhige's arduous process, which artificially changes his film, changes its structure completely (imagine what this film would look like a glorious, standard Technicolor). another, unknown artifact of culture. Some of the pictures are so far away from what we expect on the screen, they are mainly disturbing their relocation. This is not a "Last House Left" disorder, which is rather a departure-own-cave-first-time and sight-sun disorder. <br /> <br /> Look at this Fever-Dream when you get the chance and enjoy. Keep in mind that they do more regular movies every day. They can wait.
