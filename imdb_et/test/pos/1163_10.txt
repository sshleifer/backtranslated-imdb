When I watch the local magazine video, I called it "the greatest achievement of American cinema history". It wasn't a little linguistic. TW&TL will remain Milius' best work and it is sad that it has so few opportunities to work anymore. But TW&TL remains a striking exposition that is once known as the American character, largely based on Brian Keith's superb imagination, Teddy R. (probably Milius and Keith admired TR tremendously to make him two films, including "The Rough Riders." some level of guilt: excellent balance, action, relationship and serious American theme in the world. In addition, TW & TL has an extraordinary appeal all over the world: mark the statistics that best show it for men under 18, 18-29 and over 45! It is clear that Candy Bergen has struck a sensitive chord for both women and men.
