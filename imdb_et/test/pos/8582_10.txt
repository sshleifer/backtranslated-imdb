Fabulous movie I've just bought a video four days ago. Yes, I'm Colin Firth Fan and Colin was his usual talented, natural gorgeous self. <br /> <br /> Colin (Matthew Field) and Fissy (Sammy, Name 7-year-old son) were very special and so natural to watch. They were funny funny together and touched my heartbeat. The scenes that I loved most were Sammy and Matt, who sat down to talk to the wall, and then Matt fell out of fashion (I don't have the content of my discussion to ruin the plot). It was also fun to have Sammy quizzing Matt out of sex, Colin and Fissy were perfect in this scene and did what might be an inconvenient topic between adults and children so natural. Colins words and faces at the end of this scene were so strange and said it all! just great. Credit must, of course, also go to Fissy Roberts for his strange imagination of Sammy. He played such a loving and embarrassing child. The two actors were perfectly together. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Colin (Matt) and Nia (Name) was perfectly balanced and I could no longer agree that the chemistry between them was wonderful to look at, show love, tension and, of course, passion. It was exciting to see how their delicate blooming romance gradually unfolds, showing how their cultural and social divide influenced their relationship and it was good to see Colin and Nia sensitively depicting Matt and Name by discovering, agreeing, and transcending those differences. It kept me attached to the TV and probably until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> The depiction of Colins by Matt's vulnerable and underage was also so great that I found it hard to see Matt being so average and childish about Sammy because he (Matt) felt that Sammy got his romance / relationship with Sams's mother. One could not feel very frustrated, angry and disappointed with Matt Sammy in this way, and this in turn threatens Matti's special relationship with Sammy and Name. Colins' special talents "get the interior of the character's head" and show the audience the different facets of the character, there was a lot of evidence here and a pure magic look. I also have to mention that Colin also has good communication with young actors (see also "My Life is so Wonderful and Not Captured Film"). <br /> <br /> I also loved Matthew and his wife Jenny, both excellent to show the blind to the audience and the tension in their marriage, and not all seemingly "happy marriages" are what they seem from outside. <br /> <br /> I must not forget to mention the admirer I thought was very funny, seriously! The Name was also cheerful for the mother and the family, and highlighted the Name culture and the importance of its status. <br /> <br /> The negative side, I can't really find the negative side, but be objective about the film and give my review credibility, the only negative comment I would like to make is that scriptwriters did not explain in enough detail why Matt collapsed in the car, namely, it was just a vague proposition that something was wrong with his heart. But it didn't reduce my movie enjoyment, far from it. I just had to take the tape back a bit to take it a second time. <br /> <br /> I felt this movie was all, fun, resurrected, and I loved the rich colors and sunny landscape. The film warmed the cold winter days and made me smile :-)) All the important elements were there, laughter, love, tension, sadness, anger, drama and a warm feeling good factor together, yes, many of those delicious Colin Firth moments, including the very soaked Colin 'a wet shirt in the scene', which should not be missed by any fan that the girl might want ;-)) <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this movie, especially any Colin Firth Fans ;-)
