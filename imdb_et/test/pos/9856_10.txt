I loved this movie! So worth a long working time. I need help completing ... <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * <br /> <br /> Final Marie's End - Will it suggest she's still looking for Renaud? or maybe he was the one who wanted to revive 13? (He seemed to be the first to present Colin's first letter). I don't know it quite well, but I know that I really liked it. So if someone has seen it and remembers it or has just seen it, please specify the end. <br /> <br /> Thanks
