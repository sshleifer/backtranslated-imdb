When a person follows romantic comedies, we know what to expect; we have seen them over many years to find out how they are going. There is a formula that almost always produces films that are popular with the audience of the genre ... not always their actual quality. How to play it and create something interesting? This movie has a recommendation ... and it works fairly well. Instead of simply following the lead, we follow him skillfully, helping unhappy men who lack attractive facades that would allow them to reveal without seeing the good qualities they have for those they love. The plot follows Smith when he works in his most complicated case of self-proclaimed; Kevin James. Together with James, we also follow Mendes, who is fed up with men who lie to get what they want (one particular scene that inspires Smith's character, his meeting with one such jerk and puts him in place). After seeing Smith to help disaster that is James, we see him with Mendes ... and despite his talents to help others, he ... blows ... badly with him. We are admired by love and how to fall in love. In the case of romantic comedy, it usually avoids such pitfalls (sometimes with almost the same sense of genre looting), although recent scenes have the sweetness and emotions of this type of film. This review does not reveal whether they follow the formula. The pace is pretty good, it never really slowed down and rarely moves too fast. Action is great when everything goes. The characters are nicely developed and come real. Humor does not always work ... there are occasional strokes that are less than successful, and one or two jokes that are forced. However, the film was mostly funny. I recommend it to anyone who loves romantic comedies and someone who is or is in love. Those who do not believe in love have a hard time with the latest scenes. 7/10
