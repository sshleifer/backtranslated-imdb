A great look at the 60s in the eyes of four friends from their student days in 1960 until their reunion ten years later - a Yugoslav immigrant who loves American dreams and often fights to cope with violent reality; the son of an entrepreneur prematurely revealing; soldier; and the crazy hippie girl they all love. A good direction and strong cast will justify Steve Tesich's excellent script; Dialogue is not as spooky as "Breaking Away", but the issues of growing and father-to-son conflict are treated just as well, and there are still some wonderful comic moments between shocks and drama.
