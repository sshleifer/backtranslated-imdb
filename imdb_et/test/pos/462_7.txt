A good show, a really good actor, and the director will take us through our story in an interesting, unpredictable way, especially since it's essentially two people in the room. It doesn't pull like many modern movies, but it doesn't drag. Bohl is slippery enough to believe him in his current character, "now", which is still involved and does not go back to his "career choices", so it is plausible without having to show us his deep and self-control of his soul ... Brundage has a delicate balance at stake, innocence, evenness and class to pull "Buddy" very well. The quality of the film is a bit grainy, but it fits the tone of the story. Whether the hair and the ends of the makeup could be slightly polished, it is definitely worth a look.
