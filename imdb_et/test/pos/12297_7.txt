Sometimes I really wonder? when I look at the comments here, it seems that most people have seen a completely different movie than I have. I just saw it ... and liked it. Not that it made me happy, but the way to see a good movie! <br /> <br /> The film needs patience, yes. And yes, the main character is really annoying, but I'm sure it's deliberate. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's a change when you watch this movie in a movie or at home. Most people watch movies at home as they listen to elevator music. This movie is definitely not suitable for background noise. <br /> <br /> And no. Good leadership does not mean five laughs or explosions per second. Good governance means following your theme and the story and the actors together. And while it doesn't work perfectly, at least I think it works quite well. <br /> <br /> I liked photography and kits even when they are sometimes on the surreal edge. The opening scene is truly special. <br /> <br /> Did I also like the actor? Guillaume Depardieu doesn't play Pierre. He plays the role of Pierre, himself playing a role! Pierre is not a romantic hero that he struggles so hard to be, he is a premature and self-righteous idiot, even a weak person who hurts all the people he protects. That even his love for the truth is just an idea that is beautifully shown by his constant lying and not even by asking questions or explaining himself. A person who can see more than two scenes is left inexplicable, there is enough information about the whole movie, which is distributed to everyone. <br /> <br /> And even a strange building begins to think as soon as the target is accustomed to: Remember Isabelle escaped from the war zone - and this is probably the refuge for fighters in the civil war, most likely in Bosnia (which still happened when the movie was created) . At least this is what the story to Isabelle Pierre suggests when he meets for the first time, and in a later scene where Pierre shows Isabelle's book with his father on a cover surrounded by books in Bosnia.
