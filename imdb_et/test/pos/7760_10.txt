Suzumiya Haruhi no yûutsu (Haruhi Suzumiya melancholy) may at first glance think it is just another animated school comedy / drama. Well, that's not! It's just a school environment. It is a comedy, but very wise with a lot of sarcasm. The character has a psychological sublimeess that is almost in the same class that can be found in Ingmar Bergman's work. Episodes are incited, as it seems, failed, that is, the pilot is actually an episode 11. This allows small clues to be presented for future episodes. The exhibition is the adaptation of Nagaru Tanigawa's popular novel series from Haruhi Suzumiya. <br /> <br /> So what's the story? As with all episodes, this story turns to Haruhi Suzumiya, who tries to relieve her boredom of adventures. Haruhi himself is not interested in ordinary people and is actively looking for aliens, time travelers and esperators (people with supernatural powers). To find such people, he has set up a club that he calls the SOS Brigade (Save the World by loading it with fun: Haruhi Suzumiyas Brigade). With the exception of Haruhi, other members of the SOS Brigade are Kyon. He is the real protagonist of the exhibition. It is from his point of view that we follow this story. He just sits in front of the class when Haruhi got the idea of ​​creating a SOS brigade. He is quite skeptical about most of the club's activities and tags to ensure that Haruhi does not move to extreme places, and he is the only class Haruhi likes to talk to. The other member is Yuki Nagato, who is "the indispensable silent member" and is also the only member of the literary club where the SOS-Brigade room is free to find a club room. He does not mind that the SOS Brigade uses his club room when he can sit in the corner and read his books. He is also involved in brigades. Haruhi arrested "voluntarily" Mikuru Asahina because the club needed a Lolita-type mascot to make something suspicious. He often acts as a club servant. The last member is always ridiculous for Itsuki Koizumi, who happens to be a "mysterious transfer to a student" (which means that he wore two months in a semester, which Haruhi considers mysterious to qualify). <br /> <br /> Haruhi thinks all members, but Kyon is some randomly chosen people in school, but they really have an interest.
