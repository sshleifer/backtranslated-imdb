It seems to me that many people do not know that Blade is actually a superhero film that is equal to X-Meni, Daredevil, Punisher and the like. All of these heroes (and the X-Meni hero group) are common in that they were all created in the magical world of Marvel. Blade was originally an ordinary person (blue clothes) who drove the vampire's personal fear and finally Dracula himself, and he was in a better word for lack of boredom. So it is really boring that the character actually fell down in the Marvel universe and was not actually used. At least until he reinvented. <br /> <br /> David Goyer struck the gene when he took Blade's character and turned him into a clad blind knight. He can't take all the credits, but much of it has to go to Stephen Norrington, who, with his special visual style, brings out the best. Blade's character (Wesley Snipes) is quite amazing in this film and mixes martial art with Batman like darkness. Snipes is pretty good as the title and it is successful to bring out the character duality and inner demons. However, he is a pretty stiff actor in both voice and posture and is only interesting for one movie (which is clearly visible on the basis of worse after-results). Kris Kristofferson is also good and really brings Whistler's tortured character to life in terms of energy and timing. However, N'Bushe Wright is rather weak as a leading lady that makes her character relatively flat and lifeless. Donal Logue is pretty funny and manages to do a little character. Also worth mentioning is German, Udo Kier, because he brings many fine and stylish vampire races, apparently born from his experience of playing Dracula. Stephen Dorf offers the best action in the movie and his cooling, because Deacon Frost is one of the best screen crooks I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The story is good and I feel that the vampire genre is being updated (something that hasn't been done since Robert Rodrigues "Dusk Till Dawn"), adding a lot of modern elements and maintaining a comic book. Saying that the movie has a comic book does not mean that the film is unrealistic. Far from it. Much effort has been made to make the film as realistic as possible. Including effects that are pretty good for their time. I found the vampire "dust" a very nice touch. Instead of a vampire dying, Norrington decided to allow vampires to spontaneously look good. The fact that the general effects were well done increases the credibility of the film that would otherwise have fallen on the face. <br /> <br /> As mentioned earlier, Norrington has a very clear visual style that distinguishes him from the heads of the following Blade films. Del Toro is almost as experienced, but I prefer Norrington's style. His style gives the film a special look and feel, but most importantly it gives the film the atmosphere. Very tense in a dark atmosphere that works great for the main character and story. With visual style, music also works well and adds a lot to the atmosphere of the movie. <br /> <br /> The whole Blade is a very entertaining movie that is supposed to be 8 of me, but little annoying mistakes (which can not be said without breaking the movie are enough that many of them are near the end of the movie) settle high 7. <br /> <br /> 7/10
