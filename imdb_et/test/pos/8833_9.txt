I was part of the Space Odyssey production, under the control of the FIDO mission. I just want to say that none of us, especially mission leaders, who had to respond to the green screen mostly, did not know how amazing it was. I knew it was going to be good, just for the mere divorce and professionalism that the Impossible Pictures production team gave to all involved. but when we all saw it for the first time on Curon's Mayfair screening, I felt very proud. I was so glad that none of us looked like Star Trek. Scriptist and director Joe Aherne is the most amazing man. He gets a good team and trusts them indirectly to do what they do best. I'm very happy to be part of this show. Who knew something that this epic and difficult to understand would be so appealing to look at. and my god is this beautiful universe there.
