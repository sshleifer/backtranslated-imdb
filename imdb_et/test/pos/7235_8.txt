This version of Romeo and Julia trash passes through Manhattan today. Romeo (Will Keenan) is a Que family ** hole and violent member, and Juliet (Jane Jensen) is a sexy (beautiful legs and breasts) and bisexual Capulet family girl. Scatological situations facing this romantic couple are very funny. Although this is a cult film (including exhibited at the Rio de Janeiro Festival), it is not recommended for all audiences. If the viewer is a fan of Peter Jackson's former films ("Braindead", "Bad Taste"), "Toxic Avenger", "Body Melt" and other trash, he certainly loves this flick. Otherwise, he hates it. As I belong to the first group, my voice is eight. <br /> <br />
