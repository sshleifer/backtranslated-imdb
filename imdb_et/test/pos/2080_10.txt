I've seen different Hamlets, and I've taught this game. When I look at Jacob, I am tempted to think that he is as intelligent as Hamlet himself, so that he is alive with every nuance of this blunt. Rather, he deepens all the puzzles concerning Hamlet's character. He illuminates the line after the row, after the word, after the word, shines the light on this sparkling wine. While we dare to feel the fearful Hamlet in its betrayal - much more than other actors - Jacobi feels more painful than anyone else. And we're trembling for Hamlet's betrayal, because Jacobi is not afraid of the platform to which Hamlet can step down. In short, Jacobi gives us a complete Hamlet and Hamlet is the greatest character in literature. That's why I'm convinced that Jacobi Hamlet has seen the best results.
