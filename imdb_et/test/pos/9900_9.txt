Morris and Reva Applebaum were Broadway's toast for their prosperity. In the nineties, Morris is a widow. He calls his sons - a psychotherapist and a BMW car dealer - and his daughter, a television writer / producer - to take part in his honorable party, after which he euthanises himself. The literal beings they have are taking what he says at face value. He directs them, his grandchildren and some others, including an African-Jewish psychiatrist, who reminds Godfrey Cambridge to rejoice in Manhattan when they try to stop him or repel him. <br /> <br /> Comedy works perfectly. The performances are great. Peter Falk is up. This movie is more than a worthy audience: it deserves popular success.
