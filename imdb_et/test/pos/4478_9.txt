In most cases, my opinions do not reach the majority. I tend to rely on artistic, imaginative, and diverse sides. This film resembles Frances Ford's "The Black Stallion", where a fantasy situation is created to showcase the beauty of an excellent creature who is not readily available to view his top except for the vast documentary area natural. Unlike these natural movies, this offer offers the best film making techniques that industry has to offer to create a diva that creates one of the most sensual superstars (cats) on the screen. <br /> <br /> This fantasy represents a love relationship that develops between a French soldier (he is also very nice) and a lost female leopard in the Egyptian desert when he arrives at an abandoned Egyptian temple. I bought it with all my heart. If you are at least a little open to fantasy and appreciate the grace, beauty, strength and sensuality of cats, you should enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The only mistake in my book was the end. It was perfect for the Romeo and Julia finals - it would have taken me over. <br /> <br />
