Film is a bright feature of the film. The park really knows his stuff when it comes to taking monuments behind the camera. Each shot is full of vibrant color that pops out of the screen. Every movie's frame seems to be a story in itself. I hope the Blu-ray edition is in this movie because it looks fantastic. It is quite intriguing to see which vampire mythology elements were used as his vision. Sang-hyeon must drink blood to survive and stay flawless, incredible strength and sensitive to sunlight. However, he has no mirrors and reflections in the mirror. <br /> <br /> Although I've never seen this movie, I couldn't help but feel it was the Chan-wook Park version in the dark. The entire center of the movie is dedicated to the love of Sang-hyeon and Tae-Joo against each other. It seemed like an adult version of Twilight. There are many blood, nudity, sex and even some shades for good blood samples. Maybe it's Chan-Wook Park's fanboy in me, but I honestly know I can make sure it's a better film for these two films. The psychological aspect I love about Park's earlier films is also thirsty. This is an important factor for me, like every film that causes me to think or is unusual in any way to become a fan of the fans. The soundtrack to the movies in the Park always seems to fit your film like a glove. January is no exception. Although the soundtrack is a bit thinner this time, it is quite easy for the overall atmosphere of the film. <br /> <br /> The middle part of the movie seemed to be dragging longer than anything else in the movie. This is strange, though the scenes of this time are extremely important for the story of the film and it is hard to imagine thirst being the same film as any of these scenes are cut. However, it is one of my film pictures. <br /> <br /> Chan-wook Park bites the vampire into mythology with Thirst and puts his darkness, a psychological twist. Park films always seem to have a specific formula or contain most of the following: great writing, beautiful cinematography, solid pains, some psychological twist that comes to your head and a memorable end. The January brings all the front and hopefully gets more of the attention he had on the DVD (and hopefully also on Blu-ray) during the ride.
