A really big movie ... I bumped it into a video store and rented it because Aaron Eckhart (a company dealing with men and friends and neighbors) was in it and Paulina Porizcova ... The lovely former swimsuit model of SI doesn't get naked in the movie, but that's just one of many reasons to rent it ... It's very exciting and the character is fantastic ... Eckhart is one of the most underrated players and he steals this movie ... It's very dark and violent, but I enjoyed it enormously.
