Wow, what can I say it was a good movie, very different from all the eternal remodels we see recently, the only thing I would have wanted to see a bit more when Jane left her husband Im thinking she's going to Serena for her he fell for him, not only for him, but for everything he has, so I want the manufacturers to actually show that it ends instead of leaving him with his imagination, as I finally hate when they do. The antennas seemed to be fun, but I think you should be light and muscular, I would like to see more movies like this, maybe a sequel to Jane and Serena. the girl would also have been attractive to her.
