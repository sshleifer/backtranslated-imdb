"Opera" is one of the greatest achievements in the genre of horror. This masterful picture contains everything that should be a pure horror film: a good, enchanting story, many symbols, a wonderful vision and abundance. The killings are very shocking and bloody. Unforgettable fear and atmosphere of fear. Must-see for a real Argento fan, so when you get this chance.
