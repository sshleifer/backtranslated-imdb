I recently saw Blurred test, and I'm surprised that it was really pretty good! His movie from different groups of children, your mountain balls, your rich snobs, your typical teenage couple, and two geeky boys and one post from a hipster. Together, but as separate stories, each group rides the Gold Coast School Week. Australia has never had any problems with comedy writing, and Australia is never short or participants who can play comedy with nuances and just the right amounts. The cast is full of Aussie star actors with tremendous talent and screen presence. Keep an eye on Craig Horner, a young graduate who has lost a shenanigan with his friends for a week's party. Travis Cotten and Mark Priestly, who successfully fought with some complicated physical comedy, as two bombarded bogans and Jessica Gower as a cutie but confused teenager, loving love. Veronika Sywak is making her debut as a young boy's dream girl and is among many more experienced performers. See Matthew Newton, a smart limousine driver. Fantastic Aussie
