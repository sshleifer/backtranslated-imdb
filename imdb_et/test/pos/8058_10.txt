At the time of Clete Roberts' foreword, I began to think that it was Ed Wood's production, but what rolls out here is pretty hard. The Story of Crime and Corruption in the South City is spoken of casting out of Hollywood's line of poverty and making the film even more realistic. There are no pulls here and sometimes "Well" (1951) resembles. Black and white texture gives the newsletter a similar quality. In some cases, younger viewers are reminded of "The Blair Witch Project", but it's based on REAL events!
