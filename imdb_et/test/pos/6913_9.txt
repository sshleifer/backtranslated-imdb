I thought Rachel York was fantastic as "Lucy." I have seen her also "Kiss Me, Kate" and "Victor / Victoria", and in all these shows she has become very different and very real. He's a chameleon who can play (and sing) something! <br /> <br /> I'm very surprised at how many negative comments here appear in Rachel's Lucy performance. Even some bonafide TVs and entertainment critics seem to have disappeared from their point of imagination. So many people are focused on the fact that Rachel doesn't really see Lucy. My answer to this is, "What?" I wasn't looking for Lucy's superficial cancellation. I wanted to know more about the real woman behind the clown. And Rachel gave us this very deeply. I didn't want to see anyone just "doing" the classic Lucy routine. That's why I was very pleased with the decision of the producers and the director that Rachel depicted Lucy in rehearsals for the most memorable sketches - Vitameatavegamin and Candy Factory. (Some reviewers do not seem to understand that these two scenes were to be sample sequences, not actual sketches). I thought this approach gave an innovative twist to outline that so many of us know from the heart. I also thought Rachel was terribly fresh and funny in these scenes. And he created absolutely re-established routines - especially Professor and Grape Stomping. Grape was one moment where Rachel's mouth was just a small increase, which I remember about Lucy. I couldn't believe he was able to hit it - and of course. <br /> <br /> I don't know if many of the people who criticized the show were waiting for Lucille's "I Love Lucy" ball all the time. After all, those who came to know him only on television would have no idea what Lucy really liked in his early film year. I think Rachel showed her natural progression in the diamond. He planted all the right seeds to see a clown waiting for the event, given the right circumstances. Lucy didn't fit into the forms of the old studio system. His disappointed attempts to become the stereotypical term of this era he repressed would be his ultimate gift. <br /> <br /> I believe Rachel has masterfully captured comedy, drama, spirit, sadness, anger, passion, love, ambition, loyalty, sexuality, self-slander, childhood and stoicism all as one of the most complex American icons. And he did it with authenticity and freshness, which was quite pleasant. "Lucy" was the star of Rachel York. I hope this will bring a great flood in the future. I also hope that it will bring him Emmy.
