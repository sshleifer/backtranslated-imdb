And she was really beautiful (Laraine Day, that is) - herself, her part and her performance. An engaging story of selfish and self-inviting love, the same man, the rich heartbeat, and Robert Cummings. One of his accusations leads to an incident that enriches the local community and tests the shit of his close (and two) siblings (Jean Muir and Laraine Day). Their comfortable and somewhat superficial milieu has come to an end, because two girls are facing the next crisis and responding to the contradictory demands of cautiousness, honesty, loyalty and love, the consequences of which are completely different for everyone. The old vanities and jokes abandon their real characters with amazing contrast. <br /> <br /> Great Find on TCM!
