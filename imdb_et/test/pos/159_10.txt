If you love Chan-wook Park, you know what to expect. His films are cruel, poetic, tragic and artistic, with very bad humor. THIRST is clearly Park's style and I loved every one of you, from cinematic (every shot is a proud and creative) story that combines Shakespeare's tragedy, murderous love, gothic horror and layered character drama. The characters are complex and there is a lot to go with moral uncertainty. Even the most sociopathic character causes compassion. The direction is restrained and the performances are nuanced - like SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE, there are too many nuances at first sight. Chan-wook Park is an intelligent, courageous and consistently surprising filmmaker. It's unpredictable - scenes range from brutal and heartbreaking ridiculous fun moments. It's closer to LADY VENGEANCE, then SYMPATHY for MR. VENGEANCE insofar as it is up and comic. But like LADY VENGEANCE, it's incredibly rich, thoughtful, and rewarding. <br /> <br /> If you like to talk beautifully about vampire stories (LET THE RIGHT ONE IN) or you are a Chan-wook Park fan THIRST should be clear. 2009 is one of the best films.
