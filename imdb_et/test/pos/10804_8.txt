Unlike http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098238/, this movie does not provide background information. We are being shown the current state of Danton's fall, his mockery and execution, but if no revolution is extensively investigated, it is hard to see where the characters come from (Fouquier-Tinville, Philippeau, Desmoulins, Robespierre ...) and therefore understand them for what they are is: Danton and Joe Blobb can be the same person as the viewer. For example, Robespierre & Desmoulins were close friends of the youngsters explaining how Robespierre works. Those who know the facts, however, are easily orientated and appreciate this good movie, where participants offer solid actions, no useless sub-blocks or good times. Desmoulins and Danton are the best characters, but everyone does a good job, even "demented" by Saint-Just, which is portrayed as a psychopath. "Terreur" was a period of mass murder, the importance of which has not been fully documented, and most of the motive was ambition, greed and solving personal disputes that were fed to unknown sans-culots as a further step towards tyranny.
