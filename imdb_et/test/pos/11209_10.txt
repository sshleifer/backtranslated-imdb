This is probably one year after Uzaki's sight, but it has left strong memories of two main characters, the jaunt photographer Mahmut and his naive cousin Yusuf. <br /> <br /> This is a long film with very little dialogue and a pretty limited plot. This has obviously disturbed some viewers. But the film constructs a painfully believable portrait of Mahmut and Yusuf that emotional tension is as much as the richest thriller. <br /> <br /> It is clear that there is no cushioning in this movie - it stops for a long time where no one is talking about what's happening in the emotions of the characters (and inside you, looking at them) as you could wear. Go to see it as awake and anxious, and you need to stick rather than anesthesia. <br /> <br /> Uzak rings in so many ways and sincerity is probably its greatest achievement. People do not grab the events and problems as much as each other. In fact, the film is probably not one point where the main characters (Mahmut, Yusuf and Mahmut, former wife of Nazan) are not opposed. <br /> <br /> Much of this is true all over the world: state cousin Yusuf may have deliberately naive expectation that work on the ship will fall on the lap; Mahmut's urbanized cynicism and unwillingness to bring Yusuf. <br /> <br /> Other truths are more specific to Turkey: Yusuf's misunderstanding that Mahmut can tolerate his presence with teeth; When a woman tries to get to know a woman, between Yusuf and Macho there is a gap between ambition and widespread discomfort. <br /> <br /> Uzak is undoubtedly a gloomy film and one of Ceylan's strength is not overwhelming us. his research topics. At least I completely believed in the behavior of his characters. All the small unsuccessful attempts to connect and the small atrocities ring so true. And yet I did not leave the message that "the world is such", but instead I got "The way we treat each other".
