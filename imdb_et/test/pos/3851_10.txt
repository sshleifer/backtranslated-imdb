For God's sake!! I love this movie sooooooooooooooooooooo much !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's so incredible ...... I loved it as a joke and still love it as an adult. This is my favorite Disney movie allllllllllllllllllllll! You should watch it, watch it and love it. My friends and I look at this ton ..... This is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good. I recommend it to anyone who has children or children. My favorite song is the song and dance number with all the strays and Thomas O'Malley. Writers / producers / directors cut this one ... ... yes, laughed at the wall. <br /> <br /> xoxo ~ Wolly ~ xoxo
