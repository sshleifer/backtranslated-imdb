This is, in my opinion, one of Bruce's most underrated films, this is a fantastic warm-hearted movie with a clean story and amazing result Bruce Willis! All the characters are great and I thought Willis and Spencer Breslin were just awesome together and Bruce Willis is just amazing at this! This is definitely one of Bruce's best comedy performances (Waaaaaaaaaamabulance's thing was great) and I thought it was very well written and done and plus Finale is really cool! It's good and it was cool to see Russell's (Willise) character change in the whole movie! plus the end was pretty good. I think it should be higher than 6.0 and this is one of the best Disney movies I've ever seen! It also has many surprising moments. All the characters are very nice, as well as the lovely love story, as well as Bruce and Spencer Breslin both had really funny lines (Holy Smokes!). This is, in my opinion, one of Bruce's most underrated films, this is a fantastic warm-hearted movie with a clean story and an amazing result by Bruce Willis and I say it must be seen! The direction is great! Jon Turteltaub is doing a great job here and making the movie at a very fast pace. Action is great! Bruce Willis is amazing as always and amazing here, he gives one of his best comic performances, has had fun with Spencer Breslin and Emily Mortimer, had funny lines and was dead throughout the movie. main reasons why I liked this movie! (Willis Rules !!!!!!!). Spencer Breslin is fantastic as Russell's younger version, he was very funny and never got on my nerves, he is one of the best children actors! Emily Mortimer is good as Amy and was really cute, she liked having a good chemistry with Bruce. Lily Tomlin is funny when Janet liked her. Jean Smart is good at what he had to do, which wasn't much. The rest is good. In general, you have to see!. **** p. 5
