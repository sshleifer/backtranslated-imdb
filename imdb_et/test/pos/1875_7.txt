It was really a long time since the latter has created such a movie like this. The so-called B-film. Maybe it wasn't a great movie, but it's fun to watch, classic Bruce Cambell, he's got good parts, funny, nasty, even artistic. <br /> <br /> ****** Spoiler Ahead ******* <br /> <br /> ------------------- ---- --------------------------------- ------------- -------------- ------------- <br /> <br /> The part where her husband is a robot-casual die, I don't know about you, but it made me feel so strange, so sad and disgusting. I compare this scene with the Fly 2 scene, where his dog monster dies. You think oh my god. <br /> <br /> ---------------- ------------------- ------- ------------------- ------------------------ ------ - ------------------------- <br /> <br /> ******** No More Spoilers ******* ** <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Bruce Cambelli, you definitely want this movie in your collection. If you are usually interested in movies, you may want to. Just think that the goal of the movies is to smile you, big out (don't worry so bad) and make a good time with your friends. Attention, I told mates, not possible future girlfriend.
