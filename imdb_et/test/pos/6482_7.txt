Beat was an exciting film about a couple of young people trying to survive in New York in the 1980s. This means fighting with another gang of the street, that they are directly sharing high school, trying to stay at school, and also attending local exhibitions that include birds that look like Dead Kennedy and whose name is Skulls. Rex (played by David Jacobson) Plays an autistic boy who is going to handle every kind of long and begins to show them that poetry is really beautiful and when it is applied to what these kids do in life, things can really work for the better! Billy Kane (played by William McNamara) and Kate Kane (played by Kara Glover) are brother and sister. Although these children abduct this crowd, these children are not the same type of people. They take care of Rex and care for others and really show their own illuminated side. Although her sister is sleeping with a gang, she also loves Rex, trying to show her she is not a bitch. Eventually, school teachers finally reach him and want to put him in a mental institution, he finally knows it's time to end his life, while animal animals played without him. But they want to think he's not dead but living his life in full, riding sharks and being happy to live in the ocean. This movie was one of those movies where I was glad I was watching it. Although it was a lot of fun, he had a great message. Nothing in the long line that these children did not come to the future, did not see the need to look, but because the anxious child came, they all realized that there were many more important things in life, then fighting with the local black children or everything was destructive. Rex showed them the beauty of angry music. Rex showed them beauty in rats, diseases and murders. Rex showed them beauty in almost everything, while some of these things are not included in the beauty, they still saw that in poems these poems are spoken to people. Rex played an important role in this movement, who changed his heart from depression every time to see that they had hope and why he started showing them; Beat.
