Don't be fooled by the nervous aura surrounding "Mon oncle Antoine" because, like the best Canadian films, darkness collides under the surface. <br /> <br /> It can be assumed that in the 1940s in the rural areas of Quebec, the story of young Benoit's consciousness is being studied when he learns to deal with both sexuality and death. <br /> <br /> The film's appearance is amazing, especially when the public is critical of aesthetics in Canadian cinema. In addition, it is unlikely that Benoit will be the main protagonist who looks at his corrupt community with fresh innocent eyes. <br /> <br /> I recommend reading Jim Leach's critical essay on the best features in Canada for anyone wishing to place a movie in a historical context, but also in a film format. Be sure to check it out.
