It was a casual rental in a video store. But I was impressed from the start. The wooden camera is the pearl of the second feature of the interesting director. The film captures deeply attentive moments and on several occasions the frustrating and complicated social interactions that young interracial friends experience in modern post-apartheid in South Africa. Young actors are pretty good and have approached their basic material and the dialogue is natural and interesting. The film is very rich with visual images that give the frame the deepest understanding and perfection of the study without falling into iconic stereotypes and clich√©s. The musical score of the film adds the body to the film without creating confusion. After watching this second time, I watched the DVD with Amazon and I've been happy since then.
