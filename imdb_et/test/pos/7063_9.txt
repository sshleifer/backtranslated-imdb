No, it's not Citizen Kane. But do you think it's like "meatballs"? This is the best summer summer movie of all summer camp movies. Does anyone say "Little Darlings" line-by-line? Or "Whitewater Summer"? <br /> <br /> It's just one of those movies that got into my brain when I was younger, and I stayed with them all these years. Every time I feel like a geek, I say "Spaz. Spaz. Spaz. Spaz." Or, if we hike in the forest, I'll tell my husband, "I'm Wudy da Wabbi." (She doesn't get it). "It just doesn't matter. It just doesn't matter." This stuff is classic! <br /> <br /> Disappointed with DVD. I want there to be special features, maybe a comment or a make. But the film itself is the perfect moment in the late 70s. Maybe not my life ... You can't help but want short shorts and knee socks and feathers in the forest every time you see this movie.
