This movie is a pearl ... undiscovered by Gerry Anderson's classic. <br /> <br /> The origin of both "UFO" and "Space 1999" is evident in this film, including the electoral list, which also includes late Ed Bishop and George Sewell, both of whom went to the UFO. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that Anderson, despite many TV advances, was unable to develop his talent on the big screen. Just think about what he could have done with the Thunderbirds movie version (which he completely ignored!). <br /> <br /> I'm sure you will give "JTTFSOTS" / "Doppleganger" a fair chance that you will appreciate its good qualities.
