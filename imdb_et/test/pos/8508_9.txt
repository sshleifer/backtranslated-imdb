Yes, let it out before we start: * This is what Sean Connery returned in 1983 after Roger Moore. * This is Connery's latest film. * AND YES this is Thunderball's (a kind of) remake, but more of a movie inspired by it. If all you Bond purists out there, think that I get contradictory, you're right. Bond is one of the biggest film series, but that doesn't mean the series should last forever. I think this is one of two movies where they could have made a big profit and finished Bond's saga. Not yet offended? Then I'll continue ... Hey, if you think I'm indifferent to the Bond corners, you're wrong. I grew up when my mother OBSESSED with them. Any free moment, Bond and his antics would be on TV. Bond Rules and "Never Say Never" (directed by Irvin 'Empire Strikes Back' Kershner) is one of the best. It may not be "Goldfinger" or "From Russia ..." and may not be made by the same production building as everyone else (which I hear why they refuse to approve it!?), But still has head and shoulders facing lately Brosnan's exit ... (if you haven't spit on the screen, read on). DESCRIPTION !!!!! Something so many blocking films forget about these days, but something that is indispensable to tell a good story. "Never" played a great hand when treating 007 as he was outdated from "Dr. No." He is "a little" and so has to do things like go to a health care company - direct order from "M" (!). hasn't seen this movie, i won't give too much to the land because A) loads happen and B) I probably want you to see it yourself. Don't let my "old Bond" show up, Connery still has a lot of great equipment to load, swim, hit, speed, crush, and hit your way. Man is a legend and this movie is one of his most enjoyable events like Bond. High tech gadgets, some big villains and great supportive casting (including Rowan Atkinson's fantastic chunk) raising this movie to the audience's expectations. <br /> <br /> It could have been the last Bond movie, and it should have been kept in mind. Playing a secret agent as a retirement was a refreshing genius - the last scene wrapped things up great t series ... ... but we still had more and more and more and one more Moore. However, if you want to find out what is "Fatima Blush" then get this movie. Then you can at least pretend that 007 spent his last moments as a mysterious secret agent in the hands of Kim Basinger and smiled at Mr. Bean. (P.S. * This second film, which I think it would all end?)
