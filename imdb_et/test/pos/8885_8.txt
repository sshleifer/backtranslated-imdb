When I watched this movie, I looked at the assumption of Hitchcock films and dark comedy. Now that I'm in the mid-20s, it's more meaningful. , both blast (pan and car scenes) and verbal (arguments / conversations about murder and writing). <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Larry Donner (crystal), a winning writer who has stolen her master's Margaret (played by surprisingly radiant Kate Mulgrew, named Captain Janeway, Star Trek: Voyager). <br /> <br /> Although he changes the writer's block and teaches the creative writing class, he meets with his students Owen Lifts (DeVito), an ambitious writer and an overgrown mother who still acts as a child. He has toy train paths, do I need to say more? Think away from starting, only Matt McConaughey is short, greasy and bald. <br /> <br /> Owen has stuck in her life, with a demanding evil mother (Anne Ramsey) whom she can't stand. She is looking for Larry's advice on how to get out of it and when she says to go to Hitchcock's film, Owen gets the wrong idea that if she kills Larry's wife, she will return her and kill her mother. Hilarity occurs while two are trying to solve each other's problem. Owen goes to extreme places to kill Margaret, while Larry, who refuses to counsel his "part of his plan," is wrapped by Owen's mother. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Larry and Owen are slowly but surely nowadays a rare friendship in dark comedy. One part of the movie I really loved was where Owen shows the collection of Larry coins and just lets say that it's more of a sentimental collection than anything. <br /> <br /> Two main stars aside, late Anne Ramsey is as fun as Mom and killing her cane. He is more comic in this word and in physical terms, as opposed to his role in Mama Fratelli's The Goonies. So she wears like a sailor and throws her son off at every step, but it makes her character so alive. He makes his character a person you love to hate. <br /> <br /> Another movie in this movie is the jazz musician of Brandford's Marsal, who plays Larry's neighbor and friend Lester. The film has a great moment in which he plays Larry with jazz who is depressed and needs some good stories to relieve pain. Jazz can do it. <br /> <br /> Finally, Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito would like to make another good movie together, but their certainty becomes too old for the game. This is one of those rare films where both stars look fine. DeVito's childish comedy and Crystal's sharp spirit made this movie for me. 5 star comedy.
