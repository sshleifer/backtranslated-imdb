I first gathered Nightbreed on television a year ago and I was pleasantly surprised by the results. <br /> <br /> Clive Barker has said he has been livening up with the fear of Hellraiser, but this is a film that has hampered his cinema career somewhat. What an unfortunate thing is, because this film, like the Midian people, seems to be misunderstood. <br /> <br /> Barker has created a cross breed of clips of genres in this story - it begins as a traditional horror film but soon becomes a human inhumanity. Sending sympathy to the devil is tough at best, but if the characters are so visually demonic as they are in the movie, it becomes almost impossible (to hit the baby!). Practically like a clan, a human rebellion (knees and holy anger!) In the movies is twice as troublesome before what has gone before. Compared to ethnic tension and white supremacy, this film can be quite obvious. <br /> <br /> I regret those who don't see the film from this perspective and think about it when Barker's fantastic petting went too far. We have a real forgotten pearl here, and the sooner the studio and Mr Barker make a beautiful and dedicated time - the better.
