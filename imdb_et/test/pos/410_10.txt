While many are moving out of it as a B movie, it is really a first-rate comedy that has been well written and acted. Red Skelton is great because Wally Benton is better known to radio fans as Fox. Ann Rutherford is perfect when Wally's groom Carol Lambert. Conrad Veidt controls the criminals very well. I read one of the accounts in this movie that says Vincente Minelli directed this film unless he changed his name to S. Sylvan Simon, who directed all three Fox films. This is a very fun movie made to encourage imagination. So get your black and white bias if you have one, sit back and enjoy a really great comedy. It was also Red's first major role. Take note of the Orson Welles World Fight Transfer.
