The Vampire concept is an inhuman body that should live its grave at night to drink living blood. Bakjwi slips its concept on the head, which has a sharp and sharp bite. Being an R-rated movie, I knew it was really about vampires, which really are vampires. This means that the characters in the film will do what the vampires actually do without restrictions, and that there are no glamorous moments compared to Twilight. Having looked at the previous retreat of Chan-wook Park, I had great expectations for Bakjw. <br /> <br /> I was awaiting some of the inconveniences our anti-hero, known as priest Sang-hyeon, and his impression was a great performance as a holy man forced to be humane and obedient to his thirst as a vampire. (SPOILER) After the initial assumption that he lived over a defective transfusion, he begins to crave blood and discover his superpower and his ability to fly. Screen shots make their transition phase without overcrowding. He starts drinking blood from blood and those who want to euthanize for moral reasons. Often the tragic and insecure love that the priest is manipulating with Tae Yoga is very riveting because they are played by The Host's Kanh-ho Song and actor OK-vin Kim. Special effects are correctly placed on the background, and although it does not offer anything new in the way of the Stunts and CGIs, it did not establish itself on the plot and the nature's premise. The story and the main plot points are very perverse and grotesque, but peculiar in their Korean style. <br /> <br /> There are not many negative things I can say about Bakjwi. Sometimes I ask myself if the transition phase of the priests could have shown more of a priest with a mother-in-law transformation, but then it would have made the movie again for 3 hours. The movie started long. Similarly, vampires do not really need much to express emotions. As mentioned earlier, this movie is very tragic, so do not wait for it to look for hope. In general, Bakjwi is happy in the dark, sick and original. I strongly recommend this movie to serious viewers who have passed the Twilight teenage phase. This is definitely Korea's answer to the Swedish license for the right one, which is also a good film.
