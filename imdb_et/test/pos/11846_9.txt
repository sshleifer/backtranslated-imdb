I loved this movie. That's a lot of laugh. Action is good and writing is really sharp. I see a hundred such films as THIRD Ring art, who repeat and repeat themselves. <br /> <br /> This is a small budget issue and seems to have hit the DV, but looks good and Jay Mohr and Julianne Nicholson are great together. Why do you have at least ten lines? I'm not a critic, but a patron. <br /> <br /> I doubt Quentin Tarantino could write this funny picture without filling it with masturbating free violence. This movie should be seen on more than one screen. I laughed from beginning to end. >
