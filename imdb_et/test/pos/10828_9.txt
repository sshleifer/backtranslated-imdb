"Bon Voyage" is a fast pace that reminds me of Indiana Jones / Star Wars movies in some way - it's like a fast train or roller skater. <br /> <br /> This is romance, mystery, thriller and farce upon billing; it is all and more, including sincere observations of the reactions of French society during the Nazi invasion at the beginning of World War II. It is also an exhibition of juggling, which includes 7 main characters. All the scenes seemed historically accurate (my eyes) and gave me a great sense of time. <br /> <br /> All actors were well cast and had great performances, but the IMO was great for Isabelle Adjani, who played the role of opportunistic, self-centered French filmmaker; Not only did he want to play the role of a young actor convincingly, maybe half his age, but he was convincingly convincing yet, so the audience sees that he is just half serious and more complicated than a man than just a gold digger. His character and energy move the film from beginning to end. It was only when I read Roger Ebert's review that I discovered he was 48 years old at the time of the movie. What a beauty !! <br /> <br /> I appreciated the end - it is satisfactory, but lets you write your conclusion on what happens to the main characters. <br /> <br /> As the other user commentator observed - DO NOT arrive late; you must be open from the scene. Good advice. <br /> <br /> I gave it to 9 out of 10.
