This is definitely the most tense that filled the first season's X-Files episode. this episode is what I mean when I hear "X-Files". The plot is simple but comes out. Our main cast plus some scientists are going to explore Alski's outpost, where his research team seems to be killing one another. It turned out that a small parasite that was excavated from the ice had infected a study group. The parasite binds to the brain and causes paranoia and madness. Soon, no one can tell who they trust or who are infected. Thing is set in Antarctica and a team of scientists finds a destroyed outpost where he has been killed or killed. An alien who had been buried for 10,000 years was thawed. He has the ability to emulate any form of life. therefore the main characters are no longer able to leave enemy friends. if you liked the ICE episode, I suggest you see it. Or, if you've only seen what I suggest you see ICE. the best X-Files episodes. I will give it a 10/10.
