I can be Virginia's old boy in the states of the American Confederation, but this man does it for me. It's a mustache for me. I remember seeing his video for the first time. The girl she beat was amazing. The depth of his behavior, cut into a weatherproof facade, was a new level of masculinity. It reminds me of our Mt. granite sculptures. Rushmore. If I could ask him a question, it would be, "If you were dogs, would you eat yourself?" Does Orhan make a reunion? Note, like Gordon Lightfoot, if true music never disappears from the heart. Vive La John Denver. Gracias my friend, O.F.F.L. (Orhan Fan for Life)
