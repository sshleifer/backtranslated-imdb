I didn't carry the story and plot lines because they have already been featured on this page several times, so? I've seen this movie because I've seen such a movie. Beautiful, elegant and restrained with a narrative pace. The sensitivity of the film and its undervalued qualities, which are rare on rare earths. Beautifully weak photography, saturated with rich luxurious colors and lack of better words, each frame is full of tension in the air. Settings and locations are used repeatedly, but every time they are highlighted, the film can breathe new life, it always seems to be a keychain, lighting device or set piece to suggest to the audience somewhat. World. <br /> <br /> Actress reminds me of "Bicycle Thief", not style, but the fact that you forget that you are looking at two things you do with your crafts. Every gesture has a meaning and almost every movement is important to explain the inner world of the characters, the relationship, the feelings and the situation of the two lovers. Dialogue is weak, but as with the rest of the film, it's meaningful. Speaking of meaning, the soundtrack is infectious. Here, it becomes a story-telling device. And even though the film is of Chinese origin, even the movie that was sung by Nat King Cole in Spanish gives a subtle film. An orchestrated audio track is repetitive, but repeating is what makes it comfortable. It is used together with the story and not just with the way music works or with the audience, to feel a certain way on a particular plot. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend this movie to anyone, I'm afraid the most peaceful story is a peaceful stream, but I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for an alternative to a romantic blow that fills our multiplexes around the world. I have to say that this movie is completely taken, and I continued it at night after watching the night. The story takes time to bring out and watch itself, as very few movies in this genre are open to such a broad interpretation. Very beautiful film.
