After reading that '' at the time of the 2002 release, his budget was $ 47 million, or $ 327,000,000, which makes it the most expensive French film. But Astérix et Obélix contre César (1999) had a budget of $ 48 million, or FRF 274,620,000, which probably made it the most expensive French movie ever. “I discovered why I found this movie one of the most beautiful and colorful of all I've ever seen. I loved scenarios, clothes (especially Cleopatra) and movie atmosphere! It's so happy and cheerful! I found jokes smart and fun, and I have to keep this movie in favorite songs of all time. <br /> <br /> Also great is Monica Bellucci (who is very beautiful Cleopatra) Gérard Depardieu (big Obelix! Christian Clavier, Jamel Debbouze (that I saw 'Amélie Poulain' for the first time)) :) :) / / <br /> I even recommend this movie to people who don't know Asterix and Obelix comics. You have great fun! :) <br /> <br /> aka "Asterix e Obelix: Missão cleópatra" - Brazil
