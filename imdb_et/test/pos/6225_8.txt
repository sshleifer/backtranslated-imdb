I had actually seen the last parts of the movie when I was a child. Thanks to the plot search feature, I found out its name. For years I did not know this name, but I thought the film was stuck. Finally, he hoped that the main character would eventually return to Earth. It was a shame if he didn't. This film reminds me of a trip to the sun. Also known as Doppleganger. If you liked this feature, the other is worth it. It was done before the stranger, but shares a similar plot. But different. I just got out of VHS from Stranger eBay. I hope they do a DVD, but it's doubtful if it doesn't come out of the Dollar DVD. Some pilots make it into the budget for DVDs and maybe it is.
