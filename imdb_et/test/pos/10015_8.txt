Even if you are a fan of Jean Rollin's idiosynthetic workflow, you get this extraordinary fiction into the sci-fi territory. Once upon a time, a prominent vampire girl has never been stuck one after another! Based on tradition, the budget proved too narrow to fully understand the director's vision. But it is largely compensated by his obvious love of love, his dedication to his craft, and his honesty. The cinematography of Jean-Claude Couty's atmosphere makes the most preferred places and Philippe Bréjean ("Gary Sandeur") gives an amazing soundtrack, which, fortunately, is not similar to any hardcore stuff created for him. <Br /> <br /> The film made in the Paris office block and its surroundings before and after the working hours has been filmed mainly with porn videos. Rollin was already quite familiar with his "Michel Gentil" money collection efforts, especially in French, with the demanding leadership of Brigitte Lahaie. Playing Elisabeth (quite well, I can add), she has rushed to the nearby highway one night with Robert (Vincent Gardère), driving home at the end of a long working day. Hardly able to put together a series of events born there, Elisabeth seems to be losing her memories just after the events, even forgetting the role of Robert's name and heroic savior before the end of his night flight in his apartment. Before love, he rightly describes a virgin (additional credit for Brigitte's skills that he can handle so convincingly, being only the 70's most active adults), because he can't remember one touch before him. Because of this bit of context, the relatively long sexual scene that completely deviates from other "commercial" intermediate benefits, Rollin was supposed to be involved in other works to secure funding. <br /> <br /> When Robert leaves, he has inevitably erased Elizabeth's weak mind. The mysterious doctor (comedian Bernard Papineau against the effectively cast type) and his impending assistant Solange (amazing porn star Rachel Mhas) move in his absence and took him back to where he appeared. Here we get one of the strongest scenes when he once again introduced his roommate Catherine (late Cathérine Greiner a / k / hardcore "Cathy Stewart" in a quietly devastating turn), both girls desperately supplying fictitious shared "memories" to each other to overcome your inevitable destiny. This deterioration is not limited to remembering it when it is delivered at lunch and Catherine is unable to control her movements by trying to eat a spoonful of soup. It is also Catherine, who expresses the compromise of the filmmaker with the demands of trade, because she calls Elizabeth naked and keeps her because sex is everything they have left so far, so both mental and physical knowledge have left them. <br /> <br /> Several fairly explicit - if not very hardcore - scenes make up the middle of the movie and French porn players should recognize Alain Plumey (a / c "Cyril Val"), Jacques Gateau and Elodie Delage porn princess Marilyn Jess, whose rape in the hand, and in the mouth of a Plumey member, had only a movie in the rarely revised XXX version of FILLES TRAQUEES. Véronique's central girl, Elisabeth, almost seems to remember and tries to escape again, is beautifully dominique by Journet - an unforgettable debut - who continues to support Franco Zeffirelli's LA in TRAVIATA. In the sixth leg, which ends, it turns out that the condition has deteriorated as a result of a nuclear reaction, quarantine "patients" will end up barely breathing the empty shell that was destroyed by firing in the oven. The final blow offers a heartbreaking variation of Chaplin's MODERN TIMES as Elisabeth, now approaching a complete collapse, and the wounded Robert stumbles across the railway bridge, stirring each other's tightened arms.
