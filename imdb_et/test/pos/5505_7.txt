The sick guy Carleton Hendricks (Dee Snider) travels on Teen Chat lines like Captain Howdy. She is a teenage boy and invites other teenagers to his house. Instead, they strike them, strap on, sew their mouths and torture them (mostly with needles). He hits the daughter of police officer Mike Gage (Kevin Gage). He finds him, he arrests and is institutionalized. Four years later he was released ... completely healed. But lynch mop (led by Robert Englund) attacks him and hangs him. He doesn't die, but he clicks and Captain Howdy is back ... <br /> <br /> Very sick, annoying, twisted horror movie. Captain Howdy enjoys pain and torture and tries to show the children that he is abducting how to enjoy it. Torture scenes are not so clear (you hear more than you see), but what you see is very ill. There is no humor and the (mournful) screaming of his victims sound too real. I was away from the TV during most scenes. <br /> <br /> It works differently. Kevin Gage is not as good as a cop - he is not terrible, but he could have been better. Dee Snider is very scary because Captain Howdy - his attack scenes are not pleasing. I'll probably never see it again (this movie really gets under the skin), but I recommend it to all the spooky fans - at least those with a strong stomach. I'll give her 7.
