I was one of those few who went on the road to see. I've often thought about it since then. After watching the two DVDs, I am happy to say that it was great. Like any great comedy, I laughed more at each viewing, both in the expectation of the gags and after I could miss it. <br /> <br /> Mike judges very well when creating extremely comic characters and matching them to the world to make sense. In Office Space, the environment makes the characters credible. The future of idiocracy gives him the freedom to write incredibly stupid characters and make them work. I look forward to seeing if they release better DVDs with some real features before buying it. But this film deserves a DVD that hasn't been offered to it in the theater.
