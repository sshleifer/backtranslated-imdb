What a fine film! Unfortunately, the film script in 1947 could not follow the book it was adapted to, but the homosexual murder would have been too hot for this era. <br /> <br /> I thought all the performances were outstanding, as well as script, direction, brilliant black and white cinematography, music and movie ambiance. <br /> <br /> I realize that in 1947 the film could not be filmed against black or prejudice. against homosexuals. (Robert Young's understanding of his grandfather, who was an Irish and who suffered this racism 100 years ago, was pretty flat, but times showed that the film prevents further research on racism.) I have one observation and one question to ask the viewer: 1. Did you notice that Robert Young did not catch his gun when he sent Robert Ryan, who ran in the dark, and Young shot the top story from the window into the darkness without a goal? 2. If Robert Grand's grandfather was killed 100 years ago in 1847 (the film was made in 1947) and Young was 40 years old, it would not be logical. If the grandfather had been killed 50 years ago, the schedule would be realistic.
