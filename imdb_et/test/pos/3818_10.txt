It makes no sense to compare it with the original series. Although both are different in appearance and content, they are true to the original idea. That means SF / Horrorantology series. Due to Australia's indifferent schedules, I only managed to distribute a few episodes of the first few seasons. The first episode really gave me slippers (nightmares at my age ...!), But several others had fallen; in general, when you create the slippers in horror and away from SF. I hope the DVDs will finally reach us.
