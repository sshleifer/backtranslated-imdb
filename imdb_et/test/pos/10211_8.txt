I doubt whether the real story of western development would ever have become a real audience. Instead of talking about building a telegraph system to the west, it was the board of boards that dominated one of the most interesting (and not pleasant) big "robberies": Jay Gould. Gould received a fighting company and turned it into a communication image - and part of its attempt on the national rail system to compete with Vanderbilt. But this, though interesting, is not as exciting as the story of installing telegraph lines. At least this would see viewers. Jay Gould died in 1892. If he had lived in a modern era and invested in Hollywood, he would probably have agreed to this assessment. <br /> <br /> The film discusses how the installation of the telegraph system is threatened by the Indians, encouraged by one Jack Slade (Barton MacLane). Deserative Slade is not happy with the development of a communication system that will definitely put her abilities off the police in the territory. He is faced with a man responsible for installing telegraph wires, Edward Creighton (Dean Jagger), Richard Blake, a associate of Creighton (Robert Young), and a quasi-lawyer Vance Shaw (Randolph Scott), a brother of Slade. Blake, who has little understanding of the West, romanticizes Creighton's sister Sue (Virginia Gilmore), but finds it difficult to get used to her new surroundings. But he will become a close friend of Shawi, especially in his quest for Slade. <br /> <br /> Slade was indeed a real western crime crime issue and topic with Mark Twain's ROUGHING IT. He was hung in the 1870s. But he was not involved in mixing Indians with railways or telegraph companies. But MacLane makes him memorable and completely annoying. The killing of one of his main characters takes place suddenly and backwards - and he looks at the body as if he was just released. But Lang is responsible for this, but also other touches. Look at the sequence with Chill Wills, where he is on the telegraph pole that fixes it. She spits the tobacco juice several times when she spoke to the young people who were a little bit devastating. Then there is the Indian attack, which we look at the ground. Finally, Young suddenly gets back, but it's not brown but red. He looks upwards, and through it Indian wills with an arrow. <br /> <br /> This is a fascinating movie that is worth watching and catching.
