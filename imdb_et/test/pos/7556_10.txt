The film follows four friends from the 1950s (when they are in high school) until 1981. They are Danilo (Craig Wasson) Yugoslav immigrant; "Free spirit" of Georgia (Jodi Thelan); David (Michael Huddleston), who has no person and Tom (Jim Metzler) a big, strong, beautiful and tough guy. All three of them are in love with Georgia, but he only loves Danilot. The film mainly focuses on these two - it crowns life, love and attractiveness over the years. It also gets to Danilo, trying to defeat his harshly immigrant father. <br /> <br /> I love this movie, but it's not without bad points. Thelan's high, prickly voice is annoying (but you get used to it); the story jumps very fast; Tom's and David's life has never been explained (Tom appears with Vietnamese wife and children, and David has a woman we will meet to end); some important scenes are poorly written and there are some obvious pre-release cuts (likely to keep the movie for 2 hours). <br /> <br /> But everything else is so good you can easily forget the problems. The story is convincing - you can really feel and understand the characters and always get alive. With some exceptions, the scenario (by Steve Tesich) is good - Tesich was actually a Yugoslav immigrant himself and was based on a lot of script of his own experience. All actors are great - especially Thelan and Wasson - and Reed Birney throws a strong and pleasant performance, like Louie, Danilo's college roommate. And Lois Smith is very interesting in his role. And look for Mercedes Ruehl and Glenne Headly quickly! <br /> <br /> Basically, this is a great story about immigrants, age, American love, and perfectly covers 50-80s. <br /> <br /> This movie was corrupted when it was released (unfairly). The studio didn't know how to advertise it (it's a tough movie on the market) and critics (Pauline Kaels' review of The New Yorker was particularly tough). It was hardly played in theaters (I was happy to have it in 1981 with my short theater) and has just disappeared. It is a pity. This is a film that is only ready for replay. I'm not doing this betting - but you never know! Sure 10 all the time!
