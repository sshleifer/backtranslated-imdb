Aristocats is really quite charming and is too low in IMDb. Songs are not as memorable as Jungle Book, but they were not at all bad. Animation is really cute, the best parallel is the Paris landscape in general. It looked beautiful. This is probably Disney's most relaxing animation, and just like another evaluator rightly said, who doesn't love cats? The other big animation was O 'Malley Duchess's eyes, as their romance was so plausible that it wasn't obvious. (Good thing) The plot (about the greedy butler and treasure reminds me of Bailey billions) but worked very well and the script was really funny, especially between kittens. They remind me of me and my brother and 3 sisters, always fighting. My favorite scene was tracking Edgar with two dogs who always fought over who was the driver. The talents of the voices were a joy, especially for Phil Harris, whom I recognize from the Jungle Book, and Eva Gabor from the rescuers. Supportive characters, Scat Cat, too, were well done. All in all, it is a really nice movie that is definitely undervalued. 8.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
