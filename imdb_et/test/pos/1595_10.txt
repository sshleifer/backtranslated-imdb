If all the films were destroyed and only one could save, then Venice's death should be. This is a monument to film history. A lot of criticism that he is slow, boring and too clear when he noted this point (the old man discovers the beauty of young boys and is tragically destroyed, first mentally, then physically), we should appreciate this movie for what it is . "Morte a Venezia" was shot more than 30 years ago and it is still in the early twentieth century. <br /> <br /> Life was slower then now. People had to behave in a certain way, hiding their true emotions even from themselves. Leader Visconti and Dirk Bogarde, the leading actor, are able to show off how an aging composer Von Aschenbach is discovering his romantic interest in a young boy. For a man like Von Aschenbach, this must be a too powerful shock over time to cope with it. We see his inner struggle, mostly Bogarde's face, with the beautiful background of Venice, accompanied by the most amazing music by Gustav Mahler. <br /> <br /> This movie is slow and cannot be denied. There are no special effects, no car rides or struggles to keep the viewers on their seats. There are no perverted sex scenes; communication between a man and a boy is confined to a stolen glance from a distant and random smile. <br /> <br /> So what's going on in this movie? Not if you want your minds to be like a basic drum. If you want them to be played as a romantic concert of a violin, that's the movie.
