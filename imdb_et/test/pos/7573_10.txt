Sarah Plain and Tall's Winters were the best movie I've ever seen. Create the story that I liked most was to be Cassie, played by Emily Osment. Just because of your energy and how he speaks. For example, when Anna calls Cassi from the city and she says, "Hi? Give me what. The big father was gone, but he's back and he's not a good man!" I loved all Sarah Plain and high films in my estimation, I think Sarah Plain and tall were # 3. Skylark was # 2. If I could live in any family from the past, it should be a Witting family. I think there are so many good parts in this movie that I can't name. I think they chose the best and the finest actors to play all these people in the movie, so if you ever want to watch a movie from the past, I would highly recommend the end of Sarah Plain and Tall Winters.
