BLACK WATER must be one of the best Australian films I've seen for many years. My girlfriend and we sat in each other, jumped in all the right places. It is just as much crocodile as OPEN WATER was shark film. In other words, creatures are only part of the dilemma, the trap in which people get through the circumstances. How much the relationship and fear of director Andrew Traeck and David Nerlich has caused so much is that it is amazing to look. And when I say fear, its overcrowding, artificially constructed moments, but more about the fact that if you ask yourself, "How do I feel in this situation" will you be "scared witless". The performances were great, the momentum between the mangroves and the brilliant punches were great and the moments of the end of the film were really right. This is the best debut for two directors who should be justifiably proud. Go and see this very beautifully hit and acted as a stopover.
