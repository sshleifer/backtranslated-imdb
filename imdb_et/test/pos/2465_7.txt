Emilio Estevez actually headed a good movie who thought? I sat through the two previous films Estevez - "Wisdom" (with girlfriend Demi Moore) and "Men at work" (brother Charlie Sheen). They are bad films --- badly acted, directed, stupid and offensive. Estevez is a good actor but director as a director. I made it curious - it has a great cast and I had nothing else to do. Damn if he doesn't pull me. <br /> <br /> This is about Estonia, who is coming from Vietnam from his homeland, permanently intimidated by what happened there. Her parents (Kathy Bates, Martin Sheen) and her sister (Kimberly Williams) are trying to reach her but can't. Something in Vietnam has been deeply influenced by him ... and he plans to explode ... <br /> <br /> It's a little bit over, but still very good. Many materials are famous, but the cast is so good that it seems to be new. Estevez is good, Sheen is terrible (and Estevezs real life father), Williams touches and Bates is just extraordinary - trying to keep the family together. It all brings with it a powerful end that surprised me. <br /> <br /> Well-paid catch. <br /> <br />
