Scriptwriters Peter Viertel, Joan Harrison and (all) Dorothy Parker allow director Alfred Hitchcock to explain what his favorite film may be like: an innocent person who wrongly fingers crimes on the lamp. Hitchcock, who had a story about the origins of this story, engineers confirm a lot of tension to store a warehouse worker who accused his best friend of killing; he will make a trip to find the real culprit. A lot of excitement on a large scale, usually with colorless actors (Priscilla Lane, Norman Lloyd, Alan Baxter) makes a surprisingly fine job. Even the ever-secret Robert Cummings comes into the right spirit! *** from ****
