Frozen borders are big screen drivers known as Crazy Gang. They were a group of British entertainers who formed in the early 1930s. Basically, the group's six men were Bud Flanagan, Chesney Allen, Jimmy Nervo, Teddy Knox, Charlie Naughton and Jimmy Gold. In a variety of halls the group was also popular with the royal family. The plot here sees them as a Wonder Boys troupe who went to Alto for their treasure by reading the golden speed of the newspaper. The only problem is that when they finally arrive at Red Gulch, it turns out they're 40 years too late! <br /> <br /> I often see when I see the statement "it's very British" because it means that those who are not British Isles can get into trouble. The reason it disturbs me is that, in this www / internet era, I have gathered some non-British lover who know they share their best in the best parts of Ealing, Will Hay and the incredible Terry-Thomas. So, is it true that something like frozen limits is unlikely to be appreciated by non-British listeners? Well yes, this is true, so much here is British, but it really has to be said that the classic film fan is pretty familiar with history and when everything is said and done, the visual miracle is universal. Anarchic "not" so that the wild west will make an absolute winner. A winner who has every chance that the American audience would appreciate it more than a British audience. Not all comedies work, and indeed the "big 6" is a stunning movie for Moore Marriott for a long time. But there are sketches and parodies that deserve respect and appreciation for making more comedy comedies. Ovaltine gag is unlikely to have fallen off almost with his chair, but if you are a classic comedy fan? I'm sure you admit in the worst case that there are some very talented people here. <br /> <br /> Then do mountain doses always give your husband? 8/10
