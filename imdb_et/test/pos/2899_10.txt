Personally, I have "Egyptian" in a very favorable light. <br /> <br /> This was introduced by the well-known Australian film commentator and critic Bill, who was well-known for his understanding and broad vision of the people and places and especially movies. This film was perfect for Bill, and I came to appreciate his comment and enthusiasm for the film that came up when I watched it, as I was literally pulled out in a minute, apart from my introductory remarks, many years ago in my initial review. <br /> <br /> For me, it was a layered layer in half an hour, intriguing and exciting! Yes, I am aware of its mistakes! But was it so appealing? a young man ideally learning and inspiring his father? did the peasant treat his suffering like garbage? however, an opportunistic friend is faulty but still loved by his friend, a central symbol of you? And be sure the hero of the mistake, like many people in the whole society and all the time, but also lovable and loving! Yes, I believe in a Christian God, but I also recognize the rights and respect that should be a good-hearted person who does not respect or respect the rights of his companion without any unreasonable cause. As such, I approve of the idea of ​​this film and its good-hearted and convincing man in his faith in the sunset he devoted. Such people are always welcome in my world vision and hopefully many more. <br /> <br /> So the drama of the movie I've often watched is so touching my heart and soul so sure that in his age it seems to be critics. It's exciting, looking at the doctor for your struggle and grief and love! When I look at it again, I am always reminded of the heart of Bill's film critic who dared to resist ALL the critics who had broken it long ago. Did he add too much criticism from critics? to make statues on the fair, on the screen or in history, but they do not make the critics glorious! In addition, I am reminded of watching every SUPERB & TOUCHING, a beautiful and well-presented drama that was not only relevant to the 1950s or some of the past. It was meant for you and other times and places, for every man and woman and child, and their personal desires for love and freedom, and to overcome the obstacles of misunderstandings and severe injustice and tragedy that are simple religions of many religions, it seems too much cause of war! Stay away from invitations or unfair violence at night, caused by other unfairly executed and judicial attacks, and consider the benefits of this offer. Not for the sun god or the power that proves time and again to be so transient .. let this EXCLUSION film wash you, like the waves on the beach, like the passage of time? as life was meant to be. And maybe you'll find yourself in a world of opportunities! Missing offers are no longer! 9.9 out of 10!
