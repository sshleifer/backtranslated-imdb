This is one of those movies where I just want to dance around my feet and house. This is a very positive and happy music. There are some sad parts in the movie, but most of the music is what makes me happy. Gary Busey did a good job as Buddy Holly. Buddy Holly even continued his pastor, his parents and the Nashville record producer told him not. Buddy Holly did not give up what he liked. I didn't know much about Buddy Holly until I watched this movie. I've been to Surf Ballrooma, where he last played but didn't pay much attention to it until I watched this movie. This is an incredible movie with lots of fun to get on your feet and watch this movie.
