Sometimes, but very rarely, the film speaks so well that it becomes almost difficult. This movie speaks at the same time of several stories so well that it was the first time a couple of films that I couldn't finish. It was too real .... and the characters were so strong that they looked at it for personal struggle. Seeing that these three men and their families are dealing with their difficulties, it is too difficult for me. Now, I have been watching it several times and I understand what I always suspect. This movie is a masterpiece. Writing, acting, blending several stories without even being the least evil, all about this movie is exceptional. Seven Academy Awards? No wonder it must definitely deserve it.
