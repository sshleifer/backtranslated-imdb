It is therefore important to talk about the release of a DVD, not just a movie. Crapper's stories are a movie that can only be offered by one of the world's studios. That has brought us innovative and original independent films for 30 years: Troma. This is really a very special movie, because it may not be my favorite Troma productions, but it is released on a disc that I just said it is one of my most valuable and favorite DVDs. Not only countless Troma discs I have, but I read my entire movie collection. The film itself is due to a bad plan to produce a television series led by a director who was entrusted with a considerable amount of money (especially Troma) to do something wonderful and offer a lot of unfinished and incomprehensible material before giving up (or dismissal, I'm not sure what is currently). To avoid a big investment in the toilet, Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz decided to meet a team of managers and actors and use the material as the backbone of one movie. One movie that really consists of two, nice old Tales From The Crypt, organized by Crapkeeper, played by Mr Kaufman himself. But as I said, it's not my favorite of my movies. This is largely due to strange discipline in different sets, forgetting the difficult Troma rule "no booze set" discovered by the furious Lloyd and other less respectable staff that Troma was filming. added scenes. All this did, but it was impossible for Mr Kaufman to make a valuable product in the editing room. But Lloyd Kaufman has genius and restless scenes that are already confusing to the original product, and he didn't make much less of a masterpiece. The film itself is as good as the circumstances that would allow the most brilliant filmmaker to cut, and it is definitely a lot of fun, totally confusing, loaded with elements that made Troma great and definitely unique and unique. But if the film itself isn't as brilliant as many other Troma productions. However, the independent cinema genius made the DVD of this film as much as the release of the movie with some extra games. The film is when the thrust is really only a part of the whole DVD, which is a document of a difficult situation as a whole, where serious filmmakers have to live in a world that is monopolized by some very large individuals who don't let other players in their market market. A document about the problems that people have in trusting to find out that freedom is sometimes something that is hard to live, and realize that access to a film budget when the Boss is not over can even ruin those who really need to know. The brilliance of this DVD is that the film is not perfect and that Lloyd knows it and does not want anyone to think he believes it is. A full-length comment is an exhibition in itself (as is often the case with Mr Kaufan's voice commentary), mixing humor, despising those who deserve it, and very interesting information for anyone interested in making an independent film in such a way that watching a movie with this comment again right after It is so interesting that it is hard to stop when it is viewed on its own merits. The full length documentary PIKK BROWN LINE takes us behind the scenes to various places where Lloyd visits the kits to sometimes take over and take advantage of what he finds there. We sometimes see him frustrated, unlike his appearance in other documents, such as the Dark Fart and the Apocalypse soon, both of which find the black-and-white MAKE YOUR OAMN DAMN MOVIE box. <br /> <br /> Added scenes with James Gunn (who started his career in Troma to find success as a writer who is now a director of Hollywood) and Trey Parker (again someone who starts off with Troma's released work) is later his South Park series national The hero is entertaining and probably (just as elsewhere in this version) is the reason for getting this album alone for anyone interested in the work of these two characters. Loaded much more than I mentioned here (including the second audio comment) is one of the best Troma-DVD releases.
