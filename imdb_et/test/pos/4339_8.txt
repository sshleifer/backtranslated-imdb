I had never seen an original desire in the book to wish to die (film). But Death Wish 3 was a very interested movie. Well-known vigilants, Paul Kersey tried to visit his friend Charlie, but he only visited him for a few minutes before he died because Charlie did not pay for the huge and infamous underground gang led by Manny Franker. After being imprisoned in prison, Kersey learned that Franker, whom he was fighting in prison, was on his agenda to make the New York City hellfire (and his influence) by sending his minions every time to determine the crime everywhere and every day. Insp. Due to this opportunity. Richard Shriker, who knows his profile well and likes him very much. Kersey decided to make war with Franker and his power. <br /> <br /> I agreed that Death Wish III was one of the most straightforward and extreme acts of violence I saw in the past. This movie used the story very straight. Incomplete stories and less unnecessary scenes that were one of the film's values. The next issue used violence in the film. I believed that many viewers might like the scene of Death Wish III's activities because it showed crude oil, extreme and blast every minute of the movie, especially the climax of the movie and the death of Manny Franker, which I thought was the maximum scene of action. <br /> <br /> As for the majority, I think everyone was good and got their role. Charles Bronson made everyone believe he was still as great as Paul Kersey. He didn't look like a "big old cat," but a big vigilant. Gavan O'Herlihy also did a great job. His main villainous role in the film made him look disgusting and seeing as a big bad man. But Kathryn Davis' role in this film was pathetic. She didn't look like a protagonist. I thought he only appeared in two or three scenes before Franker and his follower killed Paul Kersey's heat. It could have more roles. <br /> <br /> Straightforward style and extreme violence made its comment on fans of the extreme films of this movie. The fast paced backward and Forth style made this movie very interesting. Nonetheless, this film had a silly scene and a hole in the plot. First, the scene where Insp.Shriker stood for the first time with Paul Kersey. It was very funny because you attacked your utility before you wanted it to help. Haha! it's like a joke! Although I liked the twist of the plot when Insp.Shriker was later shown that he was helping Kersey, because at the beginning Shriker Kersey was very cheated by his actions, but when the movie came to a climax, it was clear to everyone that it wasn't Kersey hidden action plan. <br /> <br /> In another case, the movie's final scene was backed up. It stinks everyone's feeling because it ended up too easy. The members of Franker's gang saw incredibly when they found that Franker was dead before his girlfriend and other followers decided to escape. Finally, Insp.Shriker promised Paul Kersey to fly out of his city before the police seized him. I thought the scene-ending style can be found in many Cannon Film films, but I don't like it. <br /> <br /> To summarize, I am right to my death request 3 because of my explanation. Cast and act was very good and extreme, even though I had a scene I didn't like. The best short description of this film can be straight and extreme violence.
