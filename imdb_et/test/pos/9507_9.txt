They were alternative before there was an alternative. Residents are a band like no other, and I love them for that. It has all the classics from "Hello Skinny", "Third Reich and Roll" to their respect for the great James Brown, titled "This is the man's husband's man's world". But that's just the beginning. As a bonus, he even has Renaldo & Loafs beautiful "songs for camps" and even "Residents" features. Needless to say, I recommend buying this DVD, I would also like to buy my last album, "Demons Dance Alone," which is fantastic. Uncle Willie Eyeball Buddy # 502
