I love watching Jericho miles. I'm thinking of watching Peter Strauss run when the mile is like watching a 100-meter ring. I think Peter Strauss is a great actor and should make another rolling movie. he is lightning fast, has great energy and can drive a mile less than 4 minutes and my friend is amazing. no person lives out of the rain Murphy I mean, a man runs 80 miles a week, no one does it, but him. I looked at Jericho miles 100 times and look at it in the 100's. great movies are viewed more than non-movies. I thank the filmmakers who have been letting them live for years to be big people and I bless them all.
