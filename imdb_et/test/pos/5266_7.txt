Florence Vidor is the daughter of an adult father who throws him out of the house when the rumor calls him. In the big city, she finds her brother's dead wife (both secretly married) and raises her child independently. Years later, he returns to his family. <br /> <br /> This old melodrama is heavily adhered to with exciting feminist themes (around 1921, but sounds very modern). Some of this is put on the trowel (as the father of Theodore Roberts gives a real workout for his eyebrows), but it is well assembled dramatically and lovingly drawn and photographed by Henry Sharp.
