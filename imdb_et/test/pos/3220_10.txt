this is the best movie I've ever seen !!!!!! I just love them! I look at it every day! i have episodes on the internet! here in Romania, 6 seasons! I am happy to have seen the show from the beginning and I'm glad to see the 7-year season through the Internet. So far 5 is my favorite: D I love it because Logan appears and the scene where they jump is my favorite. I also liked Dean, but Logan is the best. I would like Lorelai to stay with Christopher because she is beautiful. this exhibition is good for all ages and is worth seeing. I really want a DVD, but I think it's never going to appear here in Romania because I think they don't even know they have fans. but no matter what I look at, look at it. bye !!
