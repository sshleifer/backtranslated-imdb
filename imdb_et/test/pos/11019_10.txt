I've been watching this movie repeatedly - every time I laugh at me, it thinks for me and it makes me cry. Robin Tuney does incredible work on Marcy's portrayal (and I'm glad Kate Winslet and the other lady turned back) is just one of the rolls you know nobody else could even compare. It is a beautiful love story of these two very different people who are together. They stand side by side, regardless of what it is, even if it is odd and crazy. <br /> <br /> I tell you not all now - of all I have shown to say 50/50 results - but if you like, you love it and want to share it with others! 10 stars!
