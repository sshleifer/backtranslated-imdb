when I first heard this movie, I noticed that it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s. I noticed that the music was by Elton John, so I thought I had nothing to get rid of, so I got it. What a surprise!!! The film was fantastic. It was true love. The characters (Paul and Michelle) had no luxury, money, and sometimes no food, but they were still happy. I recommended this movie to all my friends, but they all criticized my tastes and even called me names because the film had two minors naked. I think this made the film more realistic. The cinematic art was excellent and it was only to show the great abilities of director Lewis Gilbert
