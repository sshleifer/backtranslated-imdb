I really enjoy this movie. It is time to look back when this nation was indeed in danger from countries that attacked or scared the war against us, i.e. against Japan and Germans. Robert Cummings and Pricilla Lane were excellent in the lead. Otto Kruger, Alan Baxter, Clem Bevins and Norman Lloyd were also supported. The direction, pace and finals are kept and are still of interest. So much so I bought my copy. I appreciate the goodness of Turner classic films, they show so many truly classic films, including that. <br /> <br /> Robert Cummings was definitely not as easy as an actor, and although I am a big fan of Gary Cooper and Joel McCrea, two of my favorite actors who were first offered a leading role, I don't see what they would have played a role that would be has crossed Bob Cummings performance. <br /> <br /> This is a movie I repeat watching and inviting others to watch.
