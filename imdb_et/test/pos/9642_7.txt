I recommend that film viewers go to the Intrepid Museum in the New York area and get some of the closed and narrow lives of World War II submarine crews. How much more should have been for the sailors during World War I? It must be really under hell. <br /> <br /> Walter Huston and Robert Montgomery are led by Hell below, Captain Hunton and Montgomery as his free wheel number two. They are both quite believable as naval officers and the rest are cast like Robert Young, Eugene Palette, Jimmy Durante, Madge Evans, Sterling Holloway and so on. Fulfill their roles quite nicely. <br /> <br /> Quiet service during World War II and beyond. It's amazing, but I could name all the submarine images like Torpedo Run, Operation Pacific, Naval Hellcats, Run Silent, Run Deep and much more and you'll see the same plot situations in all of them. I think there are indeed limitations in situations. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Durante's presentation is interesting. She's pretty funny, and her scene, with her boxing hoop on the shore, is really funny. But I have to say that such a character, as in such narrow quarters, is likely to be very necessary for morality. If you don't have anyone to break the submarine tension, you should get it right over the ship. <br /> <br /> For me, the highlight is, however, the scene of Sterling Holloway's death. Very similar to Sean McClory, who is on the island in the sky. It worships you long after the movie is seen.
