This film received the best film award at Cleveland International Film Festival. This is America's title probably in the fall spring. Action is great. The story takes you to the life of an older man who takes the life he's doing and pulls it up a little. His best friend (and partner in non-serious crimes) puts people at every opportunity, but often reveals his golden heart. Her long-term wife has reached her mindset and makes a life-changing decision that is heartbreaking. The story resolution is beautiful.
