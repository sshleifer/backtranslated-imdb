Kannathil Muthamitt is definitely a great movie. I have to give Mani Ratnam excellent management and A.R. Rahman for great songs. Camera work is just great and is similar to Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan. I'm shocked when this film doesn't win the Oscar for the best foreign language film or even the best camera work.
