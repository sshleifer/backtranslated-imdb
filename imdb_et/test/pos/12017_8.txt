This movie is a bad member of my film collection. Although it is not a mainstream film, I think it is a very effective movie noir, in which Eric Roberts is completely undervalued as an actor. (I'd qualify her as a much better actor than her sister, Julia, who is overrated, but it's another review ...) Roberts plays with her luck ex-reporter with perfect narrative accuracy and jargon. Idealism: Two components that are part of every effective film noir. Roberts' first-time narration enhances the quality of the film and probably keeps us on the true motive of the crime. <br /> <br /> In Palm Springs, everything is set to slow the metaphor about the subject of oppression: Asch (Roberts) has been killed in his past; the police have been emphasized by the Palm Springs rich people who treat them as servants; rich, meanwhile, is nervous (see Johnny Deppi's classic performance as an insightful rich boy who wants to be loved ...); Isolation of each character is everywhere and is further enhanced by the heat and insulation of the desert. <br /> <br /> This movie has an audience when they search for a more modern version of the movie noir. Although there are some elements of the film that may have been more stringent, I suggest you get a copy of this movie and put it directly in The Big Sleep and Chinatown. (The film is based on Arthur Lyon's book, CASTLES BURNING and if you like Roberts's behavior, you might want to get a copy of the ambulance where he introduces his funniest and lighter side.) BEST LINE IN THE FILM: "Careful? Careful what? I should have Only fools ignore the strange warnings of the ladies of the trailer parks. "
