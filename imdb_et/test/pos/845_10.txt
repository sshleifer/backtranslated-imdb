I'm sorry that many people have appreciated it. The series started very well and after the first season it was not so good. <br /> <br /> People tend to forget something and only start to end. This is not good to do, you should look at the whole, not the end result. It is sad that many "normal" characters died, but we had a lot of nice new signs. <br /> <br /> Please do not add yourself to a few characters, but add yourself to the series, content. Please understand that I didn't like when Boone died when Augur died, but ... well. Can you imagine that everyone lives the whole series if they are always in a dangerous situation? Come on, if they don't die, they would be invincible. In this way, you will always keep tension, will he survive, will he die? I understand that people associate themselves with characters, I do that too. My favorite character was Augur, the one who could get into every deliberate computer. He was the one who was mysterious, he could do things with a computer that no one else could get. <br /> <br /> Do I want to make one statement for all the negative voters, whether the series that started so good deserves such a low rating? Should we look at the final season instead? Shouldn't we see how good it was when it started? Shouldn't we see how much we enjoyed it?
