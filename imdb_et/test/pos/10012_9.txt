My wife is a mental health therapist and we looked at it from start to finish. I'm a typical person, and I can't stick with chicks, but this movie is incredible. If you want to see what it is, if someone who goes through this type of effort is a movie for you. When I looked at it, I found myself sorry for her and others for her. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler *** Plus the fact that all the people in the movie, including the mental body, were real people in real life, making it more real. <br /> <br /> One must see a mental health specialty!
