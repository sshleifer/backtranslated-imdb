I'm so happy I don't live in an American small town. Because when I have shown some small towns in the countries, it is populated with all kinds of monsters, including the hungry zombies of the flesh, the evil aliens, and the evil spirits are the safest. In this film, a former doctor who has just made time for his wife's accidental killing in a car accident will take his steps to the nearest small town - he will never see any small town in his life - what happens to the Purgatory Flats. And of course, as soon as he arrives, all hell breaks down. She meets a blonde chick, who is most like a cow in both facial expressions and brain function, and falls in love with her. But there is a small flaw, he is already married to a very small drug dealer who in a few minutes will be mercifully dead. To find out what has come out of it, you should watch the movie yourself. I'm just telling you that it resembles a bit of U Turn by Oliver Stone, but has all the artistic qualities.
