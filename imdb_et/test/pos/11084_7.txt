I'm not a fan of Sean Pennie, but unlike my German colleague, whose review is here, I think he was neurotic, narcotic. He has all the nuances perfect and reminded me of several acquaintances who had a similar taste in "entertainment chemistry". I saw this movie, but once, 10-15 years ago, and this is the only part of the movie that I thought was indelibly etched. I don't say that very often, but in that case: Bravo, Sean Penn! As for the story, it is based on the fact, and as such, it is a tragedy for people to sell their country's secrets to that enemy. Again, Penn has shown what you can do if you do not agree with the administration. Use the freedoms you have paid in the blood; do not break the law.
