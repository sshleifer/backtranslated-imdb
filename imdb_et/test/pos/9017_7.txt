In England, we often feel the British films we like because we are accustomed to the usual American settings and accents. Being from London, where virtual sexuality is set, I felt very emotionally. Virtual sexuality characters, especially women, are just like British teenagers, I felt like I was almost in the movie. I'm instantly involved with the film's character Alex, his coat is quite common in most British teen boys, especially girls. Virtual Sexuality made me feel really good as my only British film, not about gangsters or middle class, but about people watching the movie, the middle-aged teenagers. Americans do not know the emotional bond, but every British teenager should watch it. Everybody from London knows part of the movie in the city, this is definitely a place for my video box!
