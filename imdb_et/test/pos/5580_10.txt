This is perhaps a television series with the greatest potential around any series. Production values ​​are in their class. The characters are rounded and interesting. This is the best entertainment. Some foreigners are quite grotesque, but there is humor that makes it unacceptable. I hope this series will continue for years and will have many by-products. The science fiction has had a bad press, some are legitimate, but it is indeed a flagship scientific literature and I thank Henson for that. Top characters.
