This movie was really a breath of fresh air from the Hollywood crap that I recently saw. The actors are great and the characters are interesting and weird. The story isn't really much, it's simple and it works well. Easy movie just sit and enjoy. The mood was fantastic and the sets really helped to postpone the movie and offered nice visuals. The film obviously has horror aspects, but it is a little more focused on the humorous side of things. You do not laugh it hysterically, but you smile all the way. Humor works very well with the characters and the great actor doesn't hurt. I really watched this movie on the basis that Ron Perlman was in it. His role is somewhat smaller than expected, but it is not important; the rest will do more than enough to occupy you. If you like horror, look at it. If you like comedies, look at it. Just go ahead and see it anyway, it's really very good.
