The first thing you see in this movie is the static angle (the one that is repeated later in the movie), depicting the studio that takes place in the news studio (invisible to the audience). Shortly thereafter, the characteristic story of Fonda will be displayed at the same angle. Don't let it mislead; The film does not mean a female reporter, a woman who struggles with the success of men's dominant profession. It's just an introduction, a way to start a movie (though it's used later). The actual point of this production gradually appears, and the first thing we see is a deliberately long scene. The whole film has such a pace; not slow or pulled out, but deliberate. It is never really fast, even in the few sequences normally expected. This pace (especially since it seems that the plot is even more visible because the disruptive, unpleasant nature of the film is open) is almost painful for the viewer. It inspires you, if it were possible, to jump on the screen, grab the people responsible for the collar and shout to them * to do * something to improve the situation. I never felt that I could get up for a moment or even take off the screen. The topic is extremely important to be aware of, and it is completely addressed here. Too dramatizing (well ... very little, anyway), but an accurate presentation of the problem. The direction is surprising. The empathy sensitive to Lemmon's character is deep. Editing is masterful ... near a scene that ends, explains it completely. The editor, appreciating his filmography, is significantly underestimated. Writing was great. There was a lot of action, especially Lemmon, Fonda and Douglas (who produced it). The lack of scores is perfect; No music is needed to improve it. The end is superb and effective. The film has some negative points ... some of the dialogues are obviously and undoubtedly an exposition, one part of the film, though dramatic, does not seem to follow what follows. Not everyone is watching a movie because of its two attributes that are usually (and rightly) attributed to bad movies; pace (which may be mistakenly considered slow) and (absent) score. It can be argued that this is a negative thing, because everyone should consider the points it presents, but maybe it is better; dealing with a difficult topic with intelligence and respect (both for the subject and the viewer) ... something like that, perhaps it should not be fed with a spoon. I was mesmerized with the film and I was very surprised. I recommend it to anyone who believes in itself strong enough to cope with it. 9/10
