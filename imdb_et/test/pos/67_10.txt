This Blake Edwards movie is not too sure if it wants to be comedy, drama or musical. No matter what, Julie Andrews' thin presence is a good reason to see this comedy-drama-musical-spy. Julie is beautiful and uses a lot of talent in the film. Rock Hudson seems tired, but he is more than good at Julie's romantic interest. Authentic World War I cars and planes add a complaint. Overall, the movie is very fun. The DVD edition is an edited version of the original edition (Blake Edwards). This is probably the only version Edwards would allow; But, Turner's classic film has recently shown a complete (theater release) version. Recommended.
