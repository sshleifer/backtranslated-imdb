This program was quite interesting. The way the program was displayed made it even more interesting. String theory is also very interesting to listen to. All three hours I thought was worth it. I liked listening to ideas from physicists. The extra dimensions really attract the mind. If you have the opportunity, watch this amazing documentary.
