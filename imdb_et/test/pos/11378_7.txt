An interesting companion to true documentaries by John C. Holmes. Unfortunately, this is not what ultimately killed Holmes, and it would certainly have benefited. Burt Reynolds and Mark Wahlberg were most praised for this, but I felt that the real stars were Julianne Moore, the smoker of cocaine, Don Cheadle, a black man fighting for identity like pornstar / stereo salesman in some wildlife and William Macy in William, who is a woman, is the ultimate slut. Not to mention the almost recognizable Alfred Molina. Macy's New Year's Eve and Cheadle's chance for a better life after the donut shop was wildly abused, are probably the two best scenes in the movie or at least two of the best pictures. What this film does best is to show how power can easily corrupt in its various forms. But no one obviously learns anything from his blind downward spiral as they all recover and return to their normal lives.
