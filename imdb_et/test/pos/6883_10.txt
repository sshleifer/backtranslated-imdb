It is quite simple that those who call this movie are not known for the "good" cinema. "The Doll Master" creates a sense of fear and rarely seen outside of Asian films. <br /> <br /> Think of a mix of "Manga" and "Ring" that has been rolled into one and that's all about it <br /> <br /> The first level works, first-rate direction, first-rate settings and effects. <br /> <br /> This is where the best Asian horror is; Ring, dark water and the story of two sisters. <br /> <br /> Absolute must. <br /> <br /> Take this guy who knows his movies.
