I loved this example. In fact, I left the pub ten minutes before closing and drove down the road to catch it. I remember Daniel Peacock's outline of Gandhi in newspaper and journalism as a masterpiece. The complete design and lighting were out of this world, creating the atmosphere you felt you were actually living on. V unusual for comedy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I have only one other person (except the other) here as a reviewer who once knew that this program existed. In fact, I have to thank the IMDb for being there and proving to me that I have not really imagined the whole series of drunken fog that I began to seriously believe!
