This film is basically very well done and gives a good impression of the war situation and its impact on those involved. It is always interesting to see the story on the other hand to change. This film focuses on a group of German soldiers who, following the battle in North Africa, are sending Stalingrad to Russia, where the most infamous and bloodiest battles of World War II are being fought. <br /> <br /> It's interesting to see the other side of this battle, because we just see the Germans as a "crook". In this movie, these "villains" are given a humane face and voice, which in turn makes you realize that the only real enemy in war is war itself and not necessarily the ones you fight. At first, it's hard to concentrate on the movie because you always have the back of your mind that the German is an evil villain. But of course you do it quickly and the Germans will soon become the main characters in the movie and you will even start taking care of - and be interested in them. <br /> <br /> How is this story spoken? this is not the best, however. Sometimes it is difficult to follow the story because it jumps from one sequence to another. The film is not always logical in narrating your story and contains too many sequences that remain too vague. It is also often difficult to keep characters and see who is. It doesn't always make this movie easy to track, but on the other hand, there are enough sequences and moments in this movie that make it valuable and interesting, just not the most coherent. In this respect, Hollywood films are always better than European films. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are high and there are some good looking outfits and locations, even though this movie wasn't even filmed in Russia. This will help create a good atmosphere for the war. <br /> <br /> Characters are mostly interesting, though perhaps a bit bright. But I do not know that for some reason form characters always work well in warfare and strengthen drama and realism. It also helps them to be played by well-cast actors. Not all actors are the best-known actors (Thomas Kretschmann was still an unknown actor at the same time), but each of them fits well with his role and gives his characters a unique face and personality. <br /> <br All in all, not the best or the most consistent World War II drama, but it's definitely worth a look, as it is the original approach to the German side of the Stalingrad battle and its good production values. <br /> <br /> 7/10
