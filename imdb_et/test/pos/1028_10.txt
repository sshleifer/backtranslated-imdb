>>> The good news is the BBC DVD edition, scheduled for July 31, 2006, in the UK - there are also planned release countries - don't know the date - can't wait! ! <<<<< br /> <br /> >>>> Below is my initial comment <<<<<< br /> <br /> I agree with all the other reviewers - it's just amazing that one of the biggest TV shows Never written on DVD. <br /> <br /> The story is thrilling - acting outstanding and character-building is tempting! <br /> <br /> There's a lot of TV shows and movies on DVD in the UK through popular campaigns <br /> <br /> It's hard to see why right-holders are not going to DVD production? I'm going to email one of the leading players in this grassroots movement and see what happens. Who made the production? was it the BBC? RW
