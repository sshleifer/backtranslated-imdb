This movie was fun when it was across the table. <br /> <br /> It basically follows a two-grave robber's comic romp in the 19th century England, moving from a regular body to vampires, zombies, and dead Roswell. to foreigners. (I have no idea what Roswell's alien did, nor the producers.) <br /> <br /> But was it funny? You wish. Even Ron Perlman, who is often a kiss on a direct DVD, was pretty good in this field as a priest who turns out to be the leader of the body-snatcher rival gang. <br /> <br /> A real joy to watch this fun little movie and a good example of what you can do if you don't have a bigger life than the ego on either side of the camera.
