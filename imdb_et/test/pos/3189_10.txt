Love In Limbo is my all-time favoir movie. (W.A) It's hilairious and is great cast, including a group of three gorgeous actors, Russell Crowe (As Arthur), back in the day when he actually looked hot with short hair and no facial hair. Aden Young (Barry McJannet) and Craig Adams as Ken Riddle. <br /> <br /> Ken is a college student who has been sexually obsessed and sent out to her classmates for the sale of pornographic drawings. She starts a new job at her uncle's clothing factory and gets close to another young man, Barry McJannet, who buys a car so they can pick up and pick up the chicks. They become companions of good twoshoes geek Arthur Baskin (Crowe) and three men go to Kalgoorlie to lined the brothel and lose their innocence ...... <br /> <br /> Look at it, its classic !! So long I've been trying to get a DVD or Soundtrack, someone told me if you got em.
