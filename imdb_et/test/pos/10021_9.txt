A pearl of quiet-looking cartoon --- it was rediscovered by CARTOON NETWORK and was probably sent for the first time in decades, if any. <br /> <br /> What makes it so enjoyable is its versatile suitcases ... The giant mosquitoes attacking Douglas Fairbanks; Does Hays Visit Static Studios 'Boss'; also performances by Chaplin, Keaton and William S. Hart. It is not possible to describe chewing gum that destroys the population's footwear (Felix's almost bankrupt shoe - salesman's boss), which has to be seen. An amazing cultural pearl.
