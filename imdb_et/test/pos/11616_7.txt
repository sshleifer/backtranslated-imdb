Well, it's safe to say that subconscious cruelty is one weird movie! Supposedly, the unconscious cruelty is the human mind, which consists of four macabre and extremist strangers. The first segment, entitled "Ovarian Eyebrow", is really just warming, but it is good because it gives the viewer an idea of ​​what to expect with the following three segments. She just sees a naked neighbor placed on a table while another woman cuts her stomach and pulls out a man's eyeball! I have no idea what that point is, but it certainly makes visceral viewing. The next story is the best in the bunch and takes into consideration the theme of the "old favorite" sick movie. The segment follows a man who lives alone with his pregnant sister. She has been rejected by her pregnancy - but she still wants to have sex with her, and of course she gets her way. This story looks like a monotonous and "factual" narration and end - that can't give a hit. This segment is a well-functioning, well-filmed and easily unconscious cruelty. <br /> <br /> Of course, the next two sections are not as good as the other two; so the only way down there is, but director Karim Hussain still manages to pull the bag before the end of the movie. He's not doing it right now because the third segment is the weakest in the movie and just sees many people having sex with the land. It is very surreal and therefore equally memorable; but it doesn't seem to make much sense, and I was in a mood when something got sick after the second section. The film, however, ends up high because although I'm not sure what the point was - the last segment contains the best shapes of the film. This segment focuses on religion and is certainly not for everyone who values ​​it! Head Karim Hussain has accomplished something here - because this collection of four "extreme" stories does not come together as a whole, the film seems almost tasteful because it is so beautiful and eye-catching. The director seems to have imitated a highly regarded surrealist director Luis Buñuel, albeit with gore, rape and incest; and when you ask me, he hasn't done anything bad at all. Not for everyone, but definitely worth looking for extreme fanatics!
