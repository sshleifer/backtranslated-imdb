I liked this movie mostly, but I have to say that besides Bill Murray, someone else who wasn't so good was in the lead. He brings energy to the role that plays this film, if it had been otherwise. I mainly enjoyed jumps pulled by one advisor and there are other humorous things in this movie, such as the hot dog food contest. This film would also set the stage for a summer camp for the film where the competition ended. Almost all camp films have either this or a troubled or worrying child plot or a combination of both. This series would lead to a rather strange change in tone, as this one and two are both family-friendly movies, while the third and fourth are more adult-oriented, rather than historical teen sex comedies. It was not the opposite of the police academy films that went from R to PG-13 in PG movies. This series goes back to R. This first and only good is worth the dialects that are largely due to Bill Murray.
