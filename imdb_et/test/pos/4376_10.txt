It's bad because Ya proves more of George Carlin's talents. In fact, he's still as sharp as hitting. It is a shame that we lost him last year, but his comedy lives forever. This stand-up special is literally one of the funniest I've ever heard of a comedian. Although it makes fun of small children, it just makes a laugh as he says some things. It is true that Carlin can literally do something that seems uncomfortable and makes it one of the most fun you have ever heard. I really enjoyed this stand-up especially at Carlin and suggested that those who liked it would become more familiar with George Carlin.
