Young Warriors (1983) <br /> <br /> Although it is a deeply flawed (and in some sense idiotic) film, it continually makes expectations unexpected as it gives a decent look to the adventurous shock fan. <br /> <br /> Meet yuppie college student Kevin and his gang armable frat boy buddies. Following the extraordinary teen sex comedy, we follow this assault and their antics, which include, among other things, making promises of binding bricks to their genitals. The film moves sharply around the gears when the fresh sister of Kevin's high school is raped and beaten with a gang of bands who apparently have nothing better. When he dies in the hospital, Kevin promises revenge, much to his detective father. <br /> <br /> Until now, we've gone through the Porky-Connector through the last house on the left-hand side of the territory, which is probably shaping its typical city vigilants revenge. But Kevin's and his gang's imagination ranges from vaguely sympathetic to kill-mad to ransom. According to the film's credit, it is not a fascist anti-crime rhetoric that Kevin constantly pulls out, while being understood that he knows how he does it. <br /> <br /> The mood goes gently sloppy and sliding very fast and eventually it is so up and running that it leaves you incredible. And that is the strength of this movie. You never know what to expect next. <br /> <br /> Over 100 minutes, it's a bit long for a fare, but you're not getting bored. Badly acted mostly, cartoon dropping of characters and some particularly ridiculous situations and quite foolish dialogues, it won't let anyone on the list of forgotten classics soon. However, I got out of it and I'm sure anyone who reads it knows if they do it.
