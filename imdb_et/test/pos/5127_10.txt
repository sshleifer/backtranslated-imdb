I saw the movie "Hoot" and then I decided to comment on it right away. The truth is that NATURE needs protection from us because we are the dominant species on this planet. Some people think that if they have the money, they can do whatever they want, which is probably, but when they think more about the future, they think they are doing something useful! This film is not just about children, it shows us that children are usually the ones who care more about it, then adults do. When I was twelve, I saw some water lilies and I knew they were protected by law and didn't even dare touch those who were not afraid of the law, but were afraid I could actually harm them. (I am currently 15) So, it worked very well, the three main characters are well interpreted and we all have to learn from them. I hope you all think about what you saw in this movie! and enjoy!
