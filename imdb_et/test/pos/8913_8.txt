There is more to this film than an eye. If you are looking for groundbreaking originality or simple comedy, you are disappointed. But for 90 minutes of entertainment, it's just good. <br /> <br /> Cinematic art is cautious and accurate. Sexual scenes, one commented on as free, are something else - each gesture contributes to the development of the characters. <br /> <br /> Yes, some of the main characters are not loved ones. But in the film it is an honest light to show their communication without sensationalism (at least not to the urban standards of the early 21st century). And there are lots of very fun moments.
