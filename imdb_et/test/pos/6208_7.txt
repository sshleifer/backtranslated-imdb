"Citizen Kane" precursor to the analysis of the life of a dead grandmaster, reviewed by his faithful secretary in a number of blocking setbacks. In Spencer Tracy's 15th film, he even sees scenes in the middle ages where he is meant to be young! <br /> <br /> A small silent screen-type emotion is understandable thanks to the vintage, but it is the most enjoyable, well-written drama.
