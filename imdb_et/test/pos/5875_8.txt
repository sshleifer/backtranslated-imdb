This film is more frequent in and out of a modern mini ring. The war in the post-war period was almost forgotten in the 1970s, except for the students. Recently, it has been recognized that the integration of soldiers in the aftermath of war is ever more evenly represented (and that certainly includes films like "The Deer Hunter"). <br /> <br /> The story is simple. Three very different soldiers who have left the Second World War have traveled to their city center and are trying to live or create civilian lives. One is disabled, who has a job waiting for him and the other is not going on but decisive. <br /> <br /> There are some good but unfortunately uneven formats. Fredric March won the Best Actress Oscar, who played an old sergeant, who returns to work in a local bank. Personally, I think Jimmy Stewart deserves this "It's a wonderful life", which also earned the best picture award, but this film clearly touched the nerve of the post-war audience. As I said, it was fashionable. In March, there is one fantastic scene, a humorous speech that reminded us of a somewhat similar incident that was related to the World War II hero, Pappy Boyington, or else it is certain but remarkable. <br /> <br /> I'm going against the fruit here, but I thought Myrna Loy, who played the March woman, was rightly ignored by the Academy. I hardly found him a hint. In fact, I thought he was going to make Frederic Marchi annoying. He practically grimaced every time they were together. There was definitely something lost there, his forced smiles and the air of tolerance, not in joy. I think all this nonsense about being a "perfect woman" is right only if you think that the housewife of the 1950s is your ideal. You can agree, but the Academy voters probably did not. He's a big problem with this movie, terribly uneven. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews, as a former soda puller who became a war hero, is again struck by striking. She gets to the woman who obviously married her before she left for war for the wrong reasons, and her future looks dark. But then he gets the March daughter of Peggy (Teresa Wright, a fantastic procedure) and fireworks explosion. Both are big, but then the unevenness that goes through this movie will come again. A few moments of pure soap opera penetrate, timed by the classical line, "I'm going to get this marriage!" Romance is a resurrection and reflects after the war a common state, when the military return to love for their return. <br /> <br /> Speaking of resurrection, we are now coming to Harold Russell. He has a natural quality of action, or it is ineffective, which today is as true as he did. Being a nonsense approach to his situation, he is an inspiration. Her best scene, one of the best cinemas, is when she brings her a nice girl in her bedroom to show her the truth of her condition. "I'm happy, I still have elbows unlike some boys." Really big things. <br /> <br /> The film has a few moments that inspire. It also has a few moments that belong to the afternoon. Take a good look and see it for high points.
