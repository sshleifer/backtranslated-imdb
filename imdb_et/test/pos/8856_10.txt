Following the lines of the classic formula to abandon the second leap of material, the Thing remake becomes one of the coolest remodels of that time. John Carpenter looks out of what has been a rather vague scenario of certain things (or perhaps a very descriptive one who knows), bringing Rob Bartin incredibly evil, brilliant puppet theater and animation (along with Stan Winston in the team). These effects help set the tone against harsh isolated environments. The film takes the story of a group located in a research hub in the midst of the Arctic climate, which is opposed to the malicious force that takes the shapes of others. The choice of Carpenter tones and surprises give it a full life. If someone follows the traces of Howard Hawks, this filmmaker has a lot more trust and talent in material delivery than most who have been given the opportunity to go to another movie. <br /> <br /> Working with people with full force - who would probably follow Backdraft, which contains the most fire on the scene (it may become superfluous, but it will be missed after a while) - the participants will be a fine ensemble. Unlike the Predator team, they are mostly just working boys whose leader comes from Kurt Russell's MacCreedy (a very good role for his style, great). Fertile support roles are intended for Wilford Brimley and Keith David. And it is refreshing to see how the absurdity of the film (an alien who starts with dogs and then moves into other, demented transformation forms) has times with such timing tone for everyone. I loved long silences from time to time, spooky, curious about Ennio Morricone's music (and that bass line is worthy of itself). <br /> <br /> This is the best, if nothing else. He is catching his genre / culture to the audience. It's one of Carpenter's best; a rare movie where the story is spoken clearly and precisely by the timing of the camera, dialogue and scenes. This does not mean that the film is not full of violence, it is actually and a few times it's almost funny. But given that it goes back ridiculously seemingly like a past era, creatures / make-up were made with a permanent, well-calculated script completely without CGI. It's nasty, but it's real and atmospheric to T.
