Typically Spanish production - slow moving, but with great sensitivity and sexuality, which happens to be the leading actor Paz Vega. (Look at her "Spanglish"). Large sets, lots of color - you can see the mountains of Cordoba, Seville, Spain and the countryside. The plot has a tendency to tilt here and there, but if you follow it carefully (I succeeded, though the film is in Spanish), you get the content. <br /> <br /> How one very very sensual young gypsy woman, Carmen, uses her feminine words to attract men to make their offer. Carmen is taken to jail after being attacked by a cigar factory at the cigar factory where she works. He persuades him of a soldier who has taken him to prison to escape. Jose admires his charms because he speaks Basque (he is Navarres and speaks the same language). Jose is sentenced to 1 month in prison and humiliated to infantry. Later, Carmen will meet at the party and eventually become lovers. But Carmen refuses to commit to her and continues her lifelike and flirting lifestyle. With a jealous rage, Jose kills some soldiers who have been with Carmen. Then they have to leave the city. During his life, Josei turns into a bandit. Meanwhile, Carmen remains the same, wildly revealing woman. Finally, Jose loses his mind and ends up killing Carmen. <br /> <br /> Jose tells the story in prison, waiting for it to be executed. The person he speaks to is the French writer and anthropologist Prospero Merrime, whose fancy watch (it plays Beethoven's fur) stole Carmen or Jose. <br /> <br /> Worth watching sets and pleasing Paz Vega.
