"Shadows" are often recognized as a film that was a breakthrough in America's independent cinema. Whether it is true or not, it is undoubtedly an important film, the effect of which can be observed in today's Sundance feed. Here is a film that deals with the controversial issues of the day (namely racism) and refuses to answer and manipulate them easily. Also, this gender honestly addresses Hollywood not even discussing before "Graduate". <br /> <br /> But the question remains, is it as powerful as it was originally released? The answer is yes. Although many important films are difficult to track and date today, Shadows now retain the emotional resonance of every dream. It addresses racism as a personal problem, not a political one, so it is still appropriate. Plus, it works as a great time capsule, capturing the 1950s generation and the art scene in New York in a way that is not in any other film. <br /> <br /> At the technical level, it's uneven. Cassavetes did not yet have complete confidence as a director and dirty editing reflects the film's small budget. However, the story of the film is still powerful. In addition, the actor, taking into account the inexperience of the cast and improvisational nature, is phenomenal. In the vicinity, the actors create realistic characters who remain compassionate despite their often less admirable activities. "Shadows" is an absolute must for watching movies. (9/10)
