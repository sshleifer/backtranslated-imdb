It is valuable. Everything is illuminated is cute and sublimely funny from the first tasty dialogue. Oh, how have I expected it to arrive in Austin? While Elijah Wood is charming than ever before, the real author of Jonathan Safran Foer (novel Everything Is Illuminated) is Eugene Hutz (played by Jonathan's Ukrainian guide and translator Alex) who really steals this movie. Alex is a hip-hop-lovin Ukrainian dialect who, together with his grandfather, helps Jonathan find a woman who saved Jonathan's grandfather's life during World War II. The Ukrainian countryside has never seen such a breath. I am thinking of packing it and moving to the former Soviet state. <br /> <br /> The film's tone shifts as Jonathan and Alex finally meet the woman they are looking for, and suddenly this divine comedy becomes a ruin for the heart of the Jewish village during the Nazi occupation. Everything is enlightened by the history, heritage and wisdom that can be gained from the discovery of the past. It's perfect.
