This film certainly does not go well, because most of the horror is spiritual. However, it is almost something for everyone, including a couple of really cool robbery scene with aliens. The film uses extensively the mythology of the abduction of an alien, while at the same time showing a little more intelligence on some aspects of the abductor than would have expected of the film. Jillian McWhirter is great at what was supposed to be exhausting.
