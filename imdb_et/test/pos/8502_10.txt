Don't forget the lover on the side! She is a "hottie", Karen Parsons is delicious, she is wonderful, acts and beauty and style. It's just her job! Hoo, it is here to show that writing slips in your gut and when you doubled, it beats you in the back! When quoting Peter's wife (Associate / writer / Producer), she said that when they look at "previews" for "new" exhibitions appearing on the ABC online party, she looked after she was playing and said, "It doesn't look like anything else. What's in this network. You're in trouble. " That means it's very good! But it does not look like a regular "shiny happy person sitcom" fare or over-haired drama that they (ABC) regularly "air". Since I saw it, after the end of the first episode I was sure that this time slot was not left next week, I was immediately addicted to "Work". Cutting and cynicism, outrageous situations and ridiculous writers make this series hit! <br /> <br /> Then I felt anger and a feeling that I stopped the show just sailing into the air and wondering what executive was doing to break the big comedy cornerstone of my network? <br /> <br /> I told some people some knowledge, some did not, but I know the stupid network did not promote it hard enough or I should say enough visually. If they had had at least 3-5 years, maybe even a month I just believe that knowing the grid deficiencies and ordering a "one" formula that they didn't miss the boat. There was so much room for expansion, it just barely started. The situations were funny and serious, fast and sometimes slow, though not much so that it kept up at a good pace. A few years later, I finally found it on a new DVD for $ 50.00. In my opinion, this amount of entertainment would be worth $ 1,000. I was astonished when I went through the DVD for the third time, both seasons and the "betrayal" episode, which led to a serious drama segment where they discovered the murder victim, was better than most drama victims. The "and" police now show up in the air! !!! They went into scenes as seriously as a heart attack and believed that they did so, not even skipping. Just as it was meant to be serious, I was so impressed by the versatile ways that Tolan and Leary shared and shared the scripts. <br /> <br /> In the second entertainment week I learned that a beautiful wardrobe, silk ties and expensive suits with pressed shirts and ultra-stylish footwear ... were sold for the cable film "In the cut" (2003) for just four hundred dollars , it is !!! ! I am sick. Did you see what they were wearing all the shows? Only good over the coat can do so much. <br /> <br /> It was Denis Leary in some of his best. I recommend this great cop "drama" to the east coasts or wherever you are in this country. I even heard that the Irish people joked with Leary about the "Bathroom" episode, repeating them back because they saw it from there. (****) Excellent intuitive, comedic New York Leary / Tolan cop.
