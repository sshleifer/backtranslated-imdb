This is not what could be a happy story. The headed leader (Edmund Purdom as an Egyptian citizen) cannot gal - although he does (?) Apparently the "last" word, otherwise the main tragic figure (Michael Wilding as a politically myopic pharaoh) reaches tragically and the wrong man? even if it is Victor Mature, it will crush all marbles. Perhaps Peter Ustinov had got the best part (Kafka) and maybe maybe stole some, if not most, of the movie, except for the top-notch Jean Simmons as somewhat brighter than the average barmaid (Merit), perhaps just more of a ball? intellectually and spiritually, when all the rest of them are put together. <br /> <br /> The exciting and pessimistic Sinuhe doctor (which is Purdom) is depicted as a dark, cynically tortured soul that spends the entire plot? in his lifetime, looking for the meaning of "Life". (Btw and John Lennon paraphrase "Life" is what happens at the time of making other plans.) Publish a lack of philosophical depth in parentheses. <br /> <br /> And speaking philosophically as if things were rather negative or negative, John Carradine (as an unnamed tombstone) opens up a role in the middle of sliding. that "Life" is basically pointless and worth living only as a poor alternative to ultimate disappointment. <br /> <br /> So here we have over 200 words and I really don't have a word, so why did I appreciate the hell? Well there is a lot of Shakespherian tragedy and a bunch of moral value. There are ethical contrasts, true friendships, real and unhappy (almost) love, and - despite the limitations of 50-year-old production capacity - it's very (sound) staged, pleasing to the eye as well as aside, and very well / evenly. Is it usually a very good operation? whereas this is a drama of the costume of the '50s, and interactions are plausible until the fatalities of the characters - which are abundant in this fairness and the best of the Greek tragedy - come to an end. <br /> <br /> Is there a redemption, you will discover and accept your son? Tommy Retigg played, who, despite Ustinov's best efforts, really needed to pull Lassie out. A few other "misleading" souls will just get your desserts? "foreign" nefer (Nella Darvi)? apparently in Egypt with the exercise of physical exercise, which was cruelly mercilessly forced by the Princess Baketamon (sister of Gene Tierney), who was deeply blinded to your ancestors, and then tried to use it against her friend, her brother, Pharaoh? beautiful people, huh. He looks good enough to somewhere before the long end you want to drag him, grab him from laptops and say, "Look, the mannequin is pulling himself up, the glass is not empty, it's half full!" And then find that you are personally disappointed in Horemheb - Really Sinuhe's best friend (Victor Mature as Pharoah's Top Soldier) because he has a lack of character that prevents him from doing something positive. <br /> <br Interestingly, the secret of the whole movie is that it reaches out very quickly and maintains the necessary "stopping the unbelief" and understands and worries about these characters early, making sure that you really know them and their failed opportunities fortune; happiness that would not have been so far away from grabbing them. <br /> <br />? does not understand why it is not already on the DVD and hope it can be repaired quickly.
