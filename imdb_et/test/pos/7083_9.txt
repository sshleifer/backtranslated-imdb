I've loved one real thing the first time I watched it in the theater and shouted out my eyes. I bought it as soon as it was available, and lost how many times I've watched it. <br /> <br /> One real thing is the ultimate family relationship movie. I love looking at relationships in family change and the evolution they finally get. I can be involved with many details. My mother died of bone cancer, so it really comes home to me. Maybe I love it so much. <br /> <br /> I love the relationship between children and their parents and the relationship between brothers and sisters, but I especially love the relationship between man and woman. For me it is really beautiful. <br /> <br /> I recommend this move to anyone who enjoys such a movie.
