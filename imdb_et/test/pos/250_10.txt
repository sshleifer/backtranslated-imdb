"Cover Girl" is the best musical Rita Hayworth. Ms. Hayworth is always remembered for "Gilda", but the next film would be "Cover Girl". The story is great. They are talking about a dancer who wants to be a cover cap and make it big in an exhibition project. He does this without the help of his talented dancer / director boys (Gene Kelly). Mr. Kelly has the opportunity to call musical numbers. Dances are remarkable. It's fun to see Phil Silvers, a comic, make musical numbers with Mrs Hayworth and Mr. Kelly. <br /> <br /> A strong mold is perfect. Lee Bowman is given the opportunity to be an interesting third wheel, another boy.
