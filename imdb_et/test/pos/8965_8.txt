... with one example. <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson, congress, real character. In the 1990s, when communism broke against the Soviet Union, the Berlin Wall and the Afghan war (against the Soviets). He did it, for one denial of money, and everything went down. He should remember, so here it is. His memorial. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie. Funny, dramatic, snob, political or just boring. Anyway, it's a smart film about political life, world leadership and, above all, a lesson for the world. A lesson for every policy, a critical perspective that refers to countries that support money, weapons and words. <br /> <br /> Lesson - The world is not a nice place to live
