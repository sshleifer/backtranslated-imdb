"The Queen of Fucking" is one of the best vampire films I've ever seen! The movie had intercourse, action, and gore. The combination of the extremely demanding attitude of the Queen and the rock mood of our star, which Stuart Townsend behaves very well, makes a wonderfully made film that can only be created by that combination. I'm always the one who gives my friends and family members some advice on what movies are worth renting, and when they ask me, "The Queen of Fucking" is worth telling them it's worth buying. This movie is definitely a must in all homes of horror lovers!
