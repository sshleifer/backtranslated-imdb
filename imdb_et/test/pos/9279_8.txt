Despite the previous scorer of the reviewer, this is a very fast and interesting documentary with many clips of classic 1950s sci-fi films that influenced Spielberg, Lucas and others in their latest efforts. I agree that Spielberg's films are not even in the same league as the films discussed here, such as William Cameron Menzies's brilliant INVADERS MARS, to name just one of the many headlines studied, but it is still a very good review of the 1950's paranoid sci-fi. Yes, in the last fifteen minutes, it becomes a harsh remake of the World War II; you can turn it off. The rest are surprisingly good, and it is nice to see today's filmmakers remember these inspiring films, even if they can't match the originals.
