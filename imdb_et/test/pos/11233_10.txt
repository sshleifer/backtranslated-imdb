Polish brothers are unique filmmakers and they have really pushed the envelope here. The fantasy of having common points with the "Wings of Desire", "Northfork" tells the story of a small town in the 1950s somewhere in the middle, two days shy of being flooded and submerged by the US government's desire to build a reservoir in a place where the city stands. It is a nervous parody of the disappearance and memory of angels, dreams, imaginations, and the most entertaining government restoration functions from Repo Man. The performances are all outstanding, especially Nolte and Woods. I have noticed that I have read some comments that there are people who are simply offended by the fact that Polish twins use elliptical storytelling tactics and I want to say that this is one such thing that makes this film so big: wanting to embrace the mysterious aspect of everyday life . David Mullen's cinematic art is stunning. Highly recommended; if you have suffered a substantial personal loss, such as a parent's death, I invite you to even watch this movie. - Ray
