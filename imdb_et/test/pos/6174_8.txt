I left it in the cinema and leased it from the DVD. If you get the chance, I would recommend it if it is better than just about everything I saw in cinema or DVd this year. That doesn't mean it's one of the best movies ever or something, it's just seen a lot of garbage :) <br /> <br /> You can't really say anything except 8/10
