What are people with you? John Dahl? "Rounders" and "Unforgettable"? Too Stupid? Tap Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman to have fun playing against the type? And someone liked Gingerbread man? <br /> <br /> I rented it but knew nothing about it and found it as easy as possible. Never offensive, well thought out, funny, scary. I clearly disagree with naysayers. I thought that the story was not noticeable, but the great casting, which probably means that the director turned his attention, raised it to the super cool. Good sound design (also appreciated in the surrounding environment, but I'm not talking). And yes, I'm a girl, so maybe she's a bit slanted (boys boy is pretty worth it). In conclusion, 9 and a cheerful RECOMMENDATION.
