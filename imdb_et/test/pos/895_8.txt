Laura Gemser plays a magazine photographer who is sent to Africa for a photo shoot. There, a couple and other swinging couples meet him. They all stay in this huge, very tourist hotel with a huge pool. One night they have a pool party with real live dancers. It is very politically correct and very tight. Later, Emanuelle finally has a photo session that turns out to be one of these cars (although photography is great). Throughout the film, Emanuelle goes to every man he meets. Photography is very well done in this film. There are scenes with cascading waterfalls, galloping giraffes and ancient ruins. The film is worth one soundtrack to Nico Fidenco.
