Instead of writing a paragraph, I give four good reasons why 2001 is the biggest cinema experience of all time: 1) It is a visual Odyssey that can only be spoken on a big screen. The special effects that won Kubrick for his only Oscar are the most daring effects before Jurassic Park and T2. They allow Kubrick to give a precise (or at least the most accurate) description of the space travel. The silence, which fills the scenes of space, not only contributes to its purpose as precise science, but also adds to the mood of the film (discussed at a later point with HAL). The fact that Kubrick shot the scenes of the month before the Apollo landing is still a perfect move. Many have said that after this initial release it was a favorite "movie". I don't think of any other film that has such an amazing vision of its time or all of the time (sorry Phantom Menace fans!) 2) Kubrick's leadership style is terrible. Like all his films, Kubrick wants to use his camera to get his characters and plots into psychology. His camera is not as mobile as others, like Scorsese, but sits and looks at the narrative. Faces are a key element of Kubrick's film. Like classic films such as M and Touch of Evil, Kubrick focuses on the faces of the characters to give the audience a psychological perspective. Even he uses HAL's glowing red "eye" extreme close-ups to show the computer manufacturer's cold and determination. I could go on, but summing up Kubrick is his style in the dark. 3) The HAL 9000 is one of the most frightening signs of film history. I sincerely agree with Gene Siskle's late opinion on HAL 9000. Most of this movie takes place in space. Silence and the darkness of the room create the mood of isolation. Dave and his teammates are separated from the land and the jupiter, where they cannot escape. Connect this mood with the cold, calculated operations of the HAL 9000 and you have the most frightening villain to imagine. Although I can see this movie several times, I still feel that my chest tightens in a certain scene. 4) The controversial end of 2001 always makes people out of this movie. Instead of trying to give my opinion on what it means and what my idea of ​​the meaning of 2001 is, in general, I would like to discuss the fact that the ending ends with leaving the film. Kubrick has said he was going to 2001. He left his meaning to the viewer. Kubrick gave the audience intelligence, respecting the beginning of his film as a thoughtful debate, not the end, the past, the present, and the future of man. The beauty of 2001 is that the end may not mean something deep, it may be just a primed explanation and the whole movie can be seen as a fun journey through space. No other film, except the great Citizen Kane, will allow you to open up for the 2001 debate. It is truly meant for a surreal journey that involves not only the eye but the mind. Instead of waiting for long lines for Phantom Menace, rent a 2001 broadscreen edition and enjoy the greatest movie experience.
