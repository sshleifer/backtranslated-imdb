This is the curious but free stock of Thomas Manni's novel with the same title. Dirk Bogarde gives his best screen performance - he himself believed it. The dialogue is minimal, so its face must be recorded by the nuances of its intriguing character - the composer (writer in the novel - the only big change) who travels to Venice in 1910. Visconti appears in the image of beauty, it is over, and Visconti combines Mahler's music and images seamlessly with his best films from "Leopard" (another stunning film that significantly influenced Coppola Sicily "godfather").
