This is a great example of Classic Full Moon Pictures. Every Horror / Vampire Flicks fan should definitely check it out. Original plot and good, easy to follow story. This movie also has some heart racing scenes that combine Horror's action. From now on, the only order I see in this movie, Part IV, which I have to say, is almost better than the original. <br /> <br /> I give him the 10/10 <br /> <br /> Fans of such fear films should check Puppy Training, Slumber Party Massacre, Skinned Life, Sleep Away Camp and other full moon pictures.
