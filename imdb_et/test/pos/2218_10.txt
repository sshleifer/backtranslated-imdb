It was fun to watch the new independent film "Half Empty". I usually go with my husband to a local cinema and feel we would be arrested in the last queue or Prequel that Hollywood throws us. It was different and surprisingly? So much more entertainment than anything Hollywood spends on millions of ads. When my husband and we go to the movies, do we go for entertainment? and "Half Empty" did just that and the movie did it in a smart way that made me feel like my cinema was worth it. It's a funny, humane and surprising, sometimes musical, story that enthusiastically attracts in its simplicity. I especially enjoyed the scene where 4 men sang in the bathroom in harmony. It's almost like an operetta. This particular scene reminded me of the scene in "Opera Opera" when 4 speakers were not simply, i.e. they sang against each other in a friendly retort. I'm not a movie, but this movie was more enjoyable than any other big studio movie recently seen. It's silly, funny, fun and fun. Totally enjoyable? that's what I'm looking for in movies, but rarely do they give such "Half Empty".
