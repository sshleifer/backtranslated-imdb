This is the best Roma version that has been filmed. Bette Midler is just as great as Mama Rose. It has voice, gestures, appearance and above all the highest acting ability that can play the role and make the character come alive. This singing is simply: MAGNIFICENT! In particular, she shines in two numbers - "All the Roses" and "Rose's Turn". Other actors are also good, especially Christine Ebersoll like Tessie. Also good is Peter Riegert, his portrayal of Herbie is very stylish and plausible. The direction of this movie is very, very good. this film is a huge improvement over the Roz Russell version, which was filmed in 1962. As you look at it again, I can say that the three biggest Mama roses are: Ethel Merman, Bette Midler and Angela Lansbury. Watch this movie.
