David Cronenberg's films are easily identifiable, or at least the elements of the film are distinct from their brands. Fetishism, blurry obscure things between organic and inorganic things that shouldn't be tiny and crackling. "eXistenZ" is a classic Cronenberg. In short, it is related to the future generation of computer games, but instead of a video monitor, your senses transmit visuals. The game switches directly to the "bio-port" at the bottom of your spine, and when the game is running, the player cannot tell the reality of the game. Jennifer Jason Leigh plays the game developer, guiding the pace of the game at the Novitiate Marketeer, Jude Law. During the game, they discover strange events and possible crimes. But are they real or is it a game? Even the author of the game doesn't know. <br /> <br /> The movie is relatively gentle, keeping the viewer busy but in the dark until the last minute. Another thing I like about "eXistenZ" is that it doesn't have a big impact on special effects, it's a story that pulls the movie forward. Recommended on Saturday night when scientific literature is needed.
