Since Jason and his horror took over the horror films of the 1980s, each horror film has involved a group of hormone-charged teenagers who began to cut into bits, focusing on grinding and not skipping. <br /> <br /> This little movie is different. Made in the early 80s, this does what every good horror movie should do - bring your worst fears to life when you are just knowing that these horrors are just around the corner. Then you make these horrors glowing, just don't make it into the lesson of bodybuilding biology. Big Chill and then slipped back in the early 90s. Meg plays a prominent teenager who is just dying to get into the good graces of some classical characters. Girls intend to scare him and leave him crypt, giving them a double reward - even more tortured girl and excuse her back. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, the famous occult Karl Rhamarevich has died a deadly death soon after he has claimed that he has discovered the way of returning from the grave and commanded a great magical power upon his return. His daughter does not believe it first, but he listens to his father's experiments involving successful animation of his small dead animals and his plans to escape from the grave with the ability to animate the larger game and retrieve it. He also learns that he could inherit his father v sister and be the only person who can rise from the dead. I think you know where this story is directed, so I'll stop here. Did I mention that the magician was put in the same encryption where Meg Tilly's character is staying overnight? <br /> <br /> I mention that commercial TV with this movie seems to have somewhat deteriorated compared to what you expect from a recent film. I saw it on television in the mid-1980s and I remember it is better. The problem is that the original negative location of the movie was never placed so the DVD had to be printed. This means it is equipped with dirt and scratches. <br /> <br /> It's worth any kind of horror blower. It was a self-made film and an example of the unusual things that could normally be found on late-night television until the commercial user turned to the big wasteland of 1986. Only TCM's underground movie is no longer working.
