When I watched this movie again, I think it's one of Hitchcock's biggest films. The first time I saw it, I was arrested, just deeds and pictures. It has a captivating end, a robbed murderer, an innocent man surrounded by, or sacrificing circumstances, some great on-site shots, eg. Jefferson Memorial in Washington and Penn Central in New York. Hitch's daughter, Patricia, has a role as Ruth Roman and little Leo G. Carroll with Hitch's daughter Patricia. The near-end merry-go episode is one of the most nervous of the Hitchcock workspace. <br /> <br /> Robert Walker, as Bruno Anthony (his last full-length movie) gives a great result as a spoiled foreigner who believes in the life of an unsuspecting tennis guy, Guy Haines (Farley Granger). Granger plays a nice boy who has fallen into dirty divorce. The film opens with a camera that shows the shoes of two different men when they leave the taxis on the train. Finally they meet and the story takes over. The stranger has an extraordinary interest in tennis and if the film continues, a stranger becomes a stranger. The action shifts from place to place, including Washington, Metcalf's fancy small town, the Forest Hills tennis championship, and a passenger train that takes two leading men back and forth on separate missions. Finally, the game of tennis weaves at a time when they racist. The camera cuts off athletes' faces when they crawl and earn remarkable amounts of frames. When the fierce battle has ended, the climatic chase is taking place. Hitchcock has a love for trains and it's nice to see Penn Station, which has long since disappeared. Trains are presented in 39 steps, Lady Vanishes, in the shadow of doubt, spellbound, northwestern and this film. <br /> <br /> This classic Hitchcock thriller took place at the beginning of a period of great creativity for a temporary journalist in the 1950s and I am convinced that one day he will be presented with the Hitchcock Hall of Fame. .
