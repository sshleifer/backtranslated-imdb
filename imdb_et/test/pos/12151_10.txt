if you have little pleasure in pink Floyd music, you will love this movie. The score is completely pink Floyd and of course the drug element plays an important role in this film, giving you doubts about the life's weakest moments. this film also touches on the love of the heart and the people around you ... there is also a great connection to the world around you with the environment of your personal island. This thing tells me I need ten lines to bring together a movie, but I've done that, that's all you have, why this movie is 6.1, which is any kind of movie with a score like that. watch yourself for a dream and a fountain .... equally good results for our generation but overrated
