I remember this movie many years ago with friends at VHS. At first I thought it would be a boring autofilm. But to my surprise, it was one of the best films I remember from my time. I really loved Fox's car, which was most used by the Dodge Charger. The color work done with this car was, in my opinion, truly outstanding :)! <br /> <br /> There's also a black two-door blown 57 Chev that arrives later in the movie. <br /> <br /> Last year, I managed to get a copy of this movie from VHS at K-Mart here in Australia. I have plans to make this movie myself a DVD myself because I believe it's a movie worth converting. But to my surprise, I saw this weekend when I was on a DVD while browsing a DVD movie. So of course I grabbed it when I got it because it was the only copy there. on the horizon. Then this movie is for you !!!! <br /> <br /> Here is some additional information from the back of the DVD. <br /> <br /> He wins at all costs Fox is a young man who lives on a fast track. He believes he is the fastest man on the road, but the street race is illegal. If he does not accept his last challenge, he may lose his girlfriend ... if she accepts it, she may lose her life. Dangerous living, quick living and winning at all costs are their obsession. They don't turn back, don't give in ... and don't ask for help.
