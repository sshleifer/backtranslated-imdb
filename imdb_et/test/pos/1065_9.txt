Finally, he hit me during my VHS Christmas at Connecticut, what else reminded me of this movie. If that wasn't the fact that the other was done 20 years later, I would say it was a remake. <br /> <br /> Just like Rock Hudson was Abercrombie & Fitch's counterfeit expert, who was supposed to get Barbara Stanwyck to play Martha Stewart in the workplace at work. <br /> <br /> Stanwycki's cooking columnist who has built the whole image that lives on a small Connecticut farm with his wife and baby cooking these wonderful delicacies. The problem is that he is single, childless, writes his column in New York from his apartment and doesn't know how to boil water. But his writing has hit the public. <br /> <br /> The problem arises when he hijacked a war hero sailor who also plays a few songs to prepare his home dinner. I have to keep the picture at all costs. And his publisher, Sidney Greenstreet, likes such a good idea that he calls himself for dinner. <br /> <br /> So borrowed from a farm, a baby, and Reginald Gardiner, who would like to make it with Stanwyck, he tries to scare him through. <br /> <br /> Christmas in Connecticut is now a classic Yulet class and earned so. Wires are warm and human, and accumulated players get great support. S.Z. Sakall is a Hungarian restaurant owner / friend of Stanwycki, from whom he receives cooking information and Una O'Connor as a housekeeper, is a nice chemistry between them. Reginald Gardiner and Stanwyck have no chemistry at all, obvious to everyone except Reggie and he's funny on his stuffed shirts. <br /> <br /> Most people remember this movie as one of Sidney Greenstreet's few activities in comedy. If he is not a direct villain, a cynical observer of life or a tyrannical tycoon, Greenstreet has some other things on the screen. Connecticut's Christmas gave her a rare opportunity to split her image and she was the most rewarding. <br /> <br /> The story of Barbara Stanwyck mentions that she enjoyed a welcome change in the making of Christmas in Connecticut from some evil parts like Double Indemnity, which she recently did. One of the things that made the film so enjoyable was that between the competitions, director Peter Godfrey and Greenstreet, English-language music hall numbers were cast and team members entertained. Made for a relaxed and warm set and molded to it. <br /> <br /> Now that only anyone had filmed these numbers.
