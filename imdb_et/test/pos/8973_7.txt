Well, we certainly saw, and I and many other people were really worse off. It was also some good parts too, so I didn't expect it to still fail in other areas. <br /> <br /> For the first time, it was above average. I love Phillip Seymour Hoffman in this movie and I liked Tom Hanks. Hoffman was the glue of this movie. If it wasn't for him, this film would have crumbled and hit the bottom. His performance was in no way stunning, but absolutely necessary. He gave a good, funny, cynical performance to what most other participants would have done in their clich√©. Tom Hanks really gave a nice loose performance and was not disappointed, but he certainly didn't impress. I couldn't stop Julia Roberts from participating in this movie. He was as big as I've ever seen. One of them is a bad actor, at least for me, that he had young people for his character and he was fake even with the game he played. <br /> <br /> Leadership was for me. I'm not really a big fan of recent Mike Nichols films, and I haven't impressed it either. It was made of the kind of Hollywood comic that I couldn't stand. The worst part was that he tried to make a really meaningful movie in the end. I love meaningful movies, but not when the film tries to rush the scene or two at the end and show something that is trying to justify the rest of the garbage spreading across the film. This is something Mike Nichols has done in recent years. <br /> <br /> One of the most impressive parts of this movie was writing. The dialogue was well done and was able to play the story. Writing was the one that could really take over the average level of this movie. In so many scenes I found myself partially laughing in writing. <br /> <br /> Well, that's part of what we saw at least. Many landscapes were good in the movie when you get what I mean, but not much more. I liked that this movie didn't praise everything America had done. It is obvious that during the entire Afghan war, the US gave weapons to those people who are now against us. This movie show is too guilty for that. This shows that what may seem good in the short term may change in the future in a terribly wrong way. This movie had a good initial message, but it just didn't give it right. In general, though, it was fun.
