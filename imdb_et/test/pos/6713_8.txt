The goal of Tobe Hooper (with a fresh, traditional "Poltergeist") is in heaven during this time. "Lifeforce" is the adaptation of Colin Wilson's "Space Vampires". "Alien's Dan O" Bannon and Don Jakoby manuscript vary slightly: I was told that the futuristic story is modern and Hailey Comet was added to coincide with the actual passage of the Earth within a few weeks of the release of the films (so I read). <br /> <br /> The story is related to the Shuttle mission (Commander of Steve Railsback), sent to Hailey Comet to study the Earth. Everything goes without a hook, but when it comes to the comet, it is discovered that the coma of the comets is a strange ship. The team explores the massive structure and finds the dried bat-like creatures. Looking deeper at the ship, a chamber is found that contains three humanoids (two naked men and one rather nude lady) in the coffin of an odd statue. The crew returns to the ship with the humanoid and bat creature. <br /> <br /> Shortly afterwards, the ship will return to Earth, but NASA will not be able to connect, and another truck will be launched to make sure the mission. In the docks with Churchill, it is discovered that a massive fire is seemingly a crew and all the flight information. But these three humanoids remain. However, it is known that the escape pod was launched but whose location is unknown. <br /> <br /> Soon they will discover an alien's origins when a very attractive vampire queen rises from her slumber to easily enliven her vitality with the men around her. If you wonder the face with him, you will like them and if you do not eat after two hours, you will dry and become dusty. The goal of the three goals is to weaken enough the population to reach and support them and their ship to travel to the next planet to waste on them. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the commander directs domination. entering the pod (Texas doesn't beat less) and now has a psychological connection with his royal heat, the queen and can use it to find a hidden queen when she and the surviving man try to dry their breath from London <br /> <br /> Tobe Hooper ("The Texas Chain Saw Massacre "(1974)) does amazing work on what must be his greatest production. Production gathered from many fine technicians from all over the film industry. Production designer John Graysmark (Fresh "The Bounty (1984)") uses every four stages of Elsree Studios to create spacious ship interiors. Cinematographer Alan Hume returns to scientific literature after "Star Wars VI: Jedi's Return" (1983) and three consecutive James Bond episodes. Hume uses all of the widescreen frames with a big effect a little. The Oscar winner, John Dykstra, has been the innovator of the original Star Wars (1977) revolutionary effects, able to capture the envelope again, creating very creative and remarkable effects on lasers. Heck even maestro Henry Mancini falls to give the film a memorable title that gives this sci-fi / horror hybrid an adventurous feeling. In a well-functioning department, it falls quite a bit on Steve Railsback's shoulder and the newcomer Mathilda Mayle (vampire queen). Railsback always brings out the signs he plays and can play nuts like no one else. This is when his mind worsens when the queen struggles with his soul. Gorgeous French actress Mayi doesn't have a lot of features (there were more than ten?), But her often naked presence never gets old and you have to give her costume to have jingle watches. Quite a lot of all the queen is to do this, it is the feed and to do that she should tempt you with a sexual presence. The work has been accomplished and where do I become a victim? I really liked how they changed the vampire clich√©s and were able to feel it fresh, but still easily recognizable. Almost everyone here is considered: bats (their actual form resembles a big bat), coffins (static fields resemble them), transformations (scans and may be something), big sexual complaint (Miss May ?? duh) not to mention that they contain themselves also the heart of the old standby state (this time a bit towards the energy center of the pen, which is just below the heart). The only thing they didn't touch was religion, but I think the vampires who use the cathedral at the end as the home base can just be a little tears and nods. <br /> <br /> Short (yes) right to 800 words later) Lifeforce is a great combination of scientific literature and horror that respects the vampire theme, while adding some pure different wrinkles. The effects and scope of production are enough to keep the summer movie types (at least at that time) and horror and sci-fi fans. 4 of 5
