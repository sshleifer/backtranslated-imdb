I thought it was very different from Shakespeare's most recent interpretations and enjoyed it thoroughly. It would not be useful for those who study at school, etc., because it does not show traditional Shakespeare character interpretations (ie Miranda is depicted as a pretty punk compared to a regular Shakespeare lady), but to understand and play the game. The story is a very strong piece and a fantastic look. It also does not contain the correct format, such as the layout of operations and scenes, because I am currently playing Miranda in production and most of her lines were cut and some scenes shared and mixed, but it is very useful and I would definitely benefit from suggesting it as black-and-even even If you just say you have seen it! Shakespeare fans would love it!
