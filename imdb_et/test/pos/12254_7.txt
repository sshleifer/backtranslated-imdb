I don't really know when it was that the TV channels began to favor beautiful men as their reporters - regardless of the men's IQ - but it was obviously a problem when "Broadcast News" appeared and the film didn't happen. a really good job of watching it. Imagining a beautiful boy's airy reporter Tom Grunick (William Hurt), intelligent but nervous reporter Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks) and producer Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), does not pull the film. Probably the best line of film is when Tom says something like, "I don't really understand what I understand." In the era of FOX News and such things, such a film becomes even more important. <br /> <br /> All in all, it is definitely a recommended movie. Also Prime Minister Robert Prosky, Lois Chiles, Joan Cusack and Jack Nicholson.
