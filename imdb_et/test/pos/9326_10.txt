michael jackson is the biggest singer and the biggest dancer ever lived and this movie proves it. It's a great look and the dance is fantastic. If Michael turns into a werewolf, it will be a bit like the edge of your seat part for the first time you watch it. and the vincent price rap shakes fear when all the zombies rise from their graves. if you like it then i suggest you buy a 'making Michael Jackson' thriller with a movie that is made after that. making the unbelievable results of Michael 'Billie Jean' when he was first engaged in television with the moonwalk. Look out.
