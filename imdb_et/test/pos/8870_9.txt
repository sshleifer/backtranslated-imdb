I do not clearly understand the average rating of this movie!? <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it, I stayed up early in the morning to stop watching it late night. <br /> <br /> There are three great characters here, great characters. Danny DeVito played a pearl, quite amazing, also considering his leadership. His ridiculous ridiculous time was, in reality, brilliant and surreal in an absolutely plausible way. There are such people, Owen was just on the line, without exceeding it. <br /> <br /> Billy Cryston's comic guilt and timing was PERFECT for his role. His disappointment / comedy was interesting and exciting, and yet ... you could understand his feelings. To really feel that you know that it is difficult for a writer to achieve character, the art itself is the way to find the right puller, and both were achieved here three times. <br /> <br /> Third, who else could have played with Mom? There is no one who can play this part so well. There is a style there, unlike others, something you want to look at, I found myself waiting for it to appear on the screen ... and not because the rest was bad, no, because the mommy's character was again so straight without going beyond that would be great to watch. <br /> <br /> And what else? Happy ending with new friendships found, nobody gets in and everyone gets the life they wanted in life ... HIGHLY no more big cheese ends. <br /> <br /> Great script, brilliant idea, perfect cast big movie.
