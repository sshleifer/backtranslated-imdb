Oooooh man I was glad I didn't leave it. I wanted to post this review because this episode does what a recent movie did not do. It pays real respect to DOOM. The graph is different, and the characters are obviously in a completely different universe (probably a doctor in the universe), but the feeling, pace, references, and location are perfect. And for all the original Doom fans, the sound effects of opening and closing the door are heard, it was a bang for me. <br /> <br /> Please ask all doctors who and Doom fans are alike to check it out. her pearl!
