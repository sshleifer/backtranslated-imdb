It's a movie with a theatrical message mixed with some reasonable moments. Such films are the stretches of the big actors, they enjoy throwing the ball into open pieces. An angel who was not what we see in old books and churches is a pretty nice change. It also sounds in Kevin Smith's work, Dogmas, in almost the same vein. <br /> <br /> - = 0) Watch this movie for a good day after you have all absorbed it. Could it be so many movies trying to be complicated that we forget the simple movements of such films? Perhaps one of the funniest items I've seen for a while came into this VHS trash because someone in the basement was flooded this summer and grabbed a handful of tapes. <br /> <br /> Whether such a light comedy is fun in the trash or silver screen, you don't have to tell everyone in the hip nightclub you like, or a nice political party. Just hold it yourself and I'll put that many people borrow it from time to time.
