I have to admit that before I thought about this movie, it is one of those unpleasant love stories where everything works well and bored. but I was wrong when I actually looked at it. I found that it was really a good story of a family going to a dance park for a 3-week holiday and having the youngest daughter, baby, love, but she has trouble with her new beloved love because she has disagreement with her father. But the road is helping another dance teacher and jeopardizing the whole relationship ... A truly heartfelt film like no other. <br /> <br /> 10/10
