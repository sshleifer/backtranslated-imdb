I was very surprised to find out that Goldie Hawn won the Oscar for this movie. 54 (!) By the year Bergman, he seemed very inanimate and completely trained, where they were side by side. If it were written today, I think that Bergman and the young man Ivan would have put together (Ingrid is so hotter than Goldie ...) and two self-absorbed characters that Matthau and Hawn played would be left cold. But it was written in the late 60s and seems like a Plaza Suite or Barefoot Park. But with Matthau's one liner, Hawn's innocence and Bergman's stylish presentation, it's a very nice look.
