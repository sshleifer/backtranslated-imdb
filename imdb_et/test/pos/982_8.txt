This movie is really a fun, clean fun movie for the kid. Kaley (played by Nickelodeon's talented Amanda) is a brilliant boy who is hard to tell the truth. Finally, he makes it into a stolen movie script. I didn't give you any details. If you have children and want to see a fun, if not fascinating, film, I highly recommend it.
