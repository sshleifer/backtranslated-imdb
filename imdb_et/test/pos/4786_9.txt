It's about time "Kate Jackson" got his credit for this movie .., I can't remember watching it and trying to understand this TV .., my grandmother put in bed dying of cancer and I barely 15. I could not find until years later was Richard long dead ., I miss her from other examples / movies she was. <br /> <br /> I still have a copy of the VHS tape, but it's NOT "or Closed Captioned for hearing impaired people, and it's the only mistake I remember or still know about the movie ... I haven't been able to find a DVD - or a VHS copy that even has subtitles in English. If someone knows a copy of VHS or DVD that is CC or has English subtitles, please let me know. <br /> <br /> Thank you - Cofffeen
