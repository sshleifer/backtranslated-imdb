I loved this series completely and felt very sad. Yes, it's a Christian, and also traditionally. It deals with some difficult issues, as the other reviewer points out, but I think it depends on your point of view on these issues, and when a teenager grows up and now, as a mother myself, I was so happy to see a TV channel that was clean and fairly honest saying wonderful! Unlike other evaluators, I was happy to see how they deal with a condom. Instead of hearing the typical desire of the condoms, they showed the son real work to be clean and applying it to his later relationships, which were pure and divine for that, and much safer for it (100%!). br /> <br /> After viewing this whole series, you are extremely involved with all family members and non-family characters (if they live permanently) and the moral values ​​they teach in every episode are simply invaluable. I found that Angel (made by the same manufacturer) was bright here and there (although I liked it at all), but this series was, in my opinion, much better and better and more interesting. It was good for the whole family and was interesting for the whole family, which was a big plus. The family was not outstanding, they had their own mistakes, but in the long run they did what was right and you saw them growing and changing and fighting like every real family. It was my favorite exhibition and it is always at the top of my list, I hope it will appear on DVD!
