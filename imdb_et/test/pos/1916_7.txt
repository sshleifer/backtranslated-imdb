This is definitely one of the ultimate cult classics and it must be for all psychotronic fans. Why? It has everything that should be a 70's exploitation film. Contains top-down dialogue, bad behavior, enthusiasm, gender, sleaze, political injustice, violence and many other elements of good cult classic. In other words, Dolemite is a must-see. <br /> <br /> As with many of these films, there is little point in the plot. What I came out of is that the pimp-hustler Dolemite captured the fur and half a million dollars of drugs. At the time of his time, his nightclub was taken over by his army Willie Green (the same man who shaped him). A sympathetic caregiver (the only white sign in the whole movie that isn't totally evil or incompetent) decides to freely stop him from evil Willie Green and his drug trafficking. Fortunately, he knows kung fu, as well as about 50-75% of the characters in this movie. And, fortunately, Mrs Queen Bee sent her, when she was locked, to all her "hoed" kung fu school. With this kung fu army, he struggles "to his side" (his words, not me) in his plan to take Willie Green's nightclub back. But two racist white police are trying to rebuild him and throw him in jail. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, don't try to follow the plot. I've seen this movie about five times and there are many elements that don't seem to be in any way connected. Characters supporting the movie move in and out. I'm still trying to figure out what the mayor and Hamburger had to do with Pimp. Who cares at last? Scenes with these characters are all invaluable. As for the dialogue, it is terrible and worse. Since Rudy Ray Moore was originally a comedian, I wonder if this movie was meant to be a spam or a serious movie. It looks like he couldn't decide which one. Such traits as "Yes, I'm so bad, I'll hit my ass twice a day" require further investigation. In both cases, the movie is fun and the plot has more holes than a Swiss cheese factory. Another fun element is some of the most filmmakers used in sex and nudity. The actors you never want to see naked are naked (including Mayor and Queen Bee). Not to mention that the boom microphone seems to be visible in every other arena. <br /> <br /> The most important thing is Moore's amazing enthusiasm. He seems to have a good time in general and it is definitely charismatic. His comedy rape turned out to be a great influence the last day, including Dr. Dre, who tried him in his groundbreaking 1992 album "The Chronic". As the film is technically incorrect, it is culturally influential. More importantly, it is a good time all the time. The biggest crime that can be used by the film is boring, and all its shortcomings are fast paced and entertaining. In other words, if you dig such a movie, you'll love "Dolemite". If you do not complain, you are "no business, born insecure, jock-jawed motha-f *** a!" (7/10)
