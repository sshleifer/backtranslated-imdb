It is not so much an overview, because it is proof that once again the Academy has been rewarding money, not artistic achievement. And I have to say I am sad that this imbd-member usually has an artistic and intelligent ensemble that has left it at the top of the 250's. Boogie Nights is powerful, raw and buggy through script, direction and action. Very few films can be claimed for this triple crown.
