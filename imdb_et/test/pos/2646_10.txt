In 1968, Stanley Kubrick made the masterpiece of this historical film based on a book written by Arthur C. Clark. It was such an early attempt to make scientific literature with scientific facts. His film-making style is still fresh and intact. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie more than one and a half times and I even have a copy of the VHS library. The CS3 class made the film again with another view: who is HAL and what does it think? <br /> <br /> I liked watching the movie again and tried to focus on HAL dialogs during the second episode of the movie. Dr Dave Bowman and dr. Frank Poole puts his food in front of two TV monitors on their sides and the HAL round reddish glass cup is in their middle. The TV report introduced HAL as a new generation supercomputer, which was launched on January 12, 1992, called the HAL 9000 Series. During the interview, HAL responds to a modest work machine that seeks to complete the mission of the spacecraft. In the second scene, Dave Dr Hunter, Dr Kambel and Dr. Kaminski, all in sleep mode. HAL wants to see these sketches and raises his dubious question about the purpose of the Jupiter mission. His calm and monotonous voice makes the audience hear more carefully. In the following scenes, we see how HAL tries to kill astronauts one by one and takes power. Because of his consciousness, he is able to try to save his life. When Dave wants to return to the spacecraft and HAL does not listen to him, the most memorable line is: 'I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid it can't be done. “In the midst of the most important communication between man and machine, the voice of HAL in the same monotone can bring both solid peace and malevolence. <br /> <br /> Dave has gone back to the ship, lost all his astronauts and decided to divorce the main brain cells of HAL. HAL uses its ultimate apology technique to persuade Dave to disconnect him. HAL asks him to stop and let him improve. These are his famous traits, while Dave disconnects his modules one by one: <br /> <br /> Dave, what do you think you are doing? <br /> <br /> Dave? I have the right to answer the question! <br /> <br /> I know everything is not quiet with me lately ?? <br /> <br /> But do I know much better? <br /> <br /> Can I see this very bad for this very bad decision recently ?? <br /> <br /> Dave, stop! Dave, stop! <br /> <br /> I'm afraid Dave! ”<br /> <br /> HAL's voice slows down during this process and becomes thicker and less audible: <br /> <br /> 'my mind is going? I can feel it. <br /> <br /> 'Can I sing to you?' <br /> <br /> Dave puts the final modules out and lets HAL sing "Daisy": "Daisy give me ?? <br /> <br /> your answer to me ?? <br /> <br /> Am I Crazy ?? <br /> <br /> While I'm not confused? ”<br /> <br /> HAL dies when Jupiter mission continues ?? <br /> <br /> Artificial God Blesses You HAL, Keep It Calm!
