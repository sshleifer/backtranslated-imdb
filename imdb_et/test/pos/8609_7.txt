Pretty nice for a good French movie. I have not seen any of Catherine Breillat's earlier films and hence has no opinion on the previous work. French cinema usually sticks to fun movies and leaves shooting games and starred vehicles in Hollywood. This is probably a good business strategy because no other country is likely to have the resources to compete in these projects. Making a film about movies is often pure because it has little response to people who are not in business. But that kept my interest much more than I thought. Regardless of the title (strangely in English), it is not much of a comedy for a moment. I've only seen some of Anne Parillaud's films, but she shows an excellent range of talents ranging from "La Femme Nikita" action / psychological drama to "Innocent Blood" skittish comedy. This film also extends its selection as it plays more or less ordinary women, but is still convincing for the screen. I also knew Roxane Mesquida with whom I was unknown. He plays a very expressive artist on most films whose talent is outlined. If you do not need driving and explosions for entertainment, check it out.
