During the short golden age of the Super 8 Magnetic Sound Home movie, we bought the GAF projector for $ 148.00 in a camera shop in downtown Chicago. It looks like the GAF came out of the camera and the projector; although they would continue with their other companies like the former Sawyer's Vue-Master 3-dimensional color slide viewer. <br /> <br /> Little did we know or foresee the fast approach to a video camera, Betamax, VHS, and possible DVD turns. With the Super 8 Magnetic Sound Camera that we also bought, we took some soundtracks from our daughter, Jenn's first sanctuary, and her younger sister, Michelle, before finishing school. It was all about 1979-82. <br /> <br /> During this time, we also bought some fathers toys to go with it; like some Super 8 Magnetic Sound LAUREL & HARDY Films and W.C. INTERNATIONAL SHORT SHIRT, Blackhawk Films, Davenport, Iowa. We also received a Columbia Pictures Home Movies soundtrack, which was then a forgotten classic comic, UPA GERALD McBOING-BOING (United Productions of America / Columbia, 1951). That was the time of our home movies! <br /> <br /> Being a member of this baby boom generation, the woman (Deanna) and herself remembered the character of Gerald McBoing-Boing; For Gerald, CBS had online TV on Sunday night, ca. In 1955 Bill Goodwin was a notifier / host. But we had never seen this original UPA theater art; nor was it known to us that the young Master McBoing-Boing was dr. Seuss "Grinch", "Horton" and "Mulberry Street" fame. <br /> <br /> The staff were very rich and deep. Outstanding output values ​​are obvious. Director Robert Cannon and director John Hubley were veterans of their job. Writers were Theodore Geisel (Dr. Seuss, himself), Phil Eastman and Bill Scott. <br /> <br /> Mr. Scott does not like writing for his UPA, but as a partner with Jay Ward in television features such as ROCKY & BULLWINKLE, MR. PEABODY, FRACTURED FLICKERS, JUNGLE, HOPPITY HOOPER and fractured flickers. With Jay Ward Productions, he was a full-service writer, voice and Kibitzer general. <br /> <br /> Multimedia gets its only voice narrator, radio / film / TV actress Marvin Miller. Remember him? He was Michael Anthony TV Ssries THE MILLIONAIRE (Don Fedderson Productions / CBS Television Network, 1955-60). <br /> <br /> The heavy color schematic and imaginative design gave UPA animations a special sense of loneliness, fear of fear and potential victory. And we can add that animation is definitely a "limited" variation. <br /> <br /> as many great stories as we start with a simple assumption; is born different. In this case, the young boy, Gerald McCloy, is born to call rather than talk. Children may be cruel and soon he will be dubbed with his not so strange nickname by a group of young deputies singing, "Nya, nya, your name is not McCloy; it's Gerald McBoing-Boing, a noise-causing boy!" At this point, the Animation Team is doing a remarkable job of happily and recklessly isolating the young emotional move and loneliness and eventually depression and despair that they cannot turn to someone for help and understanding; not even for mother and father. <br /> <br /> A frighteningly fashionable dark scene that includes a very UPA stylized running point that includes a train and equally stylized snowfall, leading Gerald to the edge of absolute despair. But then he is interrupted by a gentleman who announces that some radio program producer wants the young Gerald to play the sounds shown in the studio. <br /> <br /> The premiere of ONE will be with Gerald In the head of the Sound Department, he will travel with a huge limousine (which seems to have been waiting for them on our Stretch Limos) for admiration and admiration for his classmates and the world. <br /> <br /> IT has said that there are only so many parcels and in this case this story is likely to be a different ugly duckling; After all, a sad and lonely boy finds his place in the world and real happiness. <br /> <br /> NOTE. American American productions, or short UPAs, were the center of outstanding creativity Animated Cartoon. They were responsible not only for GERALD McBOING-BOING and several queues and TV series, but also for a very popular MR. MAGOO theatrical performances followed by a TV show (with Jim Backus' voice technique), the classic FROSTY TV in the snow shelf and the rather odd DICK TRACY Cartoon Show (with Tracy's voice given by Mr. Everett Sloane!).
