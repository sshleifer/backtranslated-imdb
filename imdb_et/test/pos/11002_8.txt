In the "Gothos Quay", Kirk and his team meet a powerful super-creature who keeps captain, "bones" and some crew members in captivity for no apparent reason. I may be wrong, but I think it's the first episode of Star Trek I've ever seen and a program that made me hungry. This is not one of the best episodes, but an alien who puts the team at the corner of the company is a precondition for making the show so much fun. In a sense, super-humanoid is one of Star Trek's most famous characters, the Next Generation's mysterious "Q". This episode is also forgotten to create a unique situation: this is the first time Uhura has been part of the action, and the story allows the viewer to see what a pleasant Uhuara character is when the story allows it. Too bad an exhibition has never fully explored this iconic image.
