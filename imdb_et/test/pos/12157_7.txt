Like most people, I was more interested in the Pink Floyd soundtrack, which has proved to be the only Pink Floyd album I still listen to after those years. It was quite surprising that the film was digitally remastered in a local video store. It was an even greater surprise when it was found to be a pretty good movie. <br /> <br /> Visually, it's pretty beautiful, especially when the two main characters are on the stones of the Spanish island of Ibiza. And using soundtrack music, which is as much as possible, is just Pink Floyd, is great. It was a pleasure to watch the movie with my copy next to me, mentally marking every story when it was used in the movie. Dave Gilmour's short "Spanish piece" was the only one I didn't hear, and many stories are used quite prominently, especially "Cymbaline", "Main Theme" and "Quicksilver". This last track is cumbersome in the standard music album, but it works very well during the title of the movie, covering at least once. Maybe I can now rate it on the album, now that I have some visions that I think it comes with. <br /> <br /> The "More" plot is sometimes a little harder, especially at the beginning, when the film seems to be just a vehicle that shows the hippies of its creators. But in the end, the film proves that it has much more to offer than the plot becomes sharper. Why Does Stefan Take Heroin? Why does ANYBODY take heroin, knowing all the possible consequences? The film does not attempt to answer this question directly, but Stefan's heroin consumption seems logically to expand its unanimous endeavor to pure pleasure. An amazingly appreciated "More" soundtrack evaluation. I also recommend it to anyone who is interested in the culture of the seventies and how it was portrayed in the media. I have no idea how realistic this film is, because I'm too young to experience the sixties for the first time, but it seems to try to make the spirit so that no other film is going to happen.
