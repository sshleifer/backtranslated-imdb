It has been almost 50 years since I saw "Jennifer" the first and only time. I didn't know the name of this movie until I saw this site, but I've talked to many people (especially my grandchildren) about how movies don't need to include graphic details to scare you and leave a strong impact. The story skilfully introduces you to concepts that really place East Lupino in a very dangerous situation. Every time Miss Lupino discovers a new "fact", she pulls the viewer into her confusion and fear. <br /> <br /> This movie influences me so, almost 50 years later, I still name one of the most terrifying films I've ever seen. However, this film does not contain blood and gore that became popular right after that movie. It is amazing what a good story and great actors are.
