We will not see this movie by HBO in the near future, if any. If somebody overcomes the video store in some way, grab it before someone else does it, because I doubt it will be restarted again. <br /> <br /> Unbelievable and timely film on the first attack of the World Trade Center on February 26, 1993, and how government agencies are responsible for detecting and stopping terrorists for American citizens and damage. The American property fell into full employment and inadvertently allowed it to happen. <br /> <br /> Cooling Bones Because We All Know Now that the terrorists detained at the end of the movie were not the end of our nightmare that came back on September 11, 2001. <br /> <br /> The movie revealed everything that went wrong in 1992-1993, which allowed the first tragedy to happen to the WTC. It was still eight years to realize that we should have learned from this first WTC attack to be more alert and ready to avoid another and much more devastating attack on the World Trade Center. I found this movie harder to watch after the September 11 attacks after the 11 September events. <br /> <br /> Everything I can say about this movie doesn't look at it alone. Even ending is so powerful and prophetic that it would leave you in a state of shock, knowing what we know today, and maybe we need someone who is with you, but not watching a movie to call for medical care.
