hello, looking for a movie for the family to watch on Friday night? Can't find what you were looking for? I thought it was a very enjoyable movie. Good for the whole family. I found that it had a very rare combination because it is attractive to both adults and children. At least, it was great. Bruce Willis was top-notch, with a lot of humor and a great film overall. I think it's a black film. And I don't think many movies, believe me when I say that it takes a lot of time for the film to think about it. It is clear that Bruce Willis did a lot of work and did it to make the film. Great story, good action, and again, an enjoyable movie.
