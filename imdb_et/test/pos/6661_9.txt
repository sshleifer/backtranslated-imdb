In Cold Mountain, North Colorado, near the American Civil War period, sons Monroe (Donald Sutherland) arrives for healthy reasons with his daughter, the shy Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman). Ada also meets the shy Inman (Jewish law) and they love one another. In the beginning of the war, Inman becomes a soldier and his great support for survival is the desire to see Adat Cold Mountain again. Meanwhile, Ada meets with the surviving Ruby Theweser (Ren√©e Zellweger), who helps her on the farm and becomes her best friend. The story alternates between current and past situations, expressing beautiful romance. I liked this movie. A movie like the pain of Philip Seymour Hoffman, Natalie Portman and Giovanni Ribis, the great direction of Anthony Minghella and the seven characters of the Oscar, is not disappointing. My comment is that the story is on DVD and the very important scenes are deleted. At least one of those that shows what happens to the dead body of Sara, her child and three farmhouses, should not be deleted. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Cold Mountain
