Night Hunter starts in 1968 when young Jack Cutter (Chris Aguilar) has unexpectedly handed over the family tradition of becoming a Vampire hunter when Vampire hunter Sid O'Mack (Sid Haim) handed over his family and handed them over to vampires to help Jack In his quest, he is given a book that contains the name of every living vampire or dead, no matter what you look at ... Jump to 'June 1995' and Los Angeles, where now the adult Cutter (Don 'The Dragon' Wilson, who credited as co-producer, there are four more titles in the book, including Argento (Vince Murdocco) and Carmella (Sophia Crawford) together they are the last American vampires, as they all eat at Cutter Restaurant and kills them, work done by Vampire King Bruno Fischer (Nicholas Guest ) invites the other four remaining vampires around the world, the French Tournier (Maria Ford), the Asian Hashimoto (Ron Yuan), Ulmer (David 'Shark Fralick) and Sangster (Vincent Klyn) to track east cutter and kill it. Meanwhile, Detective Hooper (Marcus Aurelius) and Browning (Cash Casey) have no idea and meaningless reporter, Raimy Baker (Melanie Smith), is involved in the fight between Cutter & Vampire, where Earth's story is! br /> <br /> Director Rick Jacobson I thought Night Hunter was quite a fun way to pass 85 odd minutes. William C. Martell's script mixes martial arts and horrors with fair success, it moves at a nice pace and is at least ever boring and luckily doesn't seem too serious. However, characters characterizing other horror film directors / actors are slightly sticky. Some may be surprised at how close the Night Hunter resembles Blade (1998), but it was done a few years before the single-minded long coat who suffered a Vampire hunter, a martial arts expert, a nightclub and an innocent scene of a woman pulled The world of Vampire. The Night Hunter does not really follow the traditional vampire law, for example, sunlight only irritates their eyes, they can only push the sunshine (why?), Heart and garlic stakes are not good when vampire killing in Night Hunter is breaking that neck. I could have done a little more horror and a little more blood because it relies more on martial arts. The dialogue is appropriately cheesy and the character is almost enough pleasant in a stupid way. <br /> <br /> Director Jacobson is doing his best to destroy the movie, the action scenes are OK, but they do not have a certain and odd cause when the order of the action is done, he shakes his camera constantly, it is like the camera is put into the whole washing machine ! Hey Rick, companion, it's not smart and stylish, it's irritating and annoying. Gore is disappointed with some somewhat firearm and some blood flow, breaking the Vampire's neck unfortunately does not contain much blood. <br /> <br /> With a budget that probably didn't mean a lot of nightclub expertly made. The action was bad most of the time and what is the "Dragon" thing with Don 'The Dragon' Wilson? Has he changed his name legally? Does he write to check Don 'The Dragon' Wilson?! Will he send him a mail sent to that name? I think I could do something like this, now I want to be known as Paul 'The Killer Klown' Andrews ... <br /> <br /> Night Hunter is one of those films that goes beyond its limits and horror to get gold for entertainment. If you like entertainment for your movies, it can be said that Night Hunter is for you, if your search for a big budget is similar (! Vampire's, veins and blood?), Then Blade & its sequels would probably be a better choice. What the hell I liked to complain to me.
