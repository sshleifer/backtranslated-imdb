I always enjoy this cartoon when Sylvester tries to catch a Tweet on a train rather than a grandmother's house. It's actually a normal price, but it's entertaining, especially when Tweety pulls an emergency stop. One of my complaints about this is how sloppy the animators were with the train. If you look at it again and again, like my little boy (who loves trains, so he liked so much), you will notice some things. the luggage car changes on the train either in the third, fourth or fifth place and in the long frame at all. The engine has either 651 or 814 or not. The coal offer has the number 99 or the letters "S.P. & Q.R." on it or not at all, numbers or letters. Coaches wear "S.P.Q.R." without "" and "long frames", and then the words "Southeast and West." very carefully. It is still a comic among my favorites with Sylvester and Tweet.
