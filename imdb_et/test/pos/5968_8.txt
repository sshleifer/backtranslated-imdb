During the Second World War, two Belarusian (Soviet Russian) soldiers try to avoid the occupation of the Nazis because they drag through the snowy landscape, seek food and safety. If you do not like black and white "foreign" movies, you can still enjoy "Voskhozhdeniye" (retiled in English "The Ascent"). Directed by Larisa Shepitko, the film performs exceptionally well, despite being largely part of the film. His premature death in a car accident, unfortunately, made Mrs Shepitko a final film. <br /> <br /> After declaring an opening mission, it does not seem that much can happen in snowy forests, but the Shepitko and the changing device make it unexpectedly exciting. Leading players Vladimir Gostyukhin (like the mentally wounded "Rybak") and Boris Plotnikov (as physically wounded "Sotnikov") successfully prevented the deepening of the symbolism, their allegorical performances, which are under the sharpness of Shepitko, give memorable and pointless provocation to the familiar story. <br /> <br /> ******** Voskhozhdeniye (4/2/77) Larisa Shepitko ~ Vladimir Gostyukhin, Boris Plotnikov, Lyudmila Polyakova, Anatoly Solonitsyn
