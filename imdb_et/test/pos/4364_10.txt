I find it a breathtaking, but deceptive film, because it seems so simple and straightforward: the Vietnamese survivor says his harassing story and some of the story is being restored on the spot. Observers sometimes even say that Herzog's presence in the film is minimal, but how wrong they are. We know that all documentaries are somehow mediated and have a fine hand on Herzog, especially in stunning music, an incredibly professional selection of archive material and cascade management. The meaning of this film is amazing, starting with its title, the opening title card "Revelation" and the original voice. This is a movie that can be viewed repeatedly with a growing miracle, not a simple commodity that has come to the news in the evening with its favorite drink. This is one of those films that can live with you during your lifetime.
