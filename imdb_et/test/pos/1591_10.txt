<br /> <br /> This film is a summary of Visconti's confessions: the Decadence of Death, Death, Aesthetic Search, Homosexuality ... All mixed with melancholic mastery. At a slow pace just to make all your beauty (which is both in music and pictures and in the story), this movie, which we can no longer enjoy, is bold, deeply personal and intelligent. Venya's real fruit like Visconti.
