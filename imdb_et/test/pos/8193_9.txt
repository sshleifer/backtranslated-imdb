The Emperor and Assassin (w / English Subtitles) 161 minutes are long, but time is full of a story that hardly fits it. The Golden Lips palace scenes and dusty yellow panoramas from the background of Chinese landscapes are a true story of China's unifying king, about 300 BC. A complex plot with lots of turns is played with great images. King Qin's simple desire for his common people is a unified empire, but not without fraud, plots and plots, and yes, bodies. Lots of body. This epic story of the beginning of China is a great opportunity for Westerners to glimpse the history of the little-known Asia. Caesar Qin's legacies include thousands of life-size terracotta pots that are still being excused today. As a historian, this film has clearly shown that Emperor Qin should be held together with George Washington, Napoleon Bonaparte, Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan and Julius Caesar to name some of the world's biggest conquerors / statesmen. I recommend seeing the emperor and the assassin, especially on the big screen.
