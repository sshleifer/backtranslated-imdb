I think it was already in 1987 when we had exams and my friend and I saw in the documents that one of the theaters was playing "teen deviyan". We decided to just go to this fucking, hoping for nothing big. But we were a pleasant surprise. The film was made in 1965, but even according to today's standards, the plot was completely modern and ahead of time. Music was wonderful and Dev Anand as a grown-up city saw and acted best. I still remember the feeling that we came out of the theater after the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Who guessed this story from a man who simultaneously fell to three very different girls? No, he's not three timers, and he doesn't cheat them, but he loves them all for three reasons for different reasons. One of them is homemade, one is an actor and the third is a "high society" girl who can help her as a poet. The question is which one is for him. What makes things worse is that all three of them like it. When things get stuck, the hypnotist takes it in and in their hypnotized state dreams of their future and comes to the right decision. <br /> <br /> This dream of the only color otherwise black-and-white film is the core of the film, but surprisingly it comes out of most of the versions available today. If you want to watch this movie, make sure that this part is intact. If you look at this movie without knowing it and being confused, don't worry because you just looked at the inadequate movie.
