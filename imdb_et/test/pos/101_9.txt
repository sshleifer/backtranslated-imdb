This is a very, very strange film ... that is so strange that it is best if you see it yourself. The film begins with a mixed professor who harasses his class because students have the courage to be as incredibly brilliant as he is! You can say very quickly that this man is a complete cynical - finding value is nothing but a sense of your inner self-importance. In addition, he seems to be tired and monotonous of life. <br /> <br /> Later, he spoke of bank robbery and managed to distract so many robbers that one of them would shoot him. Strangely enough, this is halfway through the film and what followed was a very strange story of the last seconds of his life. This is when the film becomes exciting because the style of the story is like one of the novels of the professor of literature that is intelligently written and tells the things we want us all to say. <br /> <br /> Watch this strange movie - it's amazingly convincing and I don't like what I've seen before.
