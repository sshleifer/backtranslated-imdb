Okay, "pretty good" doesn't shout at me, but I was surprised how much I enjoyed Campfire Tales. Although in the classic case involved leaders have no idea what is intercourse. Fears do not jump on you, but managers are constantly building on climate change. The film is based on popular city legends and ghost stories. Writers have refreshed their stories quite well and just twisted them so that the familiar endings still pack. The best shorts are "The Honeymoon" and "People Can Lick Too", I liked both because they have a nice story in every story. "The Locket" was a good ghost story and encircling "Campfire" is pretty good unless they go too much twists at the end. The only disappointing segment is "Hook" which is good because it is still quite short. In general I give it to 7 out of ten. It has a relationship that is absent in today's most horrible movies and a good actor. It may not be with Halloween or Exorcist, but it is a good movie that is worth the rental price.
