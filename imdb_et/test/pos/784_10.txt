I just saw this movie at the Tribeca Film Festival and I have to say I thought it was amazing. The combination of humor and sincerity made the film really worth it. The film was about seventeen years old, whose mother and father are very religious. Seventeen-year-old Ben decides to work as a retired actress who teaches her about girls and driving and living. It is very comical and touching. I must honestly say that this is now one of my favorite films. I recommend this movie to everyone and everyone. If no exhibitions were shown at the film festival, it should come out at the exhibitions later in the year. Please check it out! This is a great movie.
