Dario Argento is a filmmaker that I slowly enter, following the iconic efforts of Deep Red and Suspiria; he is not a filmmaker who always takes care of stupid things like "plot". It may be one of his little (but obvious to me) responsibilities: he will not let a small thing like common sense for his complex killing sequences, because his killer (s) may go through any complex invisible phenomenon until the POV tracking of psychopathic killer occurs over the frames. But it's fascinating to see a filmmaker of this opportunity, the pure Italian aesthetics that make Hitchcockian's thread into the soul (actually, as an interesting remark, when I recently saw a Scorsese short film, where he took three pages without filming Hitchcock's film, which Argento won in the opera almost twenty years, apparently without the text, it is 80 years old (CD players and heavy metal and hair, oh!) And with the absurdity that makes it tastier to swallow. <br /> <br /> The story is simple: Macbet's Opera has been produced, with high stylized pyrotechnics and trained clusters, at the last moment, Betty has even played a talented up-and-coming play played by Marsillach. He can't go to the police (how can he let the opera be really damned?), But is that a killer who doesn't let him go? rooms such as those played in other Argento films - a girl pursued by a killer, but it is like Argento, like De Palma, builds and fills her sequences and adds a peculiar taste to add strange humor (attacks against attacks to attack) killer, and the next version that refers to the lineup), some over-styling of the area Leone (the door through the door through the door probably inspired a similar stroke in Kill Bill 1) and even sado-masochistic inspiration with tapes taped on Betty's eyes more than once! <br /> <br /> Argento puts out his actress's anger and he's all played for it, even though things just seem to go to the "mis-hell" territory (I threw my hands almost saying I give up when he is led mysterious girl, as if we were suddenly with foreigners). With such a dark genre of material, Argento keeps violence and freshness as much as it is when opera music arrives directly from a stereo speaker, and an operator who may have had some drinks (and right!) During some scenes of how they shoot and vibrate hit. It should be read in the trash, but it is higher than the attitude of any driver's ballsy of any limitations of the genre, despite the foolish end as something that preceded it (thanks to a little lizard) - and an attempt to break the Macbeth curse, which, unfortunately does not seem to be in real live opera opera. 8.5 / 10
