Wow! In my opinion, THE NET is a great, nail bite, a techno-thriller with an edge-to-seat seat that will let you know. When I first saw it, I felt good during the day. When Angela (Sandra Bullock) went to Mexico, I thought, "It's really a nice place to rest." From the moment Jack (Jermey Northam) and Ruth (Wendy Gazelle) started pursuing him, I thought, "Don't let him do anything wrong! Please!" I also took quite a few deep breaths to shout more when I was already. On the bright side, when you ask me, the house was very luxurious and spacious. In conclusion, I give this four excellent stars of techno-thriller with an excellent, nail-engraving, edge-to-own seat.
