I chose "English Patient" for additional credit for history. I thought this movie would be incredibly boring. Instead, it has become one of my favorites. It depicts life in World War II quite precisely and the story of love is amazing. The love story made the film so incredible. I felt this interesting feeling, passion or something. It made me watch the movie over and over again. Kristin Scott Thomas and Ralph Fiennes are amazing actors and the way they played their characters is amazing. The face was wonderful together and actually seemed to be in love. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a movie or a donation to spend their free time.
