I looked at Dresser tonight after seeing it only once before about a dozen years ago. <br /> <br /> This is not a "big" movie and does not try to make a big gap, but my God, the shine of these two lines leaves me almost speechless. Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are nothing but amazing in this movie. <br /> <br /> Dresser is the story of a story by Mr., an aging Shakespeare actor (Finney) and his dresser Norman (Courtenay), sort of a lie in placing King Lear in London during World War II. These are two men, each of whom depends on another: Sir is almost helpless without Norman's help cajole, wheedle and bully him to get the stage of his 227th performance Lear. And Norman lives his life right through Sir; without Sirita she needs nothing, or she thinks she's anyway. <br /> <br /> This is a character-based film; the line is secondary to the interaction of characters and as such, it requires the participants with the highest caliber to implement it. Only 47-year-old Finney is completely believable very old, very sick, deceptive, bullying, but brilliant actor. He lifts up and smokes his fellow worlds even when they take their bows! And Courtenay is not less persuasive than a mincer who sometimes has to act more than a mother than her parent's employer. The employer is actually the wrong term to use. Because, technically, their relationship between the employer and the employee is mostly Sir and Norman like the old couple. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are others in this movie, but there is no doubt that the real stars are the wonderful script by Finney, Courtenay and Ronald Harwood. This does not mean that there are no other fine performances, especially Eileen Atkins as a long-term director of Madge. There is a wonderful scene where Sir and Madge talk about old wishes, old regrets, and what might have been. <br /> <br /> While not talking about these days, it is worth remembering that Dresser was nominated for five Academy awards: Best Actresses for both Finney and Courtenay, Best Picture, Best Director (Peter Yates) and Best Custom Scenarios. <br /> <br /> I was this memorable movie, but I was not ready to be as fully mesmerized as I was from beginning to end. If you want to see an example of what works great and be very entertaining all the time, I encourage you to look at The Dresser.
