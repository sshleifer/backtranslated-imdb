It plays like your regular teen audience's R&D movie, but the mood is incredibly grim. If it was done today, it will be considered a film of an art house. It goes through the routine that a man tries to put in, but the results of his efforts are harsh and cruel and dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> The entire tea flick formula is followed, but nothing indicates a path you would expect. Imagine the director's "It's a Wonderful Life" where eventually James Stewart wasn't allowed to come back to the real world. An incredible movie that reflects all genre expectations. This will make you dirty later, because the characters are not redeemed. I'm surprised that it has ever been done. A detective story of the eighties.
