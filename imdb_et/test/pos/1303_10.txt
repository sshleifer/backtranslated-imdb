World War II would not be cherished. <br /> <br /> We have had quite a few documentary series about the Second World War in a conventional television program. Without discovering any information in some encyclopaedias or movie books, it seems that this old memory can be completely remembered for most names. <br /> <br /> There was CRUSADE IN EUROPE, which was headed by one military general and later Dwight D. Eisenhower, 33rd US President. It spoke of the history of conflict in Europe when it was seen by the Allied Commander. <br /> <br /> Then PACIFISES CRUSADE (self-explanatory), which I don't remember much. Newspaper Man / Author, Jim Bishop was the host / navigator of BATTLELINE. <br /> <br /> And there was a wonderful WINSTON CHURCHILL, SELECTED YEARS. * The series was a British Broadcasting Company and an American Broadcasting Company. First it was in 1960-61. A. During the season in these countries and proud that Richard Burton is talking about Sir Winston's words. <br /> <br /> This is the production of the 1952 NBC television network on our subject today, with the hands of VICTORY AT SEA winning the cigar. <br /> <br /> First of all, it had to produce several years of care and literally through thousands of hours of film. The footage mentioned here was from members of the United States Armed Forces, an independent newspaper film, movement material from our other Allied partner countries, as well as from Nazi Germany, fascist Italy, and film. Imperial Japan. <br /> <br /> When this was achieved, the various respective films had to be cut and edited in 1/2 hour portions. It was done with great skill, so many changes in the scene, be it sharp or resolved. A vision of every episode seems as smooth as it would have been for one film project. Highly polished and meaningful fiction does not waste a word or sometimes even a description of action, not an exaggeration. Talking to Mr. Ralph Graves was a talented actor, director, film, radio and television. Certainly, he received immeasurable mortality through the golden tonal tuning of descriptions of written episodes. <br /> <br /> Finally, VICTORY AT SEA has the luxury of having an original score, both the opening theme and random music. Richard Rodgers, Broadway celebrity. (Rodgers & Hart, Rodgers & Hammerstein) His compositions are complex, complete, changing and even "classic" in the right sense. <br /> <br /> Classical arrangements played by NBC Symphony Orchestra under the leadership of Robert Russell Bennett, and as a soundtrack / cassette / compact disc, it has been continuously available and demanding since its first release, 55 years ago! And really a small miracle, because it is this musical result that is so pleasant to the viewer / listener. It pulls this cake cold. <br /> <br /> * SIR WINSTON CHURCHILL, SELECTED YEARS had a beautiful and very memorable original score. It was also prepared by Mr Rodgers. <br /> <br /> ** We had our "Ace in the Hole" complementary to our father, late Clement J. Ryan (1914-74). . The father had been in the United States during the war. Our Pop was always on hand to explain and explain any of the situations in the series. <br /> <br /> He and our mother, now 90-year-old Bertha (nee Fuerst), were already my older sister, Joanne (1942-90) as an addict.
