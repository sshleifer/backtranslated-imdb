I got this movie one night late and never knew what struck me. It was one of the most annoying movies I've ever seen, but I was waiting on the edge of my seat to see what was going on. Alan Rickman is a great "bad boy" but this sign wins everyone else. I've never influenced this movie! It has been 6 years and I still don't forget "Closet Land".
