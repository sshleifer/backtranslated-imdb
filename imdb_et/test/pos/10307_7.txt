The film's theme is tough and very real. It happened. One can discuss some of the director's and scriptwriter's artistic freedoms. The theme is what makes the movie a sign - something else. I saw the film for the first time after the actual phoolan, was retired in New Delhi and had served as an elected member of India for several years. By the way, he was not the first inviolable parliamentary election, as some reviewers noted. The so-called "inviolable" has been elected to the Indian Parliament for decades in polling districts. <br /> <br /> While Shekhar Kapur is headed by many Indian heroes because he made commercially accepted international films - - "Bandit Queen" and "Elizabeth" (and an acceptable child movie called "Mister India", accepted by the average India audience) --- and even got the Oscar nominee for Elizabeth, I will not place him on top of the Indian director. He will fail as director in all departments, except maybe he will get higher than average results from his actors. Fineness, fineness, charm are not easily found in his films - they contain melodrama. <br /> <br /> His idea of ​​using Nusrat Fateh Ali Khani's song at the beginning of the cinema was perhaps one of his great achievements on the audible soundtrack of Queen Bandit. And then maybe the doors are ganging during the gang rape sequence. Otherwise, the film seemed like a spaghetti to the west with sex and violence, with the subtraction of the great music they joined. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good-looking Indian film director who makes a realistic international cinema movie, you shouldn't see Shekhar Kapuri movies. it is the later works of three Indian filmmakers Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Mrinal Sen and Girish Karnadi and of course Muzaffar Ali "Umrao Jaan". Unfortunately, none of these directors had the financial support that Kapur had to give them and their films an international viewer. For example, Sen's "Oka oorie katha", made in Telugu, or Satyajit Ray "Sadgati", based on Munshi Prem Chand's "Kafan", has more films than an intelligent viewer who deals with the intact situation in India. It was not supposed to use graphical sex and violence but just suggested them. Of course, Sen did not make nugget headlines, while Kapur's efforts were boosting them. <br /> <br /> Kapur has formulated and used his limited talent and modest resources in the Mumbai film industry to take his products from home away from home. For that, I welcome Kapuri. But the "Queen of the Bandit" remains a major issue that awaits its director.
