Although this is not the most technically advanced film I saw, it was fun and enjoyable for a few hours. The main characters are sweet and you really like them and you know something when Susie Q has to go but you feel good when she returns to Maggie. <br /> <br /> Lots of fish stock dialogue and meaningless plot-line, but above all LOTS FUN.
