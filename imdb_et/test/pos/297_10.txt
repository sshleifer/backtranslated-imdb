Brilliant actors and brilliant picture! I love the music that comes with the start of the chopper scene, it's just so moving and at the same time real, but at the same time surreal! The Vietnam War was far from human, and I believe that there are terrible people at such film events who can act under certain conditions. Modern war films spend so much money on the effect. It's just a straightforward smart movie that takes you beyond your imagination. A film that really captures evil and hates the fear and fate. How crazy the world and the will and friendship, love and passion. Must See The Movie And Undoubtedly The Best Warfare Ever! Many tried to copy, but still the movie is not even close enough!
