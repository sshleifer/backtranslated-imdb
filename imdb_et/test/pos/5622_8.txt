Chris Smith is a good filmmaker who has rarely seen talent for good recording and then hell. Smith's American Movie is a biography of Mark Borchard's filmmaker who has lost his will to milk his uncle's uncle to fill his horror short. But never in any case should you continue to work or support the children he has prepared. <br /> <br /> This is Smith's ability to make Mark seem more meaningful than anything else. Even if he entices Uncle Bill's sweets and executive producer's credit, his despair is to be with someone that likes us with Scorsese and Spielberg. <br /> <br /> "The American Film also belongs to this rare, often tried but rarely achieved sub genre that successfully interferes with the fun of horror. Humor comes from Borchard's Ed Wood-style belief in his genius. From his terrible attempts to act, from his less as a mistress to replace a movie, and her work as a sweet but brain-damaged friend of Mike, if she is a short actor or team member. <br /> <br /> horror comes from what Borchardt can't do: This is the American attitude - I want, so I am justified - that keeps him from seeing how much he has to learn about his chosen craft, he's so sure he can't fail.
