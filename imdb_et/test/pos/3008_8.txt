I usually give this movie 8/10. Visually, this is not something stunning: a mixture of artistic director dreams of Hieryonomous Bosch, Salvador Dali, Frieda Kahlo and Georgia's O'Keeffe - and a valid proof of a recognized film as a serious art form. The beautiful use of color, form, shapes, the environment and the fabulous set is combined with modern computer graphics. So, the 10/10 for that! Wow! <br /> <br /> The plot line is well predictable. You know they'll save the girl and finally get a killer, but this story is still interesting and enough to get you there and keep you there. 6/10 for that. <br /> <br /> Probable Factor ... I don't give this rating, but the movie certainly made me worship, and I watched it on a television screen. Of course, the big screen would have a big impact. The graphic violence of the erotic, erotic nature in the surreal landscape - even if it is beautiful - is extremely unpredictable. The world inside the killer head is not - thank goodness! - My World. Since I watched this movie on the video, I could play a couple of sequences repeatedly and admire the second time if I wasn't so nervous where the scene could go, and I suspect that the whole movie would be worth the second time, just for "visual art". <br /> <br /> General recommendation: Do not take children or conservative grandparents into it, but if you want a visual look for movies, such as surreal art, don't forget a little kinky gore and just want to take a bit of thinking, it's a winner. Oh, and if you want babes, Jennifer Lopez is pretty hot. <br /> <br />
