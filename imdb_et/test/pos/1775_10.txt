I like the movie, this is the best pirate movie I've been watching so far (forget the silly Errol-Flynn stuff and the Pirates of the Caribbean). This movie is a wonderful melancholic. I compare it to "Johnny Guitar" by the sea (but 3 years earlier), two women fighting for a man where mad love can happen. <br /> <br /> The character of the woman (anti-) heroine, Anne Providence, is great, acting without compromise as a child who lost her female identity in the real world of a man alone. He is a rather strange hero of the movie, not a funny pirate, because most of his companions in this genre are still not kidding, fighting for the poor and good and killing only foolish Spanish or British soldiers or - better leaders, but he kills all poor war prisoners after he grabbed the ship (look carefully at the beginning of the movie), he is primitive (he can't even read), he is desperate and he's desperate and he's an alcoholic, he loses all his friends as a result of his fatigue and he carries most of the film. This movie shows a pirate "hero" a bit (!) A bit, as he (or in this case, "he" but has been a woman "Anne" buccaneer, Anne Boney) could have been a brutal reality. <br /> The film is quite short and the story is breathtaking. Certainly, the film of the 1950s does not have exciting special effects for today's viewers (the ships float very well in the bath), but this real drama of love (which kills), trust, betrayal, revenge, hatred and sacrifice leads one crazy. Perhaps Anne should even be Judas Iscariot and Jesus of Nazareth in one person, being his friend (French LaRochelle) betrayed as Jesus; after a friend's disappointment, giving him the death penalty (like Judas); if you regret it (like Judas, who commits suicide according to Matthew's gospel); and eventually sacrifices himself to save the beloved enemy (like Jesus). But even if you are not interested in the philosophical issues of guilt and reconciliation, the film brings many (cheap) activities such as sword fighting and burning (plastic) ships for a very short hour and a half.
