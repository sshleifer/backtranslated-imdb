I have to admit, when I saw a preview of "Inglorious Basterds", I gave myself great expectations. THIS FILE IS NOT AFTER. <br /> <br /> Rarely, when I look at such high-expectation films, I have met or exceeded these expectations; this movie did it and more. Even more rarely did I stick to the end of the movie, I and everyone else in the theater did. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I am slightly inclined towards Quentin, I grew up with Pulp Fiction. "I was watching it when I was 12 years old and it's still my favorite and influential movie. <br /> <br /> Since then, Quentin hasn't really reached its billing level. was not honest (I never watched Jackie Brown and then Grindhouse there.) It's up to "Inglorious Basterds." What Quentin did was exactly what was needed for the war genre, western spaghetti, which could only be done by Tarantino or Sergio Leone, but seeing Leone dead, Tarantino himself is the man himself who is the masterpiece of this masterpiece. So we look at a movie that I don't give. Writing was on the spot, a nice transition from one, but not one language Not to mention this movie, the great scenes and unexpected shocking action of the classical Tarantino mold, a rich meaningful dialogue, were created. <br /> <br /> The actor was great! Christopher Waltz deserves serious I do not say it often, but frankly, one should speak for this film, he spoke every language in this film and gave such an amazing touch and soul. He stole an exhibition in a movie that was all amazingly impressive. <br /> <br /> I have no problem building this movie because this movie is the best movie I've seen all year round and probably all over the year. Quite frankly, the more I think about it, this movie can always capture my best films and this is Quentin's best film after "Pulp Fiction". Take it from me, watch this movie. I loved it not making this movie fair enough. <br /> <br /> I looked at it yesterday and I'm still blown. Thank you to Quentin's heart for making this movie. You're a friend again. I can't say "Inglorious Basterds!"
