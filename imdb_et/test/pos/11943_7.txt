It's a nice little lifetime movie about a man (Peter Coyote) who lives in a perfect suburban environment, when one night the police suddenly broke his home and was arrested by a boy after 27 years of murder. <br /> In his jail, Coyote announces his wife's fate events 27 years ago and how she contacted Wayne Kennedy, who allegedly killed her. <br /> <br /> This is a story about kickback and more about Wayne and Coyote and how they met and what happened when they were more interested. The man who plays Wayne Kennedy is pretty horrible. The true strength of the film is that it actually happened in the mountains. The husband spends a film that runs around to find secrets, and every time something new comes up, we are being treated to reveal another mystery. It's actually pretty good. <br /> <br /> So, when a lifetime television movie goes, this little color is highly desirable. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
