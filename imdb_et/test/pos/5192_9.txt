I found the movie very real as much as S Ryan Private and a sustainable account from a German perspective. Graphic action and single characters gave this movie a lot to interest me throughout the film. Stalingrad was a very brutal battle, and the scenes gave this film the reality of this battle. I recommend it to anyone interested in military history. It was my second film review in a couple of years, and again it revived this realism. Weapons, uniforms and German listening while reading subtitles gave him a lot of good military film. In fact, I was in the German perspective of the battle because I took up the Germans, even though they were the aggressor of the war and the final loser.
