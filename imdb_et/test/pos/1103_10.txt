Jingofighter I agree with some of your comments, but I have a couple of points of disagreement. First of all, this film is not something like cars by ATE Paris. Not IMHO. I do not like this. <br /> <br /> I think the film had elements of surrealism, but I think the filmmaker's basic approach is not "surreal" per se. that's why it doesn't like CARS Paris, I think more than strange euro work, some scenes with "wierd" are not surreal. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I think Heuzenroeder's music is great. They used whistling, the sound of old and western documents, and their waaayyy better than most of the Aussie films that usually made filmmakers with the dark-hearted Indy band that the company wants to push. <br /> <br /> The name of the movie - I don't know why it's called Modern Love, I was hoping David Bowie seems to be wearing a tie and lipstick ... \ t
