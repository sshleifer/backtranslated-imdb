I stumbled upon this film, while channeling the other night. It has continued to hold my interest about twenty years later, as it is an important lesson in real life that he teaches us about the darkness of human nature. And while it gives a true story of what is happening in World War II, it is astonishingly surprising for the ugly things that are happening in Europe today. <br /> <br /> If you thought that "ethnic cleansing", as it is called today, is something to do because of race or ethnic origin, you think differently after watching this story. <br /> <br /> I think I would have been naive to think that evil follows all the rules. Evil is like evil. <br /> <br /> This movie teaches a valuable lesson and I recommend it especially for example. church groups or civil rights organizations. <br /> <br /> I don't expect it to be too easy to find and rent, but I would like to see it again because there is one amazing scene that gives a completely random but interesting look at the banal complexities of "racial expertise". In this scene, the SS racial organization is discovered from the protagan, captured by the Nazis at the beginning of the war, and led into space. There, these two pictures play where the SS officer can determine where our hero (character of Anthony Quinn) came from and where his ancestors came from. Well, "came to find out" that Quinn's character is not ultimately a "worse" member of the race, but on the contrary, he is a perfect, archaic! It doesn't mean much of Quinn's character who is more interested in the cities, rivers, and mountainous areas the SS-man just called ... However, the perfect Aryan archetype is his perks. Among other things, he can leave his job in a slave industry where he wears striped clothes, and a slave modeling work where he can wear custom Nazi uniforms. Yes, it's a sure-fire guy who always appreciated the nice clothes ... until allied armies arrive and know his face from the covers of magazines. <br /> <br />
