This movie was what I've been waiting for for some time. I was delighted that it was all welcome. Writing this film is so finely designed and researched far beyond the viewer's view. I found it amusing that so many people who watch are not reading some very important lines, but if not, the movie makes sense in a different way and is very brilliant. The film has many stories and symbols that have been weaved around this one character, Kilo, who has risen from the streets in the midst of many misfortunes and has become a very powerful criminal. After spending time in prison in Kilos, the legal system has a loophole and unleashed events are only released to find everything that doesn't seem to be. Kilo finds himself against a higher kingdom of society and political royalties to explain the importance of the word and meaning of man. The war begins when the street is against weapons of wealth and corrupt power. <br /> <br /> Build on explosive and powerful non-resistors. This movie leaves you riveted. I found this film to be outstanding and not a movie that needs to be ignored. Great. Go Hire Today!
