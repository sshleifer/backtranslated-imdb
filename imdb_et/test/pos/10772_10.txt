When it comes to movies, I can't just distinguish between crap, cage and masterpieces. I believe this film is an absolute masterpiece and it is difficult to keep it entertained for more than 90 minutes. This film ran SLOWER when the Mystic River and Harry Potter 3 were combined and I still managed to swallow. For me, Eric Bogosian was his passion. Such a stunt is extremely difficult to pull out and has a positive effect. Bogosian probably slipped one of the toughest performances of modern cinema. I had no respect for Bogosia until the end of the movie. The turning point was the whole monologue that was before the unmistakable climax, it was the key that turned me around. This man hit such a low point that he knew he could never get it back. The boys of the company congratulated for the action. His blistering prose even made the cavalcade slip away, shaking his head horribly. It made me realize that personal integrity and hypocrisy are not important in the world of speech, even in the business world. Stone may have pushed some uber-liberal action, but it was my real film and production. Oliver Stone is a small captain of a kind. The last third of the film probably had the best lighting and cinematography I've seen in every movie. The stone artificially makes the DJ cab in the nineteenth-century prison for five to seven cells. Visually, Bogosiani's only friend is a black foam that absorbs his routine vitriol. He's talking and it doesn't talk back. This is a sad metaphor, considering the way he treats the people who gave him success. Stone and Bogosian created a stunning movie about a man trapped in a prison in the walls as well as in prison. This man is limited to his will and he can never escape. The scene that made me understand my relationship was when he didn't want a former wife back. He preferred his prison, not outside the world. Every story is in conflict and it came to the simplest conflicts: man versus himself. "Talk Radio" presents this conflict in a smart, engaging and artistic way. There are no hidden messages in this movie and any smart viewer should wait for the progress of events. I just bowed back and let my mind grab this movie and I loved it. It is sleepless, invisible, and it will never get its proper recognition. We hope this will be the case, because the gems deserve to be found and then hidden again. This is a pearl because I found it on my local Wal-Mart store on a favorable DVD. $ 5.50 was worth half an hour when I dug it, trying to find it. I did and got more than my money. This is one of the best movies ever made and it is worth ten reasons. Ten reasons give ten results. <br /> <br /> Here ends my bead!
