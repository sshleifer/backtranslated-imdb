I loved this example. I think for the first time, when I tried rocky ice cream, it was an exhibition. Wasn't the store like a beach or something? In fact, I wrote to Marc for several years. I lost my touch and I would like to be contacted again as adults. Does anyone know where he is now? I want them to put it on the DVD. I seriously doubt that because I think maybe five or six people might even like to remember the exhibition. They just don't make such shows anymore, are they? I don't know if it would still be that day and age. Do you know anyone who could burn DVDs from the show they saved to VHS? I would be willing to pay (within reasonable limits).
