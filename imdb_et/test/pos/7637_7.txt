"Cherry" talks about a naive, married virgin who decides to have a baby but is not sure how to do it. This easy going little sleeping bag is full of exclusive characters and language-in-cheek situation humor. Fresh, fun, mold-breaking stuff, I really did enjoy this flick ... whatever it is worth. Recommended for romantic comedy lovers who want something else.
