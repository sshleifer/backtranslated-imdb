Like NIGHT STALKER and then X-FILES, the show showed a fantastic situation and the main characters had to find out. Unlike them, the hero (s) did not end up in an empty bag. They usually had tangible results. It was also made clear that "good guys" were a dirty profession, where they sometimes had to pull some nasty things. Imagination, wit, action that has not always taken too seriously ... I miss it. One of the reasons is that I find it difficult to think of too many exhibitions - BANACEK aside - that did the same job to take the viewer and grab their attention to bats. Writers looked out for extremely unlikely, if not impossible, situations that the characters had to find. explanations that often took 90 degrees are obviously still unexpected, but still worthwhile. Too much I agree with another reviewer that Anabelle's character was somewhat underestimated, but when she was on the screen it wasn't just for eye candy. He was quite competent on his own and stood by the two male leaders when he felt he was justified. Rare these days. Sullivan? If he was not in the department, he worked at the KGB or CIA. He's such a cold-efficient, ruthless type. He knows how the world works and understands what work can do. King? This is clearly a game for him. He stands out and talks about ideas for detective and spy novels he writes for his seemingly "real" work. He's probably the most interesting to see these three, though they all have their moments and often. I agree that only his spin-off series had no original interest.
