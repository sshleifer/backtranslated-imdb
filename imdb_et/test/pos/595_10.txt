I've always loved cups. Although most of the kids' entertainment was not so pleasant, Muppet was. Muppet is very funny. They are probably the most pleasing characters of children. <br /> <br /> Muppets not only had its own example. They have also filmed in many films. from Muppet Christmas Tree to Muppet Treasure Island. The first Muppet movie "The Muppet movie" was also, like show and other movies, great. <br /> <br /> The movie button is how they all started. Kermit lived in a crow. Until one day, the film director tells him there are frogs in Hollywood. So Kermit takes off for Hollywood. Along the way he runs a lot of people like Fozzie Bear, Gonzo Big and Miss Piggy. An evil person is also trying to kick Kermit. <br /> <br /> All Muppets movies are very enjoyable. I mean, they're all very funny. This movie has many movies. Like Steve Martin, Mel Brooks, Elliot Gould, Carol Kane, Richard Pryor and Orson Welles. Mupet's movies are all very enjoyable. I hear Jason Segel going to another star. I can't wait to see it.
