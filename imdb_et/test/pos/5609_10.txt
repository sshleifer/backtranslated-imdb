This is my favorite Hal Hartley film. All his films are small gems. I love independent movies and I hope Hal Hartley never goes to mainstream and sells. What if the Lord Jesus came back and loved his people so much that he could not open the final book and destroy the unbelievers? It was nice to see P. J. Harvey's movie because I am a fan of his music. Don't look at it if you are a fan of Hollywood movies, you are disappointed.
