Bonny Hunt appreciates the coup with his director's debut. Minnie Driver and David Duchovny have this indescribable chemistry name. Of course, the plot is unlikely, but it doesn't stop the movie from enjoying. Carroll O'Conner does a great job as Grace's grandfather. Other big characters show their card buddies. Jim Belushi is funny as a part of Megan, an extended family, man. <br /> <br /> Faith, family, and marriage are respected. Some sexual references and salty words are used, but in context and with gentle humor. <br /> <br /> And in the background that wonderful Dean Martin tunes - "Back to Me". <br /> <br /> Recommended.
