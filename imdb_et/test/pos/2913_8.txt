... as valuable as the King Tut tomb! (OK, maybe not valuable, but possible to cool). I note that no one has commented on this movie in a few years and I hope that the new post will generate new comments. This is a movie I remembered only from childhood, and only recently, when I'm tired of waiting for Fox to honor his past and hunt for Korean DVDs (in English, but unorganized with Korean subtitles). I'm not going to go through another long plot description - it is enough to say that the first time it was in the right widescreen format left me with the agapile and the scope of the movie. Matte's paintings still remain and the palette sets are truly breathtaking. But it is smaller in size, giving this film its depth and richness, looking at the lifestyle of both the Egyptian poor and the elite. Bazars, hovels, docks, emblems and inns are just as fascinating as the Pharaoh's throne room. While there are a lot of errors (especially dynamic sequences), details are explored more thoroughly than most Hollywood movies. Visually, it is not without its mistakes - interiors are often too illuminated and colorful to blend smoothly with exterior surfaces. However, it is a film that should be credited as it is as small as it is. Annoying? In parts, absolutely. Overweight? Underfilled? Yes, both - though "underestimated" may be more appropriate descriptions. Too long? Absolutely not. I wanted them to spend more time in the House of Death Experienced Death and hits, and less with their romance at Nefer. Historically inaccurate? Yes, it is, but it was Shakespeare. Nobody blames him for that. I appreciate historical accuracy as much as the next man, but in the end, remember that cinema is a theater, not a lesson in history.
