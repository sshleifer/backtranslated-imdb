It's a thrilling story that borrows the elements of Kennedy's murder and uses them successfully to create an excellent Western story. <br /> <br /> The movie has a good music score, although it relies too much on repeating the title theme. Giuliano Gemma and the rest cast are excellent. This is more of a brain than normal Western spaghetti, which relies more on story than action, and it succeeds because the story is great. That doesn't mean there's nothing going on in the movie. There's a lot and it is very well designed. This movie will immediately draw you off and keep you away. You always have the idea of ​​what each of these documents is after. This film also has some frightening comment on American politics. <br /> <br /> This movie shows why Valery, in my opinion, is a threefold link between Sollima and Corbucci in the western spaghetti guidelines.
