I'm currently watching the DVD "The Big Chill". One of its participants is Meg Tilly. I watched it in IMDb, which led me to read Meg's bio, which mentioned and reminded me of Meg's sister Jennifer Tilly, whose filmography included "Key West", one of my wife and my favorite events. Then I read this whole thread of reviews. <br /> <br /> Wow, I really loved to show it and accept all the signs of the character and uniqueness of characters and situations. <br /> <br /> Like most others, I want it to be available on DVD or otherwise. <br /> <br /> The last reviewer says he is following it again so I would like to know what network, channel, day, times are on. <br /> <br /> So if anyone knows how to watch "Key West" episodes, please let us know.
