Three American boys have traveled their way around Europe, turning each other to gather so many bold tricks and the Hot babe sees them as they get, but Andy is looking for true love. She finds it in her Eiffel Tower during her bungee jump when she arrives and surprisingly saves suicide and the heartbreaking beautiful Julie Delpy. His efforts to find this girl and the secret he discovers, he and his friends, lead him to a fast-paced adventure, full of action, romance, gore and inspired humor, without ever having seriously taken or tried to be anything other than a wild entertaining 90- minute ride. I've seen this movie many times and found it to be a much more rewarding experience than the "London" original, although both films are so different that it's not fair to compare those two or even follow it up.
