I adored it, but I'm an 80 year old child. I loved Rainbow Bright throughout my childhood. I don't know if small exhibitions would be very interesting these days. (But that's okay, I bought it for me anyway. I just brought a little so that the cat on the cat doesn't look at me.) I love the violent drama and the colorful landscape. It just reminds me of a simpler time before cartoons were more violent than our local news can legally show. :) Although I can be a bit biased on this subject. Afterall I was Rainbow Bright for 6 years in a row for Halloween ........ I don't know if they make Rainbow Bright costume for adults. Lol.
