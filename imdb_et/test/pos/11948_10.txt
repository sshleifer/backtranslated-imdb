I saw this movie for the first time in 1988 when it was in HBO and I loved it !! It was so much fun when I read it too many times. I like Stork's brothers and sad, ugly dog, Bosco! My favorite quote form is: "It's so ugly, it should be asleep." I also loved it when a little sister bounces girls on the back and their faces stick. I also love John Cusack and Demi Moore in this movie. They were great. This movie brings back the memories of my college day when I first saw it. I rented the movie countless times and watched it over and over again. My college roommate and I just didn't get enough of it. Who could not love this crazy movie?! I want to buy a copy of the DVD, does anyone know where I can get it?
