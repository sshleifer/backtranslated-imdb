The movie is really good, it doesn't use violence or sex, etc. to sell itself like other movies, but just uses a real decent plot (based on Michael Caine's original) and some great actors to make a fun, action-packed movie that I enjoyed. One thing that made me even more enjoyable with this movie was that it had some actors I really like, like Edward Norton (who I last saw at the 26th hour I enjoyed), Jason Statham (transporter, enjoyed and that) and Seth Green, who thinks it's great, his role as Shawn Fanning's roommate, called "The Napster", is fun and his hacking skills play a big part in the main thrust of a big traffic jam in LA. Car fleets are really decent and the high-tech devices used by thieves are interesting and very impressive. I haven't seen the original, so I can't really compare it, but I liked it a lot and would like to recommend this movie to everyone, it's not a movie where you like this particular genre, it fits everyone I felt good after this movie , it was very good and was very fun to watch. I'll give him 8/10. Look at this!
