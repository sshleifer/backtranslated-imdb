While I appreciate movie 7, I must also point out that both are historically interesting (as they mark Mae Marsh, Lillian Gish and Lionel Barrymore when they were all younger and lesser known) and have quite exciting activities for their day Plot Strange for the West, because all the problems with the Indians begin with strange reasons I've ever seen! Indians decide that they have a giant dog party (no, they don't eat a dog but feed on dogs) and when two Indians arrive late, there are no pooches left! So, they steal two dogs belonging to two orphans near the White Settlement, and it really touches on every kind of war !!!! Not only is it foolish, it seems to play the audience's prejudices. I don't know if the American Indians were driving a dog, but it sounds like a stereotype that was later applied to other ethnic groups. All this in dogs! The film has some great battle scenes and exciting moments - for example, if Mrs Marsh climbs over the battlefield to save the baby! Exciting stuff! But STRANGE, too!
