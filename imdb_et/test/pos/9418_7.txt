I watched two very different Holmes adventures this morning, but you would be surprised by similarities. <br /> <br /> It was probably the first collaboration between Basil Rathbone (when I was king, Rome and Julia) and Nigel Bruce. and directed by Roy William Neill. It was not their first Sherlock Holmes adventure as they did a few years before. <br /> <br /> It made a great team but I prefer the Hammer version I'll talk about later. <Br> / <br /> Holmes relies on a lot of disguises for his work, and I am constantly interested in the admonitions that appear when they imagine something. When they find a new clue, they always look striking. <br /> <br /> The story of keeping a bomb on the Germans during World War II was interesting and kept you focused on the mystery.
