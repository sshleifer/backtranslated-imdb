This movie reminds you: "Boy's Notes", "Threat to Society", "South Central" and others from its ilk and even share participants with some of them. The mentality of "The Man and the Law" is emphasized by all black neighborhoods and almost all white police forces. Here, the police are so bad that they look like cartoons, and in one scene they even attack the boys when they drive in the car they've freed by the "owner." It's like bushwhacking from the old west, but the modern environment makes it too real. <br /> <br /> The story focuses on young Jason Petty and his friends, for whom the school is just an inconvenience, taking time to lift their "real occupation" cars. This is the case with Newark, N.J., a city of stainless steel with few jobs, but very high in terms of criminals. In fact, the problem is so serious that the police have all the "Car Theft" written on their back, which indicates that the whole unit must be dedicated to this particular crime. <br /> <br /> The boys use "slim jim" to break the car and drive joyfully as if it is not a big deal. They only get into the real difficulties of the police resurrection. The laughing, Nazi-widowed widow has the boys, seeing them not as human beings, who could be worthy of salvation, but human purposes. In fact, he resembles somewhat the sadistic Nazi officer of the Warsaw ghetto, who made the Jews happy on the film "Schindler's List". When the boys lurk behind the ambush of the police car, things are expected to go down quickly. They are severely beaten and Jason finally arrives in jail. It is clear that these are "bad guys" who would like to steal your car within minutes, but the film wants us to see them as heroes, showing Jason to protect his sister and friend by taking care of his grandmother. The film left us wondering whom to take and who felt sad: boys whose life goes down, honest citizens whose cars are stolen left and right and who could at any time capture the Crusade of Attack or Newark City, the spirit of which is brutal, breathless dead police officers. <br /> <br /> Despite the last image, the film offers a realistic look for the ghetto, the protagonists and their families, and the culture of car theft in a city that seems to have only two careers - law enforcement and crime. Strangely enough, the whole drug issue has never been mentioned. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers (including producer Spike Lee) are clearly biased against the Newark police, which I hope will not be so bad that they are depicted here. Nonetheless, they have given us another strong, influential story about the inner city and the black youth who went astray and Sharron Corley is as good as Jason.
