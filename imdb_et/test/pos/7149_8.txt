The amateur camera is working aside, I thought this movie was very different and unlike all the blogs and posts I read, I got something completely different from others. The story presupposes a very religious family and their connections with their church. How they have to adhere to all the rigid rules and rules, but the daughter seems to be having problems staying ahead, what the thoughts of other opponents are and the bad language. But he prays a lot, as does his family. Then one day they will be directed to the church picnic and in an accident. There the parents and his brother change; what Jesus will destroy and "save". WARNING: MAJOR Spoiler ALERT. Or so we believe. I think if you look at this movie only from the point of view of your daughter, you really need to pay attention to the end you see that what we, the audience, think is the actual performance of the parents and the son, is actually all a dream and a daughter POV. This would explain many of the parents' and son's activities, which were quite the opposite of how they lived before, especially the sex, and would also explain why Peggy went away for murder, and so on. See how perfect this pie is, but go back and see the cake Betty. When Caroline removed all the evidence that the pie was sewn. And the fact that the scene in which he sees his dead parents puts each other in arms and his brother, all of whom seemed to die very calmly, even if they were poisoned, fit into a dream order.
