[Small spoilers follow] <br /> <br /> Steve Allen found that many find that current humor about serious events is acceptable with the formula: Tragedy + time = comedy. In 1939, before the German violence against Poland, there was barely a fun period and subsequent events, including the Blitzkrieg (after Sitzkrieg), who took a canal to Germany, led to a heroic evacuation in Dunkirk and gave the world a recumbent face of France. his honor to the Nazi conqueror. <br /> <br /> A great doll for romance, comedy and serious drama? Yep. Directed by Jean-Paul Rappeneau, well-matched with outstanding pain, "Bon voy" creates a paste of history and scene events and scenes that is very fun. <br /> <br /> Viviane Denvers and beautiful Isabelle Adjani are the main actor in France when the clouds of war gather around Europe (which is an excessive cliche, sorry). Viviane's self-respecting bedding with a lot of credit for her credit seems to be "Whatever is good for Viviane is good ... Viviane) After the last premiere of the film, then the minister was incompetent in the Reynaud administration Jean-Etienne Beaufort ( Gerard Depardieu in his extraordinary role) signals his interest in him, he goes home only tirelessly when he sees a lover who does not understand the word "no." Then frantically and histrionically supports another former Beau, besotted Frederic (Gregory Derangere), Frederic is a novelist-in-expectation to help cope with the confusion in his apartment. <br /> <br /> A comic accident that once again highlights the importance of windscreen wipers working as a public service message, puts Frederic in jail for the most serious accusations. the break of the Germans from their static positions forces the surrender of prisoners to southern France, but our boy p flies by making his way privately, not as a congregation. <br /> <br /> Panic and fear in France, when the Germans celebrated victory, are well illustrated and a new twist story. Who should meet Frederic, but a truly proud young assistant to Camille (Virginie Ledoyen), accompanied by Professor Kopolski (Jean-Marc Stehle), a mandatory Jewish refugee researcher. Kopolsk has some bottles of "heavy water" that he has to go to England. Of course, the Germans do not know the important ingredient you know (this part is pure fiction - in France in 1940 there was never heavy water - just Perrier). And Camille is so big and committed. <br /> <br /> What's next? Peter Coyote as the alleged French journalist Alex Winckler. Be by his name. He's really an Abwehr officer (German military intelligence: spy). And he also used Viviane's bed (and wants to repeat his thing). Obviously, such Kopolski is the only big male who does not want to prevent it from acting. <br /> <br /> Next, there are adventures and failures that are seamlessly integrated into a very fast, enjoyable and enjoyable movie. Partially a tribute and a bit of "Casablanca" fraud, it is a remarkably funny movie (except for the heavy natibit). <br /> <br /> Isabelle Adjani deserves praise for her best portrayal of the goddess of the daffodil, who has little or no salvation qualities over the years. And Depardieu, who is unreliable to Reynauld and ready to board a ship and join a traitor, Petain, is convincing as a man whose arivor Viviane crosses his diligent sense of duty against the Republic. At the moment of critical power in French history, Beaufort is eternal. <br /> <br /> Too many theaters do not show that Bon voy should be available soon for purchase or rental. Look at this! <br /> <br /> 9/10
