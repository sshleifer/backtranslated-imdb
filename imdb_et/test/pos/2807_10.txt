I played Sami (Porter, Lou Sidekick) in "Dead Rail", which later introduced "Alien Express". And I have to say that, for my part, I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. As a struggling actor, I had the opportunity to work with fantastic people, it gave me great scenes to add to my roll, and it allowed me to work on a dream job for a month and a half (without waiting!) Turi (director) And Steve and Scott (manufacturers) give me the opportunity to participate in production. I made many friends (Lou, Todd, Steven) and I find myself very happy that I have been able to work with these incredibly talented people. There was no day that went so I didn't laugh at my butt. The real tragedy is not so much the special effects, but the fact that every person who watched this film couldn't see what was behind the scenes and what talent he really went. Craftsmen who build sets, prop masters, gaffers, wardrobe, makeup artists, script tutors, operator, production assistants, extras, craft services, manufacturers, director and actors. It's probably that Sci fi didn't spend a terrible amount of money on the film (2 million). But there was a lot of time, energy and power. I watch the movie now as a production that brought together many talented people for a fun project that was less than two months without complication. It was a great cast and a team and I'm just so glad I left it! Next note for those who don't know Lou Diamond Phillips, Todd Bridges and Steven Brand. They are fantastic people who are incredibly funny. I'm still working on my Deniro impression and I can't thank you enough to run for "midnight". Todd, every time I hear Elvis's song, I can't forget the story you tell me to hang with him for dinner. "Can you give me attachments?" (IM A GREAT ELVIS FAN!) Steven, "Mr. Brand!" You are a true gene and any advice and encouragement you receive is always welcome. I miss you and hope you are well. Thank you for your good memories, stories, jokes and friendship. Oh and Miss Utah says hello! wink wink. <br /> <br /> Joe
