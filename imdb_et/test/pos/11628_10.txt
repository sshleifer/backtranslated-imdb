I've seen this example younger. This is really a good show. It is very educational for children aged 1 to 8. Barney is definitely super DE duper. B.J. is pretty funny. Babie Bop is very cute. Children are also very cool. This exhibition is about getting to know numbers like Sami Street, but different types of exhibitions and characters like Barney Purple Dinosaur, B.J. yellow dinosaur with baseball head and Baby Bop cute green dinosaur with pink. The first that started was a very old show for Barney and Friends. But the other was different if there was a new episode. The last of 2000 was also the new scene of Barney Park. They also have a Barney exhibition at Universal Studios in Florida, where you can see Barney, B.J. and Baby Bop and when the show is ready, you can play, shop and meet Barney. This is a very good exhibition to watch this example when you learn a lot of things you like about this movie, and live-show at Universal Studios in Florida.
