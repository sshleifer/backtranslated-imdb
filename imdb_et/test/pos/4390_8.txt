I was truly and wonderfully surprised "O" Brother, where are you? The video store was all the movies I was planning to rent, so I found it. I came home and when I looked, I started to get in and found myself laughing loudly. Coen has again made a spectacular film. But I think you will know the characters when you watch this movie for the first time. The second time, now that you know them, you laugh so hard that you can hurt you. I would strongly recommend that someone see this because if you are not, you are really missing the age picture. 10/10
