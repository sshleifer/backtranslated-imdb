The main cast: <br /> <br /> Vlastimil Brodský .... Frantisek Hana Stella Zázvorková .... Emílie Hánová Stanislav Zindulka .... Eda <br /> <br /> This charming story is directed by Vladimir Michalek the enchanting appeal of people, making the characters attractive, truly universal. <br /> <br /> Frantisek Hana is retired and retired, her previous occupation unknown. She lives in a very nice apartment with her wife forty-four years, Emilie. His son Jara carries a spacious apartment as a problem solver because he needs to accommodate one of his spouses and several children. The son is not a cruel scheme, but one man who has one past is too much with his wife and sighted when his dad is connected to that apartment (which he moved after giving up his son's previous residence). <br /> <br /> Hana and her elderly friend, Ed, spend more than enough free time there to make small jobs, not for money, but gladly to put one over for slightly duped people like real estate agents. The favorite game is that Hana is acting as part of the divo divo of the New York Metropolitan Opera, returning home to a large mansion. Ed is his companion because the light commercial vendors are collecting themselves by offering controlled limousines and fine French cuisine in the hope of profitable sales. <br /> <br /> If he does not deal with well-planned fraud, the duo will deal with the quick pluses of pretending to be railway security staff to seize breaths and tickets from young teenagers trying to cross trains. Amazing kisses, that is, there is no lechery here. <br /> <br /> Hana's long-term wife is obsessed with saving enough money to make sure that the couple have an individual and joint great funeral, an event where the loving Frantisek is in no hurry. <br /> <br /> Disagreements between money and Frantisek's divorce funds lead to a crisis whose resolution rings both real and love. Michalek calibrates the viewer's emotions, but he does it openly, honestly and effectively. <br /> <br /> "Autumn Spring", of course, is subtitled, the result of an increasingly lively Czech cinema. It was not widely shown in the US, but its availability on DVD will hopefully bring the flick to the general public. Unfortunately, Brodsky recently fell to cancer, so this film is a fine actor who admired his character with a passion for the joys of life, which must reflect the actor's own values. <br /> <br /> 9/10
