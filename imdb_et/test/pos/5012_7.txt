The basis of this dynamic docudrama is the true story of one of the most extraordinary card players. <br /> <br /> STUEY is a dense poker ace whose life is a one-way trip to Hell with little bypasses. <br /> <br /> This dramatic feature differs from other poker movies. This is a rare and serious attempt to bring a real story about the ultimate gambling addiction to the silver screen. A complete obsession that destroys the intimacy of spirituality and overrides all possibilities of redemption. This is the least likely movie commented by Vegas Casino. And this is the only poker DVD you can find on the Gamblers Annonymous shelves. <br /> <br /> In this movie, there are scenes that poker players will definitely refer to as some of the best gambling images. Stu read the bluffing of his opponent's hand and especially Texas Hold'em. <br /> <br /> Prophetically, early in the film, we see a young Stu tempted in his neighborhood with a pile of changed pockets. Poker is for individuals seeking revenge. It is a patience that harms a shortage. "You can't tempt me!" can very well be the basis of the punishment triggered by the master poker player for his opponents. <br /> <br /> Conservatives look at this movie for a warning story that has been lost from sin. They can trigger Mark Twain: "The best throw the dice is to throw them away." Young and liberal masses inevitably have a simpler and more sympathetic outlook. They may not have heard of Twain's bid, but you will definitely remember Stu's stunned ball note, who learns from the future of Stuey that he won one local car overnight in the game. "You say go to hell and they're waiting for a trip." <br /> <br /> The Las Vegas vignette mosaic we see in STUEY will stay in memory for a long time. Frank Sinatra, the most generous tipper? Forget it! Nobody sees the surprise as a hot-shot gambler. And for Vega visitors who may not know what impact they have on the quality of their stay, check out Stu's visit to the Vegas hotel! <br /> <br /> It was what I had to do. is where I had to be. Movie stars in Hollywood, politicians in Washington and gamblers in Vegan.
