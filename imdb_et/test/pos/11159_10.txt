This movie is full of interesting ideas. Some scenes are really fun. Dialogues are smart and spoken. The tension of the film does not come from the line of the "mystery of murder", nor from the relationship between the characters. The film speaks parallel to two readings. <br /> <br /> The first story relates to Trintignand and Kassovitz players. Trintignant is an aging drift with a somewhat ridiculous macho toughness, followed by a naive young man, who Kassovitz played with many good-hearted smiles. There are many good moments in the film about the contrast between the two characters, for example, when Trintignant tries to teach Kassovitz how to intimidate. <br /> <br /> Another story tells how Jean Yanne's salesman gives his job and his wife to find a young friend's murderer. Yanne plays a part in aggressive irony. I wish I could better describe it. <br /> <br /> After a while, the viewer understands how both stories are interlinked and eventually meet at a surprising but also logical end. <br /> <br /> The film is a successful mix of clever but superficial gangster films written by the director's father (labeled by Michel Audiard) and the "typical French film" that has a lot of psychological depth and a lot of care about showing emotions.
