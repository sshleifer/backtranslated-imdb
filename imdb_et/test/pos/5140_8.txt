I took a group of youngsters of the same age as the protagonists, and I appealed to all of us. I agree with another job, Wilson's boyfriend was working on a very small script of the admirable script. It's good to have a movie about demographics of a certain age (too old for PG, too young for R). It also shows how they think and maneuver at the university. You had to love how well Jimmy Buffet made a cool teacher. He kept us awake for adults. The level of the questioning agency for children remained reasonable. Their motives were specific and not like some A.D.D. rebels. The setup and the music were beautiful. In general, if you liked Holes, it's really similar.
