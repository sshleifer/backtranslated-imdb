This performance was nasty when it first came. The first actress who played the daughter did not respond to this role, writing hit or missed, and Damon Wayans CLEARLY hadn't done such a cornea family-friendly exhibition. Chemistry between himself and Tisha Cambelli (they are long time friends, like all Wayans clan with Tisha's husband and Will Smith and Jada Pinkett) DID work so they show it again. When she's back, she changed her daughter, made her son fucking ("Eric Manes", "Boy Meets World") and made the youngest daughter a genius ... . Exhibition of how often roller-travelers across the upper sacred music to be horny walks well enough to keep it as an example that you see Damon Wayans comfortably on your skin (especially since the main writers, directors and consultants) were all Wayans family members) AND his character. When everyone had been to the exhibitions for some time, they worked in all the pains and consistently took a funny show. <br /> <br /> However, there are too many breaks, too many Kyle family's lives are often too chaotic. They did Junior TOO STUPID, also made the oldest daughter an occasional attractive, clumsy idiot, and the writers didn't even stay with their youngest daughter. I feel they jumped in the shit and signed the death penalty at the show when Junior became pregnant with her girlfriend, she moved and married her and her parents were introduced (the father of June's wife characterizes me to think). The show was funny ... but it was an UPN show at ABC, if it makes sense for the reader. <br /> <br /> Updates are funny enough, but I'm released, it's over ... somewhere to go with it. If it's bad, it's really bad. It tends to be sometimes a cornball, but at least he was a black man who had a sitcom to make this syndication a big network .. Who can say to himself now? (Given the merger of CW and the recent "cracking" of television networks). One.
