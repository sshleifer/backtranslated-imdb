A very good "Precoder" starring Dick Barthelmess, which reminded me of a Hawks "Only Angels are Wings" (1939) in which Barthelmess acted. This film was directed by master William Wellman, who was responsible for the "Wings" image of Silent in aviation. <br /> <br /> Barthelmess plays the pilot of a fucking guardian who is guilty of an aviation accident. Later, he meets and falls to Sally Eilers, who is part of the law on Air Circus migrating; but when Barthelms' brother appears in the scene, a triangular relationship is created. "Central Airport" has many exciting moments and some moving and moving scenes thanks to the great chemistry of Barthelmess and Eiler. who, in my opinion, is very similar to this actor Dorothy Mackaill). Tom Brown is good when Barthelmess brother, fresh and successful Wyleri "Tom Brown of Culver". <br /> <br /> Great special effects, good flying stunts, fast paced movie; very fun at all. Don't miss it when TCM starts it again.
