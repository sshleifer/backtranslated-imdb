It is a shame that this series has not been remastered or produced by Warner or another professional film house. <br /> <br /> Copies of most episodes are available, but they are usually copies of poor quality copies of copies. <br /> <br /> As I understand it, 92 episodes were produced during this time, but only 15 were mentioned here. <br /> <br /> Some series writers, like Richard Matheson Edasi, became a great author. <br /> <br /> Excellent series, well written, well-staged and well-produced.
