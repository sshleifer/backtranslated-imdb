In my opinion, the golden boy is one of the sleeping places / lost treasures. Sexy comedy about the young man's quest to find his nitch in life and he hurts all kinds of wonderful jobs that somehow have a pretty sexy girl who eventually falls against him, but he doesn't really understand it! It's really something you can easily miss in the absence of a name, but when you look at it ... it falls on the comedy / stupidity that is inside. Really a crime that caused only 6 OVA episodes and a pilot film. However, it is unique. I'm surprised that it survived so much. If you want to laugh, high quality anime that is (100% CGI free), check out this anime. A boy who one day can save the world ... or maybe not.
