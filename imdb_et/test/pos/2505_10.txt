This is one of the best films of 1999, where Kate Capshaw directed a small town and a love letter. First of all, the landscape is beautiful and anyone who sees this movie and doesn't want to move to that location is crazy! For the participants, Capshaw is a stunning actor who enchants the emotional role of a roller-coaster. Tom Everett Scott is charming, and always pleasing to Ellen Degeneres! Blythe Danner and an actor who plays a bookstore salesman are also terrible. Although it was unsuccessful, the film is great because it is both short and sweet and very romantic. 10/10
