I looked at the pilot episode with this great expectation, having just finished college and moving on to "real life". I was not in the brotherhood, but there were many of my best friends and I got part of the party they did in their house, so I know what's going on. <br /> <br This exhibition is clearly a dramatization, not a documentary about Greek life or college life on this issue, although it has a lot of truth, though mostly exaggerated. If you look at the exhibition about the value it contains as a television show, and nothing else, it's a lot of fun, like movies like old school, pork, animal house, etc. If you look at it while waiting for it to crown all your experiences in your college life, you are likely to be more willing or angry that they will dramatize many events.
