This documentary is unique as its theme. And while D'Amato's staple was erotic, the film succeeds in showing some decent movies that you remember from old time, late night Cinemax ... One problem ... Joe made hardcore porn at times mixed with softcore eroticism, even mixed in his gore movies. Gore movies are the classic of the cult for a duplicate copy of a $ 20 pop-up window (not peanuts for 20-year-old films, folks.) I want to see why they are a cult classic. Even as sweet as Joe seems (she seemed more elegant than expected), the guy liked the shock. Both "Caligula: The Untold Story" and "Emanuelle in America" ​​show us heavy rape, snuff and beast (both, if you'd be surprised at how far he goes to "Caligula II" if you can track it though these scenes may be personal career documentary uncomfortable, hey, he did it ... I would also have liked to see more interviews with people with whom Joe was working ... Maybe I want to see what Laura Gemser looks like these days ... I think she is a goddess and one of the sexiest women who ever like the genre.
