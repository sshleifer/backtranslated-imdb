This film is about a teenager who is fighting for his social status at school. She is a "good Christian" and feels she has lost all high school fun. So she wants her never to be. After receiving the desire and trying the earthly lifestyle, he understands that his quality of life has been dramatically reduced and wants to go back to being the person he was. A good family-oriented film that has a positive message to be proud of who you are, even if you are not the most popular.
