o m g !!! Do you think they would make a movie about it? well i knew they would be, but i didn't know when !! and now it's finally here !!! when i got it through yesterday's post, i put it on my (evil) stereo system that plays dvds and immediately it was huuuuuuuuuuge smile on my face when the cloud appeared (looks good .... proud!) and was followed by all other exciting characters fantasy! including tifa and aries, my favorites .... (these are also too big) the graph knocked me out !!!! they were really amazing. so real until last hair !!! the story is OK a bit confusing, especially since my movie was in Japanese, but of course - being a fantasy fantasy for a long time - I didn't think a bit - I just read the subtitles !!! all the characters talk about how they do the game, and the reno and the rude are still ridiculous. The dragon scene is also a bad guy. just seems so good! anyway .... the graphics were, amazing .... story, awesome .... and the basic idea even ff7 about the movie ....... genius !!!
