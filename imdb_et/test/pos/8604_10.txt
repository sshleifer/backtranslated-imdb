This is the true faithful adaptation of Masuji Ibus' novel "Black Rain". Like a book, it's very moving and thought-provoking. The story revolves around a couple of attempts to see their niece successfully married. They have difficulties with the sick to hear that he is suffering from a radiation disease, after Hiroshima, on the day of the bombing. Well filmed, well-functioning, moving, tragic, terrible and funny.
