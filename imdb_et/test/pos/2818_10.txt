I love the female protagonist, her name was Rose. Rose brought many interesting questions to her journey. Is it possible to achieve peace and internal fulfillment by external means? Does our society teach it? Could it be a victim of memory that can lead to the victim of others? Is one responsible for the product of my environment? To what extent can one environment be controlled or controlled? How is a "typical" person or different from Rose? Finally, would the result or story change if it came from another country like France or Italy? I loved that this movie provoked all of these questions in me, while it was amusing, stimulating and finally holding me off! Every time I watched it, I've learned more about film and myself.
