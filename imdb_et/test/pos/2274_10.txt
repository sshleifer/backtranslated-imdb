Everything is enlightened, Elijah Wood plays Jonathan Foer, a Jewish American who is looking for a woman who saved her grandfather during World War II. In a sense, she is a woman who saved her whole family. <br /> <br /> This is a heart-like story from someone who is seemingly hopeless on the journey. A stranger in a foreign country to talk so. Jonathan is not fully prepared for this adventure, he grabs like a painful thumb in Ukraine (he would probably stay like a painful thumb everywhere). But what he discovers is much more than he expected. This movie makes you laugh and makes you cry. Elijah Wood is very good in this film, based on Jonathan Safran Foer's novel. <br /> <br /> From whom I spoke, this film is somewhat different from the book. I collect the book is really good. However, it is a good movie, it's something for everyone and I really enjoyed it. Can anybody say an Oscar?
