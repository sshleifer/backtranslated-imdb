Witticisms, colorful characters, family relationships, coping with hardships, fun living and humor. This movie is all and more. What is the story of every man (and woman) with an upper bound and a script. It just offers pure fun, lots of laughter, lots of smiles and pure entertainment for the whole family. Other reviewers describe this story. I just offer this comparison? it is part of the "Best Exhibition", "Grumpy Old Men", "Millions" and some other comedies and tricks that have been rolled into one. <br /> <br /> This movie's pearl was probably limited and is probably not available for rent. But it is now on DVD and I recommend buying it. If you like good old-fashioned fun and fun movies for your family, you can't run Manna from Heaven. This movie is a sure fire for blues or dark days in the days or harsh times to follow the darkness.
