Great movie. There are no free tricks like most Hollywood movies. Everyone supported the plot. B & W also gave him a simple, non-frills. In short, it was the simplicity of cinematography and casting. <br /> <br /> The next is an interesting contrast with Memento. Both are used by manipulative and extensive characters. In this sense, both reminded me somewhat of "In In Company of Men", as well as highly recommended. One difference between the two films of Nolan is that Memento was a little easier for me to follow, given that b & w scenes are developing in a continuous chronological direction and so colorful. I don't think this applies to the following places where the scenes seemed to be randomly displayed. If you have the choice between VCR and DVD, I recommend a DVD because it gives you the opportunity to watch the movie a second time in chronological order, not just in the order of the mix (though inventive) presented by Nolan. It also makes it easier for you to create an order for yourself when you want another. <br /> <br /> As the other viewer pointed out, one of the best things in this movie is Memento. none cast was famous. They were characters, not the big-name actors who brought about the development of other films. <br /> <br /> Given some of the similarities in the plots, I don't know if Memento is a kind of succession of the following, but is meant to reach a larger audience, as Edward Burns did, that he is the one who is - and to a large extent the same cast - Brothers McMullan.
