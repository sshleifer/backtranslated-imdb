This game was one of the main reasons I actually had PS2. I remember playing Soul Edge (sometimes called Soul Blade) and I was trying to do it. <br /> <br /> I played the original Soul Caliburi, but I could never play it enormously since then. However, I bought the Soul Caliburi II Gamecube version and that was what I really got into the series and I was ecstatic when I heard about Soul Calibur III. This game gives us classic characters like Mitsurug, Cervantes, Nightmare and Taki. But it also adds a number of new characters, such as Zasalamel, Tira and the unplayable Night Terror. (True Boss of Spiritual Stories) The strategy-based "Sword Chronicle" mode is a new feature that I really like, it can be quite complicated in later chronicles, but it's a good addition to the series. <br /> <br /> In Soul Arena mode, there are several missions that, under certain conditions, you must fight against a certain enemy. (The exception is the "final battle", where you just have to fight the Night Terror) This is another exquisite touch that makes the game even more fun. press some buttons to get a different result, it may be to attack or block an attack or get a better end. (Every character has two ends) In conclusion, this is a great game and I would recommend it if you are a fan of fighting games.
