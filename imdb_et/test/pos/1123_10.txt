This show is absolutely fantastic. It gives you all the great show and romance shown by OC and Dawsons, but it's much more fun. It is a show of morals and values ​​without everything being sugar-coated and disinfected (area 7 in the sky.) We do not have corporations or brotherhoods in Australia, and our university system is completely different, so I have no idea how Greek life is accurately depicted . But I don't care! Because this show is my new favorite! Any writer who can love me for a racist homophobic flagship bible must have a genius. <br /> <br /> And Cappie is my new Pacey. Sorry Josh Jackson, you're accused!
