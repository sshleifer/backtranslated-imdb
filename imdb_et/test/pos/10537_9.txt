I saw it in the family section of the Tribeca Film Festival. I'm not sure either of my kids really got a movie, but I have to say it's a great short film. that we all felt we grew up in the 1980s, which in turn extends to how my children today feel. Then we had Regan today, we have Bush. We have terrorism instead of the nuclear war. <br /> <br /> I really identified this with the main player and I was wearing Curehead in high school. We all felt that when we were 16 years old, there was nothing important, but it's nice to see a movie where they discover everything is important! <br /> <br /> Again, I probably wouldn't have put it on a family member ... some younger kids had too many curse words, but it was a wonderful and enjoyable movie.
