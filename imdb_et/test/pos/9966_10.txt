Seriously, where is Al Pacino's Oscar nomination? Is it that we take it for granted at the time of our career? Pacino here is extraordinary .. He gives a complex, heartbreaking, like Jewish money lender to Shylock. The film as a whole was quite large, beautiful pictures of Venice and a pitch perfect score to listen to. other actors also do a good job, but the real reason to see it is Pacino. I've seen all of the 2004 Oscar performances and I have to say Pacino was accused. with the game, the lack of studio campaigns, the late release date without much push or probably all of the above .. I think the best performances of the year are Jamie Foxx Ray, Don Cheadle in Rwanda and Al Pacinos Venetian Merchant ..
