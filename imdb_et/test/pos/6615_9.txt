this is one of the biggest documentaries I've ever seen with "Dark Days". I've been skating for an hour and I love this movie. Peralta and his superb editor caught the hours and atmosphere perfectly, contributing in part to incredible archival material. Tony Alva is one of the coolest individuals. Love these knees high on striped sports socks and rock Tony! <br /> <br /> Not only is this movie a visual feast, but the 70's soundtrack must be one of the best in history. Buy a DVD, you won't regret it.
