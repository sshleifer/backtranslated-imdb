Even if Voskhozhdeniye was your favorite movie, it could be viewed at most every ten years. It is too emotionally tense. Just considered Shepitko's best movie, ASCENT is a story of partisans operating in the Belarusian forest in the dead-occupied Soviet Union of the German dead. <br /> <br /> Military experience, especially cold and snow deficiencies, the actual fight against survival against both nature and fascists, is always subtle, barely deduced from the subtext of moral judgment, and the question whether a person can be moral or immoral in one context, but otherwise rights. <br /> <br /> A group of partisans in the forest are attacking a German patrol and losing their food supplies. Two men, Rybak, who know this area, and Jewish teacher Sotnikov, have been assigned to go to a small village for food. They find that the village is burned to the ground without edible and nothing but charred wood and foundations where a mirror is hidden in one hip hole. The overwhelming feeling is that anyone who brings war to the land of cruelty and the people is really damned. I thought that the war that the Americans and the British bring to Iraq, and how the horrors of war bring people, is a degenerate act of the people. <br /> <br /> Two go closer to the larger village where they come from the co-operative manager of a sheepskin litter. The Germans arrive and two partisans are fleeing under fire. Sotnikov hits his leg and prevents German because Rybak gets away with the sheep. Sotnikov becomes so desperate that he is not ready to settle when he removes his laptop to put his ball on the ball. Just then Rybak returns and pulls Sotnikov out of the fire. <br /> <br /> Rybak pulls Sotnikov through the forest, a bloody meter by meter, made for a long time. Each meter is a torment, but it still pulls it on deep snow, up, cavities, black bushes that break when they lose their weight. There are several similarities to Tarkowski's cinematographic vocabulary - long processes document the effects of the process, the use of repetitions, and the resulting emotional stress that builds a longer picture. In the background, unnoticed by the action, the question hangs - did Rybak return to Amorov for an immoral act? Was it not the duty of Marxist-Leninism moral standards or the general imperative of group survival to get food back to its hungry band and leave Sotnikov to flee? To sacrifice one person to stay in the group? What brings the question - can we assume that an immoral person under one philosophical system is moral in a different moral system? The guerrillas come as if the second war was a farm of three small children. He is shining with the scourge of war and hardly hanging out with his three children. They are hardly rested when more Germans appear. They make their way to the exit and be directed to the attic to hide. <br /> <br /> Sotnikov's cough gives them away. When a gaze appears over Germany, and no one responds, he threatens to fire over the attic and break Rybak's nerves and they stick. Who has moral responsibility here? Sotnikov cracking for cough or Rybek? Two partisans and a mother are put up and taken to a nearby town that enters the forged iron arch at the entrance. They'll find a headmaster and a little girl already in custody. They are heard by Belarusian turncoat, played by Tarkowsky's favorite Anatoly Solonitsy. Sotnikov keeps his head in interrogation and torture and only asks what the interrogator's pre-education was? He does not answer, but the simplicity of his desk was probably the answer to a "school worker". <br /> <br /> Rybak, on the other hand, asks for his life and even offers to join the police. The previously noticed defect of the character that made the wrong moral decision, the ambiguity of which hides this judgment, is now becoming obvious, disturbing and very ugly. <br /> <br /> Five are sitting in a dark chamber. They all have to die the next day. Here the elements of the Christian parable become stronger. Genuine Rembrandt lighting and compositions are used to portray other Christ's old Masters. He decides he can save everyone if he takes guilt against everyone. He must live until morning so he can save everyone. She asks her mother for forgiveness and the leader who knows what is happening does not feel such despair dying as she did before. <br /> <br /> Morning comes. The Germans do not care whether Sotnikov takes over all the sins of his companions or not. They're all hung. They are dropping a steep street, virtual Via Dolorosa. The seat that is the gate of the city will be delivered. Five ropes hang from it. The board stands in only three places, so Sotnikov stands on a wooden stick, which Rybak throws off. They're all hung. <br /> <br /> When Rybak goes down with the Germans, somebody crowds him into Judas, unnecessarily hinted, Shepitko is just a mistake. Rybak depicts several times that he is trying to escape, trying to escape, dying of honorable death and trying to unscrew himself shithouse, but leaves with the Germans as a beaten dog. But if Rybak had the moral right to go back and save Sotnikov's life, would he be wrong to try to save his life?
