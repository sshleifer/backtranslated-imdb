"Traces of the Moon" is almost certainly stranger, the most complicated and the most atypical Giallo. It may be a constraint for some sub-genre fans, but this film does not include many of the usual Giallo brands such as bloody knife killings (preferably a covert killer carrying black gloves), delightfully decorated beauty and unpredictable red herring. Anything to compensate for it ?? and many more? "Footprints" is the most indescribable mysterious and unstoppable atmosphere I have experienced in this type of film. The level of mystery in this film is so high and intolerable that it literally feels uncomfortable and scared. Like the female protagonist Alice Cespi herself, you have no idea what is happening or why, and this feeling of powerlessness is undoubtedly the main point of reference for the film. As an observer, you desire to help this poor woman understand what is beyond her, but you just can't. Alice has a successful interpreter interpreter, but her quiet and peaceful life breaks brutally when she wakes up in the morning and slowly realizes she has no memory of the previous three days. She thinks that a photo of a hotel on a holiday island in Gamas has been spoiled and decides to go there to find out what happened. On the island, it seems that Alice recognizes several people, including a lonely little girl, she just used the fake name Nicole, wore a red hair wig and acted as she came to the island to hide from the unknown threat. In the meantime, even the nightmare of a poor girl is restless because she repeats the dreams of astronauts hatching on the surface of the moon and a nice scientist named dr. Blackman. "Footprints" plot is really odd and slow-paced, and especially the cosmic sub-line is really hard to do with the rest. Alice assumes they are just a Sci-Fi movie that she has long been seeing, which sounds like a reasonable explanation, but you feel there is a deeper meaning and a real connection to all the other events. Tension-based and stylish Italian movie fans can't afford to miss this movie. This is a psychological excursion by director Luigi Bazzon, with amazingly beautiful photography and mind-changing music. Despite the lack of violence (or maybe just because of it), the film is really distracting and the spiritual torment Alice honestly goes through the viewer emotionally. Because it's unfortunately too often in the Gialli cinema, the climax is suddenly quite steep and hardly provides a waterproof explanation of all the inconvenient events you saw in the last one and a half hours. However, the content of "footprints" keeps you thinking long after the end of the movie and its powerful effect only increases. Florinda Bolkan is sublime as a tortured leading lady and gets excellent feedback on limited supporting pain, including the young Nicoletta Elmi. The outstanding star of the euro coins, Klaus Kinski, also receives top-notch settlements, but its role is just an expanded cap. This movie is actually much better than Bazzon's more acclaimed (and much simpler) Giallo "Fifth Head", so here's the hope that "Footprints" will soon get a fancy DVD.
