15 Park Avenue, the name mystizes the beginning of New York's address and Kolkata film. But as the story emerges, it is understood that the thin line that the director is trying to achieve between the world of relationships, the social cause and, of course, schizophrenia. I would say that Aparna Sen is one of the directors who has so much to say and less time to use. He has undoubtedly managed to make a good film. In a sense, he makes us realize that each of us is probably looking for his “15 Park Avenue”. This is an endless search for each of us ... <br /> <br /> Shabana Azm's Christmas fight is a pendant to watch. The presence of his screen brings a lot of life to the scene. Indeed, it was surprising that we saw him so vigorously as I was expecting it to be all over the Konkona Seni landscape. Shabana makes you feel like an older sister's deep skin, who drives the whole show for a rather unfortunate family and during that time she forgets her life. She is burdening her 18-year-old sister (who is more of a daughter) with her ambitions and desires and an aging mother, played by veteran Waheeda Rehman. The guide of a leading actor (that is how I will immediately remind him) is hardly anything to say except for the few lines and tears that are here and there. Once trusted, Rahul Bose plays another central role in the film, demonstrating his medieval emotions to the fuller perfection of his face. This man amazes me with the variety of work he has done. Jhankar Beats from musician to liberal Muslim Mr. & Mr Iyeris and so many others? He's one of the most versatile I really want if he had another frame in the first part of the film. The film's cameraman is Shefali Shah (remember Satya and Monsoon Wedding). She really looks beautiful and really plays the role of the mother of 2 children. He gives you a look at a modern Indian woman who is modern but still ordinary when it comes to her husband's past relationships. <br /> <br /> The camera's focus has been Konhi's Meethi. He and his schizophrenic world are the core of 15 Park Avenue. He's really been involved with this character, but there are times when he can't communicate with the audience. His life's fatal accident attempts to entice sympathy and has only been partially successful. <br /> <br /> The film tries to deal with a number of things at one time, starting from the unique world of the disabled person to the unequal status of a woman, even in modern India, and in a twisted family in a split family. And I believe Aparna has succeeded to some extent. The helplessness of the action, when working as a journalist in the eastern part of the countryside, really gives us a naked picture of the country we are so proud of. <br /> <br /> Well, after I finished 15 Park Avenue, I was thirsty thirsty. I wanted more out of this movie to emotionally relieve me. This has been a laudable effort by the director, except for some hiccups. Must watch all those who want to see a different cinema, with a strong goal.
