It was the first Mickey Mouse comic and the first sound comic. Mickey does not use gloves yet. He's not talking yet. All he does is play whistle and music. The song he plays is "on the shoulders of Turkey", where several farm animals are used as musical instruments. For example, he plays cows teeth like a xylophone and pulls nursing piglets like an accordion keyboard. I put this copy out of the Disney channel and I think it's wonderful. It was based on a quiet film starring Buster Keaton titled "Steamboat Bill, Jr."
