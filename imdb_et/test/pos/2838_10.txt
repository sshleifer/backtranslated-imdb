After the sovereignty that is full of protection and disappointment, Sister Betty is the breath of fresh air. The film is like no other I've ever seen. Director Neil LaBute proves that he can direct more than disturbing images of men and women and how they approach sex (his previous two films were the Brilliant People Company and almost shine with your friends and neighbors). Renee Zellweger gives her career the best result as Betty, a waitress who, when she showed her asshole husband (LaBute's head Aaron Eckhart) brutal death and disappears into the fantasy world. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are playing men who killed their spouse and are now in trial. The trick of the movie is that Freeman and Zellweger are really parallel characters. While Zellweger falls in love with the beautiful and polite images of Dr. Dave Raven's soap opera, Idealizes Freeman Betty. Sister Betty is a brilliant film full of life, humor, love and graphic violence. My class: 10/10.
