Leos Carax has made 3 big films: boys meet girls, Mauvais Sang, Les Amants du Pont Neuf. In fact, these films were not so big, but they have youth violence, the beauty of the juvenile desert. In these three films, Carax was aware of what the cinema was, but he tried to make his vision of art without thinking of what he had seen, but used it and melted it in his times. Pola X is a very different film, because Carax made a film of Les Amants du Pont Neuf, a $ 20 million monster, all of which has been destroyed. You can't do the same after such a movie. So Leos Carax has to change and he did. The film is not as beautiful as her first, it is more reasonable, no more studio, no longer dreamed of Paris, Carax has reached the last reality. It's not clean anymore, it's not poetic characters. Carax has become romantic in German.
