If you liked Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, this is also an option. Although I think some British jokes (such as the two London characters Dixon and Winterburn, after Arsenal football players) may disappear for some, it is still entertainment that really pumps vitality. <br /> <br /> Carlyle, Miller and Tyler are all excellent, bringing the depth of your character and the interaction between the two main characters is always well appreciated. In fact, Scott's direction is very confident, because it is his first feature film and proves that he has his father's talent in an unfamiliar neighborhood, pampering us. <br /> <br /> Hell, I'm convinced myself. I see it again!
