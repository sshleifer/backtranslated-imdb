This almost perfect cinematic transfer of Edith Nesbit's popular children's novel follows the lives of Bobbie, Phyllis, Peter and their mothers after their father is wrongly accused of treason and sent to prison. Are they going to live on an almost uninhabitable land in a country near the railway line? Mom writes stories to make enough money for food and candles, while children spend much of their time around the train station and especially rolling on one particular train to "send their love to their father". <br /> <br /> It is always an inclusive and clever novel whose characters are here under the perceived direction of Lionel Jeffries (better known as the fine character actor). Jenny Agutter plays Bobbie, while Sally Thomsett and Gary Warren are her sister and brother. Their mother is Dinah Sheridan, while other memorable characters are played by Bernard Cribbins (Perks Rail Man) and William Mervyn (the old gentleman on the train). <br /> <br /> "Railway Children" is a gentle entertainment from another age, but it does its job beautifully. If we look at Bobbie's growing up with missing parenting concerns that encourage his needs both alone and for fun, we can only rejoice when events get together. Do we have the feeling of time and place? be it for steam trains, university paper guides, or red flannels (and used to prevent disasters) by girls.
