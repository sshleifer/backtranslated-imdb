While this episode was offensive to the Tourette Syndrome Society, others thought it was funny, while others thought it was a new season to start. <br /> <br /> This episode was funny and just shocking. South Park has made history the first episode with the most words, except when you read the episode of the movie. <br /> <br /> I liked the fun of Chris Hansen and his TV show to catch the Predator. I didn't like the idea of ​​how they thought Chris Hansen was going to make an exhibition and let the boy talk and talk to the Jews. One thing I did not like is how South Park thought that people with tournament syndrome would just be a bad language. I've seen people on the TV with Tourettes syndrome and they don't just disturb bad words. If I'm not wrong.
