Let's start with this point: it's not a movie for a common audience. Totally bizarre, somehow incomprehensible, totally unpredictable, it keeps you on the streets just by looking at the stones, trying to find out what happens next. If this in itself does not give you consent, this is a great movie, then go back to your "family" movies and forget about MOTORAMA. It is a material that can be considered a cult film, it can be placed in the same category as Cannes or other films winning intellectual film festivals, but unfortunately, Hollywood is not forgotten just because it is not commercial. The performance of young Jordanian Christopher Michael may not be an Oscar, but he will give the story correctly. Even the genre is hard to describe; It's not a comedy in the right sense, you don't know if you should laugh in strange situations where Gus is involved. It's an impossible adventure that some kids want, but don't let them watch it ... it's not a movie for kids. So, if you like Disney movies or are looking for a "Home Alone" style, then this is definitely not for you. But if you like reading Edgar Alan Poe or Tim Burton's works, you like Motorama. So, jump in your red Mustang, get a tattoo spell "Tora" and cruise to Strangeland with Gus. I would like this ...
