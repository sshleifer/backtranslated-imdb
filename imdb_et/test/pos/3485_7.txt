Thanks to its predictable secondary title (at least what it was distributed in Italy), this movie didn't expect much of it. I thought it would be another cheap ghost house ("LA CASA MALEDETTA" means "Cursed House"). Well, I had to change my thoughts just after the first glorious scene! The constant presence of the priest and the creepy atmosphere reminded me of The Exorcist and some of his decent Italians, but it was completely different ... It's more like Hitchcock meets with an Italian thriller! Very well written and guided, good actors, interesting plot ... OK, I've been trying not to spoil you from watching 7 Hyden Park, which I would recommend to everyone. <br /> <br /> P.S. Is it wrong, or when Joanna climbs or tries hard to stand (she is paralyzed below the waist), do the legs and feet move too much? (... And I'm not talking about a "bad dream".
