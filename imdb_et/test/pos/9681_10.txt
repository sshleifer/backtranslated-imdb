Family Guy has been so much fun for so long, but I feel like he lost his sharp and casual humor at the beginning of season 6. While I enjoyed Blue Harvest, it seemed that the rest of the episodes were "packings" - episodes where manufacturers made a small attempt to honor the reputation of the American Guy of America's social satire. <br /> <br /> I've seen all the 7th season episodes and I was totally surprised and happy that Family Guy has found his true colors again. The 7th season has many fantastic episodes and lots of fun about the current situation in America, which is what we need now - more fun. <br /> <br /> I feel that Simpsons have lost all the sparks together, this exhibition has made a terrible recovery to prove how perfect they can be. Great work!
