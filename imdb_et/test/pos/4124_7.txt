First, I'm a big Buddy Holly fan. I grew up knowing who he was, and I knew everything about a fateful plane ride that erased three such incredibly brilliant flames. But I've never heard my music. I had heard a lot about it, but not until I sat with the intention of getting out of it, so I really saw the real Buddy Holly. And let me tell you that my world is now different for him. <br /> <br /> Because of this incredible human respect, I bought the Buddy Holly story without seeing it before. I've torn the views of this movie. Perhaps this is because Buddy feels so alive that I just couldn't see Gary Busey in this role. I testify that he did a nice job, but his song was so forced. It seemed to me that he knew he didn't sound like Buddy himself, and he used too much energy to make a similar sound. He succeeded in some parts of the film. But others .. ouch. <br /> <br /> The film lasted for several years, but I think the portrayal of this period could have been much better. It was a difficult time for me to distinguish in which Buddy life certain events occurred. I also had a serious problem with some historical inaccuracy. I think the worst was depicting crickets. I understand how their real names cannot be used, and how there were only two in the film for simplification. And maybe it was good. Because the movie's backing track was steadfast and I didn't like how they were portrayed as an obstacle to Buddy's career. Something else that really didn't change the film but shook me was Gary Busey's teeth. They wore me out! Buddy Holly had much better teeth. I don't know why I noticed it .. but I did. <br /> <br /> I finish this review of what I felt was the best part of the movie: Buddy's last performance. His last phone call to Maria, the Big Bopper, to bring him and Richie Valens to the stage, followed by the end of the frame. It even amazed me and I feel that it shows the audience effectively how Buddy Holly was alive and energetic and that his flame was blinking. It was a beautiful way to imagine this horrible tragedy I think. <br /> <br /> Good movie, despite the obvious problems .. 7/10. <br /> <br /> Some obvious errors can use some of the works ... but not bad.
