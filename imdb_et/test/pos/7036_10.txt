I really don't know what this is about Dirty Dancing. In this film there is some absolute magic. I can't guess hundreds (yes, hundreds) of times I watched it, starting with the end. But every time I talk on television, I am entranced and mystified, and I sit down and there for two hours I love the movie the way I watch it for the first time. Although Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Gray hated each other while making this film, they also have a beautiful chemistry. It makes the viewer much more so to see this passion and commitment. Help a little bit at the end when Patrick comes to the Houseman family and says to his father, "No one's in the corner of the child". (classic moment) For all those people who believe that this movie is dirty and gentle, maybe as it is, but it was a thin 80s movie and put Patrick Swayze straight on the map; his performance was impeccable. <br /> <br /> Three joy to Dirty Dancing !! <br /> <br /> The Ps soundtrack is a fantastic, absolute masterpiece
