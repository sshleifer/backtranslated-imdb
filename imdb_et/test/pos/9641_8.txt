Robert Montgomery and Robert Young are outstanding as a young submarine duo placed in Italy during World War I. The dialogue is very fun, and Jimmy Durante is fun like a ship cook, "Ptomaine". The character of Walter Huston is inspiring as a captain of the submarine, an example of an officer and a gentleman. One of the most interesting aspects of this film was the level of technology displayed in the battle scenes. I was surprised by the similarity of the technology of World War I, which was displayed 25 years later in World War II. Human nature was considered very similar to modern times and far from the conservatism that I thought existed in the so-called innocent past. All in all, I felt the cast, the characters, the action scenes and the history depicted in this film were first-rate.
