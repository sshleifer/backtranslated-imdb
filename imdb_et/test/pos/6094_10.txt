For David Lea's best styles, this romantic love story overflows the screen with epic proportions equal to the large desert areas it is set against. It is a film that says that man does not choose love but rather that it is the love he chooses, regardless of who, where or when; and, moreover, it is a matter of heart that often depends on the prevailing conditions and circumstances. And so the situation of the "English patient", led by Anthony Minghella, is a story of two people who discover passion and true love in the most inappropriate places and times, proving that if it is predetermined, love will find its way. <br /> <br /> It's WWII; flying to the desert of Africa, Laszlo de Almasy (Ralph Fiennes) of Hungary, his biplane was wrong with the enemy plane. And while he is living in an accident, he is burning seriously. But for his great happiness, he rescues the tribal nomads and gets sick in the hospital. However, the existing conditions are governed by military circumstances, and Almasy will soon become one of many patients carried by convoy to another. When he arrives in Italy, he is too weak and ill to continue, and Canadian nurse Hana (Juliette Binoche), who is a volunteer to stay with her in an abandoned monastery. <br /> <br /> Hana will soon discover that her reward is something mysterious, because Almasy doesn't remember her past, not even her own name. It is thought that English is the only clue that refers to who it is contained in the book found in his possession after the crash, but even if they are as mysterious as the Hana patient. Still slowing down, Almasy slowly remembers the bits and pieces of his life and his story begins to open. And his memory is further enhanced by the mysterious stranger Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), who suspects that Almasy is the man he was looking for - the man with whom he wants to score. However, Almasy may be recognized but may not be the man. At the same time, Almasy's memories continue on the surface; the memories he loved, Katherine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas), as well as the memories of Katherine's wife Geoffrey (Colin Firth). And the spirits that are in mind and in the body, as it is, are the only thing that it can have any hope of, even if its life seems to go beyond every passing moment. <br /> <br In addition to leadership, Anthony Minghella also wrote the script that he adapted from Michael Ondaate's novel. The result is an epic saga featured in the tradition of Lean 'Doctor Zhivago' and 'Arabrence of Arabia'; a great movie that fills the screen and the senses with unprecedented size and beauty. Simply put, Minghella's film is brilliant; crafted and poetic perfection, looking at it as Monet's life. From the opening frame, Minghella gives her audience a hypnotic spell that is binding and transporting, a story that has an emotional beauty that equals John Seale's remarkably stunning cinematic animated and vibrant; pictures that fill both the screen and the viewer's soul. In every sense, it is a rare fiction film that has a striking emotional ability that facilitates a truly transcendental experience. With twelve categories, he earned a total of nine Oscars, including Best Picture, Director, Supporting Actor (Binoche) and Cinematography. <br /> <br /> If someone had to choose one word to describe "essentially" this film would be "top-notch". Even an extraordinary movie doesn't get nine Oscars without extraordinary performance; The presentations by Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas transcend the concept of "Oscar worth" here. The best actor for Almasy's portrayal (Geoffrey Rush got "Shine Gold"), Fiennes has never been better at achieving emotional depths of a character that is almost sensitive. Private and introspective, Almasy is not by nature a person to whom an audience can create an intimate connection; However, Fiennes feels that this emotional door just opens to hit you so you can taste the honest passion inside. And it works. Almasy doesn't catch your friendship; He also gets his compassion. <br /> <br /> Kristen Scott Thomas also received the Oscar nomination for Best Actor (Frances McDormand received Fargo Award) for depicting Katherine, a woman whose stoic face masquerades the emotional conflict inside her that was born forbidden by the passion that enslaves him, but to which he himself pleases, casting down his repressive wells to embrace such a strong love that he threatens to consume. Katherine's reserve must keep the audience's empathy, because Scott Thomas digs the emotional depths of his character as successfully as possible. This is a performance that pulls you in and keeps you fast, bringing you as it transcends the hypocrisy curtain that dictates what must be for the sake of performances and allows you to experience true unlimited passion. Always underrated and hidden by Kristin Scott Thomas. <br /> <br /> Binoche also provides stunning effects that also affect performance as a kind-hearted sister, Hana; it is in fact its humanity that defines love in the purest sense and offers a balanced perspective in the context of the film. His relationship with Kip (Naveen Andrews) gives us a glimpse of another kind of passion that is effectively at odds with the intensity between Almasy and Katherine. "English Patient" is a film that moves you and performs you emotionally; one that you don't want to see. 10/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
