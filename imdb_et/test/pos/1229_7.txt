In my opinion, management, editing, lighting and acting (minus Franco) were very good. I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised and impressed by this movie. I did not expect much, camera corners, sound, etc., but in these areas the film was not bad at all. <br /> <br /> After seeing the film, I was personally disappointed by both characters because I wanted these two characters to reach each other. And I felt that the nature of Travis (Franco) didn't affect or actually change after Terri's suicide. Although this is probably due to the fact that James Franco is unable to express emotions (of any kind) very well in this film. I've seen some of Franco's other movies and he just can't pull it out when the scene requires real emotions or facial expressions. The only positive thing he brings to the movie is the opportunity to watch this movie more. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Rachel Miner's portrayal of Terry is well done and she expects the future to be bright. I really saw and felt the character of sadness and emptiness and it made me feel like it. I just wish I could see more of Terri's life before the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> For short films, this film was good, but it will leave you with more desire. I wish it could have been a little longer to see how the characters develop a little more. Nevertheless, I hope to see more director and team films in the future. :)
