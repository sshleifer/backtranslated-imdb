I remember reading the original Balzac story in French in French. <br /> <br /> I remember Ken Nordine from WGN-TV in Chicago, reading it one of his late nights. <br /> <br /> You always loved the story, but never think they could make that movie. To my surprise they did very well and did it very well. <br /> <br /> Few Balzac's stories offer dramatization, which is unfortunate, and the lover that I am always hoping to be filmed without much Hollywood sex. This is as close as possible to perfect conversion. <br /> <br /> Mind theater is always better than what the eye can see, but it is as close as I think it can give the imagination a reality.
