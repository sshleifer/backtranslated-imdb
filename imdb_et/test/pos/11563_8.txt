Widely unknown strange little west with meaningful colors (probably the same material used in "Johnny Guitar", I think "Trucolor" or something that turns blood into dripping rubies), almost surreal scenes with twisted action and characters. Something different, not far from the masterpiece, but this little gem needs to be given more attention in Western encyclopaedias.
