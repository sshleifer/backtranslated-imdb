This is a cult film for many reasons. First of all, thanks to the phenomenal success of music on both Broadway and London, as a musical film. The film is close to the game and some of the provocation is no longer provocative twelve years later. The discourse against the Vietnam War is no longer a protest against war, but a strong song that shows how the young people of the late 60s were able to bring a political institution. Milos Forman plays some situations at the end of the 1970s, such as narrow-minded justice, rich or infant self-centered righteous justice, with only one power more than powerless. He also plays with the racial element and the sexual ambiguity he builds all the time. The film is pleasant and thoughtful. And, of course, it's a tremendous thrill to remember those years when we've had a privilege and it wasn't an opportunity to live them. On November 11, 1969, Nixon ordered a massive celebration of the 1918 truce, which at all levels prompted teachers to take their pupils to celebration and march, thus supporting the Cambodian invasion at full speed. And some dare to give lessons to democracy abroad. I also remember the long Nixon punishment campaign from 1973 to 1974, which ultimately leads to his resignation and the first Vice-President of the United States, Gerald Ford, who was not elected, because he named the Senate Vice-President after Spiro Agnew had to leave the trial, conviction and conviction. Of course, this is what makes us think today when the US President's people did not choose the Supreme Court, or the war that millions all over the world had rejected from the beginning and even before the beginning, and it started with a better decision by the United Nations and three permanent members of the Security Council. And some speak of a new world order based on respect for others. A modern western man seems to have some problems understanding that the world is changing and has already changed widely and wisely. A modern western person seems to be sort of non-synchronized and needs special evenings to find out that democracy wants most of the majority of the world to be the majority, and that it is the majority in the West, and that if the Soviet bloc could have realized that a market economy is not capitalism, but for a market economy to be either socialist or capitalist, the Berlin Wall would have fallen, but vice versa, and fortunately China has learned the lesson well and is at the foot of this wall. to climb to find out that their socialist market economy must lead to political democracy, but they, like Vietnam, were able to regain their aggression and damage after thirty years of brutal war. In other words, hair is ideal for thought. Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine, University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University of Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
