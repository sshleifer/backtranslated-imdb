I have great memories of watching "Robin of Sherwood" on television as a child (but I think for some reason I only saw Michael Praed episodes). And lately my brother bought the new released DVD boxes. It was nice to see it again and this is the best of all Robin Hood films and TV series. There's a lot of casting, and the places that mix with Clannad's music add that very special feeling. Personally, I think Praed is the best of two Robini, but Jason Connery was a great choice to continue the series. Ray Winstone, Nicolas Grace and Robert Addie have their roles in Will Scarlet, Nottingham Sheriff and Gisburne Guy. Unfortunately, the fourth season has never been done, and I have also heard that the writer Richard Carpenter was actually planning to make a series of follow-up feature films. Finally, Robert of Huntingdon (Connery) may marry Marion (Judi Trott) or maybe Herne Hunter may return Robin Loxley (Praed) and he may have received his sheriff. As mentioned earlier; if "Robin Hood: The Thince of the Prince of Thieves" had been smart, they would have been cast "Robin of Sherwood" and made the film a sort of queue. Since Ray Winstone puts this DVD bonus material, it would have been nice to see them as old as Sean Connery's "Robin and Marian". Who knows, maybe we will go further than the perfect interpretation of the legend in the future. In any case, we can now watch our favorite series over and over again!
