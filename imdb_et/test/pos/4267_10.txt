I watch tons of movies and I had no idea it was as good as it was. I was waiting for it after reading the plot (although I found Nirvana overrated). It sounded like it would be fun, but it was more. Jansen makes little touch like books (including Kubrick's book), film boards, etc. I like to see that the director takes the time and puts the movie in my heart. And you can really feel it. I have a lot of scenes and moments I love to try to think of some other movie and I'd say the only thing I think is Cameron Crowe movies. Takes a few moments and makes them eye-catching and special. The soundtrack is amazing and every song works great with movie scenes and feelings. This movie is amazingly captured and the editing is outstanding. I could really go about the movie. I can't really recommend it. If you want a fun story with great stories from the director who put his work into the heart, check it out.
