This is one of the most unusual plots I've seen in a horror movie, but it's based on good and solid fares at Universal Studios: a lot of monsters, a pretty heroine, a villain with torches. But my favorite thing is Larry Talbot (huntmees), who is looking for treatment for lantanthropia. After his death in the original "Wolf Man" he has resurrected and travels through "Frankenstein meets a wolf" and "Frankenstein House" looking for a way to end his affliction. I think first-time viewers will find their search in this movie very interesting. <br /> <br />
