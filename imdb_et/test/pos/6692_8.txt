K-PAX is exactly what should be the heart warming film. The story is a mysterious mental patient Prot played by Kevin Spacey and his incredible psychiatrist Dr Powel, played by Jeff Bridges. Both have a very friendly relationship and their relationship is growing Dr Powel can't help but know if his mysterious patient has more or not who demands that he come from another planet called K-PAX. This movie is very funny and Kevin Spacey pulls a well-placed one liner as if it were his second character. K-PAX is a smart movie and I don't expect it to go where it did. Finally, I found myself thinking about small things in life, and the everyday life that we so often take for granted, miracle and magic. I left the theater with a warm fuzzy feeling inside and the date for families and couples is a great movie that doesn't disappoint. I recommend this film to anyone who is interested in anything more than the monotonous extracts of shiny, rubbing, gore-fest.
