When I sat down, I saw a sort of stylish language-in-cheek film that was designed by trailers. However, it was very soon that this film was trying to be more. <br /> <br /> Usually movies that try to entertain in so many possible ways are not approved. For example, this film tries to mix up comedy, romance, lightness and sharpness at once. In most cases, this approach does not work in films (see Batman Forever), but I was pleasantly surprised to see that in that case they pulled it away. <br /> <br /> The end result is a very entertaining movie that should appeal to the most mature filmmakers. (But the weakness of the stomach should indeed be warned for one or two scenes.) Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller pull out a brilliant double act and Ken Stott makes an excellent villain. It mixes with great costumes and some decent scenes that make it a very pleasant watch. <br /> <br /> But for me, this great redemption is that "gentleman Highwayman" was a real chance to have a good dialogue, but the script was definitely lacking punchiness and a little stomach laughs. Okay, so the lines weren't terrible, but for me this brought up a problem with recent British films; ignoring some remarkable exceptions, today 's scenarios are relatively modest compared to Hollywood' s efforts.
