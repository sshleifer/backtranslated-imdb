I saw this title again on Shemaroo. I also asked my nephew, who was 17 years old, to look at me the same. I'm 35 years old and she's 17. She liked it and me too. It's still funny, a bit childish, but still very clean. Satish Shah is fun in many roles. This sitcom would still be better than many of the latest TV shows. But obviously, some people are obviously the daily fares that come out today. It would have been nice for Shafi Inamdar to continue all seasons. He's no longer alive. I would like someone to list all the episodes here. <br /> <br /> If you can't forget the lines "Yeh Kya Ho Money HA" "What relief" "Kaat Daalu boss" "Vyavhaar shark Vyavhaar" "30 years Ka Experience hai" <br /> <br /> and title track Yeh Jo Hai Zindag, teaching us to live as it is and enjoy it. The lives of ordinary people. <br /> <br /> I like this sitcom. it may not be funny at times, but some episodes are still fun.
