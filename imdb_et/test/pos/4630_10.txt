I think this movie must be one of the most mobile and heartbreaking films of recent times. <br /> <br /> The film starts with a suicide basin. U doesn't see who it is, then it goes to the beginning of the day and we get to know 6 characters and they go through some pretty hard things, but eventually one of them suicides. /> <br /> I've been teaching physical education in schools for 8 years, and I've never seen such a precise picture of what "really" goes into school life. <br /> <br /> The film strikes beautifully and sounds incredible. <br /> <br /> The end is so shocking and so unexpected it is something that haunts me in days. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one to watch. <br /> <br /> I think that the fact that the director / writer was only in school a few years ago is an important factor in expressing the honesty of the raw material in the film. <br /> <br /> The movie is recorded in two different modes if you like. First of all, there is a smooth style of observation where we know the symbols in their school environment as they pass through their drama, but the stunning part of the film is in interviews where we know the characters and their deeper and darker thoughts. <br /> <br /> You don't know who it will be (who commits suicide) and if the drama happens, you will continue to change your mind until you beat it, it will hit you in five minutes. I'm all over my writing place, but I saw it in the media in Australia, and I'm still a little shocked. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best Australian films I've seen in recent years.
