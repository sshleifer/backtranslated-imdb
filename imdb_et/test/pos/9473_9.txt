I took my 11-year-old daughter and 8-year-old son to this movie, and I don't remember a movie where I smiled so hard - literally loud, deep laughs, because this movie is fun. The story is predictable, but the ride is so enjoyable that it's not important that you know how it ends. The comic timing of the actors was impeccable. The participants were completely cast. My children mentioned that Amanda Bynes seems to be the last young actress who does not destroy her life. She's so refreshing. My kids said this is now their favorite 2006 film. Our money was well spent on this film.
