Du rififi chez les hommes is a brilliant film that explores criminals and allows viewers to better understand criminals who basically do not differ from ordinary people like us. For them, the family consists not only of women, lovers and children, but also of casual acquaintances and close friends. Contrary to what many find it hard to believe, Jules Dassin has not tried to rape off his film. It is clear that any kind of bad action leads to some kind of loss of life. Regardless of this philosophical point of view, Rifif is worth a look at its technical finesse. it would be hard to believe in the carefulness with which criminal minds fulfill their plans. This is a scene that nobody has dared to copy in Hollywood.
