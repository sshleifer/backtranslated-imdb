I enjoyed the movie and the story tremendously! I have seen the original (I believe in 1939) and enjoyed both of them. To really appreciate the story, you need to know English and practice. Prof. (Peter O'Toole) was dedicated to his school and "boys" at this school. It was an English "public" school, which we call private school in the USA (E.G. Andover). He is a very assertive person and sees the surface as rigid, tired, infertile and weak to be feminine. She is strict in her educational standards because she takes care of "her boys", ie she doesn't want them to have cheap or weak education. He meets (in the introduction) with a "ballroom girl" (Petula Clark) and is completely beaten. At that time, in England, the reference to the "dance hall" was a connotation of extreme sexual promise and was certainly a "lower class". We find that Prof. is actually a very harsh and courageous person and loyal to the people and institutions that he loves and / or respects. Clark becomes more than a lover and husband ... he "jumps" his personality and allows him to grow as a man and a man, much for his beloved school and for his happiness. The first film was set before World War II, it goes through World War II, it is also in 1969 (we have had "British invasion" ... beetles, etc. to me), music is great, color and photography are excellent. I think O'Toole played the character perfectly! There are dedicated people like "chips" ... around us, but many don't appreciate it. Very enjoyable movie and story!
