I have not seen for a long time a movie that moved me and grabs me in this way; I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I finished it; and I didn't even want to stop it because I was pulled. Emotive; powerful; very moving; terrible and heart-breaking. It gives you an amazing overview of South Africa; their struggles and life. The action of the leaders was peace of mind and the script was incredible. Despite the terrible events and the horrible events of this film; I was fascinated. I don't even want to try and explain the story; it is too complicated and I do not make it fair. Please look at it; you understand why when you do. Cheers, Hol
