The story of this movie is a rather unreliable class B stuff, but the script called for leadership and in 1940 it meant Peter Lorre. And Peter is at that age with Stephen Danel, the owner of his island, who is under prison custody to work on his island's diamond mine. Upon arrival, passwords will discover that they are slave miners who can be beaten or killed by Danel's whim. <br /> <br /> Only two things seem to be worse than slaves; Danel's wife and monkeys. Monkeys mark him so much that his violence against them is likely to lead to the only meat that slaves get. <br /> <br /> Lorre is perfect here and climbs the industrial strength of the screen. Although the script is not a caliber of Casablanca, editing is very tight and there are no scenes to wear. This is a very traceable story, but I'm not sure what niche the film was performing. For too long a short topic and too short for a feature film, I'm not sure how it was marketed in theaters. <br /> <br /> I got it for the first time late in the night / early in the morning TCM shows. Lorre fans don't want to miss it if they haven't seen it.
