Like most sports movies that have come out in the past, this movie is similar to that based on fact. What he puts on this film is that it is related to a rugby team, a sport that not many Americans know. Set it aside, this movie is a very rewarding film noir. It reminds me of "We are Marshall," but with less budget and independent film knowledge. Its leader, Ryan Little, tried to bring us a story of a rebellious teenager played by Sean Farris (never back down), like Rick Penning, who finds himself in an odd place, both in the field and out. Despite some hole in the plot line, this film has a heart that is rewarded with good character viewers. There are also good productions, supporting actors as Gary Cole coach Larry Gelwix & Neal McDonough as coach Penning (Ricks father). I felt like I was going through a lot of different emotions, watching the movie, finally, I had faith in humanity and hope for my children in the future, especially if there were coaches like Gelwix.
