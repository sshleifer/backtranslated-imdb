I love meatballs! Stigma and terrible situations make it very expensive. Bill Murray is hysterical and you have to love this 4-mile trail. A classic class and one of my favorites now for about 20 years. It brings back the memorable memories of the camp and works well with the experience of rejection of foolish peers, and empowerment led to the compassionate rescue of the adult. A large number of liners and quite a large number of wacko advisers. This is a movie that repeatedly repeats important phrases among friends. There is also nothing open to crude oil and what a lovely late 70's soundtrack to bring just the right amount of nostalgia. I can't say enough about meatballs; it's classic. Be careful! All queues are dirty stink bombs that simply bought the name rights for marketing. They're not related to Ivan Reitman's masterpiece.
