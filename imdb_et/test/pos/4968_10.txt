The film Jennifer with East Lupino and Howard Duff is a film noir-beauty. This is mostly an unfamiliar film that all film-fan fans should see. Jennifer was filmed with the most unusual camera angle of that time, which sometimes made the film surreal. I love tough black and white film noir movies.Film noir color is not so good.Made and script is great.Oline horrible music is fun to listen.Id Lupino is one of the best and most talented actors ever with grace on the screen. It wasn't just breathtakingly beautiful, he was a good actor. The first film I remember seeing East Lupino in was Roadhouse with Richard Widmark and Cornel Wilde I never forgot this movie ever. I saw his latest films like foods from gods and women in chains, and although the films were not his usual prices, he was still a cheerful actor. He is always horrible. I recommend this masterpiece very much. I have this movie VHS tape.
