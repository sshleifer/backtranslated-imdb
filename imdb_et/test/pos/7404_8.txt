Sometimes good things happen randomly. <br /> <br /> I've never heard of "Silverwing" until the end of 2005 - I was in the channels and it happened that I saw something from Toon Disney bats by bats attacked by owls. I had no idea what it was, but I was motivated to stay tuned - it was hard to wait for the trade to find out what it was called! <br /> <br /> Part of what I was interested in was the appearance of bats - first they didn't use popular conciliation to give bats "extra fingers" where their thumb nails should be. Rather, they have palms like human hands, but their fingers are longer and have skin nets between them. <br /> <br /> Faces - they look like people (in fact, at one point, I was wondering if they had ever been human but became INTO bats). It doesn't usually like cartoon animals, but it worked here - the story is a human story, although it's about bats and other animals (unlike Lion King). <br /> <br /> What I saw on TV "The last two parts of trilogy". I stayed at the beginning of the first, "Lighthouses" (second overall), but I saw most of them all. But I found that I wanted to understand what was happening, because the first part was not and I would not have caught it. <br /> <br /> But I saw it based on the book by Kenneth Oppel. How lucky I paid attention and wrote it down - I was very disappointed when I found out that the WASN '' '' U'E is available! It wasn't even that recently that it made sense that it was not yet available. <br /> <br /> But I found not only the book Silverwing, but also two sequences of Sunwing and Firewing. When I read the first book, I thought, "Is that?" Not only because a lot of what is not in the series is not in this book, but even if I hadn't seen the animated version, the book does not stop Silverwing (otherwise good story) as it stops. Only one open end is connected - Shade and Marina meet Hibernaculum Silverwing colony. <br /> <br /> In fact, Silverwing and Sunwing would have had to (in my opinion) have to publish in one volume, because they make a complete story, but not separately. <br /> <br /> In fact, the animated version of Sunwing takes some of the elements (eg, in Orestes, lifting the ban on seeing the sun) and some were completely original. It's not perfect, but it's definitely very enjoyable. I like both versions of Silverwing Saga. <br /> <br /> What is the reason I am glad that it is finally available in June. It was a long time, and it's worth the wait.
