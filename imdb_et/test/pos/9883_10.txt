This movie has expensive irony, shaggy-dog roundabouts, woven with fine cultural references, classical parallel, rich masterful use of rich color and a fabulous scene a'la Keystone Cops. The work of the cast and the whole team is charming. Literally. How else can I go on? <br /> <br /> This movie is for everyone. Dirty and embarrassing use of so many universal archetypes: it makes this movie so satisfying. <br /> <br /> As a mature film student, I find Checking Out to contain all the essential elements. Of course, Bergorra, it is not GOD but would be a perfect follow-up; A tragedy is a Satyr game that binds our collective ulcers fun. <br /> <br /> Get to the theater and watch this movie, you will be treated with a unique masterpiece.
