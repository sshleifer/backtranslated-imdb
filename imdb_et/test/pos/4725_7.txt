Patricia Arquette plays American physician Laura Bowman, who takes a break in Burma, trying to heal her spirit for her husband and son. He is left in Rangoon during a military crisis and leaves the city with an aging man working as a "guide." But he is not a simple guide; he is a professor who introduces him outside the trap of tourists ... these two remain a political upheaval and Laura sees with his eyes how the government is betraying its people and oppressing it. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of my favorites because of its themes. First, it is informative (describes some of the injustices in Burma). Secondly, it's about a woman's struggle to find the meaning of life after an incredible loss. Third, it is compassion and sacrifice, and people who come together - without knowing each other - to endure pain and fear. <br /> <br /> Almost every beautiful scene in this movie is important; nothing is wasted here. It's a serious and moving film. Hans Zimmer has also created a very emotional score that complements the scenes nicely. <br /> <br /> A definite recommendation, especially for people who are related to human rights ... and people who want to know, "For what purpose can I earn?" <br /> <br />
