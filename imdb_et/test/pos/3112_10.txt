Finally, I got my DVD today, I looked at it and I'm happy to announce that it's the original version of the movie. As you might have read from "Rich and Famous" from previous reviews, editing a TV version of a movie that somehow made it to the VHS in the late 90s, but now WB has fixed this bug and released it with a toilet toilet, Matt Lattanzi bare butt and scene in a hotel room where Liz (Jacqueline Bisset) calls Merry (Candice Bergen) C ** t! It's all there and looks better than ever! Dirty clear digital transmission, widescreen and special features that include an original theater trailer and a vintage 1981 presentation called "Location for the Rich and Famous", with interviews and directors. If you love this movie, I don't have to be disappointed with buying this DVD. Glad to finally have this DVD? Worth waiting! Thank you to Warner Bros!
