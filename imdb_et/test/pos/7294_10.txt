This is a very unusual movie that starts with a rich guy, getting a brand new sports car to finish, and decides with a spin in a local town. A rich boy meets a poor girl at Mabels Diner who is a waitress and a local boyfriend gets very upset and the fight begins. There's a chase of the car and any problems seem to be happening, and Rich Boy and the Poor Boy complete the community service ordered by the city judge. The rich boy and the poor boy just can't get along and Rich Boy runs the heart and soul of the poor boy's girlfriend. There are many walks and quotes in the forest and some very deep thoughts about life. The poor girl says, "Some people go through life and never find love, I can say I found love and hold it". If you are sensitive, you need some tissues, there are many romantic scenes, and I doubt very much if you think this picture will end. The producer and the director came up with a good idea and an end to the film. If you like poems with poetry and very sensitive topics, this is your movie.
