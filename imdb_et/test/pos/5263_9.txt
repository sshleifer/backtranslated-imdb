Most of the comments have been nailed so far. Viewers and three-person IQs under the "age-specific" should avoid a "potential lifetime" like a person appointed by George W.Bush, who faces a barbecue in Congress. <br /> <br /> There are mostly veterans who know the way around a well-written script. Is the presumption wildly original? No, but the movie is in the middle of the night beacon among current and endless movies / TVs, adapted to the demographics of the most desirable young and young adults. <br /> <br /> Betty White and Leslie Neilsen have a leading position, including cast veterans like Elaine Stritch and William Windom. Sharp dialogues offer these profiles effortlessly and efficiently. <br /> <br /> "Probable Life" is definitely not a movie for Will Ferrell / Adam Sandler / "Saw" sloher gore-fests, "American Eye Boring," and ninety percent of the rest of the sediment out of Hollywood and TV.
