I like Breillat movies, but it's the best I've ever seen to balance animal heat with sexual intelligence. Anne Parillaud is electric and the script is amazing - especially considering that it should be with another Breillat movie. You don't have to agree with him to take everything out to get out of it. It made me think about vulnerability and power. Try to imagine Jeanne's open-minded male director - not impossible but with little entertainment. The unpredictable sexual undercuts that are always there when people come together are a bright light, but not a cold light.
