This movie is great. The passion between Jade & Billy is memorable and the actor was great, so you won't miss a 16-year-old and young man alone! This shows why a single mother should not tolerate a younger man who has an older teenage daughter because she seemed young enough to be Jessy's son. <br /> <br /> I give him ten out of ten, the actor was wonderful and the movements between the actors were right. <br /> <br /> The age difference between Jenny and Robi was also good because they were similar in age. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a fun movie, but I think someone under the age of 13 shouldn't watch this movie because of sexual scenes.
