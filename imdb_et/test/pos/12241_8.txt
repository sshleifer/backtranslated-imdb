Or not. No matter who thinks of "Broadcast News", good or bad, almost all of this "thinking" is written by the writer-producer-director James L. Brooks. As a scriptwriter (of which he has long been one of the best), it is not easy to afforest the entire company - in this case "business" is television news - but with a smile, familiar and laugh at virtually every step. In order to do everything that takes real talent, Mr J. Brooks has a lot. <br /> <br /> One user on this website asked a musical question in their summary - "Did Walter Cronkite do that?" Answer: No! Of course not! And this is due to Walter Cronkite's day, the only thing that was important to bring news to people. The same applies to John Chancellor and Chet and David and Douglas Edwards and Howard K. Smith. Of course, they had to pay their estimates to the lips service if they only wanted their superiors. But everything they really took care of was news. <br /> <br /> Now, of course, everything that has changed. In the last 25-30 years, the only thing in the network news area that really matters is ratings, ratings, ratings. Bottom row. How many dollars do our news agencies network? Don't believe it? <br /> <br /> Let's see "The Big Three": Tom Brokaw, Dan Rather and Peter Jennings (aka "Stanley Stunning"). All three have been in their respective anchors for the past 15-20 years (Peter received his first picture of the national anchor post in the 1960s but was fully operational). Three of them are Dan, who has the biggest training training as a reporter. Personally, I think all three are doing terrible work as news anchors and deserve their views. They all have nothing to do with why all three are actually in these jobs. All three are now in their 60s (Dan pushes the big 7-0) and all three are still very good. And if you think they're still looking good, imagine how good their 40's were when all three were hired (say, "put") their current jobs. But do you believe that any of these three would be "put" when he saw, say, Fred Gwynne ("Herman Munster"). Or, like - the sky can't do - ME !!! Not only that, when Dan retired tomorrow, the younger (if he is today) Walter Cronkite would not be able to get his old job back. Why? Not quite enough. And it wouldn't be important for him to have or would have been "the most reliable man in America." <br /> <br /> And that's "Broadcast News." Tom Grunnick (William Hurt), the next real-boy-national-news-anchor who has problems with some minor things, such as thinking for himself, writing skills, and knowing. Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), a great news producer with news business standards and ethics, all thrown into the wind when she goes to the beautiful boy Tom. And Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks, has no connection with James L.), a top-notch reporter and field reporter who has no hope of national work because he "jumps sweat" behind the anchor. And many other such flawed characters that YOU did have in the news sections of different networks. <br /> <br /> "Network" created a path. Eleven years later, Broadcast News carried a torch as a worthy successor. In the new millennium, what will be the next film that will seduce the "news you can use" network ...... Or not.
