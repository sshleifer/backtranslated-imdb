This is one of those films that is very underestimated. Again, I vote for an underrated movie. This movie has a good story, maybe a little far away, but it can happen. Sean Astin (one of my favorite actresses) again shows us good results. The man does a great job, but he never appreciates his role. He has done good after the gonics. Not only her, but Louis Gosset JR. doing expansion. I thought this movie would have earned more money in theaters, but nevertheless cares for money. All this is a good movie that is at your place at times and the plot keeps the movie itself. I liked this movie and hopefully the rest.
