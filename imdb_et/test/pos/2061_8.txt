"The Long Kiss Goodnight" is an enjoyable and very cool action slide and a career breakthrough for Geena Davis. The plot is very familiar to Bourne's identity, but what then. Fighting scenes are a real treat for the eyes and the plotline is strong enough to keep you working for 2 hours. <br /> <br /> It is aimed at the slippery style and avoids most of the action clich√©s. Geena Davis is a big horse and gets her usual "good wife" role. Samuel L. Jackson is a regular player. The baddie movie is too cheesy and you can tell what happens to her. <br /> <br /> It breaks from a conventional grinder handler such as Commando and On Deadly Ground and is definitely one of the best makers of years. Good fun and good popcorn entertainment. 7.4 / 10.
