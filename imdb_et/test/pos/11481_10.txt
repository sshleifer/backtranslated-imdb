In America, the video "Cartoon Scandals", which was for about an hour worth of cartoons, was named. <br /> <br /> Most of them were World War II. Then I saw this first (and heard) of it. <br /> <br /> With the news that opens, a cock of bunches with an Asian face that says "cock-a-doodle-doo please." After that, eight minutes of propaganda was played as a newspaper. <br /> <br /> Stubbornly racist, but if you look at it as history, it can (and should) forgive. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Show Roman ruins by calling Moussolini 'Ruin # 1. <br /> <br /> Miner who uses broom. <br /> <br /> Manned bomb with a pilot who says, "HERE TO WORK." <br /> <br /> And of course stereotypes. Drawing of every Japanese language with large teeth, constantly worshiping and saying "please" at the end of each broken sentence. <br /> <br /> More fun a bit? The air attack siren, which was two worshiping men, worshiped each other with pliers. "oooo-OOOOOO" <br /> <br /> Hi AOL. Get it out. This is worth noting. My wife laughed at it. And she's 100% Japanese.
