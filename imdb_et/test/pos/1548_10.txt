Ken Loach showed the world Swinging London a "Poor Cow", a London wife Joy (Carol White) who had been exposed to theft and had a son together to see the man arrive at the slammer. Although his friend (Terence Stamp) manages to help him somewhat, he is a little better than loser. It will soon be clear to Joy that he has to make a serious decision about where he is going in his life. <br /> <br /> One thing I decided - I don't know if it's right or not. was the use of irony in the film. His name is Joy, but he does not live in joy. Even if it was not meant to be, it is still a movie that I recommend to everyone. Donovan's songs (one of which - "The Colors") appeared in another Terence Stamp movie: "The Limey" (which, incidentally, appeared in 1999 when I was as old as my parents when "Poor Cow" appeared)).
