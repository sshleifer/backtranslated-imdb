Kevin Tenney's "Night of Demons" is an enjoyable horror film that reminds me of "Evil Dead". At Hallow night, the group throws the teenagers in Hull's house, an abandoned funeral home on the outskirts of the city. Under Angela's leadership, they fill a seance-like ceremony and wake up accidentally with the evil spirit that lives in the place. One, uninvited by evil power, is a teenager, making them blood-sensitive demons. "The Night of the Demons" is the perfect horror movie. It is scary, gory and pretty atmosphere. The characters are well developed and Steve Johnson's gore is pretty good. It is frightening, biting the tongue, fingers coming into the eye sockets, and so on. where Suzanne (Linnea Quigley) pulls her nipple through lipstick, is a hoot. Turn it out.
