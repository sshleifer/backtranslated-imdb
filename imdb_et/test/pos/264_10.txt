Rentis rented it from my local place because it was the only new British movie available this week. Never heard of the filmmaker before or other films (thanks to IMDB). About a while, a good young British comedy did not mean Hugh Grant nor forty. The story is a moral story, but never preaching, young and fresh face painfully enjoyable. Luke Goss's firefighter was surprisingly great, but then he surprised me with the great Blade performance. Loved the classification of colors, especially in the nightclub. Great music and a truly original voice at work. Nine out of ten and pay the rent.
