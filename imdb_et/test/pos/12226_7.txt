This is one of the best sci-fi series. This includes character development, some really tense moments and sensible episode scripts. As another commentator said here, it seemed to be a mini-series, not an inflatable series of fill episodes and small budgets. <br /> <br /> The problem of the exhibition, which is briefly the Godzilla series. It is that it started with too big, incredible monsters, fantastic science, then everything was boiled down to the local Americans who did things. Then the show ended too soon because the Olympics came and hey! The sci-fi show is a sci-fi show, but half-naked athletes who are rushing around are far more important. So they did just 15 episodes instead of the 22 expected. The viewers were also small because people didn't get it at 20:00. Finally the suits did it. Trust your marketing plan to destroy everything that looks remotely original and promising. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: You have a good special effect exhibition, things like big monsters who kill people or destroy boats, then enter genetic engineering, transform people, human clones, end of the world, tsunamis. Also, the only fillers are aggressive redneckers or other annoying people who are killed for their stupidity. The bottom side is that after the 15 episodes that make something huge, the show ends. There is no real end, no closing, but a dense taste of footwear, as if you were just swallowing a suit.
