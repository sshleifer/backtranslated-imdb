wow! it's even better than I expected! best animated film Astérix ever! and it seems so good to hear that Roger Carel is making Astérix's voice again! I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes the Astérix comic book! but i suggest you go to the french version because it is definitely the best and you will hear the original! Did you know that Roger Carel has been playing Astérix for nearly forty years? I think he did a great job! and Céline Dion's song finally ends until the end of the rally! the music is good, the drawings are good, the actors are wonderful ... said: masterpiece! go see it! you will not regret it!
