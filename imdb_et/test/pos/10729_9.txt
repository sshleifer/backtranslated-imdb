Films usually stay away from domestic drama and for good reasons: who wants to look for a fun story about what they or their loved ones have to do in real life? Divorce hurts an unbelievable percentage of all classes of American families, and battles in custody are its ugly and necessary parts. It's not escapism - the number that the average person turns to movies - it's a sad reality. Usually divorce or detention is simply part of a larger story and affects how we understand it or associate it with the characters. "Kramer vs. Kramer" focuses on it and asks us to understand why we do it and why it bothers it. This is a challenge for both this film and the audience: to turn something so real that can attract our attention and then we will not feel bad when the mirror is on our face. The writer / director Robert Benton will certainly and impressively achieve the adaptation of Avery Corman's novel. <br /> <br /> The story, as one would expect, is quite simple: the big business advertizing Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) comes home to find his wife Joanna (Meryl Streep) and his 7-year-old son Billy (Justin Henry) . Then Ted must quickly learn to be an active father in the lives of the boys and as soon as he does, Joanna brings her custody. <br /> <br /> The Oscar winning drama making something like this general and especially dialogue-difficult first takes a huge act of talent. You can't do much better than Hoffman and Streep. Hoffman has a role to play in this role: his first Oscar won three other significant candidates. He creates a profound character whose self-centered and accelerated ways change clearly when he learns to be a better father and the only carer. Streep only wins his first Oscars as his second career as a woman who does not have much screen time, but has to report his or her internal torture to his / her decision to leave and to renew his / her identity. Streep does it easily. The young boy, Justin Henry, who at his age was the youngest competitive category in the Academy Awards history, plays an exceptionally well-established role in the embodiment of all 7-year-old children. <br /> <br /> The writing and direction of Benton takes these performances to the level where we see the deeper concerns of this family when we make and think about our own thoughts about loving and raising a family. Benton's earlier major credits ("Bonnie & Clyde" and "Superman") do not mean a strong command of family drama, but a man can write. Numerous scenes give us a strong visualization that shows us much more than typical family scenarios. The first morning when Joanna has disappeared and Ted's Billy French toast is a classic that perfectly demonstrates all the talents involved in this film, which take place every morning in American kitchens. <br /> <br /> You rarely look at the story as simple as "Kramer vs Kramer" better. At the end, there are no surprises or turns that keep us desperately glued to the screen. The film must then rely on its talents and they are all confident in offering a new understanding of such a familiar topic.
