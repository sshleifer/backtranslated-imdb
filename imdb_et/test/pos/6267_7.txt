A very cute movie about a young Chinese man who loved Western technology, and an English speaker trying to show his success in China. This is a very interesting story, probably based on real events, although I expect it to be more fantasy than real. It has the quality of a fairy tale you normally get in real life, and it has also received 8 people for a credit for the script, so they have to be on the right and on the left. <br /> <br /> This is a very nice movie, it goes on to tell if the magic movie was for people who didn't see it before. This is not a particularly profound film that briefly touches upon the disappearance of traditions and the penetration of western culture, but is mainly a pleasant little film. This is actually a movie that I enjoyed very much, which I have seen since 15 minutes after that. White as a souffl√©, but I enjoyed every minute.
