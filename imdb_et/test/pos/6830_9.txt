The film was good. Indeed, the only reason I watched it was Alan Rickman. What he does not pull the southern accent, but he did it quite well.How did Emma Thompson really did when she really pulled out of the southern accent. I like all the character that I think is not one of those bad things, the other thing I have to notice. I have read all of these comments and no person commented on Alan 5 0 'shadow. It made her look even better and she had quite a lot of movies. I'd give a movie out of 10 out of 10. My second opinion is that the film would be better if there was no sex. However, it was fine. Love the scene when he says "Aw sh * t" when he puts it in his car and sees them in his mirror.
