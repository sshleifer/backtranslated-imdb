The Eagle wing is a pleasant surprise to the film and keeps the viewer interested. I didn't know anything about the British doing it before I read other viewer comments. I understand why he won the cinematic prize because it was superbly presented and must be great on the big screen. <br /> <br /> It seemed much more realistic than most Western countries, imagining how the West had really won. In addition to how complex the characters are. The Indian-Sam Waterson character is particularly intriguing. He seems to be brutal in a wild environment, but he has considerable respect for the white men and women he meets. He is neither friendly nor sensitive to these intruders in his own countries, but has a restriction on his revenge, even on compassion when he is in power and watches for a revolting white man, as well as a girl he rob after capturing stagecoach. As such, his character seems to be complex, but similar to the harsh lands he lived and threatened by those invaders who are not heartless in their interaction. <br /> <br /> The great horse he is driving is a critical link and it is interesting to note how India handles it, compared to Martin Sheen's character, who has it in his possession and power for a while. The "Eagle Wing" is an unusual western genre that I do not pull, but I appreciate this great offer, which I would only appreciate for the "Man called horse".
