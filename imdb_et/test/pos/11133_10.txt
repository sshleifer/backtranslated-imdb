"Celebrity" (1980) is great. It has all the features that made the films so big at the end of the 70s. It is proud of its directness and it is not ashamed that it is up. <br /> <br /> What's really here is a trip, not a destination. Unknown idiots with soap opera thinking will never realize that "fame" is the struggle, concern and triumph of their youth, not their career. "Celebrity" did it in Hollywood. "Celebrity" marked the end of the era. The end of artistic freedom and experimentation and the beginning of commercialization and political correctness. This is the last generation's statement that had its own voice. <br /> <br /> 10/10
