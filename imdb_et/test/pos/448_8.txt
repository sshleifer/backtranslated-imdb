Anatole Litvak directed the 1959 film "The Journey" starring Yul Brynner, Deborah Kerr, Robert Morley, E.G. Marshall, Anne Jackson and Jason Robards. <br /> <br /> The film takes place during the Hungarian uprising of 1956 and concerns a group of passengers who have problems with the way out of the political problems of this part of the world. They are put on a bus to Vienna, but the Russians, led by Major Surov (Brynner), seize their passports and keep them for questioning. One of the passengers is Paul Fleming (Robards), who is an American but actually a Hungarian freedom fighter, whose main religions are removed from Hungary. In fact, Lady Ashmore (Kerr) hides her. She will be the center of the main romantic attention. <br /> <br /> A very good film that gives tension and effort to the Cold War and all the performances are wonderful. Brynner is especially good as a passionate Major who is not all bad, and Anne Jackson gives a realistic and powerful report to a pregnant woman who doesn't want her child to be born in a communist country. script, good director, good cast - such movies should be more. Highly recommended.
