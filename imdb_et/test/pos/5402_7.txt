so. I was totally in love with this movie. Gaga for that, even if all this plot twisted ... but one thing I really bothered was the relationship between the two best friends in Timis and Kyle. When a film writer gave us two poisonous moments between them, and their sexual experimentation / confusion, he gives us a twist of plots that makes them half-brothers?!?! (Although the subject has not grown up in the film ... and remained inexplicable and ignored), I thought it was a bad taste and the fact that it was not even discussed is even worse. (Sorry, we've created a taboo ... now it's not working on this situation because it wouldn't be P.C.) Otherwise, a remarkable movie
