First there is no story on this film. It is obvious that during the production there were many transcriptions - sometimes the characters refer to an impossible schedule and this is probably because the timeline of the whole story has never been known to anyone. <br /> <br /> said the movie is brilliant. Pfeiffer is amazing - and I mean amazing when Catwoman; He extends the character of sexual darkness and good / bad trends. Walken is Walken - but even more disgusting than usual. Devito is not related to the comic book Penguin, but he is good and memorable. <br /> <br /> Keaton is underestimated as Batman. <br /> <br /> And music and style are pure cinema excitement. True, the third operation does not work. But the last 2 scenes are falling out and it is clear that Pfeiffer and Keaton had to be in the trilogy that got off the kinky darkness of this movie. It is too bad because Pfieffer and Keaton had classical chemistry, and if they had acted in the third part, you know Joel, who couldn't have destroyed Batman for a whole generation of filmmakers.
