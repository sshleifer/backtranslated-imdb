Mud and sand are one of the spells of Stan Laurel's popular films, the blood and sand of Rudolph Valentino (hence Stan is Rhubarb Vaseline). Although the characterization is partly inconsistent (how he did not explain these bulls at first), it was funny from the beginning to the end, when one of the best sequences was the dance that he does with his common-law wife Mae Laurel. Another funny sequence concerns his reluctance to femme fatale, the romance of Filet de Sole, while his wife, Caramel, is waiting for him, showing some glance at his later innocent character with Oliver Hardy. It is worth noting anyone interested in seeing Laurel's early work before his fate, which made him popular throughout the world.
