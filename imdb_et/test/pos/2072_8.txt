One part of Shakespeare's classic BBC filming does not make this version of Hamlet to dispel my special impression that it is one of Shakespeare's most appreciated stories and Hamlet himself is not particularly touching and tragic. I don't feel any sympathy for her and I didn't look at it. <br /> <br /> Even if you have big actors like Derek Jacob, who is Dane's role, and Patrick Stewart as Claudius and Jonathan Hyde like Rosencrantz, it can't hide the lack of passion. And as a good actor like Jacobi injects into this passion, it makes the whole role incomprehensible. I just couldn't combine my character's physicalization with what he said, and it killed it for me. That means he can get the call right or not, because his actions with the dagger explain the suicide intentions of the character in this game. <br /> <br /> Supporting roles, better written for me and therefore better to play, are enjoyable, especially Lalla Ward's loop of Ophelia and Stewart's thorough Claudius interpretation. <br /> <br /> After four and a half hours, it is a very long and best viewed bite-sized piece. Check it out if you are interested but be prepared to watch a long clock.
