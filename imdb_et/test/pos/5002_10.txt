"Who are you dreaming? Hoot Gibson ... Howdy Doody? I'm talking about the theater *!" [Harry Crystal] <br /> <br /> Nothing makes a big show ... anything! And Harry Crystal lives on that faith. The director, who is still waiting for his big break, brings Harry's live theater magic to the small town and Artie Shoemaker (TOM HULCE) ... to a young man with big dreams (but just didn't know until he met Harry). <br /> <br /> With scenes and songs from many American classical musicals ... These lips, these eyes convey the ups and downs of people that lead us to fantasy land in 2 hours, but who can keep this magic in their heart all day long alive! <br /> <br /> Like Artie ... when you've seen them on the lip, those eyes ... "You're hooked, kid!" [Harry Crystal]
