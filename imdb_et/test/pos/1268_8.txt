There are two things in this movie. (It's not a spoiler, it's a story of narration.) When Cole takes Bill to her first B&E, she finds a "box". As soon as Cole finds it, she says, "Box. Everyone has a box". A few minutes later, just before he throws it on the floor, he says, "We're really happy. You don't see them often". <br /> <br /> Attention # 2 (Spoiler Alert!) <br /> <br /> I had to look at this thing three times, I couldn't figure out a few things. Then I looked at the chronological version and saw that they have changed from the last back over time. So on some points, we actually looked at three different times in about a minute's time. <br /> <br /> It was good because I don't know how many times I could see it before I returned to Netflix. <br /> <br /> Color me obsessive.
