If you consider yourself a fan of horror, you've probably seen Hideo Nakata round and dark water. They're great and Ring makes Hollywood smooth (maybe Dark Water will soon adjust?). Although Ring is almost 100% pure heartbeat and nerve breaking, the story of the two sisters is both a nerve break and a twist. <br /> <br /> Together with others, I think this Korean is a brilliant and smart ending horror movie. The only mistake that this movie has is that some of its first 20 minutes are relatively slow. It's actually typical for Korean and Japanese films. I think it is carefully planned, not slow, I mean "a peaceful moment before the storm". Imho looks at characters in depth through character, one of the strongest Korean and Japanese films. <br /> <br /> Like Ring, the story of two sisters does not exceed the beautiful look. Rather, they let their minds do a frightening job. So it is at the same time horrible and horrible. I'm not surprised when Hollywood restores this movie after the move of Ring and Grudge / Ju-On (this flick isn't so good by the way, I appreciate it 5.5). Don't miss it!
