The film opens in a tight British men's club with leather chairs for cigar smoking. This is Denistoun's world. The messenger sends him a small box that he opens to find a pair of golden earrings. The earring is in memory of the time she spent in the Roma company. The rest of the film is modest. <br /> <br /> The golden earring has been my favorite and it is probably the most romantic film I know. Dietrich plays against his usual type. Here he is dark-haired, reputation and not the least mysterious. Femme fatale instead of her strength tower and energetically used all her resources to help Denistoun survive and achieve her goal. To make sure she is really a persuasive gypsy, she penetrates her ears and has worn her golden lover's dead lover. With her clothes and fat she turns a deliberate British gentleman into a wild and sexy looking man. <br /> <br /> When I grew up, I heard the song "Golden Earrings" singing earlier on the film. I think the dynamics are little of Dietrich. / There's a story the gypsies know, it's true that if your love carries golden earrings / it belongs to you.
