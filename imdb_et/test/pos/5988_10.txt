This is one of the best films I've seen for a long time! The director did an excellent job of showing the differences between the social classes that are very relevant today in France. All characters are loved, especially Juliette and her family. The development of romance, though not entirely realistic, is at least plausible and does an excellent job of showing how many people change for love. I found this to be a warm-hearted Cinderella story - but where Cinderella is a powerful woman and herself. I laughed through this movie and loved it. I recommend Romuald to Juliette to anyone who enjoys unique characters, comedy and non-traditional romance.
