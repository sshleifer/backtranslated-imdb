These days, you rarely come to a child exhibition that does not include 1) preteen / teen pop star who is as amusing as color drying 2) involve a plot to find the perfect date with another boy / girl 3) revolves around uncertain shouting and incomprehensible humor . About 95% of Disney, Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network exhibitions meet the criteria listed. Simply put, there is no good action, no originality and no good story. Just as manufacturers and writers think that children are not smart enough to understand the nature of development and plot details. They were no longer aware. Of course, children enjoy a good smile and insecure behavior (if it is done on a conservative level and done it right), but because they want to enjoy the story, see the drama and see the people being challenged. They don't want to see people living in a flawless world where they get everything they want. They know that this world is not all fun and games, they know it's not perfect. Everyone has problems and we all have to work around them. This exhibition revolves around things of this kind. Alex Mack is an average teenage girl who seems to be all her genius sister for Annie. His mother works in some office but is sometimes a home parent. His father, George, is a top scientist, a chemical company working in the Paradise valley of most of the towns where they live. Alex is unpopular and chose most of his peers. His only friend is Ray (but he gets more friends than a series). Jr. On the first high day, Alex walks home not too happy, but a truck that delivers chemicals from plants falls into the fire, trying to avoid running around, stumbling upon a strange chemical known as GC-161, where the chemical mixes with water that includes Alex. Soon he will start developing strange abilities, such as wrapping in a bottle, putting lasers out of his hand and moving things in his mind. He glows constantly even when it is nervous (though we don't see it later). Apart from her sister Annie and her friend Ray, Alex decides to keep these abilities secret from everyone, even his parents, fearing that the plant is being abducted by a corrupt owner, Danielle Atron, with Vince, chief of security, looking for a mysterious GC161 child. Every episode then deals with Alex, who tries to live as a normal child while learning to live with his strange powers. The series may seem like a show for girls, but that's not. Like a boy, I liked this show because of this awesome influence and drama. Manufacturers successfully incorporate some elements of science fiction with teenage drama elements. In fact, some episodes were quiet, violent and a little scary. Unjustified factory manager Atron and Vince make good antagonists for this series because the writers really prove them as a threat and give you this terrible feeling every time they appear on the screen. Also a smart move by adding the driver of the lorry to GC-161 to David, as Vince's worshiping helper hunting for the comedy, but you also love him to the end. It was interesting to see how Alex tries to live as a normal child, but tries to improve his power. Sometimes you forget that these are kids who fight with an enormous adult leader, because you're drawn. The exhibition does a good job of dealing with children, showing Alex that he may have superpower, but he is still a child, and must be careful. Even some episodes will find yourself in Alex's accidents. My favorite episode, where Alex wants her never to be born, really shows most of these elements. As I said, manufacturers never produced anything to make them laugh, whether they come from Ray's lining or George's strange habits, or David's trying to be a nice man. Of course, you will meet the brilliant moments and the whole episode, which has nothing to do with the real series, but what is not a good series? All in all, there is a big exhibition. 9/10
