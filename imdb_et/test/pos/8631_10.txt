Although it is hard to find copies of this movie when you find it, get it! !!! I believe it was just Abbott and Costello besides In The Navy. Though they wrinkled the plot a little, (I've never heard the version where the butcher goes with him), you still enjoy a little idiotic but lovable Jack and the greedy butcher, Mr Dinklepuss. A little reminiscent of DuBarry Was Lady, this amazing film rolls on the floor - just to get up and dance as Lou Costello sings. (I don't know why they didn't do it in other movies.)
