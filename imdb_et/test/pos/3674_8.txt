I wish it was released because I would like to see the finished product! We saw an unfinished version before it came out. Loved by all the characters and actors. Anyone know if there is a video in the video? I'd like to see it again. Finally, it is worth renting if it is not shown in the theater. It was hard for me to find it because they called it around.
