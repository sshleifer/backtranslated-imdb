I looked at Linda and this is a cutting-edge film! The lives of Paul and his wife Linda, whom he respected as a young man and eventually married. They meet another couple, Jeff and Stella, and the quads become very good friends. But their friendship takes Twisted Turn after Varona Beach vacation. ! The action of Virginia Madsen is acceptable; but Richard Thomas steals the film with his incredible effect ... and the emotions he shows. <br /> <br /> Great movie! "Lotta Honey"
