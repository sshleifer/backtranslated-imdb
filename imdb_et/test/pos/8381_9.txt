I'm a bit disappointed with Tarantino after proving death. But I insist that it was just a little bit, because I appreciate the work done to create such respect for people in tricks. Inglorious Basterds has definitely pushed Tarantino into the upper ranks of my universe. This movie can be summed up (though not enough) in one word: "RAW". <br /> <br /> Every scene has a strong emotion. Revenge and justice seem to be the main issues. From the beginning of the film, sympathy for the Nazi victims seems to be placed on the fictional dimension of the historical context of the global economy of Tarantino. <br /> <br /> Characters are unpredictable, fun, frightening, brutal, sexy, and other adjectives that I'm sure I can get into my mind that is just as fit and positive. I do not move to the appreciation of every character, but other co-users' comments give a summary of the recognition of different performances. The dialogue has evolved from the provocative style of the classic "bad ass" of Tarantino seen in Pulp Fiction and Death Proof. In dialogues it may seem that Tarantino makes more open reference to other films. Indeed, many dialogues were near the cinema for lessons for the audience, which is part of the film premiere; the reference to the film is close to every corner. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see that every language you speak (German, French and English) works fairly evenly and naturally. I'm fluent in both French and English and I am often disappointed how French-language characters in French films work badly and how French-speaking characters in English / American do not work well. Surprisingly, Tarantino was able to draw his actors' natural and graceful performance. It helps to put the audience in the context of the historical context. Indeed ; soldiers, spies and civilians rarely understood soldiers / spies / civilians from other countries. <br /> <br /> Visuals / photography are beautiful, with landscapes convincingly conveying World War II of the 1940s. The equipment is perfect and the violence is orgasmically / realistically transmitted. The bastards are not detained and the Nazis are often tortured. This makes the movie open to all target audiences; Graphic violence can shock more sensitive demographics. <br /> <br /> You can write about this movie. But the film is so good that the premiere of North American Inglorious Basterds at the Fantasia Festival in Montreal had to pee, but I refused to leave any scene. I hope that this picture will make this movie feel strong and I am a very pleasant audience.
