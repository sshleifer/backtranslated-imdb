I have been a very attractive windmill fan since the late 1970s since the early 1980s. When that movie came out, it was visible. And after that I saw, immediately went over and bought it! The movie is great, I love the animated action it brings, and the music is great (yes, I bought the audio track on the CD ...) Recommended video for anyone to watch and enjoy!
