For a long time it was my favorite Batman movie. It had the best cinematic art and anxiety with two natural characters - Catwomen and Penguin - with always interesting Christopher Walken. But after the last look it finally slipped in my ratings and, frankly, I prefer the last Batman: Batman, Christian Bale. <br /> <br /> GOOD - This is still the most interesting Batman movie of the last five days. Stylish cinematography here is the best of Batman movies. Director Tim Burton is known for his films, which are excellent examples because it is a great example. The three characters listed above are all very different and very interesting, almost exciting. Of the roots I preferred Catwomen, I found it most fun to look before and after he changed. Violence is not superfluous, as it was in many other Batman stories, but it is never boring. As he did in the first film, Michael Keaton does a good job with Batman / Bruce Wayne. <br /> <br /> BAD - a movie based on a comic that children usually read, I think these first two Batman films, made by Burton, were too dark and contempt was certainly not appropriate. Although unlike the first film, the name of the Lord was useless in vain, it was still terrible and both villains made too many sexual comments. It would have been good if they hadn't marketed this film to both children and adults. Danny DeVito's "penguin" is big in the spots. "Grotesk" I can handle but who wants "gross". In the meantime, some guys complained about the beautiful Michelle Pfeiffer who played Catwoman. Too much darkness and some cheap shots of the Christian bashing made me again my earlier high rating for this film. <br /> <br /> GENERAL - Fabulous visuals and memorable characters make it the most interesting Batman series, but too dark edge, too harsh and too many anti-religious prejudices all end up out of me when half a dozen watch this movie. Sorry, but I prefer the kind-gentler Batman movie. After all, it's just a comic. Most disagree, but I was happy to see that the series is brighter after that.
