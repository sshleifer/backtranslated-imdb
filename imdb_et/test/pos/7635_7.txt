L'OSSESSA, also known as TORMENTED or SEXORCIST, or ridiculously titled "EERIE MIDNIGHT HORROR SHOW" has forgotten the EXORCIST rip-off, which includes one of the best horror moments I've ever seen. The scene is when the crucifix lives. This wonderful spooky scene is unforgettable and completely effective (big currencies). It is a shame that the rest of the film does not keep an exemplary level of serenity on this scene. <br /> <br /> It's one of the most depressing movies ever. Imagine that the manufacturers decide to make a copy of EXORCIST, but they still manage to create something truly original (a perpendicular human sculpture that is shocking in that sense) but then completely forgets its original idea of ​​making a boring and forced EXORCIST rip-off. If the film had continued with the prevailing sculpture concept (characters trying to destroy it, etc.), it would have shaken the film. But if the girl is under the spirit of sculpture, she will never tell anyone where the demo came from. He and the script forget the completely haunted crucifix, which is STUPID !!! <br /> <br /> If you like "Euro-cult" movies, the first 45 minutes, unlike other Euro-cults, will feature movies. But after the event, when the girl has a vision of crossing and she gets stigmatized, the other 45 minutes are SUCK. Bored. It won't go anywhere soon when it tries to exhibit (badly) EXORCIST. So look at L'OSESSA for the first 45 minutes and enjoy the 1970s fashion, buggy and amazing statue-come-live-to-robbery-girl-scene, but after the first 45 minutes press stop and eject and maybe also move your toenails .
