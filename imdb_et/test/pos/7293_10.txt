I have to say that this movie is a bomb. You see it when you see it. I mean, it's a reminder to everyone how hard and easy it is to fall in love. It reminds you of the days of your youth when you were worried and everything that was bad for you was washed with a kiss. Although I'm still doing, I'm the way I live my life. When I was with this particular person, everything that I thought was negative was deleted. So, I give this film 10 for this heartfelt message and plot. Actors Josh Hartnett and Chris Klein I also give 10 lovely faces.
