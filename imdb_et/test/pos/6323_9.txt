"Sleight of Hand" is the favorite Rockford Files episode in its entire series. This episode shows Jim Rockford, which is usually ignored. Jim is in love with a beautiful woman and is shown as a father's indication to her young daughter. She has recently been divorced and she and Jim recently returned with the adolescent at the weekend. Through a strange course of events, a woman is discovered to be lost after returning home. <br /> <br /> Rockford's father Rocky's announcement of events leading to the loss of a woman is reminiscent of Mickey's Spillane's Mike Hammer series from earlier times. After a lot of contempt and reflection and Rocky's encouragement, Jim stumbles upon the idea that he will send him an investigation into the loss of habitual stability. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Jim's Karen girlfriend unintentionally showed some mafia action when they stayed at Buena Vista Inn. Crime bosses replied to Karen's killing and replaced Jimi's car with another woman. The fighter, seemingly asleep in the back seat, made his exit immediately after arriving home. A couple of overlapping murders occur and Jim continues its solution, while in case of suspicion by the LA Police Department, even arrest warrants are issued. <br /> <br /> This episode creates more emotional responses than all other Rockford files combined. James Garner, like Jim Rockford, is seen at his most vulnerable moment and still retains his mind to continue the case. It's personal for Jim Rockford. In this case, he is not employed, but he tries to restore his lost love to save his life. Unfortunately, this is not possible, but Jim tries to find out his feelings, but it is obvious that he will not get hurt soon. <br /> <br /> Despite the main story calls, many key issues have been raised but did not respond to this episode. (1) What about Jim's young daughter? (2) What did Karen see in the hotel that made the Mafia kill her? (3) How could Jim drive an upside down culprit without notice? (4) The daughter stated that "Mommy didn't come back to us". Why didn't the girl scream or cry when she noticed her mother was absent for hours? Despite these ambiguities, the Sleight of Hand is the Rockford Files episode closest to the tear, and it is convincing and the story is told in a sensitive and vulnerable style that makes us feel Rockford's pain.
