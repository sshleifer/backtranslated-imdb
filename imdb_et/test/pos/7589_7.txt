Every Sunday there is an eleven-minute theme that includes the talents of a two young underage contractor - a couple who will become undetectable in the future. It is interesting and fun to see the contrasting styles of Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin when they perform on Sunday at Deanna's uncle. <br /> <br /> Of course, nobody knew how big both young women could be. I've always wondered why Mayer kept Garland and let Durbin go to Universal. NAEL. have always been complaints about culture and it was the man who had Jeanette MacDonald in his studio and later hired such beautiful soprano voices like Jane Powell, Ann Blyth, Doretta Morrow and so on. but he paid a great price for it. Deanna, together with Abbott & Costello and several Gothic fear monsters, retained universal images. He was smart enough to get to the top and shut it down. <br /> <br /> Both, their salad days, Deanna Durbin and Judy Garland.
