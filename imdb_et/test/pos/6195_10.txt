imagine that "24" is completely uncensored, given a free license to explain the situation with the necessary detail and show how and why both protagonists do what they do to kill / prevent and have an idea how good this TV series is . The US people have long known that Showtime is a new HBO, they are doing much better on top level, powerful shows, and this is no exception. The exhibition leads through the creation of a sleeping chamber to the end of the viewer when an attack is attempted, taking into account such important facets as faith, religion, funding, resources and needs. There is still much to learn about Muslim faith. Unlike the mainstream examples, such as "24", where terrorists are the only ones who come to good guys, their purpose and rationale are fully investigated. What gives the exhibition more faith is the latest technology that cells / FBI uses and authentic shots in Europe, the US, and the Middle East, cost savings to tell the story exactly. The cast is relatively unknown, but acting is a great help for a stressed script that keeps the viewer constantly on the edge with many unexpected turns and turns. This exhibition has not received the credit it deserves, and ironically, there is a bit of a sleeping bag, anyone interested in this genre must see
