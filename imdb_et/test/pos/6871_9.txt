One evening at Tom Snyder's "Tomorrow" exhibition, I watched Tom ask his guest Henry Morgan, which he considered "perfect." Morgan replied, "Something about Glenda Jackson." And although I don't think this film is perfect, it does this concept very well. I was going to use a clich√© about Hollywood that doesn't make such pictures anymore, but then I just saw "Up in the Air", another smart movie about 2 over 35 years old who fall in love. However, similarities end. "House Call" is just fun, looking at 2 samples, like Matthau and Jackson, and it's completely natural. I saw this movie in the theater in 1978 (aged 18 years) and it took me another 20 years to get all the jokes. Any movie that can make great pictures of 1920's tennis, Bill Tilden and British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain would not play too well these days. Another idea: the original theatrical release was "Walking on the Beach / Love of Love", placed on The Beatles / George Harrison, "Something". At that time, it seemed a bit forced, but since then, this song has been replaced for a rather general Henry Mancin's musical call, allowing for subsequent release of home video and cable. Too bad because this scene is now there, the other is the victim of music licensing.
