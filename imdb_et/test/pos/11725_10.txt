I'm a fan of B-Class 80's movies, where the hero is a little bad guy, a strong man who finds love - and this movie gives! <br /> <br /> You don't know how to stop killing Sharky (and he won't bang! Realistically, I believe). But he does this and it is not through some "Die Hard" stunt. The "past" team works together, hence the title. His team has all the characters - people who work as a by-product because they are not quite compatible. These images are funny and compassionate - they have a real feeling for them. They're against an assassin hunter who has a good team. The result is a big film noir.
