I saw this movie when it first came out and didn't know what to expect. Overture was one of the most enjoyable movie experiences I've ever had. The lush song and music of the British Leslie Bricusse (famous by Doolittle & Wilie Wonka and the chocolate factory) and the Brazilian musical scene and unparalleled result of John Williams. There's no bad song in the whole movie. In addition, some of the finest cinematographic, costume design and filming locations I've ever seen in one movie. Not to mention the Academy Award awarded by St. Petersburg O'Toole and, in my opinion, excellent results by excellent Petula Clark. Considering that Peter is not the same caliber singer that Petula is, he can still sell his songs to the audience and that's all that is. This is a faithful customization of James Hilton's excellent book and deserves to be valued for future generations. I recommend watching this movie for the family, although most men consider this "chick" a trick. But if you like a really big movie, this movie is for you. But be warned that Kleenex's standby mode is just as important as popcorn to enjoy your viewing.
