It's a subtle, undervalued film, and Rip Tower, known as her, is seriously appreciated. I read Howard Frank Mosher's novel several years ago. How well Craven hits the book and the beauty of the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont! I was fortunate enough to grow in VT in the 40s and 50s and still lived there when the "Irasburg Incident" happened. I have not seen the King's standard, Craven / Mosher's co-operation based on an incident (and another on Mosher's novel), but this film has inspired me.
