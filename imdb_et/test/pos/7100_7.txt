This movie marked the end of the "serious" Universal Monsters era (Abbott and Costello later met with the monster "Abbott and Costello Meet Frankentstein"). It was a somewhat inevitable but fun attempt to revive Wolf Man, Frankenstein's monster, and Dracula's classic monsters in a "last" time. <br /> <br /> I say that, as in the previous movie "House Frankenstein," both Dracula and the wolfman are killed according to how vampire and werewolf legends say they should be (Dracula's sunlight and wolf man with a silver ball ). But they somehow return to Drakula House without explanation. This film could have been played as a priest's House of Frankenstein, when Frankenstein's monster land would not continue in the chronological order of the House of Frankenstein, and if the wolf had not healed. Then there would be no plot in the hole. But because this is not the case, the Drakula and Wolf Man plots do not make sense. <br /> <br /> However, ignoring these plot holes, the House of Dracula is a classic atmospheric horror movie that is fun to watch. It has many high points. Especially seeing that the wolf has healed. I know I just said it shouldn't have been involved, but it was nice to actually see him improve all the time. And the scene where the lady played on the "Moonlight Senada" piano, played a suddenly haunting melody when Dracula's spell was very scary. Dr Edleman's transformation into a "Dr. Jekyl / Mr. Hyde" character was also very good. <br /> <br /> And it's nice to see Dracula, Frankenstein and Wolf Mani together, one "last" time. <br /> <br /> *** out ****
