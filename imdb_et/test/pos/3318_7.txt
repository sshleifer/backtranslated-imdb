Everything is the best shiny large screen soap opera, followed by four career women: Hope Lange, Suzy Parker, Diane Baker and Martha Hyer in New York. What is best for some women may not be the best for everyone. <br /> <br /> In front of this young fillies group, there is a smart old mare Joan Crawford who has been around the screen a few times and in real life. She looks like a home, just like a boss lady, as she should be at the moment. <br /> <br /> At the time she did her best, Joan Crawford got her widow when her fourth husband, Alfred Steele, died. It was a particularly traumatic event for her, she woke up one morning and found her dead on her bed. He inherited his entire stock of Pepsi Colon, where he was chairman of the board and during the same period as Best of all, he quit the queen bee Pepsi Colal. Life sometimes imitates art. So this body, when he calls Dictation and coffee orders for Hope Lange rings, is real. <br /> <br /> In fact, all women here, except Lange, have some rough roaming. It is also tough for Lange, but it literally does the best. <br /> <br /> A collection of scavengers in this movie. The best of them, Stephen Boyd, is a heavy drink. Other Louis Jourdan, Robert Evans, and Brett Halsey have the same slippery collection of rodents as ever collected for a single movie. <br /> <br /> I can't forget that Brian Aherne is a fan of this publisher. sure. Half of this office would be costumes for sexual harassment today. <br /> <br /> Some beautiful New York shots in the fifties make the movie a real treat. Catch it by all means.
