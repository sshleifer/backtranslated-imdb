(Some Spoilers) Bruce Campbell took about 19 years to bring his masterpiece "Man with Screaming Brain" on the screen. But Campbell had to change his story because of financial problems in Sofia, Bulgaria, where he initially wanted to shoot it in Los Angeles, California. <br /> <br /> In Burce Campbell, the US is played by Willian Cole, a pharmaceutical producer in the United States, with Antoinette Byron, a former Bulgarian Communist Republic, with her spoiled rotten woman Jackie. William wants to help finance Bulgaria's almost non-existent mass transport system. <br /> <br /> This is a bad William accident with both Gypsy woman Tatoya, Tamara Gorski and her former boyfriend Yegor, Valdimir Kolev, former KGB taxi driver. These two, William & Yegor, inadvertently end their brain in William's skull because of Tatoy's jealousy and vindication. <br /> <br /> After the Tatoya murder, William and Yegor will be delivered to their body's mad scientist Dr. Ivan Ivanowitch Ivanov, Stacy Keach, for testing the brain of his loyal assistant Pavel, Ted Raimi. Dr. Ivanov has the theory that two heads are better than one. And now, with the material, William & Yegor, has been made available to him by dr. Ivanov. What Dr. Ivanov is sad about is that, when two heads or brains are fused, their brain waves overlap and cause them not only to fail but to turn against each other! <br /> <br /> William, along with Yegor's right-hand yarn, blended with his damaged brain, is finding Tatoya and paying for the damage he and Yegor have caused him and Yegor. For his part, Jegor has stuck with William's head, who likes and dislikes, for both food and drink, is quite the opposite of his own. This causes a lot of tension and hostility between the two brains fighting for controlling the body of William. <br /> <br /> Things go even further when Jackie discovers that Tatoya is murdering her husband, William, in a dangerous situation, and Bravoda calls the Gypsy Town a part of high crime and eventually kills himself. He returned to Pavel back to Ivanov without having the body to plant Jackie's brain inside the experimental robot Pavel had worked on. Surgery is embarrassing success, but the only drawback is that Jackie, who has a robot inside the brain, needs to charge his brain every few hours! Or, like a real brain that lacks oxygen, it dies with robot batteries. <br /> <br /> A combination of 1930s-like comedies and horrors of spheres with William & Yegor, turning the Bulgarian city of Bravoda upside down, trying to find Tatoya and reward his life for the sadness he both put. *** SPOILER ALERT *** This is Dr. Ivanov, who actually saves the day, discovering how to keep two brains in battle and thus work with each other! It does it instead of connecting the brain together. Dr. Ivanov keeps them independent by implanting the neutralizing cell wall between the globes of two non-blending grains.
