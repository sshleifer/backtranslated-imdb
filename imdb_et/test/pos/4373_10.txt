My brother got me back to Carlin in the 70's. I always loved my observation of humor. That is, looking at things every day and finding humor in it, as you would say, "Have you ever tried to throw away an old garbage basket? You can't do it! They'll continue you back!" And asking questions such as why it is more acceptable to kill a word, the word "F", while discussing the prefect. <br /> <br /> In the 1990s, it was less funny and angry. What she seemed to reflect the face of society was a mirror and said, "Look!" At this point, his exhibitions were less comedy and rather a gripping session. But in all justice he always made a huge amount of sense. She really thought. <br /> <br /> Here was Carlin old and new. He will start to have fun, which could be through aging and later by the status of the world. Again, the perfect idea. <br /> <br /> It was his best because there was "Jammin" in New York, and as his last turns out. <br /> <br /> I think that John Wayne or "Prairie Home Companion" Robert Altman, "This is bad for Ya", was "Shooter" for George Carlin. Good goodbye with a real big icon. Love her or hate her, I think she will be remembered.
