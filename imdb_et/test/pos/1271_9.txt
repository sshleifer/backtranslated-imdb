The British director Chrstopher Nolan now has a career in America and a reputation for film making both popular and critically acclaimed; but this little movie was where he started. And it certainly showed his talent, striking black-and-white cinematography and achronic narrative that prefers his later Moment, albeit in a less extreme way. Thematically and mechanically, the plot reminded David Mamet of a 'house of games', but the film still feels fresh and sharp until the end of the end that was awaited, but the sharpness is unexpectedly delicious. On the other hand, the same class does not work - the film has stylized quality and is probably bigger than the director. But it's still a good debut, simultaneously claustrophobic and light.
