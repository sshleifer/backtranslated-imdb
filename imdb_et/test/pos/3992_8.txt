This is correct. Ohwon (painter and protagonist) is an extraordinary person. What strikes me the most is the message that this film can treat all of you. And the message is sad. He says it is very difficult to do something that is amazing or perhaps even genius without having to follow the governments, agencies and other VIPs of this world. And even if you're trying, you may not wear it. It concerns the fight of one person with the system. With many systems. <br /> <br /> A great movie about this wonderful Korean director. Please see if you have the opportunity.
