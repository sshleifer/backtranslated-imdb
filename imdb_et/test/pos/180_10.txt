Here's a movie about adventure, determination, heroism and bravery. In addition, it was back in the late 1800s, making it even more interesting. It's a wonderful, adventurous story, and Alyssa Milano is great to play a healthy, confident, nonsense Fizzy ... great role model. This is one of my favorite films. This is a movie that needs to be viewed over and over and inspires you and undoubtedly enriches your life. Not only is the story great, but the film also has a fabulous landscape and music, and it is perfectly targeted. This movie is as good as gold!
