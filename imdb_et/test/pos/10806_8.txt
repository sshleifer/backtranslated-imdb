This is a great movie to watch, because Andrzej Wajda drove it so nicely, but at the same time I wanted the film to have a deeper sense of it. This is a historically important film of the last days of the French Revolution, but the film, however, overlooks the character's motivation, which makes the film a bit too low to be considered a brilliant and relevant film. <br /> <br /> In no way does it make less of a movie. It's done with passion and eye detail. every aspect of the movie is good looking, like its settings, costumes and camera-work. <br /> <br /> The story also continues to be so powerful, though at the same time it could have been so much better and more powerful, but a little more of character development and historical information. Guess if you're completely familiar with the French Revolution and especially Danton and Robespierre, this movie is perfect for what you look at. <br /> <br /> This is somewhat typical when the French film tells the story slowly and subtly without ever going into too much detail. Often it works charmingly, but in such a case the film would have been made a little deeper. In addition, this film is still a good example of French film, despite being directed by a Polish director and also by many Polish actors. <br /> <br /> GÃ©rard Depardieu has a great role to play, although the film decides to focus on many different characters. There may be too many characters in the film, but every performance is great, so it doesn't really become a big complaint, except that it slows down the story at certain points. A big movie that could have been great. <br /> <br /> 8/10
