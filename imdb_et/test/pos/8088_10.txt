This movie is a perfect way to explain what a good movie is. It's a movie for kids and parents, and it's "timeless". I saw this movie before Eleven in the ocean and I have to admit that OE participants have a class before, but Klatretøsen's game is much down and moving. Why I say Ocean's Eleven is that these two films have a lot in common and Klatretøsen is good! that it can compare to OE. Three young people play their role perfectly, not to believe in what we are used to in Denmark. Different cases of possible acts are treated so that you do not believe in many young actors (and sometimes even "old boys"). Story? Again, it has common things with Ocean's Eleven, except for the reason that the money is stolen and they have to climb to the building at Klatretøsen. The part in which young people have to look after their younger brother in the East gives the film a subtle element. Try to imagine how to rob a bank with a 2-year-old child :-). <br /> <br /> This movie can be comparable to most "grown up" films such as MI2 and Ocean's Eleven. Yes, I believe it's good. It's best to see it in the theater because all the kids in the room comment on the movie and these comments will stay in your heart forever :-). <br /> <br /> Welcome to Klavs.
