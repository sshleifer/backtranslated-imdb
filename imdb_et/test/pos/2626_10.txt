I remember this movie 34 years ago and it was full of tension and twists. It grabs you at first and keeps you in the guise of the whole movie. I have been thinking of this movie for several years and have checked in video stores whether it is available, but I could never find it or anyone who even heard it. I think this type of film is timeless and I know it would be enjoyed by observers from a completely new generation of films. I hope this will go into the video as soon as it would be nice to see if it has the same effect for me as in the early 1970s. <br /> <br /> It is very rare that a TV movie can make so many impressions, but it has been done and is still done for so many years.
