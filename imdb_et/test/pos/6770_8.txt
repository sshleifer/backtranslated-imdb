I'm not sure if I've seen black comedy from Denamark before, but it's really good. Humor is suitably low-key and dead to go with some terrible activities. Svend and Bjarne are tired of working with their boss because he always puts them down (in fact he mentions they weren't light enough to pee before peeing). They do what they have to do to start their meat shop and when a workman accidentally catches something that fixes their butcher shop at night with a fixed light that makes them more popular than their old bosses. In fact, he was the one they sold their first "fillets", and this is partly his fault because he served them at the Rotary dinner in his house and guests treated it and showed it the next day in Svend and Bjarnes. Bjarne is somewhat terrible what Svend has done, but it doesn't end there. Svend has risen above the small existence of his sadness to be popular, new to him, and he does not want to get rid of it, so the freezer continues to fill all the acquaintances (and at one point, the "little Swede from the park"). Doubts arise because the former boss Holger thinks something is wrong. Bjarne is also worshiped by his twin brother Eig, who lived in a coma sanatorium for years, and to whom Bjarne wanted the plug to be pulled out so that he could get the money of the estate to help open the store. When Eig was removed from the respirator, he was restored to the horror of Bjarne. And Bjarne also has a keen interest in Astrid, who works at the cemetery. Neither Svend nor Bjarne are well-regulated individuals, so things start out of control. Deadly humor does it really, and although it is not just a laughable material, it's definitely fun. It is somewhat creepy, though considering cuts in meat and body parts that are occasionally, especially since these two take it so seriously. If you're a fan of black comedies, it's recommended, I liked it pretty well. 8 out of 10.
