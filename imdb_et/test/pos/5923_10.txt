A great film about all the absent people trying to kill their spirit, making it impossible. I'm not going to go ahead, except to say that I liked this movie when I mean something particularly frightening, and I realize that if Lindberg can do what he did, I'll definitely get ahead of me. Definitely a "good feeling" movie. <br /> <br /> Look at it. You don't have to be disappointed.
