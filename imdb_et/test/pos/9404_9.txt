I was quite impressed by Martha's narration and how she pulled the audience's emotional hearts, as well as how it had to affect the family. The forward styling movement was well done and I usually don't enjoy movies with flash / flash-on effects. I felt during the evolution of the film that "definitely Tommy did it". It leaves you feeling how these people lived their lives almost completely apart from each other and what the consequences are if you do not want to answer the question: "It's at 10 am. Do you know where your children are?" And moreover, "What the hell are they doing?" Or "Do I care?" Rich, corrupt brats that literally go to murder. Or so they thought .......
