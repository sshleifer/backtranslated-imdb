I bought this movie last night and I love it. Everybody did it perfectly, especially Ryan Dunn and Bam Margera. The whole plot was big and, as Dunn said in adding DVDs, they showed that he seems to rediscover the whole thing again. This movie has changed my first place in my favorite movies! I can't play the scenes again and again, but I can see them again. I've never done it with any other film. I strongly recommend that you look at it for other people because it is such a big movie, and if you like Bam Margera, this is the perfect movie for you! The small assemblies they show between each scene are just big. I think they have to be movie favorites. They are very sad, mostly music from HIM, which is of course my favorite band.
