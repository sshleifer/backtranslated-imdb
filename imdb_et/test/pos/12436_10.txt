This movie was made thirteen years before the birth, but I think it is the most common, the toughest, safest fun ever made. It just didn't go wrong with the stunning British characters that it boasts of. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Alastair Sim-peerless; Margaret Rutherford-ditto, a wonderfully constant, innocent Gossage, played by the perfect Emperor Joyce Grenfell. Caddish Victor Hyde-Brown (Special Guy Middleton) and the rest of the staff will take the post-war middle class to England. <br /> <br /> Humor is sometimes evident, but it's a special "Ealing" variety and it's never offensive. <br /> <br /> I've been watching this movie many times when I remember, and still laugh like a drain at any time. The imprisonment of dormitories occupied by the girls' school, perfectly planned, but ultimately destructive, twin trips at school and the chaotic end that accompanied the third school's anarchy is invaluable. <br /> <br /> It's an old clich√© I know, but they don't do that anymore. How do I wish they did. If you haven't seen it, please don't be disappointed.
