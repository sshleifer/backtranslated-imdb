I saw "I smell dead" - sorry, "I sell dead" - in the press. Glenn McQuaid, a film writer-director-editor, is a Latvian Irishman who introduced screening, announcing that - if he was on the go - he would be "pint". I do not encourage her to drink, but - if she tells us - she seemed to feel that she had to prove her ladybird or her Irish, or both. When the opening credits rolled up, as usual in the press tests, there were white appearances about the names of each actor or team member who got the audience with friends, and silence for those who didn't. McQuaid returned for mental Q&A. <br /> <br /> This horror film does not take itself seriously, which is good because its humor is much stronger than its horror. Only one scene is even frightening and most of the "horror" is just great, but I laughed at the whole movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is about 1850 in Ireland (by the time the tomb was mostly lost). The story is said to have repercussions: we get setbacks in the setbacks, and the narrative character restores the material it didn't know, because sometimes it wasn't present (or in one case) because the action is behind. br /> <br /> The story begins with the prisoner being brought to the guillotine. Guillotines were not used in the 19th century in Ireland, but - once - we actually see a plausible guillotine sequence. The prisoner fights the way, the rope clamps are accurate and the prisoner is able to search for a blade overhead line. (And later, there is also the end to justify the historically inaccurate use of the guillotine itself.) ("look"). Actors of the 19th century show dental hygiene in the 19th century, but almost all of the apparel and hairstyles (and women's make-up) are decisive in the 21st century. I'm not complaining about Heather Bullock, who is wearing a very pulling black miniskirt cozzie, which seems to be PVC. Phworr! <br /> <br /> Leading actors (except Ron Perlman) are great, but most supportive pains don't make sense of the Victorian era. The worst offender is Joel Garland, whose characterization is firmly rooted in the 21st century. Just when I thought Garland's performance didn't get less Victorian, he used his fingers to make "irony" quotes. <br /> <br /> Sets (especially the Angus Scrimm Laboratory) are detailed and impressive. could not convince me that people actually lived and worked in these places. Almost every interior contains burning candles, but I never saw what would have been there if they were real Victorian homes or workplaces: drippings left by previous candles. <br /> <br /> It was annoying that McQuaid sank into a stereotyped "gray" Schwa alien rather than an original one. Don't serve the story. I was impressed by the recurring blue screen device that placed the heads of the main characters over other backgrounds. Less effective was the recurring "Creepshow-style" camcorder motif, which was similar to the drawings of the 1950s EC Horror Comics. I'm a fan of EC Comics, but they don't belong to the 19th century Ireland. The money that McQuaid spent on a fabulous photo F / X - showing his editing skills without making a story - should have been spent on precise costumes. <br /> <br /> LARGE SPOILERS NOW. Ron Perlman performs the "Oirish" performance, which is full of subjects in the showrooms. Obviously playing with a 19th century Irish priest, he writes with his left hand. (Victorian in Ireland was punished by left-handed children for use of the "devil's hand", and they were forcibly retrained to get it right.) But Perlman's character has a reason to hide his right hand. Somewhere a zombie bites this sign, but it has no bad effects, so I knew it would be worth it later. Several more logical night scenes are shot in daylight, probably just because it was easier and cheaper. (Because McQuaid is a proud director and editor, he can easily capture "night-time" ... but using a process-photographic effect to show the story seems to interest him much less than showing his flashy editing techniques.) McQuaid it seems to have paid tribute to these great Hammer horror. But these hammers were so big because the actors and product developers worked hard to convince us that we have actually seen events in 1888 in Whitechapel or wherever. "I Sold The Dead" is hardly able to provoke the 19th century. <br /> <br /> Glenn McQuaid shows talent as a director, script and editor, but in all three abilities he makes strange choices ... then he doesn't justify those choices. But I enjoyed "I Died". I appreciate it in 10 out of 10 and look forward to my next movie.
