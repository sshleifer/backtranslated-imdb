Yes, I will give it to 10 because I compare it not only to others who are of their own nature, but also to the dreck that is bombarded daily in today's "popular culture". This leaves the film beautifully, as has been said elsewhere, and gives us a fairly good look at the popular theater of the late 18th and early 20th century. No small coincidence is that many of the games Olcott played are similar to the plot: The boy meets the girl, someone is present, the boy usually fights, the boy wins. In fact, it was known during the "Chauncey Olcott Act". There is no chance that John Ford was driving. He called it, "Silent Man". And "My Wild Irish Rose" is in itself a "Chauncey Olcott Act." Great things, no? Anyway, great songs, great stuff. Enjoy. <br /> <br /> PS - After seeing the movie, I'd like to know more about Bill Scanlan. I found an obit that said he would give up "Mauvorneen" because of madness (replaced as in Chauncey Olcott) and died in the shelter several years later. But he was a very big star in itself, who wrote songs and played and played songs written for him. <br /> <br /> Anyone know more?
