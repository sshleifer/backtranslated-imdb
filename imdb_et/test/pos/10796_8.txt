*** SPOILERS *** Some of the strange reasons why Oliver Stone's "Talk Radio" is based on Stephen Singular's "Talking to Death" and the star of movies with Eric Bogosian, the 1984 Denver talk show host, Alan Berg, has never been certified that it served so well. The 1988 film was prophetic enough to recognize the land movement that had developed on the American farm and inland. The movement that gave birth to about seven years later, the angry and contented bay war veteran Timothy McVeigh, who hates the actions of US governments in Wacco Tex, leads him and his friend Terry Nichols, a US federal building explosion in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995, which took 168 people life that is the worst terrorist act in the US soil until then. <br /> <br /> The film is for the first time known to me when some of the main media in the entertainment media mentioned and worked out late in the William L. Pierce rural militia novel Turner Diaries, which has since become a chilled underground classic . "Turner Diaries" predict that the US government's federal facility, which was the Washington DC FBI building, like the bombing of Oklahoma City, is a local and completely catastrophic terrorist attack. <br /> <br /> The Dallas radio station KGAB talk show host Barry Champlain, Eric Bogosian, is most appreciated in the Dallas listening area and is now becoming national. Barry gets his high-level razor with a sharp spirit and abusive behavior when he's in the air. Picking up all the arrivals and the lack of questions, no matter how unpopular or taboo they are, has become the most heard and hated by Barry on the radio. Barry, who is a conscience and did not think that his speech can lead to violence, keeps his abrasion on his caller's listeners as his assessments go up. There are, however, those who are mostly tiny wings that don't take too much of their facial attitude. One of them decides to take his case at Barry's expense. <br /> <br /> Eric Bogosiani's Christmas power as a tragic Barry Champlain, who crossed the line of entertainment to the tough reality of radio operations. Thinking he was not so important to search for him and murder air for the opinions of enemies, he didn't like being too late to have enough people to make him out. Along Baldwin is also very young in the movie "Talk Radio", as Barry's boss Dan, who is trying to soften him, but eventually goes with his chat style, because he kills a race that doesn't understand that it will eventually kill him. <br /> <br /> Both Ellen Green and Leslie Hope are two women in Barry's life, her former husband Ellen and now a lover and chat room producer, Laura, whom Barry is using and almost losing both at the same time. The 1988 "Talk Radio" movie is so far ahead that even if you look at it in 2005, you still think it is too disturbing to show that it is a sensitive and sensitive American public.
