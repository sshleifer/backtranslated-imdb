... the last time I laughed a lot. It testifies to Rowan Atkinson's talent for having a comic strip with multiple layers and a clearly defined personality - hardly ever a word. The success of the program is based on Atkinson's shoulder, but it is easy to carry. Despite the fact that the show ran for only one season, anyone who is in contact with pop culture recognizes the rubber-covered social firearm, so great is talent and performance. Sometimes amazing, sometimes lovable, Mr Bean is an innocent, unhappy chap who also happens to be incarnate. The shine of this character cannot be put into words, you have to see yourself. <br /> <br /> Occasionally, the exhibition becomes too depressing, like the infamous New Year's Eve, or when Bean celebrates his birthday as a restaurant alone, offering himself a greeting card he has signed himself and making a contribution, he is not quite proud . However, there are times when you are unable to help but feel impressed by the inventive techniques that Bean himself does not interfere with, for example, when he sells this contribution in a number of smart ways, or when he becomes a swimsuit without taking off his pants! Whatever your reaction to Bean and his unusual lifestyle, you look laughing while watching. Finally, I would like to point out that while "Bean" is classified as a children's program, it is equally enjoyable for all adults with a sense of humor. As more "adult" jokes go over the heads of toddlers and the smart slapstick (yes, there is such a thing) is funny, no matter what age you are, "Bean" is the true definition of a family event. It's just classic and always glows my day.
