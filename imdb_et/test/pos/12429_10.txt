If you really took a good jack black movie, a little jeepers were added and then a jumble of joy with a hint of a Texas chainsaw and a 1000 dead body house ... you would have MONSTER MAN! I went to this movie, not really waiting at all, but I really ended up enjoying the movie. The whole premise is really cheesy, the monster truck is killing people down, but it's so funny that the writer / director doesn't expect you to take it seriously. justin urich is a comic pearl and should have a very promising career. he is an identical jack with black. the only problem with the film is the incredible hero role played by eric jungmann. but in general, if you are really looking for a really fun movie that will hit you until you run into the aisles and at the same time scare you out of the fuck ... watch this movie.
