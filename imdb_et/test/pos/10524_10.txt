Given that this movie was released 8 years before birth, I don't feel it too long for too long. Already in January 98, I attended the second Quentin Tarantino Film Festival in Austin, Texas. The specific theme of the films was the evening "Films of Corrupted 70s Crimes" and the boy was right. "Gravy Train (or Dion Brothers), as it appeared in the publication, was an absolute pearl. Wonderful performances, peculiar characters, smart plot, fun comedy, and just all the good time. You rarely see criminal films that are so fun and fresh. Margot Kidder is very sexy in one of her first films. I hope that some of the cable networks will stick to this movie and will be able to see much more. In the meantime, go to the indie video store and hope it exists.
