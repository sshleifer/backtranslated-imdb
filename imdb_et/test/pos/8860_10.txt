Classic 1951 "A Theme from Another World". 12 men are completely separated from stations in Antartica. They are penetrated by a thing from space - it eats and repeats everything it decides. It starts as a dog, but gets rid of it - and it has the chance for all men to duplicate. Soon no one will trust anyone else - they are isolated - the radio will be destroyed - including their helicopter. What are they going to do? This movie was scary. It's too - but the story is different (and is based on the source material - "Who's going?") And it's scary differently. The film starts with the enormous scary score of Ennio Morricone, which gives the right tone and - if Thing can attack - the gore is amazing. There are all the blood and body parts that fly over the arms, are bitten, the heads open and - the strongest - one person eats the face first. Gore effects are STRONG and real nightmares. I do not fear easily, but I had to sleep with the lights when I first saw it in 1982. The influence of Rob Bottin is simply incredible - how this picture got R-rated over me! He also has a very horrible feeling - it's very stopping. You are not sure who is, and Carpenter's direction and outcome really pulls tension. One Complaint - Nobody Gives Any Distinctive Personality Characteristics. They just get straight and say their own lines. It's annoying ... but the movie still works. <br /> <br /> It was a critical and commercial disaster in 1982 - it was competing with "E.T." with. and many critics complained about the size of gore and there were no women in the movie. Now it's considered one of John Carpenter's best. Must see ... strong snakes. NOT a date movie! <br /> <br /> Amusing Note: When released, Universal sent all comments with all the movie images. They suggested to the theater owners that they were playing near the rest rooms of the movie. They feared that people were so ill because of the violence that they should be close to throwing them away!
