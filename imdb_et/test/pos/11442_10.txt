This film probably gave me the most pleasant surprise I've ever seen. It was not a big-budget production, and the premise that medieval amateur jazz musicians had unexpected professional activities at a Catskill-like resort seems rather modest. What is not modest is the success of the film. It's a bit of a live movie that's the most fun. The script was also written by director Frank D. Gilroy and is full of interesting sub-blocks and unexpected turns. <br /> <br /> Actors are comrades who work hard. The biggest revelation for me was Cleavon Little. He plays a professional musician hired to fill a member of a band in difficulty. His attitude is immediately shared with others. Although they see it as an opportunity for great fun and once in life, it sees it as a job and not very interesting. This leads to conflict, but when a group gets in trouble, it leads them through. The little one who died too young showed me that he is a beautiful actor in this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is a real sleeping bag that film fan always expects to discover. I recommend it with all my heart.
