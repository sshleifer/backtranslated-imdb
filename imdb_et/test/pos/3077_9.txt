This movie was fantastic if you wanted a movie with non-stop puns and laughter, that's right for you. This movie was great because it took serious Robin Hood and did something that the whole family can enjoy and laugh at. For the first time I watched this movie when I was about ten years old and got it most. This movie is also great because it makes it fun for everyone involved: "The Order of the Royal Finance Minister H and R Blockhead?" <br /> <br /> Everyone needs a little bit of Cary Elves (Robin Hood) alive, no matter whether the liar lies in the "claw" or the yield. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth it
