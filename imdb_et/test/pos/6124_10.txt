Do you know "Curiosity Killed The Cat"? Well, I've heard so much about this movie, a magazine that called this one of the most shocking films of the time, my 1001 movie that you have to see before you die, my sister who saw it at the film festival, and I love the 70's show in VH1. I just had to watch this movie because it was the toughest movie all the time, and after watching this movie last night I have to say that it really lived its title. My God, this movie was so weird! I thought I really saw all the sick movies and TV shows I've seen, a few things I always think like shock. Well, Babs Johnson, aka Divine, is called the dirty person who lives, and competing with a couple called Marbles compete for this title. They want to take the divine out and call it the poorest couple who lives, robbing women, raping them, impregnating them, and selling their children to lesbian couples. But it seems that the divine and his family are fine ... I don't know, it seems to keep the title of sex with chicks, butt lips synchronization, dog stools eating, bold their skirts, incest, and it just gets heavier and coarser. <br /> <br /> Pink Flamingos has been a terrible act, terribly done and well, just terrible. The reason 10 ratings I give is due to whether, how can you rate this movie? I always appreciate, so I just see what the hell? Because of the strength of this movie, do you have to give John Waters some credit to think about the devil over 35 years later? Cast and team members who have worked on this film are just plain nasty! <br /> <br /> 10/10
