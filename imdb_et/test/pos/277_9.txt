Both real and surreal, all in one. I remember feeling like Tessa. Heck, I remember that Tessa. It was a relationship that ended with a beautiful one. I especially liked the tactics of demonstrators. It is nice to see the symbolism in the movie without being hit with it. If you can see it, take it. It's worth 30 minutes.
