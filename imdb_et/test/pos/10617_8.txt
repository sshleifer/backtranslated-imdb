"Piano Teacher" is all about Huppert's character; a medieval classical piano teacher with a stoic facade with a strong, amazing personality behind it. If the story is not satisfied as a characteristic study, the film follows Huppert's character through the duration of his irritating relationship between the student, who gives great performances in the process. Not for everyone, the "Piano Teacher" plays best against the characteristic dramas of foreign films and blind problems. (A-)
