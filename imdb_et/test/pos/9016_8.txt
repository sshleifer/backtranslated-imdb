Some previous reviewers seem to have expected their film to be a bit too high. I found it scanned the satellite channels for something (which doesn't know what) and it happened. I thought by headline that it could be one of the many soft kernels of porn movies that regularly appear on film channels, but I was pleasantly surprised. Although men were nudity (in fact, more than your typical soft core title!), It was not the focus of the film. It was just fun. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by my tastes: my recent screenings have been included before the Falls and Europa, Europa (both, IMHO). But I also like a complete spiritual shutdown while watching a movie. Virtual Sexuality did it for me and it's not bad!
