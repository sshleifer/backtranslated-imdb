This year's best family movie ... The Grand Champion in simplicity and light heart humor was easy to get lost. The story of a 12-year-old boy (Buddy) that he is determined to raise the Grand Champion with the help of his sister, mother and best friend. This is an extraordinary journey to great competition. After Hokey Pokey's crowning, Grand Champion, he has $ 775,000 in auction. to pay for children's college education. Buddy discovers that the next time he sees Hokey, it would bump! The children agree to steal the winning driver who wants to save him from BBQ. This is where fun begins ... Julia Roberts, Larry Mahan, George Strait, Natalie Maine, Steven Bland, Tommy Guy, Tuff Hedeman, and so many other stars create the backdrop for all the antics. You don't believe who won the auction! (She looks good on mustache) The soundtrack is full of stories from George Strait, Natalie Maines, Willie Nelson, and more. Where else can you experience the stars of the movie, the stars of the country and the stars of Rodeo ... only in Texas ... only in the Grand Champion. <br /> <br /> This is a masterfully designed "simple" little movie that can be the best movie you see this year. The film will be opened in selected cities on Friday, August 27th. Another great movie Rope the Moon and Michaelson Productions is IN WHISPER. Watch it on cable networks!
