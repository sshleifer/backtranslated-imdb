I really enjoyed this old black and white chat room. At first I didn't know Harold Lloyd as Cobbit, a missionary to China, to get home to find a woman. Mr Cobb's attempts to clean the town hall had many turns. His methods of matching punishment to crime would probably be illegal, but this is not a reality-based film. This would be a perfect film for children except that there is a female with nudity (Grace Bradley only). Old phones are fascinating. The only mistake is the problem of the day. Caucasians are used by Chinese men. This is compensated by a positive way in China. They are smart, good and friendly guys. Trivia - The Bekinsi truck appears when the police run out of Black Marias.
