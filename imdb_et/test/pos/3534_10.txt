1981, just before dawn, is one of the better stories of intimidating the desert. It is one of the best slasherists of the 80s and it blows easily movies like The Final Terror, Don't Go In The Woods or Prey's Water. <br /> <br /> A group of young adults should look at the mountain area that one group has just bought. But they are not alone in nature. A plump and bred murderer, who appears to be in two places immediately, hides and hates the victims. <br /> <br /> Director Lieberman, who gave us such great B-films as Squirm (1976) and Blue Sunshine (1977), makes this smart thriller a great job. The film is nicely atmospheric, a distressing tension and some strong tension. This film even makes a terrifying claustrophobic feel in an open wilderness. Oregon's locations are beautiful and cunning cinematography. The music score is a real original and fantastic, unlike the scenic vision. <br /> <br /> Deborah Benson makes a great lead, his presence was exciting. Gregg Henry delivers good results, as Benson's lover and Chris Lemon sometimes give occasional charisma. The supportive majority, especially the veteran actor Kennedy, is doing quite well. <br /> <br /> A real gem that lies in a genre that doesn't need excitement. It is definitely worth looking for interesting fans and horrors. Check it out! <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 Off ****
