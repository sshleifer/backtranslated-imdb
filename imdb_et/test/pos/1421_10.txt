WARNING: May contain some smaller spoilers. <br /> <br /> It's hard to say anything bad about this movie except one thing. <br /> <br /> You can't see anything! !! And again, maybe it's because you have to be in the morning or at 3 o'clock in the morning to get Fox movie channels. <br /> <br /> Too bad because it's another time for a lost pearl, Clifton Webb takes on a patented sour, familiar with all the behaviors he'd perfected with Lynn Belvedere ("Sitting Pretty" and sequel) and turns "Nature Boy ". <br /> <br /> It's actually like that. <br /> Webb plays Robert Jordan as a Sunday Children's Education Program recipient, losing viewership, and the network stops him from having to do something or else. <br /> <br /> Some of this problem may be due to the fact that the married family has no children. <br /> <br /> BUMMER !!! But when such things happen, the local church teacher needs the leader of the crowd's troops and finds that he is ready for the victim ... ahhhh "VOLUNTEER" ... host, so Jordan takes his position. > <br /> Problem solved, BETTER ??? <br /> <br /> ERROR! This is a movie with other problems. For example, it turns out that one of the scouts is the son of his boss at a TV station that causes little friction; especially since the boy is overweight, he has both asthma and attitude. <br /> <br /> And it is more reasonable. <br /> <br /> It's also Cub Scout, Mike (George Winslow), who wants to beat, being a "stray puppy" type. <br /> <br /> As it turns out, it is because it does not have its own people, but takes care of a relative who is not. Such a thing makes her work harder than expected. <br /> <br /> All in all, Webb becomes more understandable for children and not only saves his show, but also learns satisfaction and finally takes Mike. <br /> <br /> All these years.
