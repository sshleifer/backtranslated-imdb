KRAMER VS KRAMER won five Oscars, including the best picture of 1979. This intense and deeply moving family drama follows the advertising manager whose life has been reversed as his wife for eight years, walks to her, leaving her to take care of her son and build a relationship with her. Robert Benton's sharp scenario is a faulty but real heart, soul, and brain person. For example, in a scene where Joanna tells Ted leaves her to leave her, she won't rush out of the door ... she gives her keys, her credit cards, a dry cleaning ticket, tells her what bills have been paid, and tells her she's her had withdrawn as much money from his bank account as he had been married, more. That decision to leave was not a whim ... I thought and Joanna felt, without anything but leaving, when she left, she was going to do it right ... and without a specific plan, she didn't think Billy was right. Dustin Hoffman won the Oscar for his Ted Kramer, the man who had so stubbornly brought the bacon home, had no idea that his life would be broken at home. Meryl Streep also won the Oscar, who plays Joanna, an unhappy woman we know compassion at the beginning of the movie, but that everything changes when she returns for her son. Hoffman is here at the top of his form. I will always be in the scene when she tries to explain to Billy (Justin Henry, Oscar candidate) why she left her mother and she does it whispering at every stage, or when she returns to Joanna and hits her drink on the wall (Hoffman's moment that was not in the script that Streep was not reported to give a natural response). Justin Henry hits all the right comments like Billy, a confused little boy who doesn't know why his mother has gone and doesn't know how to communicate with his father. Jane Alexander also received an Oscar, such as Margaret, a neighbor of Ted and Joanna, who has exchanged omnipotence based on the film's summary. It's an intense family drama, but here's the laugh ... Billy and the chocolate chip ice cream ... Billy picks up because Ted chooses him late at the party ... Billy tries his father's one night stand (JoBeth Williams) in his bathroom tough naked, but it's the human drama moments you remember ... Ted runs through Manhattan, where Billy was at hand to get into the emergency room after BIlly falls into the jungle gym ... Ted was blamed right before the start of his battle battle and making the scene Instead, the man speaks whisper ... "Shame on you." And, of course, the finals where Joanna says to Ted won't take Billy, which I found a little hard to swallow. Why should he go to all the troubles that arise from securing custody, and then simply change his mind? But this is a small quiz about the superb film that has been masterfully staged by Robert Benton and that is flawlessly made to the highest standard. Black-black.
