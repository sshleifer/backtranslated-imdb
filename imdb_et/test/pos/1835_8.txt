This movie is so cool. That told me I enjoyed the full life of my life every moment. I think Bonnie Hunt (Jerry Maguire) is writing well and I'm so happy that he gave the older players the chance to play such a big role in the film. It's really clean, in a society that worships wealth, health, and youth, it was nice to see a movie from normal people. The film reminded me a lot of "When you slept", which I really love. If you don't like this film, you should work for your sensitivity skills. <br /> <br /> Favorite Price Bids: Megan Dayton: "I'm saying that for safety reasons, don't shave your feet, because then you won't let it go too far." Grace Briggs: "Megan, that's the first date." Megan Dayton: "I got married on the first date. I'm sure you plan to be flat, but if you are now, it seems that the male brain seems to be all that they say, brilliant. Your legs are your only communication with reality." Scenes: Megan (Good Will Hunting) riding his bike. All the scenes in the garden. Chat and company among grandfather and friends in restaurant. Please don't skip this movie that warms your heart!
