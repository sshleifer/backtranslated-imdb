Another fantastic offer from the Monkey Island team, and even though it had been a long time and had to live with Ron Gilbert's departure, is another worthwhile max. My only handle is that it was a little short compared to the previous two, although this may be due to the brilliant shortage of the disk swap. Roll on MI4.
