This is Burt Reynolds "Citizen Kane" .Tradically anything else he had ever attended came close to "Sharkey's Machine" .It seemed to me that he put all he had in it. This is a movie that is in love with the movies opening queue where Detective Sharkey rescues hostage bus loads, is a tremendously exciting cinema. Everything moves as fast as it has started to go wrong, that it seems to be taking its own life, with a great effect. On Reynolds streets, it looks cold, tense and dangerous. The district house looks dirty and tired, full of desperate people on both sides of the law, screams, screams, tries to deal or just survive. Underneath this underworld, the recently surrendered Sharkey, a drug-busted drug bribe (a corrupt policeman), is part of the vice-president. The information they pull out of the curve of the politician guide them to the world of high quality call girls and barren drug barons. Looking at the apartment of one of these girls (Rachel Ward), Sharkey loves her portrait on the wall (I know I know) and when a woman's body is found on one face she thinks she was. (Well, I said it's a movie that loved movies). The scene in which he walks into him works beautifully, even if you have seen the original. The film is full of good shortcomings, especially as Charles Durning's war story, finely acted and shot sharply in contradiction to Sharkey's robbery and torture, suitably harsh and brutal. I have to call Vittorio Gassman and Henry Silva two different, but equally evil brothers who have no redeeming qualities. They are "full" each time they are on the screen and they do not lose to society when their time arrives, Mr Silva's ending is particularly special. As mentioned, this is a Clint Eastwood film that Clint has never done. The biggest compliment I can pay is the Sharkey machine to point out that I think Clint Eastwood couldn't have done it. The soundtrack is equally high: Sarah Vaughan, Joe Williams, Julie London, Chet Baker and other top artists. Randy Crawford's "Street Life" plays behind the title order and I can never hear it in my eyes, seeing Sharkey along the sidewalk. Like other correspondents, I have never understood why this movie was a little flop. I hope this is due to a critical review, especially at a time when so many policemen are showing films and exhibitions without a quarter of their energy, freshness and joy. vivre is devastated from the boards. If you are tempted to think of Burt Reynolds as a burned single trick pony, put your "Sharkey machine" in your video device. I promise you won't be disappointed.
