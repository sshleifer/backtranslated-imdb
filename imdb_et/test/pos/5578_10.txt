I heard about this series in 2001, which my friend recorded on television every week. I've never struggled, though, to get to the series through the magazine I watched every time and then in the bookstores. I recently bought a series on a DVD and am addicted to this exciting and original series. First, the characters seem unlikely, but it is amazing how quickly they grow and develop into a common force. As they start taking care of each other, it is easy to take care of what happens to them (keeping in mind that this is just a TV series and they are fancy). <br /> <br /> But it is not the computer world of Star Trek and so that every character shows good qualities, they all have their drawbacks and demons they have to deal with. Single readers, mixed with a generic multi-story arc, make it one of the most complicated and rewarding television experiences I've ever had. I am absolutely delighted to see how each character interacts with each other. <br /> <br /> The strange new world we are introducing is perfectly portrayed through the eyes of astronaut John Crichton, and when he learns and adapts to the other side of the galaxy, strange alien beings, the different cultures that the character wants to kill him and what his comrades treat as inferior, we can easily associate with what he needs to know. When he gets used to his surroundings, viewers and his compassionate, strong will and brave character are happy to see. <br /> <br /> I just watched seven of Farscape's seasons and look forward to going through two or four seasons and the mini series. Maybe one day we can all enjoy the fifth season. Exceptionally recommended viewing and payout time for viewing. Buy and Enjoy! 10/10.
