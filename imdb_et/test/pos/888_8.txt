Well, SWORD IN THE MOON finally got a DVD card in Korea and, despite the mostly negative answers I have heard about it, and suspiciously tardy DVD, I couldn't do it - it's better - all movies are better than most of my wu xia movies in my eyes: D Maybe the low expectations were an advantage because I was quite pleasantly surprised to find the movie quite enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The assassin kills a number of ministers who were involved in the revolution that captured the throne, and the main swordsman of the government is detecting the culprit. It doesn't take too long, but the answer is not what he wanted to hear. Through longer setbacks, we learn why and swordsman and assassin and revolution. <br /> <br /> The film is typically a melodic and decisively serious tone for the Korean film - not the moments of HK style comedy you can find here. The story may be a bit more complicated at first, but it all makes sense. At the end of the movie, a little but no worse than the Chang Cheh movie, and mostly found it enjoyable. Production values ​​are great, some have good cinematography to record it. Fighting scenes are not caliber better in HK wu xia movies, but maybe they are not meant to be - fighting is more "realistic" that they are less like choreography dance routines, but there are some wiring and casual cgi that put the movie " wu xia mode. The film does not have the best selection, unfortunately, when the wires are charming and sometimes difficult to distinguish. The film has a young lady I don't think I've seen before, but makes the best impression of some of the principles - not only because you see her ... or maybe it's: p The film lacks the charm of the best HK wu xia movies beauty, but also beauty, but I wish HK would make these parties more good - TWINS EFFECT 2 does not give me hope that * it will be soon * although Tsui Hark will definitely still have it when it receives financial support and contributions . In my word, my favorite music list doesn't go in any way, but it's a whole bunch better than ROMANTIC REDUCES or MORE LEGEND - maybe better than BICHUNMOO, though I did a little more on the second viewing. Obviously, it's not a wonderful MUSA, but it's a completely different thing. Probably SITM will be looking for another three years, which is probably the best indicator of how I liked it :) 7/10
