I just sat through this movie again and can only wonder if we see more movies like this? The timeless music of William Holden and Jennifer Jones leaves this adult man crying through joyful, romantic scenes, and I'm not very kinky in life. Where are our William Holden gone and do they move, wonderful movies anymore? It is sad that we have to realize that they probably are not, but do not think about it, just try to prevent it. However, they don't have Holden and he doesn't show up on this hill again. You can enjoy this movie and watch it again.
