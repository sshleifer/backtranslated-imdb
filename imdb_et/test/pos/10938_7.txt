I liked this movie okay, it could have been so much better. I had been waiting for more activities than what I got ... which was more comedy than anything else. It seemed to be partly serious and there was a good fight scene and it was mostly more romantic and comedy with some deeds and no horror at all. What is hard to do with a vampire. Vampire men lose their partner and have to train another, his sister undergoes a severe break, but all things are tried by a vampire. This vampire is pretty nice and not sucking blood. So that's all there really is, except for some other vampire plot after some royal vampires to get the ultimate power. Some of the problems associated with this film are that his plot went here and there and there was a very uneven stream of film on it and that it seemed that the genres changed a little too much. One minute of action, the next pure comedy. But the girls were cute, good action, comedy deserves to be crying or two and Jackie Chan is quite energetic or two. This film apparently needed more development in some areas such as a villain who has not been studied at all. So with some good fighting with movies and jokes or two, it's pretty good ... though why was it rated R? I've seen things we've done, that is PG-13, which is much worse than that.
