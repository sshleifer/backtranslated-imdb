This film was one of three that later joined Chapin in the late 1950s in a composition titled "The Chaplin Review". <br /> <br /> It was a strange film in some sense because in later life Chaplin was anti-war and his films emphasized peace and brotherhood. However, this film is a propaganda-comedy that aims to strengthen US efforts in World War II. It's really strange to see Charlie as a "superhero" who unilaterally captures 13 Germans by accidentally and gently shooting several Germans in just a few seconds as a shooter, and then goes behind the enemy lines to try and keep Kaiser in his hands! Indeed, it was the main departure of a small tram, although it was fun and funny at the same time. The film is extraordinarily amazing, well done and I'm sure I supported my troops' support at home (too bad it was such a pointless and costly war).
