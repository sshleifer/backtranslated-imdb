I was waiting for ages to comment on this program, and I felt that the time was right. It is one of Christie's darker, more sinister and more appealing works, not just someone who is killed for money, it's a dark and profoundly innate story of mystery, intrigue, love, and murder that has been done better by the adaptations made by the adapter. The level of action is absolutely great, Joan Hickson is superb in this respect, as always! The rest, including the love of Liz Fraser, Anna Cropper and Helen Cherry, are beautiful, but I think Margaret Tyzack's show is hidden, the scene between her and Joan Hickson is just magical. as good as it can, cools, moves and is completely brilliant. <br /> <br /> Please let me know if you agree with my words. I look forward to seeing how Geraldine McEwan is. Watch and enjoy.
