A very plausible and amazing film depicting the effects of war on the public gives us a shameful understanding of Ingmar Bergman's beliefs. The lack of color and sound (like the soundtrack) helps to make the film more realistic. There is no soft or hard lighting or a variety of camera angles to make the story charming or dramatic. Everything is portrayed very simply as it really is. Sometimes the story was confusing, but maybe in order to give a character to the characters? how they now know what's happening or why. The simplicity of the film made it somewhat boring, but I realized how the director did not try to make the story and score points. He depicted the harsh and undisturbed events and consequences of war. At first, the characters were introduced and their content was displayed with lighter settings and very long extracts. When suddenly they were hit by war, they were much darker and quieter with much more intimate images. Bergman did a good job of allowing us to consume the war ourselves and to portray an image that was so much in response to the war. Although the story itself was not too impressive, it was the content of the film.
