It was easily one of Ernest's films, especially with regard to production design. What were pink shapes? Unfortunately, this movie probably destroyed the Ernest series by changing the series to live video. But Jim Varney gave one of his best performances by playing Nash, his offender's ego. A bug in the series, but in most cases it wasn't too bad (Electro Man's routine was classic)
