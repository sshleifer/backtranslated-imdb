This is one of the best early "Trek" episodes where Kirk and his team are invading to make a fight against a well-known enemy. Imagine their surprise when they discover that the terrible rogues are the vulcan race racers! Mr Stiles, well played by Paul Com, is one of the few truly unlikely stars in the Star Trek universe. His barely hidden hate against Mr Spock is, like 9/11, the hatred and suspicion that many Americans have of Arab or Middle Eastern origin. The atmosphere of wartime paranoia is too real. Then there are the ruins: they are the ultimate federation. Klingons are nasty but basically harmless; more discomfort than serious danger. Romans, however, mean business: they are the ancient Romans who were born again in space; In spite of their volcanic qualities, they have obviously reminded us of the Roman imperialists, such as Decius and titles like "Century" and "Praetor". The chain mail armor is really cool. The familiar guest star Mark Lenard, who played Spock's father Sorek and also the "Klingon" commander "Star Trek: Motion Picture", is appropriately grizzled, a war-tired commander, a character who has a striking resemblance to Laurence Olivier's Crass "Spartacus". Similarly, recalling his resemblance to the imperial conquest of January, his inquiry reminds of similar doubts expressed by Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) at the beginning of the Gladiator. Both must be Trekkies and epic fans of swords and sandals.
