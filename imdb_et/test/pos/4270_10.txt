As an English teacher, I appreciate movies that do more than the story. Good movies, like good literature, lead to thinking, thinking and predicting. This movie made me three. Mr. Jansen takes risks and uses predictive, symbolic and interesting turning points for many of his characters. I also like the fact that, despite the characters in the film, their choices do not seem to be adolescents or jealousies, like other movies. The action is pretty good and the actors seem to have good chemistry with each other. An excellent soundtrack with no songs on the radio. It is a match with a film of life and spontaneous journey that deserves more than just a second glance.
