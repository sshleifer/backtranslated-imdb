The review is based on a manufacturer's slit: <br /> <br /> Halloween 5 was the main disappointment in the 'office' back in '89. Personally, I have always loved it and I am proud to have it in my collection. However, because of this failure and also the rights issues, it would be 6 years before we saw the second installment. The film had one of the best, if not the best. Hardcore fan writes a script, returning not only to Donald Pleasence as Dr. Loomis and George Wilbur as Michael Myers, but also back to Tommy Doyle from the first movie, the great studio to support the project and Fall release all that made the movie call making. So what went wrong? I give you two good reasons: Re-shoots and poor editing. Because of poor testing and the failure of Donald Pleasence, the film turned out to be better. The film, like the 3rd and 5th part, was tank-filled and made negative comments from both critics and most series fans. But then, thanks to the magic of booting, the original section leaks out and many fans, including myself, were very happy. I finish this part of my review by saying: This movie is still at least my favorite "Halloween" movie and I'm not afraid to admit it. <br /> <br /> Pros: The score is simply enchanting. He has some series of best writings and a dialogue. "Halloween 4" emulated the original in that it was more temporary and the mood instead of blood and gut 6 is the same. Great performances, especially late and very unanswered by Donald Pleasence. Moves breathtakingly. An interesting explanation of Michael's evil and why he doesn't die. Some cruel killings. Some pretty cool moments, my favorite is Kim Darby's character. Many really cool arrows for previous movies. Some good surprises. Like the previous two queues, it also has a fantastic trap. <br /> <br /> Cons: Although Michael's evil explanation is exciting, he makes a little less intimidating. When can Michael move as fast as possible? Final Thoughts: It was the first "Halloween" I saw in the theater. I was so excited because I really thought 5 would be the last and then I heard it happen. I liked it at the time, but over time I saw it for what it really was: A big movie trapped in OK, a terrible ending. Why did the filmmakers have to listen to the hearings during the trial? If they had released this great version, it could be much better and the series might not be confused right now. <br /> <br /> My Rating: 5/5
