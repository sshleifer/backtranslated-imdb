Hitchcock made at least 11 films about a common man who was wrongly accused, sometimes really rolling, sometimes not) to prove his innocence in a situation that is not under his control, the first being "39 Steps" that really made him popular in Britain. It's really his signature subject. <br /> <br /> Others are "Young and Innocent", "Saboteur", "Spellbound", "Stage Fright", "Strangers on the Train", "I Recognize", "To Try Thief", "The Wrong Man", "bottom of the northwest" and finally "crazy". "Saboteur" begins Robert Cummings as a wartime aviation plant warrior, accused of killing his associate and best friend during factory sabotage. He meets with Patrickia Martin, played by actress Priscilla Lane, and later, of course, several Nazi / fascist supporters along the way. <br /> <br /> "Saboteur" is mainly like "The 39 Steps", including similar plot devices such as handcuffs, a blonde who doesn't trust a character from the beginning, a race across the country (in one case London to Scotland and another to California) to New York) and meet the "colored" locals. And so, just like "The Man Who Knew Too Much", I believe it is an American remake of one of Hitchcock's earlier works. <br /> <br /> I think Robert Cummings was chosen because he is a very common American, kind of "eternal" with whom the audience can be identified. I like Priscilla Lane because her character is more active than Madeline Carroll, "The 39 Steps" and Ruth Roman, "Strangers on train". As mentioned elsewhere, Otto Kruger steals the exhibition as a snare. I liked the result of Vaughan Glaser as a blind uncle; his lines are great. Some funny touches all the way to a comic relief, such as traffic signs with Priscilla Lane character and their circus performers and truck driver Murray Alper. Unlike other opinions here, there are not too many signs that believe Barry Kane's innocence immediately. <br /> <br /> There are some slower parts, mainly when the action moves to New York for the first time, but it will accelerate quickly as the last planned act of the Fifth Columnists takes place. I think it will hit home. <br /> <br /> It makes you think, "Can my co-worker be something wrong?" In fact, one of the posters of "Saboteur" announced "Follow The Man!" Imagine how it played in the minds of adults during World War II.
