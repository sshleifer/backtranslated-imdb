22. JOE (drama, 1970) Joe (Peter Boyle) is a racist factory worker who hated "hippe and ni ** eid". He will meet Bill, a businessman who was murdered by a lover of his young addict Jill (Susan Sarandon). Jill runs away and joins the hippie municipality on the outskirts of the city. Bill turns to Joe for help. Their search leads them through the poorest neighborhoods where both men's inner hatred and reluctance are tested. <br /> <br /> Criticism: this was the first bedtime shot by director John G. Avildsen (an amazing drink containing 'Rocky', 'Karate Kid', 'Split-Image', 'Weekend at Bernie's'). The film is interesting enough to encapsulate turbulent 60s themes and ideas (Vietnam war, black power, women's lib, etc.). It also has Peter Boyle as Joe, one of the first antiheroes of the cinema. He has always been a terrible bossy heavies whose abstract ideas are enforced by his scary presence (he would play Frank Broenet's monster Mel Brook speaks of Young Frankenstein). She reminds me of a little child trapped in a big, foolish, uncomfortable body. The film has a weak script (for example, Joe's and Bill's meeting is a bit random), but he's got a lot of trouble after the taxi driver ends. <br /> <br /> QUOTE: Title Song: "I saw children who sold junkies to children, he wears every time I move because he knows that when I try to hit him, he will hit his head and hit his fat $.
