Look, we rated it as a value of 10 for entertainment. This is a sure comedy, not an epic like Lord of the Rings or the Wind. For comedy, especially these days, it's 10. <br /> <br /> Not a long movie, moving quickly and easily. Kelsey's grammar at home is the role to play, but as the master of the glorious Diesel Department, who is in a war game against the United States nuclear power station to see if terrorists can get a nuclear bomb through our defenses. (sure ironic this plot ... before 911) Don't take this issue seriously as it is mostly laugh from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Rob Schneider is the 2nd Command (eg "Frank Burns") and pulls a lot of laughs. All others are also suitable for these parts. Rip Torn and Bruce Dern. <br /> <br /> Look simple and simple, you have 90 minutes and you have to laugh or choose me and you are not a bride (their language and an inspiration), rent it, or buy (we did) and have fun! I wish they did part 2!
