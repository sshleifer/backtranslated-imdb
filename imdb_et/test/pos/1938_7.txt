"River's Edge" was one of the most annoying films of 1986, and the year that saw "Blue Velvet", you know something is said. Looking at it today, it has lost little power and is much better than overpriced children. The "Children" previews played this way to expose the deterioration of national youth. In fact, it was a little more than a movie of exploitation, which was based mainly on shock. "The Edge of the River" was promoted as a teenage flick, but was much better. The only times when it disturbs an unpleasant one is the constant image of a dead naked body. Beyond this, the film is thought-provoking and quite realistic for all its small mistakes. . Ione Skye is just as likable and pleasant. Dennis Hopper ("Blue Velvet" and "Hoosiers" on his return track) provides an excellent result as a horrible but pathetic generation of hippies. Crispin Glover, always entertaining, seems to be a bit inappropriate as a group of manic hero and leader. The best result is definitely Daniel Roebuck. Like the murderer John, Roebuck is scary emotional. It is a shame that he did not become a star when he was a much better actor than Reeves. <br /> <br /> The movie is awesome and bold. Don't miss this slippery high school John Hughes cliche like "The Breakfast Club". This is a shocking piece of nihilism that resonates with the viewer. Fans of this movie are advised to review the 1983 Canadian "Out of the Blue", directed by Dennis Hopper. The second shocking study of the generation gap and its vagueness may have affected the edge of the river. (7/10)
