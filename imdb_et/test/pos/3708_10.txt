A lot of this movie was beautiful. The spectacular, landscapes and undoubtedly the background of Aaron's cinematography appeared in beautiful shots. It is definitely worth a look, because your attention is always exciting and it ends with the right note. <br /> <br /> The newcomer Jonathan Furr's action was great because I thought he was a pro acting since he was born. He has also acted in other feature films, but this main role is always remembered. <br /> <br /> The film has this academic award that seems to be from time to time, where it's slow and picturesque and quiet, so it's not a movie to add kids to sit on. However, the East Bend and Yadkinville rustic knew well the 1940s film.
