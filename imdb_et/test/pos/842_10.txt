The third film is an incomparably brilliant cycle of Exploitation films and the third masterpiece, "Joshuu Sasori: Kemono-beya". "Female Prisoner Scorpion: Beast Stable" (aka "Sasori: Den Of The Beast", where I live) is a film that differs in some respects from its predecessors, but which equals (or supposedly even surpasses) them in glory. The entire original Sasor series, along with the excellent Meiko Kaj, is distinguished by the absolute highlight of the WIP cinema, and all the films, especially the first three, uniquely combine Exploitation and Art-house cinema, like no other film. "Beast Stable" is the third and second "Sasor" movie with Meiko Kaji, the last one to be headed by Genius Director Shunya Ito and I think the biggest of them all. The first film "Joshuu 701-gô: Sasori" is the concept of the 1972 absolute masterpiece of exploitation cinema and simply the way of using it. In the same brilliant first stage, "Joshuu Sasori: Dai-41 zakkyo-bô" added more surrealism and symbolism. The third "Sasor" film "Beast Stable" keeps surrealism (though it is not quite as big as the other one) and contains even more social criticism than its predecessors. The main topics of the film are topics such as poverty, forced prostitution and exploitation of the poor. <br /> <br /> This third "Sasor" movie is brilliant and sublime in all respects, but is arguably the biggest, generally brilliant, cycle (for me it's the first, first, close). Again, "best stable" is both highly artistic and very exploitative. The visually stunning film represents enormous brutal violence and again a gap, as well as enormous surreal beauty. Amazingly beautiful Meiko Kaji is once again in the role of Nami Matsushima (aka Sasori). I'm doing this wonderful actor absolutely and I'm sure I'm not the only one who does it. The rest of the performances are also great, especially Mikio Narita is an excellent police inspector who is embedded in Sasor's capture. The music score is the same in all three films, the main theme of which is "Lord-Bush", which is played by Meiko Kaji himself, which is great because the score is just pure perfection. As its predecessors, "Beast Stable" is an absolutely brilliant masterpiece of exploitation-art that no serious movie lover can afford. The entire Sasori cycle is high on my personal favorite list of all time. "Beast Stable" is undoubtedly their brilliant masterpiece! 10/10
