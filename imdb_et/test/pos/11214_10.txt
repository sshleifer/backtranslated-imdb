Uzak (2002), a Turkish film featured in the USA as "Distant", has been staged, produced, written and filmed by Nuri Bilge. <br /> <br /> Ceylan. <Br /> <br /> This movie is a sharp and harsh version of the collision between "the mouse", the "mouse", Mahmut, Muzaffer Ã–zdemir, and Emin Toprak. <br /> <br /> Both men are great actors and the graph allows them to show their skills. (Tragically, Emin Toprak died in a car accident shortly after the movie was finished.) <br /> <br /> In most of the country's cousin / city cousin stories, the contrast between country and urban life styles is humorous. There's little humor or even heat in this movie. Both men have lost contact with human society. Mahmuti's work as a commercial photographer of the record label gives him satisfaction. He has divorced a woman he clearly loves and has no satisfactory human relationships. <br /> <br /> The plant has lost its job due to its small town factory and has no skills or energy to find a job in the city. His human activities are mainly limited to silent observations of other people who cross his path. He is a clearly warm and caring person, but unable to express these qualities in an urban environment. <br /> <br /> Relatives are not well connected to the world and they are not well connected. Also, do not try to act in a way that would give the opportunity to glue or close. In some ways, this film is an opportunity that is wasted. One might think that every cousin could have provided at least part of what was missing in the second life. Instead, they run parallel unhappy courses. These two men are far away, which is the situation proposed by the film title. These details tell us more about characters than we could have learned through a simple exposition. This is not a "work movie" in the traditional sense of this genre. This is a work film because it shows the detrimental effects of dissatisfied work (Mahmut) and unemployment (Yusuf). <br /> <br /> This is a silent, absorbent, dark film. Though it doesn't look joyful, I went out of the theater knowing that I had seen a truly creative and <br /> <br /> important movie. This movie is worth finding and seeing!
