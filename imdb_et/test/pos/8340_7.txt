This is one of those films that seem so "dated" that being in this way is part of the fun. You see and hear things you don't see or hear today on the silver screen. Some are good; some are too horns for words, some are bad (depending on your point of view on certain cultural issues.) <br /> <br /> For example, in this short (68 minute) 1931 movie there is: <br /> Family Grandfather who has raised the value of patriotism in this reading and why should we speak to criminals for the United States (a picture in contemporary movies!) <br /> <br /> The district commissioner (Walter Huston) almost spoke of the death penalty and the people showed that it supports it's 100 percent (again in today's movies). Violence, like a young boy who was picked up a few times and literally thrown into the closet, and his father was raised and repeatedly pushed to the head wall. This is an insignificant hard thing. <br /> <br /> But the film has a comedy, mostly by a patriotic grandfather playing pleasantly by Charles "Chic" Sales. For all those watching this unique criminal movie, there is a bunch of laughs. And with soft touches, there are two young boys, one of whom - Dickie Moore - became a very famous child artist. Here he is only a 5-year-old little girl who is, of course, a polished actor, but you can see him in front of him. In fact, he made the "Blonde Venus" with a solid result next year, starring Marlene Dietrich. <br /> <br /> In any case, it's an entertaining film because of the powerful mix of violence, comedy, and sentimentality. .... and it has a nice sensitive ending and a thoughtful message. For "Best Writing, Original Story" it was also for the Academy Award. I'm sorry to say it's only available for cable TV because it's never put on a VHS or DVD ..... and it's a shame.
