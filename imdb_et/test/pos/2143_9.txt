I first saw this movie in 1980. I have learned from other sources that the only 219-minute section release was in New York, after which 149 minutes were severely cut. So, I think I saw the first shorter version, which at the time was very interesting to the westerner, when it was a little confusing ... <br /> <br /> So it was even more interesting to finally get a full-length version of the DVD. I'm glad I did because this second review has assured me that the movie is a real classic, and the critical vitriol poured on Michael Cimino was unreasonable, at least to say. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a long film, but so are many others. For example: Uncommon in America (1984) 227 minutes; Cleopatra (1963) 320 minutes; Ten Commandments (1956) 220 minutes; Spartacus {Reverted Version} (1960) 198 minutes; The wind passed (1939) 222 minutes and others. So, it can't be a driving time that made so much foam back through the mouth when the sky gate came into the scene. <br /> <br /> Please note that all these films are topical in strengthening myths about history and heroes. <br /> <br /> Not so heavenly gate: in this narrative, America's West shows all its grim and unfair harshness, injustice and poverty. And this is probably the first reason why so many did not like this film: it set Johnson County's war situation in Wangoming in 1892, showing how the Wyoming Farmers' Association hired 50 burglars to accuse and murder a large number of European immigrants for bovine rusting and murder; and all with the help and involvement of the authorities, to the President of the United States. Because this war essay, with the background and what happened, is a link in Wikipedia during the Johnson County War. <br /> <br /> Very few want to remind you of truly dirty periods in your country's history and flying to the country that should be. If it had been a documentary, it would have been barely tasty for the majority; for entertainment it was almost for commercial reasons and intermittent and infamous. <br /> <br /> Aside from the socio-political diatribe that Cimino launched here, what is the narrative? the story of the three main characters? Well, it was probably not unusual for the men of this time to fall prey to the local prostitute, just as it was probably not unusual. This is a fairly common triangle of love, according to which Ella must choose between two men and ultimately decide for a younger man Nathan, who, while not exceeding the murder of cold blood, if it suits him, shows more spirit and commitment than older James (or Jim, like most movie people say). For some, this part of the story is perhaps too slow; In the context of the broader narrative of war, it seems to me to be entirely appropriate. And this war is graphically, brutally and brutally depicted with finely staged and edited carnage. flawlessly? although the final bloodshed between the association and the immigrants is sure some of the intermediate wagons will be repeated. A small point and perhaps a 219-minute cut to restore? Somehow you look at it, but it will hit you with the eyes, the dust, the chaos and the confusion of war ... <br /> <br /> What brings me to the second criticism: noise and dust are often difficult to hear and even see what's going on. I testify that I found it to be annoying, even upside down, to play parts to try out a picture or words? Until I realized that it was not really necessary if you agreed with the director's intention: life is chaotic, it is hard to hear and seen in overcrowded situations and in the war, this mise-scene is a sine qua non. In short, it is as if you were really present and inside the scenes ... <br /> <br /> And what's the title? From Shakespeare, this refers to the figurative proximity to God and, if you equal God with the natural world, a stunning landscape that passes through the film? and is it stunning, hauntingly equal to David Lean's doctor in Zhivago (1965)? is a useful metaphor. I think, however, that Ziminol had something more, namely the idea of ​​brave immigrants? God's Scary Salt? it was forbidden to enter heaven on earth and the freedom to build life for himself in the land of freedom. <br /> <br /> Was it Cimino's intention? to capture the American West Myth? To show how the rich in America is getting rich, while the poor are being killed historically in one way or another? Is this something new? Not really, as we all know. If it really hurts, how to show how America was not, and as a result, it's not a free and brave country. Instead of absorbing this narrative, we have the impression that the basic principles of America are more related to the land of lost slaves and the home of candles.
