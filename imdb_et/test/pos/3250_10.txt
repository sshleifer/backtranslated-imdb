I saw two hands in Sydney a few years ago and it became one of my favorite films of all time. It has action, adventure, comedy and romance, all rolled into one (and a little bit of music that has been thrown for good action). Like a lot of Australian films, the plot is easy to follow, but admirable, and Jordan should be proud of its work. <br /> <br /> In any case, it was already on TV on Channel 4 in London, and my two favorite comedy scenes were not only cut off for this movie, but indeed for every movie! So, if you watch this movie, make sure it's the original version.
