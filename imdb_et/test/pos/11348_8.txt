Held in Hong Kong in 1962 (at worrying times, as we know), this extremely intimate story of two married people involved in their tradition fails to resemble the old Hollywood scene after a lush color scene. still modest sensuality (unlike the required sexuality and random scenes that have become part of the film's romance) and the use of facial expressions to suggest mood or communication in subtle changes. Marguerite Duras's influence here is not difficult to see, as he is known as a minimalist narrative, and also describes a powerful drama using verbal and non-verbal conversation between the two strong bonds of art as well as the use of the regime. - Functional scenes that can end up in the life of both characters. From Hiroshima MON AMOUR to MODERATO CANTABILE, his pen is clearly visible here as we enter into the tight spaces of Mr. Chow (Tony Leung) and Mrs. Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) with the latest scenes, which explain the intensity of regret, that he feels that he recalls the possibility that this relationship was reaffirmed. <br /> <br /> The plot is even similar to what Duras could have written: Mr. Chow and Mrs Su Li-zhen, neighbors in a neighboring rental apartment, although both are quite successful professionals, will discover the most banal how their spouses cheat on them, and they naturally discover that it is with each other. The question is, should they act according to what they know about each other or are not similar to their partners? Every scene has the idea that at any time they give in to each other and at one point it is recommended that they finally make it so intrusive when the camera describes our meetings (which appear to be the frequent changes in Cheung dresses that showed it every day), we never see it. And as none of these spouses see their story of love, wearing them with their attraction does not mean that separating them is even tougher, because every moment we want something - a catalyst - and the only one who comes is when Leung discovers that he loves him, followed by his quietly brutal revelation that he never leaves his husband, which means he is not his. It also gives us an insight into what culture and timing can do: from the Western point of view, finishing their romance would have been more solid, lasting, especially in the 1960s, but because it is Hong Kong, cultural values ​​are very different. <br /> <br /> Performances here are at a high level: it's very easy to play horrible love, but the constant play of repressed, platonic relationships that is desirable is hardly recommended. makes the whole sensuality more brain than sensitive or visual. Cheung and Leung laugh and their desperate chemistry stays long after the credit rolls.
