this is a beautiful movie. The scenes are well captured. The Revere dialogues are really well-written and inspiring, the philosophy and thoughts that this film gives and teaches make it wonderful and wonderful. <br /> <br /> Mickey Rooney is big in the movie and his role is going through a lot of emotional confusion when the movie is progressing. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Taylor looks very beautiful, her scenes in the film are essentially poetic, the camera follows her, and how the music feels you are so beautiful every scene. <br /> <br /> This movie has a great spirit and beloved cherished classic. <br /> <br /> Angela Lansbury is quite entertaining in her role, though recognizable as a "m" in the Manchur candidate. <br /> <br /> Donald Crisp has done his father's role in full justice and the script gives him enough things to justify his role. <br /> <br /> This very nice movie and must look at the family and the kids for evergreen Christmas.
