I saw this movie originally leased by Blockbuster VHS. It was a while ago, but it was still remembered. Blockbuster no longer has it. Netflix didn't have it and there were not many copies on the web - just a few VHS copies. Recently, I finally found it in eBays DVD format at a reasonable price (in PAL format, but our DVD player plays PAL discs on our NTSC TV). <br /> <br /> My husband and I both enjoyed it. The film's style is a bit strong and many, if not most, parts are quite overwhelmed if the amateurs did it (especially the kids), but it's not cumbersome. The contrast of societies is emphasized in overplay. <br /> <br /> There is little political preaching, saying that the Russian youth should not try to escape their not so big life, but at least try to do things better first. But it is not dominant. Most of the time it's quite humorous. <br /> <br /> Some of the western games others have commented on is that at IMO I took the Russian characters' expectations as a comment. At least when it's taken from my western perspective. Perhaps it is a Russian sight in the west (it is literally a character). <br /> <br /> I can't say how literally English subtitles are for a movie, but I can say that subtitles are done very well, full of English idioms, as the English-speaking speaker - "colored "with language.
