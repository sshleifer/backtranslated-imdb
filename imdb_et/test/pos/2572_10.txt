I think it's called the Southern Goth. <br /> <br /> He marks Samuel L. Jackson, Christina Ricci and Justin Timberlake. Timberlake does a good job, to my surprise, I didn't expect it from him. <br /> <br /> If you're lost and you can't find your way home - it's a black snake. br /> <br /> The people in this movie will certainly lose in many ways, psychologically and emotionally damaged, betrayed by those whom they trusted and loved and filled with much pain. <br /> <br /> Samuel L. Jackson is playing a blues singer / musician - whose husband is confused with his brother and has left his brother with the abortion he had hoped to get with him. <br /> <br /> A woman who has been sexually abused as a young man - this has made her self-destructive nymphomania; allowing men to treat him badly. <br /> <br /> The story lies at the intersection of these two characters. This is a love story, but not a story of sexual love between them - an older black man and a young white woman. <br /> <br /> It's different from most movies in Hollywood. br /> I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> 10 stars
