Although Cover Girl's plot is very thin and tired, it works well enough as an anchor to musical numbers from Kerni and Gershwin. After signing her in Gilda, Hayworth chose a star with that music that seemed customized for her. In addition to looking as beautiful as ever, she also impresses with her dance. Gene Kelly, who was borrowed from Columbia for MGM, fits in with her dancing, and the sequence she smells like was well done. Supporting characters also acted competently. Personally, I didn't enjoy Cover Girl as much as the music of Hayworth, made with Fred Astaire. Cover Girl is, however, very fun and easy to recommend. My score: 7/10.
