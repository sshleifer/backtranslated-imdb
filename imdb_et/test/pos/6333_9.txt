Having seen the film years ago and disappointed with its destructive potential, I heard that I heard it was becoming a television series. My best friend immediately became a rabid fan and knowing that my love for horror movies couldn't believe I wouldn't look at any episode. I told him the film was so frightening for me when life was touched by BUFFY, and he said I forgot that the movie even existed. He stressed that I would give two episodes: "once more feeling" and this one. <br /> <br /> Both of them are why I am a BUFFY fan today. He was right - I was immediately trying. I have never seen the courage to show that it would be a breeze to try an episode that does not have a dialogue, and nothing else could have drawn it with a pan and BUFFY with pure creativity. I think X FILES could have taken it away if they first thought it, but I'm glad that BUFFY did it instead. <br /> <br /> This is a credit for all involved, that you have been swallowed within an hour, sometimes hanging on the edge of your seat. And when it was over, I wanted to know more about every character. So I went out and bought one box for one season. And the rest is history ... <br /> <br /> I guarantee you that if you have never seen it, you will want to see more if you make this episode the first. <br /> <br /> The only reason I don't give 10 to 10 is that I reserve this score "repeatedly ..."
