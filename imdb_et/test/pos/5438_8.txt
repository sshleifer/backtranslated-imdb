This movie was really different from what I had imagined, but exceeded my expectations. This film has exactly the right mix of comedy, drama, political criticism and satire (not necessarily in that order). Without patronizing or wisenheimer, it opens up the open and fine problems of our capitalist democratic high-tech society. It will make you laugh at once and stay in the mindset later. For those who wanted to "invite a dog" and wanted to be humane and human politicians, this movie should definitely be a choice! <br /> <br /> "Politicians are much like diapers: they should often be changed for the same reasons."
