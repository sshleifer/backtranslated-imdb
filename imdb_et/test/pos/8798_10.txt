the film itself is absolutely brilliant, its buzz, the speed that makes you just want to go, blow your wages and rid yourself. This is what the weekend is, our sanitary conditions, where we can come together and be ourselves without care in the world. The film is layered in depth and the on-site dialogue is on the spot, especially with Jip. Characteristic features are instantly pleasing, one is obviously the nature of colors and his views on what Star Wars really touches are genius. <br /> <br /> If you have an hour before you leave, you will be left with it, you will feel confident right now, we definitely recommend it.
