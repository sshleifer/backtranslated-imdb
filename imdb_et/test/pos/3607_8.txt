Captain Corell's Mandolin is one of Nicolas Cage's best films. It makes the title's character finely. This is the romance that is placed on the background of a worn torn island. The character of John Hurt gives his daughter Penelope Cruz the beautiful advice on love that is beautifully played. This movie is not entirely predictable. This film also allows Cruz to perform as a strong woman who knows her mind and heart. When the film warms up after the opening sequence, it focuses on that film. Again, Nicolas Cage was not disappointed.
