I saw it through cable television. Although I only saw two lines, I love this drama. I am expecting more lines to be vented by cable. <br /> <br /> Although it describes a terrible, absurd situation in a prison camp, it shows us an inseparable spirit, warmth, friendship and humanity. They do not know whether they can survive or not, but they kept their hopes strong without having failed. <br /> <br /> I know this movie is not realistic like any other movie, but I don't want to blame. It makes me believe the strong will of the most difficult people. Especially this episode deeply touched my heart. <br /> <br /> I remember every scene. I always hate math. But after seeing this drama, I can understand something about mathematics ... Mathematics is his relationship between the past and the present, also symbolizing eternity. <br /> <br /> 'Time, light, and memory surrounded by a circle.' Like other war victims, he lost his love with an irresistible fate. I put on my time and memory as if I had the same thing. <br /> <br /> He suffered a great deal of loss, but he has pure instruction. <br /> <br /> He started his studies at the camp, his pleasure to understand, <br /> <br /> I believe his commitment to learning remained with him. <br /> <br /> I saw it several times, but the meaning of this movie has never disappeared. Every time I saw it, I feel the same deep emotion. <br /> <br /> * Their songs are beautiful, harmonious, <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I can't listen to OST.
