This movie is great. In the 80s, a film sliding through three children who were born in the dark, killing everyone they see. The reason they kill is practically meaningless, but it just adds to the charm of this movie. And these kids are crazy, especially Curtis. Once you've seen the movie, you know who I'm talking about. This boy is crazy! Although the film does not have much gore, it is entertaining and for some reason cares for the characters. She also has nice nudity. There is some decent behavior, really decent 80-year-old movie, it is worth checking out if you have the opportunity to see it. However, you have those terrible children who guarantee you!
