The original story and funny compelling characters went well for teenage girls who had a semi-film (2 times). I loved it, it was fun and moved fast, not dull drawn scenes. It is violent and has little language (although most of them are covered). This is a great movie. David Strickland was a terrible actor. Ron Eldard gave an excellent result. I look at it every time with girls.
