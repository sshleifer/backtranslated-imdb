If you have ever been, there is a friend or child who was skating at one time or was, and then see this flick !. I've seen it several times and I get something new about it every time. It reminded me why I started skating first (long ago). It reminded me of what skating brings to a person and I think it also helps a person who doesn't understand why the skiers are doing well. Of course, the entire visible very dark side, which the film touches a little. But it tends to focus more on what is at the center of skating. Just a person on board, doing it because they love to do it. This film was so inspiring to me that I was skating again (I'm 32) and I haven't been happy with myself over the years. T.
