It's short and point. This movie was great! I love it! I took this Hollywood video for 3 volts during VHS and looked at it about 5 times in the last 5 weeks. I'm a big Bogart fan and I just locked this movie. I thought the song was funny and now it's ringing in the phone. Robert Sacchi is great and pulls off good Bogarti. His nose is a little big, his voice is a mix of Bogart-Columbo and he does some things that are inconvenient, but otherwise he was fantastic and the film was wonderful. No one can be the perfect Bogart, but he was great. Remember that Sam Marlow is a fan of Bogart and is not going to do everything he did. He mentions many other films and does some things that were never part of the true character of Bogart. But it is so funny and fun and it has a great casting, including some beautiful women. See it and enjoy it!
