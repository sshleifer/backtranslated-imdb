Great fiction film, following Bill & Tom's adventures, two high school friends in the opposite direction of the spectrum. Bill (Eric Stolz) prefers to live life directly, while his friend Tom (Chris Penn) doesn't take anything seriously except for partying. When Bill moves out of her mother's house to live independently, she faces many questions, from her girlfriend, her brother, her landlord. Meanwhile, his friend moves to Tom to rent, but continues Bill's life backwards. This movie is a non-stop comedy from start to finish and is my favorite. The soundtrack has Edward Van Halen, the guitarist of the guitar, throughout the film, with reflections by rockers Lee Ving and Ron Wood. 70s Pornstar Legend Kitten Navidad also has a look! The classic price of 80's movies is worth it. Now all you have to do is the much anticipated DVD edition! If you liked this movie, check out The The American American, similar to Wild Life. I appreciate it so much.
