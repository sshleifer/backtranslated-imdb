It's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I looked for about 20 minutes, a little confused about what's going on. Then I started to laugh and didn't stop long after the movie ended. Such a color of death is really rare. Christopher Guest has a real eye for humor that is characteristic of those who do not have a sense of humor (about 90% of white heterosexual men). As the "Guffman Waiting", American idiotic self-importance in the middle of the nail is important to the wall. I can't wait for my next movie.
