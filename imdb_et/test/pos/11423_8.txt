Stan as a bull fighter and a good surprise. Usually, Oliver Hardy overshadows this silent short, allowing him to take the lead and the limelight. <br /> <br /> It can only be concluded that his character "Rhubarb Vaselino" was a parody of many Rudolph Valentino films. Be prepared to laugh foolishly in some dialogue and observe special effects. <br /> <br /> I watched it on DVD Vol. 1 & 2 collection.
