This is the first movie I've ever heard on a video, and 14 years later I still have the same copy. Elizabeth Taylor was twelve times faster than ever before, Mickey Rooney gave the real dimension to Mi Taylor, and Donald Crisp was sure as ever. The amazing Anne Revere, like Mrs Madam, seemed to be the smartest woman in the world. After nearly 60 years, the heat, humor and excitement of this film will affect the viewer; we still laugh joke, root the pie, and love velvet for the spirit and the ability to love that it displays. I love it as an adult just as I loved it as a child. Every family has a video collection obligation.
