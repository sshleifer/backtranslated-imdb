The reader is exceptionally well done and very sweet. Each part of the work contributes to creating a pure emotional response to the script. Well done, managed, shot and written. I was surprised when I heard there was no trial before shooting, not even reading. Performances show good fine instinctive action in response to a well written script. The work of the actors was great and never showed their work slipping into a purely sentimental one. Less is much better in this case. This film is a great example of how these low-budget contracts benefit both participants and filmmakers.
