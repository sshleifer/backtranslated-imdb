The joy and tragedy of the Christmas season lies in the fact that it revolves around the family mostly. That's why some people call it "children's holidays". As we age, natural friction and advancements remove people and things that gave us special memories. John Denver plays a successful NYC architect and a new widow with George Billings, who lost his wife about a year earlier, in one of his loved roles. His life is focused on his 9-year-old daughter Alex; both are still losing their damage. George is trying his best to make a special Christmas for his daughter. Enter his boss, Thomas Renfield (played foolishly by the flagship Flagg M * A * S * H ​​boy, Edward Winters), who sends George to Georgetown, CO to investigate a possible real estate transaction. Staying with her daughter, that the purpose of the trip is rather a holiday than a job, rides George and Alex to a city where they immediately experience a lovingly generous but somewhat eccentric set of characters whose main eccentricity is that they all believe in Santa Claus. Georgetown is a photo library community that we all would love to live in and we would love our neighbors. George will soon meet Susan's love (Jane Kazmarek.) If it weren't Renfield, it would be the perfect time. The fact is, however, that he is in the city to find real estate for Renfield to develop real estate development, and near the city is a nice beach, which is closed, and the dark edges of the film rotate around town closure and reaction. livestock farmers and outsiders. I don't break the end for those who have never seen the movie. It is a typical happy Christmas, but it is processed in a rather fine and credible way, showing the best in the human spirit without being too syrup. All in all, this is the most pleasant way to spend a couple of your Christmas TV lessons. John Denver and Jane Kazmarek have a nice chemistry and Gennie James as Alex is doing a good job. I've always loved Mary Wickes, an actor of recognizable character, and all other cast members do a good job with less muscle parts. This is a regular Christmas ticket for my family; I appreciate it 4/5.
