A beautiful movie from the early silent cinema coming to China. SHADOW MAGIC combines the story of love with the drama of the cultural collision between ancient Chinese culture and contemporary Western culture. An amazing first film by Chinese director Ann Hu. When I correctly understood Hu Hu's comments at the 2000 Sundance Festival, this film was produced as an American film co-funded by the Chinese Government and shot in China. SHADOW MAGIC reminds me of films such as IL POSTINO and CINEMA PARADISO - not necessarily by subject or plot, but by the same feeling.
