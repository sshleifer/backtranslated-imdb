When Nathaniel Kahn started this journey, he barely knew who his father really was. At the end of the film, he found him and reached the strange life he lived as a child. <br /> <br /> Louis Kahn was a father. He was an architect architect. His designs were perhaps too complicated because he tried to build buildings that did not meet popular trends at that time. It is ironic that he never achieved fame that was so easy for some of his companions. He had a vision and he had never lost it. We see the characteristics of our unique style in the buildings it left to humanity. Each of his creations is unique because they do not imitate the works of other architects. <br /> <br /> The life of Louis Kahn was quite complicated. She was married, but she had things to do with her two assistants who produced a girl and a boy, along with her husband, with such a legitimate daughter. Separated area away from father who only visited late at night. Louis Kahn never recognized these children, although it is very clear that they all knew the existence of others. <br /> <br /> It is tragic that Louis Kahn died alone at Grand Central Station when he returned from a trip and women he never recognized for himself. He probably took care of all his children, but he was left with the whole movie. We can never feel a man, though in the end Nathaniel finds most of the missing pieces in his father's discovery of life. <br /> <br /> This is a personal account of the life of the artist. Thanks to this son who has the courage to speak the story, we are almost strange to the lives of Louis Kahn and his extended family.
