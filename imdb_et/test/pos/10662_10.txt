Sergei Eisenstein's most famous film has proven time trial. The rebellion on the warship in 1905 is a feeling of Soviet propaganda, but it does a good job of showing the conditions that caused the rebellion. The scene of Odessa's steps should remain in everyone's mind. <br /> <br /> Okay, so "Battleship Potemkin" wasn't really the first movie, but here they did a great job. Certainly, the history of each movie should show this movie. This is a great historical drama (although I admit I don't know how accurate it is). The rating is 10/10. We should now learn that "Potemkin" should be transliterated as "Potomkin".
