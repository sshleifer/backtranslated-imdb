I had heard of "games" and "Dungeons and Dragons" before, but I knew it might be like what I saw in "Gamers: Dorkness Rising". These guys are so funny and fun to watch. Especially a boy who plays "bard" or "minstrel" or whatever, has a gift for physical comedy and timing. In some scenes there is so much humor and energy that makes you really think that at least some of it was improvised there. The special effects had to work a little bit, but I saw it at last year's conference and this is one of the things they said they were going to do again and get better results, so it's probably annoying!
