When I first saw this movie, I was just a little boy and I fell in love with them, they're no longer making such films, I look at it again a bit older and still love it. <br /> <br /> Humor is perfect and very well suited to film, all gags are childish, but they make adults laugh and the film is very rare for children. <br /> <br /> Animation is amazing and viewing hand-drawn animation is a real breath of fresh air for all the computer animations we see today. The backgrounds are stunning and the coloring is amazing. <br /> <br /> Characters are just the characters you love when you look at girls. Songs are fun to listen to, and some just really want to cry or get up and dance, as well as have fun watching visual humor to go with them. Voice action is undoubtedly a great doubt even when most of the votes are high pitch, but the interesting thing came up and it was one of the songs of this movie, but it slowed down to show the real voices behind them and see it really fun. <br /> <br /> If you see it in a movie shop or rent it somewhere, I'll say it's really worth it and it's a perfect family movie that's amazing, words can't express that movie.
