What Porky looks like hangs out as a pretty touching film about youth and love. <br /> <br /> The story concerns three friends, Gary, Ricky and David, who spend after school looking for sex. When a new girl arrives in town, Gary falls in her crushed heels. <br /> <br /> The film goes from a creepy film to a teenage uncertainty test. It is funny and sad at the same time. It never gives the love story to the formula that seems to be prominent in every film. You know the boy meets the girl, the man loses the girl, the man gets back to the final frame. This formula is thrown aside when a boy meets a girl. Maybe I liked this movie so much. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is especially good and the end is a solid teardrop. It may also be one of the most realistic endings I've ever seen in the love story. <br /> <br />
