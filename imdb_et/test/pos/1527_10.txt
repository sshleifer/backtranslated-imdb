This is an amazing movie and it is very smart to use few players and sets. It is also very shocking - physical and psychological torture (both explicit and implicit) mixes with calm and even humorous stretches. So horror is always unexpected and brutal. I'm not soft, but it should be the most shocking film I've ever seen. The message of this movie will definitely be slipped together. This is a movie I always remember for both participants.
