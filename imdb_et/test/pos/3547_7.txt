Robert Altman, Nicolas Roeg, John-Luc Goddard - did you expect a fun movie that the whole family could enjoy? These and other directors were probably chosen because they did not follow the mainstream, but created it. For those who complain that they did not follow the original story of the opera - How often does the music on the film directly relate to the event in the film? This is the mood that counts. This is what I believe the leaders of these films did: creating a modern mood for old operas. In most cases, they succeed very well. With all the operas they like. We could have used more Beverly Sills. <br /> <br /> Finally, what is art (even an opera) without a few naked women?
