The blue ribbon banners, stars and stripes forever, decorated generals and unconditional surrender of enemies who needed tons and tons of radiation, were the United States winning the World War II victory! Both in Times Square and elsewhere in the United States, national zenith is celebrated !!! America is on the right right! one thing, one tempting and carefully perverted thing .. Adjustment period! .. The real party ended when the bottle of champagne was completed. Now everyone needs to go ahead with their life ... just one problem. they have to get new lives ... old lives are lost forever ... Courtesy and pleasant smiles were in a fragile facade of ice cubes in boiling water! Everyone in the film's characters has inevitable primary doubts and can't mask the pretense of how something was not seriously wrong, just because it wasn't true! When the Sergeants and Generals and their wives and daughters and sons and practically all the other Americans who were affected by the World War had been exposed to disability, nightmares and accusations of World War II, and what he really achieved and denied, nobody was the same !! At the moment, social and moral issues were self-serving ... Frederick March and Myrna Loy had to start! Dana Andrews realized she would never have to marry Virginia Maya! Theresa Wright is painfully aware that she is constructive selfish !! But no less, if the character, Homer, is married and he thinks all his injuries around him are as devastating as he is, basically in the sense that they can't or do not want to cope! <br /> The reason why this movie is so fabulous is because the happy ending was achieved hard when everyone acknowledged the beginning of the new United States and the new world, the tragedy of the Second World War and the things that were emotionally recognized violated were taken step by step and treated accordingly ! Frederick March and Myrna Loy have to return to the first chapter of their marriage, Homer has recognized his new bride as having to be married to her (ie half a time, she feels like a sister) and involving Thresa Wright in Dana Andrews means that her entrance adulthood has caused partial responsibility for breaking the marriage ... It is equivalent to learning to drive a car to get your driving license in Indianapolis 500 ... Movie characters are typical after World War II Americans because they are stuck by rude awakening forced changes in their lives ... Happiness is no longer given a luxury adjective cop-aesthetic ... it's now scary conditions, and a good winning over bad less ugly choice! ... World War II did not happen easily! From now on it is dominated by social models of American life. <br /> <br /> The World War II crash has also reflected most of the American feelings of personal inadequacy! I loved this movie and so did AFI, probably because it brought out issues that were unjustifiably taboo! .. bottom line, watch this movie !! In films and television, there is a constant vision of the struggle, the worries about the accident and / or the reorganization of a marriage, the coping of life, in films and on television, if it is a person suffering from a disability and simply a working person. it's 1946 !! It's very new to Americans. Director William Wyler has illustrated how Americans are familiar with the consequences of World War II on those days when the film industry has left him behind one hand !!! Take this into account and you probably understand how this film was sensational !!
