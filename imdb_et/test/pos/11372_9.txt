I believe it has been this series for over 40 years, but the memory of it has not been slightly lost. This would be natural for reissuing DVDs, it seems to me. Many performers have gained more fame (Robert Hardy, Sean Connery to name a couple); even though it was a small role, I still remember Judy Dench from his 20s as Katherine of France (Henry V). Now she was very cute. <br /> <br /> This site has a hint that the series has been filmed in color - is it? Who would know about us - practically no color television is available these days. Unfortunately, there is no VCR; if so, some may save it. As a way of teaching English history, this series gave so few classroom teachers alive. <br /> <br /> What kind of fine does it give out again?
