Pierre Jolivet plays the character of Don Quixote, who is unable to speak and live in a world in conflict with modern life. He hopes that his home armor - helmet, sleeves and spear - is made of hubcaps, seat cushions and end-of-life office furniture. Just as Don Quixote traveled with Rocicante, "The Man" is driving his contraction (literally) that transcends the lost lives that have hit the harsh and humiliating worlds of today - growing over the earth, away from the situation of modern man. Both characters are driving in search of adventure, trying to justify the lies of the world. Both characters are guardians of values ​​who do not know most of the characters from other characters. <br /> <br /> Unlike the Cervantes story, in this film, we more directly identify the anachronistic ideals of the main character. We can compare this alien and the forbidden landscape to the lush and beautiful world in which we live. Our reference framework is an area of ​​fantasy that a single knight may remember. Our vision would be one that hopes the main character wins, loses, makes his world (better) back to a world where there no longer exists. <br /> <br /> We watch this movie and see a real knight between the human-animal world. Don Quixote considered himself a true knight among the animals. <br /> <br /> The Cervantes story is only seen by a dreamer without understanding the extent of his anachronistic shift. The story of Besson and Jolivet shows that the new world is the sight of Don Quixote, because we value the same visions and ideals as the crucifix main character.
