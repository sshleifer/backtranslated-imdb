THIS REVIEW may include spoilers! The decline of western civilization ..... what a big title eh? And a tough big movie. This is the best show I've ever seen. A close second is the Talking Heads movie "Stop Making Sense". I heard this movie for the first time when Waynes World was released in 1992. I looked at the director's name at Penelope Spheer and thought of the cool name he was leading? I thought the first name was pronounced like an envelope. After a while watching movie guides, I found a critically acclaimed setback and realized that Penelope was a woman ..... my mother repaired me. I spent 8 years in my life trying to suppress it. Finally I saw it in VHS in Vancouver, where I am now. It was worth the wait. This makes LA punk movement very good. This is a teenager angst when it is best. My favorite is a band that needs subtitles because Darby Crash is singing so crazy, you don't understand. I laughed when I saw it. Black Flag band lives in abandoned church and band X is a very intelligent bunch. We also laughed in a letter where an idiot writes to Slash Magazine about how we don't have to rescue whales, there are huge miles out of the sea so we can pour toxins! After that, I became a big Penelope Spheeris fan and saw all his punk movies - Dudes was OK and Suburbia is a cult classic! I have both of them on VHS. She is a true underground filmmaker and I love her. I would have loved seeing this movie in 1994 when the grunge was so popular. So I was a big fan of Nirvana, but unfortunately I saw it in 2002 and since then I've grown from grunge and now I'm listening to the Crystal method / Fatboy Sick. I know the pace has changed, but what can you do? But if you want a real image of a punk movement, it grabs it better than anything. Much better than 1991. It's a tough movie to watch, but if you pick it up, rent it even if you don't like the music that's great work. It is now easier to find the days when a DVD is so popular. By the way, as Penelope produced the little-known Albert Brooks movie called "Real Life", which I would embrace. Very funny things in today's reality TV craptacular! Rent drop ...... Highly recommended! Thank you!
