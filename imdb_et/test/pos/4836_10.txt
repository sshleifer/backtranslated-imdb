I saw this movie for the first time about 3 years ago. I was shocked at how stupid the FBI was to prevent such a tragedy. It could have been easily prevented. This movie was simply incredible. <br /> <br /> Now that you see it after September 11, I am shocked and it could be said that it would have been easier to avoid because most people would want to know. <br /> <br /> This movie is 100% true <br /> <br /> In the last scene, when the first attack is crafted with a helicopter into the prison and rides over the towers, he makes a note of cooling the spine. it laughed when he said it. "Next time we bring them down * DAY *." This was actually said by Ramzi Yousef after his arrest. <br /> <br /> This movie shows that the first attacks occurred under the FBI and NYPD nose. This shows how the 1st and 4th changes in the attacks are partly to blame. <br /> <br /> I watch this movie now and know that both attacks could have been prevented.
