I love the Thackeray novel on which this film is based. And while this modern version of Becky Sharp's story is a B-film, Loy's highlighting in his first cutting edge role is quite exciting. <br /> <br /> Before Loy became an MGM for a ruling girl of good quality and comic, she was an actor. VANITY FAIR was the film of Loy's aftermath for EMMA, where he played a buggy and greedy daughter who almost destroys a loyal housekeeper (Marie Dressler). <br /> <br /> Loy's Becky is much more nastier than Miriam Hopkins version 3 years later at BECKY SHARP. Loy's Becky has a lot of pre-code movies that have their own laptops and immoral ways. That's the kind of thing Jean Harlow or Clara Bow could have played easily, but Becky is still kind enough to be here. This makes her fallen character so tragic. <br /> <br /> Unlike Loy's gripping Becky, it's good, good Amelia (Barbara Kent), who's not just an interesting character. Mary Forbes is good if Mrs. Sedley. Most of the other participants in this release are blah: Conway Tearle as Rawdon; Walter Byron as Osborne; Anthony Bushell as Dobbin. Others are almost dicens, their quirkiness: Billy Bevan Josephina; Lionel Belmore as Crawley; Montagu love as a marquis; Lilyan Irene as Servant Polly; Elspeth Dudgeon as a housekeeper. <br /> <br /> Loy is front and center. Although the end is quite shocking, he has several great scenes, for example, in a casino where he tries to steal another woman's winning roulette. The more Loy's Becky morally falls, the more beautiful it will be until he is finally "caught". The bottom line here is that it is Loy's very strong force in the visible film.
