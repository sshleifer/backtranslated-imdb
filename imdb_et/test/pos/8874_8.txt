You won't see the meaning of the title much later, but you'll get that point in the first few minutes. This Golden Globe director's debut (actor) Danny DeVito, who also played Owen / Ned 'Little Ned' Lift, is a terrible Hitchcock-like movie of a woman's hatred against her wife's book (she stole her) and a man's hatred for her mother. Basically Owen wants to be a good writer, like her teacher Larry Donner (Billy Crystal), and she's inspired by murderous homes. Larry says he sees a rather ironic Hitchcock movie, and when Owen has an idea to kill Larry's former wife, Margaret (Star Trek Voyager Kate Mulgrew). Owen is inspired by the "strangers on the train" that exchange murders, so Larry must kill Owen's terrible mommy (Oscar and Golden Globe, named Anne Ramsey). Larry was convinced that Owen had killed Margaret and that he had to kill Owen's mommy, but it was a happy ending when months later both Larry and Owen introduced the books, Momma died naturally and they went on vacation with Beth Ryan (Kim Greist). Rob Reiner Joel and Oprah Winfrey also play. With fun moments, great leader / actress, and her support, it's black-comedy. Very good!
