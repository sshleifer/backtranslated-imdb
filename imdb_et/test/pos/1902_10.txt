Dolemite may not be the first black exploit flick to come, but it is definitely one of the best. This is the central film of the Black Exploitation genre, where it caused a dramatic change between the films in front of it, unlike the films that came after it.

It was guilty of joy, fun and the best it would look with friends. (10 out of 10)
