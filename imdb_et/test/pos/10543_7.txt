Perhaps the best film ever directed by Kevin Tenney (well, his witchboard is not on my all-time horror list), it's a strange, fascinating mix between Pin and Child, which is better than that, but not so good . Of course, the plot is livened up and perhaps too predictable, but the actors are good, Rosalind Allen is very pleasing to the eye (and this is also Candance McKenzie - God blesses her for the shower!), The child's actress is a very good interrupted daughter and Pinocchio doll. is scary enough to give you some excitement in front of the spine. It's not bad for the B movie.
