John Carpenter's "The Thing" is undoubtedly one of the best fiction films. Unfortunately, as with most Carpenter films, it is also one of the most underrated films that critics will soon be released after its release for a reason that is almost pathetic. It seems that at a time when people were "surprised" by the alien's idea. The idea of ​​"I.T." succeeded. And I thought the film about foreigners could deviate from this idea for heresy. People's ignorance is a really scary thing, people have to evaluate movies about what they don't want, what they want. <br /> <br /> Thing itself is an interesting study of human paranoia as members. The US Antarctic Base discovers the presence of an alien (referred to as "thing" throughout the film) that can mimic any form of life. If we do not know who may or may not be a creature, we see how each character reacts to the situation. There is no mass hysteria or panic, but simply a slow and gradual chaos, as more and more people turn up ... not quite human. <br /> <br /> Carpenter is able to bring this movie to something other than your average Sci-Fi / horror. Not "whats behind?" Jump moments here. Instead, relying on an intense climate of mistrust and apocalyptic despair with some moments of well-balanced visual terror that are not small thanks to Rob Bottin's impressive creature effect, he gives us an experience that is not suited to many other horror films. <br /> <br /> Instead of our faces and plot elements on our face, Carpenter offers us a much more gradual and delicate approach. Thinking about the mystery, it gives the viewer enough freedom to interpret it on certain scenes, giving enough plot to those who do not know the films for such interpretation. <br /> <br /> Ennio Morricone's result is fully operational. It is a minimalist and frustrating sound that fits perfectly with the overall tone of the film. While I've always wondered how it would have sounded like Carpenter (he's known he's making all the OST of his movies except this)? Even not so deeply developed characters are still memorable thanks to actors, especially Kurt Russel, who plays out-out apathetic helicopter pilot R.J. MacReady. It is worth noting how his character changes through the film. Your unsuccessful "don't give ..." attitude at the beginning, the leader of the unity and the group of men who try to fight "thing". But even saying no, there are no false heroes, no "laughing face" moments and definitely no comic relief, the film keeps its atmosphere from the first scene to the last. Talking about here, Carpenter keeps his tradition in creating a powerful ending. <br /> <br /> A quarter of a century after its release, "The Thing" doesn't know the date. With the worryingly increasing use of computer generated effects, it has an even stronger impact as it shows life's work and people's commitment to non-computers. Together with analyzing openness, it gives the viewer many more reasons to look at this second or third or fourth or ... time. A masterpiece of terrorism that will never be forgotten.
