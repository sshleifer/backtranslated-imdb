Deep Blood ... This is one of the films you talk about here and you don't say any Italian jaw ripoff! Well, Deep Blood is far from it. It's cheap because filmmaking can get on the other side and it's also creative. In the jaws and all the other shorts we've all seen or flocked all of them use fake sharks, Joe D'Amato's film is a new approach, using all of his shark scenes. This is one of the many reasons why I like Deep Blood as much as it didn't use stock footage. <br /> <br /> In Deep Blood, the ancient Indian spirit is sick in the form of a blood shark in a coastal town. Joe D'Amato shark in the classic deep water. <br /> <br /> It seems that an older Indian parent warned a group of young people about this great evil at sea and years later, friends are forced to face fears that one of them will be killed by shark through a series of attacks on their coastline. Now it is still a few to make sure that this monster is killed, even if it means going to sea. <br /> <br /> Joe D'Amato directed and directed this film under his company Filmirage. . Released in 1989 and later used on Bruno Mattei's brutal jaws: jaws 5, with many other sharks. Joe D'Amato shark scrap is a great movie and every Joe D'Amato shark movie observer should try it.
