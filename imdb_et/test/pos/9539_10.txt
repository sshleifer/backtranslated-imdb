This is a movie I love in front of everyone else. I try to look again at Oakworth's and Oxenhope's main film locations, if this is possible, which will help restore the magical qualities that this film appears so uniquely to embody - recalling a softer and more fashionable age without saying that people really do matter that family life is not just one disposable, and that life is really worthwhile (although sometimes we can suspect it). In short, the movie that will soon bring tears to my eyes may have helped this deeply challenging music - some stories are dirty (like the Perks tune that is played on a thrombone, sometimes with spoons), a disturbing melody when the family first set off Yorkshire for those who do not know what is ahead, and the haunting little tuning on the solo clarinet (or is it an oboe?) that precedes unexpected childhood changes in happiness. <br /> <br /> This is just as much an adult movie as the kids, tempting to all of our eternal child - the key that revives those deep and apparently lost the hidden values ​​and feelings that have been ignored from today's demands of life. This is a film about the basic human goodness and dignity in which we observers are left to do what we want, and there is a welcome sense of humor that is sometimes added to a good action, such as aunt's arrival or a level of reputation, a bedroom scene on Persi's birthday - "Better Bert - like this is your birthday! " I have to know every scene, every line of this movie, and so much magic that every time I look, it's like I open for the first time, I taste every moment - sometimes humorous, sometimes humorous. ..all, very different. As Peter says in the movie: "It's perfect - more perfect than you know." And so it is !!!
