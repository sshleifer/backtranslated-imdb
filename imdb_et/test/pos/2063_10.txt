This is a film that does not reflect the real world. Nothing in this film makes real world sense or real world logic. It works perfectly in your little world and your ability to receive it or not to determine your love or hatred for your film. <br /> <br /> I love the movie. <br /> <br /> At first I bought a completely unrealistic assumption that a hit woman restored her memory when the past returns to her. Soon there was a time when I remember that it was one of those films where the heroine knows nothing until it is needed, despite all the logic that this would not happen. "Oh, one of those movies," I told me and tried when the film went to the forest every two hours. <br /> <br /> This is a brain and impact movie that follows your inner logic and you need to pay attention to follow some turns. I like it very much and I am pleasantly surprised when I get into people who feel the same way. People love it or hate it when they hear it at all. <br /> <br /> If you like action movies, it's definitely a movie. You may not like it, but it's definitely worth the effort to find out <br /> <br /> And as always, leave reality to the door.
