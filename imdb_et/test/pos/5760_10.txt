Why did I vote for this film, which is just guts *? Just because if you just let yourself be funny, you can just laugh until you stifle. Some people find that it goes too far, it is definitely not for everyone, but when I have to go down and I just need something really stupid to laugh, Chuck is Bottom or GHP and I can forget all my worries and transport it to the magic dark and strange world. <br /> <br /> * "Entirely Entered" is an Australian expression that has no literal translation.
