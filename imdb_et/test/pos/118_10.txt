one of the best movies ever ... fire ... it's not much of a sociological description of India today ... it's a mind that blows the use of light that never stops, never ... normal ... even if .. in that in the sense the film is almost unique ... both leaders are of good quality ... The origin of Dasi as a street performer is quite obvious ... his performance is great "cammeo" ... but the use of light ... I watch it and watched it over and over again ... still mind blows after age ... a little bit of a story ... rather a "pure" theme ... in some ways, it's sad that the odd world of life is called a gender film ... stand face to face with Jeanne D 'Arciga or Ichikawa Biruma no Tategoto or some of the great Kurosawa films, just called "some". I wish my contribution would be a little worthy of this film.
