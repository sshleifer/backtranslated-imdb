I loved this movie. It is a very simple plot and what I understand is based on a real story. With hard rock / hair material growing in the 1980s, there may be something about my love for this film, but even with music, it's a very fun movie. Try it, you like it if you're not the most critical and just like "Citizen Kane" caliber movies.
