I was pleasantly surprised at how good the film was. Are you a gore fan or fan fan; you love it. I didn't like horror movies, I thought they were stupid. But it still happens that I make exceptions. I find something very extraordinary in this movie. I have rarely ever seen a movie that has scared me, but I tell you the truth that this film gave me my neck. Unlike most horror films, it cares about developing symbols. I recommend this movie very well and I am glad that shelters are finally bringing out good horror movies these days. Advise! Enjoy!
