I saw Anatomy a year ago - duplicated in the Friends House. I don't remember that much, and then I saw another in the video store that is not really related to the first Frank Ponte. And it wasn't as good as the first one. I see for the first time tonight - there is no duplicate collection edition. I like German movies, as it is very interesting, and people and cultures, like those in the movie, may, in my opinion, be, i dunno. But it is very fun and scary. Anatomy 2 is slightly different and characters are not as good as first. But if you really thought the anatomy was interesting and good, you should see another.
