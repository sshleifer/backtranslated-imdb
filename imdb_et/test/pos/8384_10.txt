That's what I thought when I heard about Inglorious Basterdside casting. And I'm in Germany and in movies. <br /> <br /> This man is over 50 years old and so far he has played in mediocre TV series - and even there he didn't play the main parts. Apparently, no one has ever noticed what he can do. Now, thanks to QT, he got one picture to change it - and - let's be that way - it was a bingo! He is a lively proof of what is a great bike in Tarrantino. <br /> <br /> By the way: I think it's a great privilege to watch a movie like a German who can understand everything. And the German dialogue is written almost as well as English. <br /> <br /> Now I can repeat what many others have written here before. I will put it briefly: in the end, QT is back.
