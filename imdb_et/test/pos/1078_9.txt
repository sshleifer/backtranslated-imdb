Business vs. personal conviction. Profit vs. Art. <br /> <br /> As with any documentary that puts capitalist big companies against a small producer, the viewer must always take one or the other on his own beliefs. This is the same documentary as the new standardized way in which globalization brings us, against old traditional ways, where the art of making things and things is almost more than the product sold. <br /> <br /> If you have to remember one thing about this movie, the masses can no longer decide for themselves, they just follow the taste of one or a couple of critics who tend to equalize and standardize their taste in the same way as MacDonalds. a path for a quick bite (something Parker admits in a Burger King character in the background). "It's all about the image" content that the other interviewee says. It's a simple way, a standardized way. It's easier than spending time to make a nice wine ripe, easier than to taste, try and try again. The taste of a controlled brand is easier. <br /> <br /> There is hope that some of our oceans across the ocean agree that some people will "refine" the taste of wine in order to maximize profits and ensure maximum sales of "gray mass". Individuality and difference are sacrificed for extra bits. It is nice to see that not everyone, or everyone, even gives standardization to the ocean. <br /> <br /> Like many other modern areas, few choices and reduced freedom of choice affect us all ... let everyone make their thoughts and decide what to do. Too much standardization kills mind and taste; The difference leads to innovation and healthy competition and allows you to choose - and not just "more the same". Standardization sells easily and much and brings everything to the same level - lower. <br /> <br /> This will open a nice bottle and I wish you a high "sante".
