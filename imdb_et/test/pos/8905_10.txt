Participating in this film was an excuse to get to work, which I had to do for my classes, but it turned out to be one of the best experiences here in France. The film is working quickly to create multidimensional characters and is a wonderfully smooth story. Indeed, the characters had voices that would be expected when reading graphic novels and artistic talent exceeded my expectations. Music was a catchy and comedy toying and light, engaging engagement with almost modern items in playful ways. The film was captivating, cute and packed at the same time. A great story that has been expertly twisted. I will show it to my French students.
