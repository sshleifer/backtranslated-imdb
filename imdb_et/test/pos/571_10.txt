I don't have to talk much about how good this documentary is - it's a truly amazing piece of narrative. The story is quite simple: a young young tourist is killed in Florida. A young black man and an arrested boy are being mistreated and brought to justice only by a public defender and his family. It's very tempting and the public defender is happy to look at all of his human ways - you can't help but pull the triumph of justice, and the end ends more than you expect a real story. > <br /> It is a shame that more people have not seen this documentary, but hopefully you will find a way to see it. For those who are interested in US competition and the actual functioning of law enforcement and legal process, finding this documentary is worth your time and effort. I'll give her 10.
