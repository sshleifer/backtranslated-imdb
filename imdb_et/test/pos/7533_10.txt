"Nagisa no Shindobaddo" or "Similar Sand Grains" is an amazingly beautiful story of teenage boys and girls who are dealing with the situation with whom they are. This film is not about homosexuality, but about sexuality. <br /> <br /> Aihara, an alien girl, is definitely a thinker who is behind a remote girl. Does he love Yoshida? Or does he love Ito? Or did he become somehow lesbian because of the "incident"? (I doubt it). <br /> <br /> And how does Yoshida? Does he realize he loves at the end of Ito? We all know she loves her friend. But you never know when you see this movie ... haha ​​:) Finally, Aihara (with Ito) gives the audience an extraordinary message: that doesn't mean you love a boy or a girl. And I have to tell you I'm so tight that I couldn't. ^^ ;; This is because of all the scenes that we are talking about ... You have to try to understand what the characters think and say through their actions, and not what they say (especially the last part ... whew, boy, it was confusing!) , but it is beautiful. :) This movie is definitely one of the best Japanese movies I've ever seen (and trust me, I've seen a lot).
