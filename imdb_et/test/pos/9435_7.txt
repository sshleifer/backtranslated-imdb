Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) and Dr Watson (Nigel Bruce) are British scientists hired by the Swiss government. Franz Tobel (William Post Jr.) for protection. He has a bomb that the British want to win the war. Unfortunately, the evil Dr. Moriarty (Lionel Atwill) is working with the Nazis and completing something for a doctor - and his invention. <br /> <br /> Moving Sherlock Holmes to the 1940s sounded like a stupid idea, but it works for one reason - Basil Rathbone. He is said to be the BEST Sherlock Holmes who once put it on the screen. He plays the character so well (and accurately) that it doesn't matter which era he is dealing with. As for Nigel Bruce as Watson, everyone has problems with it. He plays Watson as an old fool of worship ... it's not Watson. You don't really know why Holmes is bringing him. However, he is growing up on you. Then there is Atwill, who has time for the spirit who plays Moriart - the conversations and battles between Holmes and Holmes are just great! I've never liked Dennis Hoey as Inspector Lestrade - he's such an idiot. Makes Watson look like a genius. And Post Jr. is pretty good as Tobel (although his accent is happily changing!). <br /> <br /> This movie takes place exactly and lasts just over an hour. However, it is slow and I never understood the part of the codes. <br /> <br /> Still when it's worth for Rathbone and Atwill.
