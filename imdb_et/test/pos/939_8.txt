Brilliant Aussie movie ... At first, it's a bit slow, but if it does, you can't stop laughing. When I first saw the movie, I knew vaguely the plot line because I'm not sure if many people are aware that this movie is based on a real story, and especially on the director and his mother (obviously the names have changed). I knew this only if the director was a friend of my family friend. When I saw the film, my mum kept secret that we met Matthew Newton after screening. Such a nice gentleman (except for a particularly unpleasant incident on his ex)! Brillian also pours Sam with Neill and others! Great reason to continue to support the Australian film industry
