Brighton has a family traumatic drama: twenty-year-old Emily Brighton (Taylor Roberts) has slowed down when she was one, and her defiant mother, Martha Brighton (Amy Madigan), accuses her of neglecting her accident. Seventeen years old Evie Brighton (Lauren Ambrose) loves her sister and reads Emily's poems and stories. Their father, Harry Brighton (John Savage), a bank investor, lives in the basement with his train and rail models. Evie mysteriously interviews her about the rejection of various universities and teaches her poems to Emily. When Martha hears Emily repeating poems, she remembers them and shows them to English teacher Stewart Worthy (Christopher Lloyd) who believes Emil has had a genius. When Evie's only friend James (Fran Kranz) reads the notes, he immediately discloses the truth about the authority of poems. But when Marta becomes aware, she finds Evie's reality by launching a series of revelations. <br /> <br /> "Admissions" is a very powerful drama of love and guilt for complex people. The performances are stunning and this is Lauren Ambrose's first work I can see and she is amazing. This independent film is a great choice for viewers looking for a refreshing story based on cast exhibitions. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Cumplicidade" ("Complicity")
