"Walking with dinosaurs" is absolutely brilliant in every sense. Kenneth Branagh narrates in a way that really wants to listen. The documentary script really sounds like scientists and writers have done their homework, it is so reasonable and it will put you on hold and never let you go. Music is also great, very dramatic, if it has to be. But the visual effects and landscapes are what makes this documentary so good. The landscape is breathtaking and the dinosaurs look so real thanks to the amazing effects. It is so informative with such a good idea and attracts not only adults but also children. <br /> <br /> To sum up, it must be traceable. I just didn't like it, but it's probably the best documentary I've ever seen. If anything, it could have been longer than it was perfect. 10/10 Bethany Cox
