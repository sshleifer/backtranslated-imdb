People who say that some Looney Tunes comics are unsuitable for kids have probably forgotten something: they were not originally meant for children. They were produced for the cinema that was shown before the feature films and they could show something they wanted. "Tweety's S.O.S." is the bad puddy tat Sylvester who found the Tweet on the ocean liner and enters the ship to try him. But there are two things to do for Sylvester: grandmother defends the canary harshly and Sylvester easily gets sick of the sea (we don't see him throwing, but with his green face they make it quite clear that he does it). And then obviously cute Tweety has a bad ass. <br /> <br /> It's just nice to see how these cartoons were not afraid to go out; what they thought show, they showed. We have to realize that cartoons were not always fun entertainment for children. Very funny.
