Bodybuilding filmmaker Corbucci is rarer in his thirteen west of Spaghetti (which I have only left for what I am trying to get in 1972), I only learned quite recently through Marco Giusti's "Stracult" guide; this is an atypical atypical genre pearl in the director's own masterpiece "GREAT SILENCE" (1968) in a style hidden in snowy landscapes. <br /> <br /> Frenchman Elvis Presley, whom I first saw at Jean-Luc Godardi DETECTIVE (1985) is curious but very effective a choice to play a lonely anti-hero Hud (who, like Clint Eastwood's man who doesn't have the name Sergio Leone labeled "dollar trilogy", is equipped with steel plates for protection), by the way, I had "met" Hallyday's daughter Laura Smet in 2004. but he was disturbed by his esteemed Director Claude Chabrol! Gastone Moschin is another curious addition (earning quite a bit of fun) the action that Frank Wolff did in HAPPY DIFFICULTY), but fulfills himself well and is a fun, clumsy bathing water in the presence of Francoise Fabian; The latter then plays the bank's widow's greedy nymphomania, who attracts everyone and a variety of their goals. Sylvie Fennec has another big female role, because Hallyday is taken care of by a farm girl who at one point has been attracted by Free Love by hippie Apache Gabriella Tavernes (with this in mind, it is worth noting that the film is surprising, but both the Fabian and Tavernes welcome nudity) ! By the way, the anachronistic addition of young people with long hair (also engaged in smoking and revolutionary speech) has somewhat half-tried to contemporary importance? but it all finally adds fun (besides, even a black warrior sport afro hairstyle!). Mario Adorf also enjoys an enormously larger role than Mexico in the bandit nickname "El Diablo"? who keeps a younger biography (an element that may have influenced Clint Eastwood's UNFORGIVEN [1992]) and at one point contests a duel with Moschini's headwind in captivity! Having mentioned this, does the film include one very unusual "weapon of death"? When Hallyday disposes of an opponent, the cash in the cabin will hit your face! As always, pleasantly counterfeit attacks are accompanied by excessive pressure effects; But the same is the success of Angelo Francesco Lavagnino, which is as typical for the genre. In fact, is the ambiguous ending completely in line with the overall horrible tone of the film? After the arrival of Fabian's local inhabitants, the cries (who had previously been with Hudi's idol) turned to him wounded and terrorized the city (forcing everyone on the street and dressing up), but the unsuitable weaponry can lift itself to meet their challenges (they scream in front of him!) and then drive out of town leaving Fennec behind. <br /> <br /> All in all, I acquired this high-quality wide-screen printing in Italian, though French credit and from time to time? about one minute of screen time in all? French (where probably the original soundtrack was not available).
