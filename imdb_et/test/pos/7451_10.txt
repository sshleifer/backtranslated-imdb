Now, after watching the Advent children twice, the story is not as low as most of us have criticized. If for some reason you have not played FFVII or did not want it, this movie is probably not for you. Knowing the original story is a prerequisite for a full understanding of AC, otherwise you will still see the biggest CG animation in your life so far. <br /> <br /> I don't have to break the reality. we have known FFVII with our friends and friends. Without seeing this second time to give more attention to reality, and most of the questions we could answer were answered. Some were not. AC is clearly for FFVII players / fans and he does not honestly try anything else. The FFVII world, which serves this purpose, is not really a reality there. The music is mostly reconstructed with heavier touch on the FFVII themes (TBM team according to the final credit) and works exclusively with eye candy. I found music that improved the experience of visual fireworks in all situations. <br /> <br /> We all know that you can't put FFVII in for 1.5 hours and keep in mind that the reality I have been offered is more than I expected. There are two problems with FFVII: AC and both stories were packed very smoothly between the sequences. And trust me when I say there is a lot. The activity that is. <br /> <br /> I will change my voice from 9 to 10 after I watched it for the second time because I had a couple of explanatory sequences that I couldn't put together for the first time. As a warning, this story is easily overlooked and focus on graphics, but try not to appreciate the Adehent's children. If you don't let the story, it's no wonder it looks sloppy. <br /> <br /> I do not praise graphics because I assume we all know they are awesome, which may be underestimated. Especially the characters talk more with their facial expressions than ever before. I hope we pay attention to the goal, because it really makes sense and works well together. Get ready for your life, there is no break.
