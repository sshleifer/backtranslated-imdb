Steamboat Willy was not the first comic to play Mickey Mouse. The first movie celebrated by an American friend was "Plane Crazy". "Plane Crazy" was released on May 15, 1928 in Hollywood, California, in a quiet movie format. "Steamboat Willy" was released on November 18, 1928 as a SOUND film (also released on July 29, 1928 as a silent film). So doing "Steamboat .." Mickey's first SOUND movie, but not the first small American Mouse movie. Although many games have used the question: "What was the first appearance of Mickey Mouse?" The real answer is "Plane Crazy", not "Steamboat Willy". These dates may be the "release dates" of the IMDb statement.
