It's a funny, smart movie and it's worth your time. In my opinion, it is much better than American Pie and other movies of the same genre that look all the time. I had not heard of this movie, so I think it didn't get much of a press that is a kind of shame. It does not take itself too seriously, but at the same time it gives people a serious message of life and life experiences and what's important ... Unlike a movie that talks about a desperate man trying to unlock for the first time and a dude stuck in his d ** k pie but finally everyone can put and whoop-de-do ... One thing that impressed me was that the soundtrack was pretty awesome and not the usual cheesy american pop-punk ... They actually had a real punk behind the day like Ramones ... That in itself made the movie better! Frankly, I didn't expect much from this movie and I was pleasantly surprised at how good comedy was.
