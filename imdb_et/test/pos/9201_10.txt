This show is awesome! I love all the actors! It has great stories and lines. This is the perfect drama. James Caan and Josh Duhamel have a great dialogue. They can both be really funny. James Lesure is great! He can be fun. Molly Sims plays very well. Writing is fantastic! The show can really leave you hanging, which is one of my favorite items. I can't wait until the new season begins. This shows that it is in the top ten of all my exhibitions. I hope this exhibition will last for a very long time. When people know what's good, he does it. I never want to stop the sample. Never.
