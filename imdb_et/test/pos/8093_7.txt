Most of this film is an amusing and brutal satire of Nazism and Fascism, made at the height of the success of these movements. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Chaplin's art from the last moments of the film will give up all the deeds (not to mention comedy) and will completely switch to propaganda. And not even the anti-Nazi propaganda, but some of the most mawkish and idiotic "progressive" propaganda that ever fades out of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Nothing that has been seen so far suggests that a hairdresser is even capable of giving the speech we see him (given, ironically, with annoying wild fanatics); such trivialities must not be allowed to be confused with the message.
