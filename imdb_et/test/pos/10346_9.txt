A touching film about a talented woman struggling with society and love that underestimates her. The questions are finely addressed and timeless, as many of the hardships between a man and a woman still exist in Dutch society. This film is a tribute to all modern women who do not live in feminism. Not only is the story well spoken, but also the actor and the landscape are great.
