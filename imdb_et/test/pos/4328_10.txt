Jack, Sawyer and Sayid swam in the boat and found Desmond completely wasted. His traumatic experience before traveling to the island has been revealed through setbacks. Sayid draws a plan for Jack to surprise "Others" when Michael is in the group twice. John Locke persuades Desmond to penetrate the door that is protected by Mr. Eko, and does not press the computer button to see what happens. <br /> <br /> This episode is one of the best in the second season. Unfortunately, we see that "Lost" lovers see the respect of fans of this stunning series of manufacturers. In the US, this episode was air dated May 24, 2006. Therefore, during this time, fans must wait for the third season in a very different situation where Jack and his group are surrounded by "others" and find the truth about Michael and Ana Lucia and Libby's death; John locked the hatch without trying to catch the button and Mr. Eko desperate outside the hatch. I hope that the "lost" fate is better than the "Angel" and its very disappointing conclusion (or lack of conclusions) after five seasons. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not Available
