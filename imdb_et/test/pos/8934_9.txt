I've always loved Brenda Blethyn and "Betty" wasn't disappointing. I saw it on a satellite on a harsh Sunday morning. Life has been stressful and this film made me laugh and see things we usually deal with terribly. I wish he would do more of these films and "rescue Grace". Brenda Blethyn is an excellent galaxy with which we approach 60. She is cute, beautiful and full of life without plastic and fake. Not many actors are there for us to be realistic but comical and / or serious. Brenda - if you see it - go on with such gems. We need more Mrs Bennetts, Bettys and Graces.
