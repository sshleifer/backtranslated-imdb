Being a great fan of Charlie Chaplin after a good vibe, having seen the first "The Gold Rush" and then "City Lights", I was eager to see "The Great Dictator" as I said it was arguably his best film. I was also interested in being a chat room; my first, Chaplin-wise. <br /> <br /> The beginning is a typical Chaplin and a blatant proof that in the case of sound, the chapel can cut it, not just by setting and talking to the music; it is funny, well-timed, and impact-resistant elements such as the airplane gun are dropping well with jokes. It was good to have the viewer pull the opening of this "classic Chaplin" and at the same time start to know the characters with each other. What was well done was how Hitler was disappointed. Any scene that Hitler or Hynkel has in this movie was funny and even now; makes you think when you know exactly who he is spam and creates an internal reaction. The way English is blended with German during dialogue scenes is an additional proof of how Chaplin was able to adapt to the talk time. My favorite joke was a five-minute speech given by Hynkel, but to an English translator to translate it into just a few words; You may think of Hitler's film material, which you may have seen at some point in your life and laugh. <br /> <br /> Historically, the movie has some things right. Chinchilla is seen in children with children; something that Hitler did to manipulate the media, but here it seems that Hynk wakes up and is bored; Hitler's fallen technique to win against the German public through compassion (Oh, he hugs and kisses the children. He must be OK!). The film also offers a fantastic assumption that the Jewish civilian was in the ghetto for all the current traverses, but the catches he has forgotten. Movies such as "Pianist" and "Come and See" are two good examples of Nazi cruelty to "worse" people who today all look back and shake our heads, given that in the late 1930s when it was filmed, he had cruelty and he used it, making it even more amazing. Chaplin has managed to replace the weapons and trophies of tomatoes and saucers and still pull it out. <br /> <br /> What I did not like about the film was that he was a real story after opening. . It slowed the film and it is very noticeable because the leg was removed from the gas somewhat. The film started with clues about stories and sub-stories. These were a hairdresser and a female neighbor who was in love with the supposed destruction of Hynkel's palace, while none of them had actually developed. "Giving a shave" and "someone in your pudding coin" made "deeds" on the paths of this plot, but ultimately they were simply excerpts for the discarded, unpleasant gags that were disappointing. <br /> <br /> At the time, the great dictator of the fact that the Italian dictator is introduced, who adds a lot of life and excuse to the film, will act as a treatment, as we see them, and when Hynkel tries to "overpower" his Italian colleague with several dirty tricks (though Despite the weakness of the middle segment and the fact that I felt that the message was in my throat at the end, the great dictator was busy today, but it's just because he took the game did not use anyone else knew there were.
