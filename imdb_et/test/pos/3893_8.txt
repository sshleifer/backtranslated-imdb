Not a stunner, but a good movie to see one or two times. Bill Macy shows that he can do more than just act; his writing was pretty tough. Great supportive casting, especially Jamie Cromwell as an extraordinary private eye. <br /> <br /> The greatest strength of the movie is Macy's work, which reminds us of Jerry Lundergaard's role in Fargo. He has many scenes where he is extremely funny, as a slick, manipulative and deceptive character. It's enjoyable to watch her, and for a while I was happy that things had come out well for her. *** of four.
