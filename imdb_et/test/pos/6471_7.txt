Alex North (John Cassavetes) has problems with his father and flees home to join the army, where he will soon desertify and arrive in New York, who plans to start a new life, taking advantage of the fact that no one knows his past. He works at Waterfront, where he meets a young man living with Tommy Tyler (Sydney Poitier), who is happily married and lives in contrast to the sad and unhappy nature of Cassavets. They become very good friends and Tommy does his best to help his friend. The only problem is that their boss at work, hard worker Charles Malik (Jack Warden) is kind of envious of their friendship as well as Tommy's constant happy behavior and progress in personal life. He can make his life difficult when he learns about Alex's past. <br /> <br /> A good drama run by the Academy Award was directed by director-producer Martin Ritt (The Hud) and has wonderful items from Sydney Poitier and Jack Warden. 7/10
