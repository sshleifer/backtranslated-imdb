It often happens that the great director's last film becomes such a moving, superbly executed and filmed masterpiece. It's great and the camera is cast. Starting with the joy of a well-educated group of citizens from the early 20th century, Dublin becomes a dark, philosophical narrative of all our fear of death and sometimes dark shadows of the past. Thank you, Mr Huston, for this great movie!
