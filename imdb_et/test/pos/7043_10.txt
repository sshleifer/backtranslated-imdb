"Rattlesnake! Look!" "Is this a bra you wear or are you waiting for a murder attempt?" "Spaz, what are you gay or what?" "OK to go! Feed Fink, he's our hot man" "Do you know that they are using the most sophisticated training methods of the Soviet Olympic, Eastern and Western Germany and Trinidad-Tobago." "Oh Spaz, who are you old champion!" "What is not a mustard?!" "Oh my God, his nose is bleeding." "It will become even bigger now" "Our political roundtable ... Henry Kissinger will be released. Yassir Arafat will come out and spend the weekend with children rap rap." <br /> <br /> These and many other big lines make meatballs a famous comedy. Only in Caddyshack is Bill Murray more fun. He probably slipped a half line. The gymnasium actors seemed to be with him in the same movie. <br /> <br /> Funny movie to watch every season, not just summer.
