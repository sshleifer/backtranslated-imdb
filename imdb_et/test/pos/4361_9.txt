I was able to see the last night at a local film festival. Herzog introduced the film and made an hour and answers after that. <br /> <br /> It's a great documentary; Herzog later explained that he did not consider his films a real documentary because the facts sometimes hide the truth. Instead, it scripts some scenes and some scenes to introduce a new element that may have been missed when it follows the original story. <br /> <br /> Little Dieter, unlike Timothy Treadwell, is the real person you fall in love with; you rejoice at him, you know the anguish he knows. You admire the sense of humor and the joy of life that he showed here 30 years after his stay in Viet Cong. You are disappointed to hear that Dieter has gone too long ago. <br /> <br /> Like most Herzog films, the images are amazingly beautiful and with a great selection of background music. Especially the scene of the battle taken from the Vietnam War Archives, which fits the story of Dieter, is the core of the film, which Dieter returns to the hustling jungle where he was POW. takes a trip with some local people. Don't look like we look, I can't imagine what he felt like he was tied again. <br /> <br /> One of the best films that depict and discuss the horror of the Vietnam War. It should be a lesson for all of us.
