I loved it, it was really terrible and disgusting. I thought the tearing of human flesh was thoroughly provocative. The way he portrayed the crucifixion of Jesus Christ was really interesting. Tearing the limbs and jaws was cruelly cruel. Don't look at it if you have a weak heart, you can't stand it.
