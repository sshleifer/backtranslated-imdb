I watched the Grand Champion at least twice. I liked the story of the movie, the characters and the actors were not bad. It's refreshing to see a G-rated movie. This is a good movie. The story is mainly about children. Relations between children and adults make the story interesting. I recommend this movie if you are looking for a family movie. If you liked Little Rascals, you probably enjoy it. I watched it with a movie cable. Encore or Showtime family. This is not a movie I would have seen in the theater. But I'm just going to the theater for the big screen effects, so most of the comedies, romantic movies or dramas won't go to the big screen - I'm waiting for a TV / cable. Get your kids together, pop popcorn and enjoy!
