Although I'm not a huge fan, I'm a thirteen purist. I believe their best work was far from Curly as the third Stooge and their first films are generally their best. This is because, after a while, they began to re-create their films and gags began to collapse. Here, in 1934, they were still quite fresh (more than one) and funny. Three run foolishly, hit each other and scare the pants for someone who hopes to get better. Non-stop energy and freshness make it a must for fans. Pictures. NIFTY NURSES is much like black, but manages to be more funny and is about the era's best hospital comedy - better than Laurel & Hardy COUNTY HOSPITAL.
