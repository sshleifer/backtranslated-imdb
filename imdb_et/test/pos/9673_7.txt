I still have all the seasons of family members and I have to say Vol. 6 has been the greatest disappointment of all of them. There's a lot of laugh here, but I think Vol. 6 as the last volumes give a slow laugh. At least for me. <br /> <br /> The greatest annoyance I had with Vol. 6 appears to be very difficult in left-wing politics. I am a great believer if you can laugh at other people you should laugh at, but that volume really seems to draw your political view down the throat and I think it will take a lot more from the show. All conservative people are terrible places. We need more arms control, Insinuated school is funded, Insinated religious people are crazy, Bush is fucking friends. I could go on and this is just the first three episodes. br /> <br /> Of course, some of them were funny, but they become a point if you don't make comedy and you really just move your political views to other people.
