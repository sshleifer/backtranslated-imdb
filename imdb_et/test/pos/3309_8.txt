A nice movie that gives you romance, a woman-psychodrama, sexual harassment, adultery, and fashion. It's all there. Typical characters are found in America. Joan Crawford is the usual long-term employee's female leader who feels the need to be like that because he's with big boys. Hope Lange is an ambitious ambitious employee, determined to use his mind, not his body. Their personal life is a sub-block. <br /> <br /> The movie wardrobe is great, but nobody forgot to tell Stephen Boyd's hairdresser that "a little hip does it!" The amount of Brylcream in Stephen Boyd's hair is sometimes disturbing. The relationship of his character to the character of Lange has never been fully developed, which I found disappointing. In general, the film is pleasant. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8/10
