Listen, this Ralf Westhoff seems to know a lot about people! There are nine women and nine men at the Speed ​​Dating event, each with five minutes to talk to each other. It's a good idea to take a movie out of these chats. And even better: it works very well! Dialogue is witty, original and authentic, each person delicately characterizes, without the cliché of the cliché, something that is unusual for German films: Remember all these years, we Germans were tortured with foolish zeitgeist comedies such as "work injury" or "Stadtgespräch" . But now is the time for the young German directors to do their own and take the risk that they will produce entertaining and funny and smart and sensitive movies at the same time. The timing of "shoppen" is also good: although it mainly contains dialogue, it retains tension and interest. After a while, you are actually curious to see how this man and woman would do it. Some participants will meet twice later, it is fun to see that they interact with "real life". Of course, the film has some drawbacks: it is not very cinematographic (but can such a film be?), The musical soundtrack could have been better, but all this is only marginal. <br /> <br /> The most important thing about this movie: here are some good actors here. Imagine this: all of them are still quite unknown in Germany (most of them came from the theater scene in Munich or Bavaria). But I predict that at least 11 movie and TV shows will change very well in 18 major players. It's nice to see so many fresh and at the same time talented faces. Well done! <br /> <br /> For those who want to read more, all 18 participants have gone missing: (spoilers!) <br /> <br /> Sebastian Weber: The quiet waters are deep! Remember your "flower garden" monologue, you can win any woman's heart. <br /> <br /> Anna Böger: Woman's Hell! Every time he opens his mouth, you can't help but laugh and feel good. Listen to how he pronounces the "asshole" and calls the pink shirt "Bürscherl"! <br /> <br /> Felix Hellmann: "Bürscherl" from the top is fun to watch. The uncomfortable truth is that these men are too many. His appearance reminded me of Flo Weber "Sportfreunde Stiller". <br /> <br /> Katharina Schubert: This woman has everything: love, hope, despair, beauty. His "want kids" scene is classic. The great actor we hear again, no doubt. <br /> <br /> David Baalcke: Is this a loser or not? Almost as authentic as Paul Giamatti's "side". I hope this is not the method that works. <br /> <br /> Julia Koschitz: A "good looking" woman in a circle. Julia played theater, gold in her hometown! I think he will appear in many future TV series. <br /> <br /> Martin Butzke: The revolutionary man at the end is catching the sweetest and most common woman. Would you like to share this guy with a taxi? <br /> <br /> Kathrin von Steinburg: He gave a stunning last year at "Tatort". The performance of his movie in this film is not less than that. SEE ALSO her beautiful face and INVITE her dirty laugh. The best scene in the movie belongs to him. <br /> <br /> Matthias Bundschuh: I know they "write everything" - back from school. I'm not sure if the hot blonde got an allergic reaction because of his or her cat. Matthias's portrayal of this chicken is outstanding. <br /> <br /> Mediha Cetin: My ex-girlfriend's sister was a speaker like her. On the day I met him, my only day in my life was the need for soothing substances, so bad memories. <br /> <br /> Thomas Limpinsel: "A nice and desperate man" in the circle. Limpinsel has a comic talent that is much better than most so-called comedians on television. <br /> <br /> Lisa Wagner: Victim of Sebastian's "Flower Garden" metaphor. Lisa's face is funny and full of melancholy, her story made me feel good and sad at the same time, wow! <br /> <br /> Oliver Bürgin: "Good looking" man in the ring. No wonder he finally arrives at Julia. These two fit together. I think he will appear in many future TV series. <br /> <br /> Julia Heinze: "Lovely, normal" woman. I hope he will not be underestimated: Julia's face becomes fierce for naive patients, it is great! <br /> <br /> Stephan Zinner: Partenkirchen's "Nature Boy" likes cooking, eating? and good sex. Look at the body language between him and the hot blonde! Usually Zinner plays CSU politician Söder. <br /> <br /> Anja Klawun: "Reduced Girl" has some good moments, but please, if your grace is revealed, will fail (like most participants) to play on the drunken screen. br /> <br /> Christian Pfeil: He plays a arrogant and narcissistic man. Could not believe that this very actor owns two art buildings in Munich. <br /> <br /> Tanja Schleiff: Play a girl who sleeps around every person. I'm sure many men will visit him. I've heard that he can make dramatic roles, so I'm curious.
