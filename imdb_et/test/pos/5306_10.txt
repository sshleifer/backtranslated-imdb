When Hayao Miyazaki makes "trifecta" (writes, manages and animates the film), he makes a classic film for the era. He has done it again with Gake no ue no Ponyo. <br /> <br /> The story is about a girl's fish, kept with her younger sister's father, a bitter former man's wizard, very tight. called Fujimoto. The fish escapes from the father and drives to the shore where he is caught in dredging and finds himself in a bottle. This underwater sequence must be one of the most thought-out animated scenes ever made and stand alone as a reason for searching for a theater publication. Miyazaki, who has no fear of a busy scene, has crossed over. At the same time, at the same time, all the hundreds of individually drawn sea creatures were created. <br /> <br /> When the fish escapes from the dredging, still stuck in the bottle, a five-year-old boy named Sousuke floats him in the water and breaks the bottle. Because he is the result of his father's magic, he is capable of wearing magic himself - and his father is trying to actively restore him. The boy calls the fish Ponyo. Just when Sousuke learns that Ponyo can speak, he pulls his father back in captivity. <br /> <br /> After a war with his father, Ponyol will escape again by turning himself into a human. He meets again with the Sousuke storm, and the story continues in many interesting ways. In this film there is a competition factor that competes and allegedly exceeds Tonar from Totoro. Joe Hisaishi again provided excellent musical support. <br /> <br /> The story itself is simple - as well as Miyazaki movies in general - and should turn to a broad viewer. Although I have not seen it enough, this film does not seem to keep scientists in lengthy discussions, as Sen has Chihiro, Kamikakushi did. However, this is the ultimate feeling-entertainment movie. I gave the movie ten out of ten.
