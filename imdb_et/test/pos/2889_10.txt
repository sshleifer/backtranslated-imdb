These guys are great and everything they put out to the public is first-rate. The music of this band is amazing and we should all be very grateful for living in a world where Rush exists. Future generations will never be able to see and personally see such mastery. Get this DVD and enjoy it all! I have recently seen these incredible musicians in Houston, TX and blown. I have not forgotten the window show and I have to say that they are better than ever. Everyone should embrace these men and teach others what is real music! In our lifetime, we never have such a close and well-assembled trio. Lets just hope and pray that they won't retire soon!
