(r # 88) Brilliant, a very entertaining show with amazing effects. All fans of these prehistoric reptiles must see it. CGI mixes well with the environment, and it's just fun to watch these giants in their daily business as casual as in the Discovery Channel. This exhibition was a genius strike and it blows away its followers "Walking with Animals" and "The Future is Wild" out of the water. <br /> <br /> The biggest episode was definitely the last one where we had to look at the last days of the Tyrannosaurus Rex and the meteor strike that became their punishment. This stuff is almost too awesome for television. How about a theatrical release? I'd pay something to see them in the dinosaur cinema. <br /> <br /> If you are for a mood exhibition that can be remarkable, interesting and educational at the same time, it's for you. Dinosaurs have never been cooler.
