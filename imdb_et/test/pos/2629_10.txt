I saw this movie for the first time at least thirty years ago and it remains one of my all-time faves! This is a classic - intriguing plot, big characters, temporary and shocking twists (everything is set against the excellent Monterey / Big Sur coastline). Roy Thinnes depicts Johnny Brant, an enchanting character that is growing more mysterious when his true identity develops. Operation is great and plausible; viewers catch a web that evolves between a diligent wife, a disappointed wife, and an attractive stranger (Thinnes as Brant). I've been looking for a copy I have been buying for years - I don't think TV movies are unfortunately posted on the video. Great movie, look at it when you find it.
