It was curious to know the name of the village of Tuscany, where it was filmed in Italy. I know the name of the villa: Villa San Girolamo still wants to know the exact location of Tuscany. Cinematography is great and it would be nice to visit this area. I would also like to know the location of the desert. Travel extensively in Europe and Africa and be interested in visiting the book and film areas. Please send me an email with any information about sites someone may have. We would be very grateful. And if anyone knows if the Tuscan wool is still habitable, it would be awesome. I look forward to your information and thank you for your time.
