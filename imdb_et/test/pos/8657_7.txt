The Twoersome Man is a smart, surreal movie that makes you re-evaluate your life and make you alert. If you see these people in zombies like trances who do everyday events and realize that what we do and what we want in real life is really close to home. This is a surprisingly effective film that leaves you with questions about your direction, not about the film. <br /> <br /> Andreas is the main character whose life we ​​get from the perspective of a third person when he tries to adapt to a new life after relocation. At first it seems that he is the most popular boy in the city, because all the workers see him and he is invited for dinner and the like. A good example of this is your new boss, who offers him an unspecified amount of cash, saying, "Here's a little bit of something to get you started". Andreas even gets a 20-minute girlfriend she's finally moving. It seems to be the ideal life situation because his girlfriend is a well-established interior designer, attractive and never everything she does. But Andrew has not fulfilled his relationship as everyone else in this world. He then begins to communicate with a Ingeborg co-worker who finally leaves Anne and claims to be in love. After Ingeborg it was told how she tells her she sees other colleagues and says that all the relationships are "nice". Soon after we see Andreas at the train station, where he tries to put an end to his misery and the audience is not disappointed. Still looking for salvation, Andreas Hugo, who has found a hole to hear music, meets. So they start a mission to get to the other side, is it better or is it worse? <br /> <br /> The "Imagine Man" shows us the obsession of society with performances and its materialistic thinking. This makes us a great job by filling homes with the IKEA products that the characters spend every lunch. I think he's mostly kidding in Scandinavian society and its high suicide rate. For example, the film has a scene where Andrew comes over a man who jumped out of the building and confined it to the garden. Andrew, who has retreated with this world, cuts his finger and then jumps on the train; this is one of the most strange / outrageous scenes I've seen. This world created by Lien is equivalent to bloating with no punishment and no reward. In this world, after drinking Dr Andreas never drunk, sex was unfulfilled, and no matter how many times he tried, he couldn't kill himself. This film reminded me of a "fighting club" and how both major characters were in sync with their surrounding world. In "Fighting Club", Tyler Durden creates another person who does everything he does not, and in this film Andreas is awakened to Tyler Durden. After a while, he wakes up and tries to escape from the blissful life he now has when he escapes through a wall hole. <br /> <br /> Lien makes this movie in this consistency, which means that if the character has half full cups and they are cut off, they come back and have the glass in the same hand and it is not full or empty, which shows that the picture was taken the other day. Nowadays, directors are more concerned about sound effects and forget such small things as the one that carries the bracelet on the same hand as filming the previous day? Since I took television production for three years in high school, I don't have the trouble of looking for consistency or voice commands that drive me nuts. Lien does some good things if they have very good lighting in every light, never leaving you wondering why something has been taken off and creating an interesting subject. This film really worked for me, because it not only strikes Scandinavian but also Western society and what is wrong with it. The only real problem I had was the man who committed suicide when he jumped into a fence. Because you finally know that this world has no death, but it made you motionless to assume that it was dead and that it will never, in my opinion, be answered. <br /> <br /> Andreas is the only main character as others come and go and never do more than support him. Her first girlfriend, Anne Britt, is an interior designer who sees her on the surface perfect but eventually turns out to be boring. It takes him to Ingeborg, with whom he starts communicating and falls in love. He will soon discover that he was a handful of other men and that what he felt was not real. Andreas finally meets the Hugo bar in the bathroom, claiming that nothing tastes good anymore and how he can no longer drink. He follows Hugo's home to find a hole in the wall that is full of children's laughter and birds. <br /> <br /> Lien doesn't have much to do yet, but "The The Twoersome Man" is more than a jump to start a great career, but a preview of the upcoming and future director. If it refers to his talents and potential as a character, Lien has a bright future and we can only hope that his future films will not take so long to make it a joy to watch abroad. So sit back and enjoy the ride as the director Jens Lien takes you from the comfort of your home to a dreamy world that is a "tedious man".
