I've been watching this movie for the first time since 1996, I feel like I can't finish my satisfaction, I feel I want more and more to watch, my God, I don't think it was ten years ago and I believe I I remember almost every dialog word. I love this movie and I love this novel, absolutely perfection. I love Willem Defoe, he has a strange voice to write "black night" and I always say it several times, never bored. I love Sararem's music, it's so much spiritual, I forced me to come to my heart into a deep world. can anyone feel what I feel and someone could do the film like that? I do not believe it. Thanks to Ondaat, thanks to Mingela.
