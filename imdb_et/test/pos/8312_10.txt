This film was viewed at the American Cinematheque Egyptian Theater in Hollywood on April 7, 1999. It was described in the American Cinematheque schedule as follows: <br /> <br /> "TOMORROW IS THE SECOND DAY 1951, Warners, 90 min. Steve Cochran's ex-con, who has never been with a woman, Ruth Roman is a dime-a-dance dame who has no use because it is not sappy for men, a hotel room, a dirty policeman, a blow - a perfect jumpboat for refugees. This virtually unknown noir is a Felix Feist masterpiece that is full of revelatory sets, Cochran was never more vulnerable, Roman was ever sexier .. Imagine GUN CRAZY, written by Steinbeck - it's so good. "<br /> <br /> I just saw this movie and agree to each of the above descriptions with the word.
