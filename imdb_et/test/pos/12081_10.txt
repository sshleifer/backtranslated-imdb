I saw this movie when it was broadcast on television in February 1983. I was in the hospital, having just given birth to my first and only child. I'm not telling you to what extent I moved. Suffice it to say that the film's memory has remained with me for almost 23 years later. I hope I will find a copy of this movie once such a thing has ever been done. This movie should be remembered by anyone who has ever seen it. However, I must admit that the fact that it remains somewhat unclear is good for me. In this way, it is always a small secret to me and to those who have moved. I never saw the better part of Margaret. I have never seen him in a more convincing role. I will respect him forever with the acceptance of such a lovely part.
