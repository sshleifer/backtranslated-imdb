As always, Joan Hickson is great as Jane M. Subtle, sharp and aware. I do not want to stick to my behavioral skills, because they are praised on this site. I would like to criticize some of the smaller parts because the director David Tucker seemed to have chosen the rest. <br /> <br /> Liz Fraser's performance with Mrs Bentina (mother of the lost girl, Nora) is a joy to watch. Fine and deeply moving like an alcohol-dependent exhausting mother who loves and leaves her daughter in dire need. A good monotype (thanks to Tucker!), So you can enjoy it completely. I was moving when I saw her for the first time it was sent, and I was moved again, now it's on a DVD. Brava. <br /> <br /> Joanna Hole is a Madge travel guide that is very fun. He is on the verge of excessive activity, but his role may be. He's so funny when an over-organized guide who wants to do everything with this bus, I find he's fun. His reaction after he got on every bus is great ... As always: to do comedy it must be taken very seriously, and that is what Hole Hole does. <br /> <br /> I hope these two ladies have a good career (as I live in the Netherlands, I don't know if they have, not all theaters can googled ...) - their performances on the screen deserve it. <br /> <br /> Pieter
