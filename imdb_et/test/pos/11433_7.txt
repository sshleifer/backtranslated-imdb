The "lost star" who competed for the golden lion at the 2006 Venice Film Festival is a film that, when you think, is the first feature that comes to your mind: intense. Intense appearance, intense sequences, the intensity of this film captures the viewer from the first steelworks scenes in Italy (I could not recognize the city, perhaps Genoa or even Naples), although the pace is rather slow. <br /> <br /> Vincenzo Buonavolont√†, the male leader and with him, the whole audience, sees a completely different China than the usual western imagination: a terrible high-rise building with about 8 hundred apartments, skyscrapers, devastation, fog, scrapers and cranes everywhere, but also the beauty of the Yangtze River, which will soon become a large lake due to the contradictory stream that destroys many cities. China is a country under construction, but under all these colossal public works, poverty, backwardness and dishonest laws are still in place. <br /> <br /> We can more easily associate this story, because Gianni Amelio, the expert director, chose two phenomenal interfaces: the well-known actor in Italy, Sergio Castellitto, and China's surprising Thai Ling, the whole unknown girl who gives the same intense interpretation as Castellitto. <br /> <br /> The film is not perfect, here and there are some mistakes, but that doesn't mean it's a mediocre movie. Try to see it.
