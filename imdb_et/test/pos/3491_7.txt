There is no real plot, no character development, no Scorcese-level direction, but seriously, did you really expect it? The only thing that matters is that this flick is completely fun, almost at the same level as Borat. Of course, a little bit will end, but if the Borat site hasn't broken you, then you have to be the worst boy in the history of batty boys. Sacha Baron Cohen is probably the biggest comedian ALIVE and here she laughs more than Jude Law's naked beach. I dare not laugh at you. <br /> <br /> If you can pull one and a half feet out of ten feet, just enjoy the nicely timed and very dumb jokes of the silly story of a stupid character, look at this stupid movie. You're glad you did. Keep it real!
