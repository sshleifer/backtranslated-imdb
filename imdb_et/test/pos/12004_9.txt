I felt it when I saw the episode in my original ride and I still agree when I look at this runtime. You were completely insecure at Columbus throughout the episode and treating him as he was born with a syndrome. And finally, you see their shock when Columbo gets them dead and arrested. You will also get a realistic reaction to the arrogant preppy killers. They couldn't give Columbus their props and say he was just happy. I like the formula that has developed the crime, the killer (s) underestimate Columbo, and then you realize that Columbo is playing the criminals completely. I remember the first episodes of the post-1989 episodes that they didn't follow this formula and that was the first episode I was happy with.
