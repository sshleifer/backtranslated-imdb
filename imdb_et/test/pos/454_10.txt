a great movie with a rather vague political message. it is photographed in theatrical style, i.c. most of the activities take place inside. Mayor Surov and diana ashcroft seem so suspicious to each other. emotions go high because western tourists and businessmen seem unwanted and unable to bring the mayor's east-Russian charm, although he does everything he can to understand their position. The two opposing views of the world are clearly outlined, but the film also shows that politics cannot be controlled over human emotions. it has worked hard and has a great emotional impact on the film of the '50s.
