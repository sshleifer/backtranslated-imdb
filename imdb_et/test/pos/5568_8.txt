When I first saw Farscape's Premiere episode, I had no idea what to expect. I was extremely impressed and satisfied with Premiere. However, the following recurring checks have made a number of mistakes that were initially missing for me. "Premiere" is not a great episode of Farscape, but it deserves recognition for a successful and efficient set-up of the plot and the retrospective delivery of many conventional characters. Ben Browder, astronaut and scientist, preparing to open into space a Farscape module, a small spacecraft, enhanced by Crichton and his friend DK. Crichton has a revealing conversation with his father, Jack Crichton, and then begins a space flight. Of course, everything goes wrong and Crichton has "moved through the wormhole" and runs to the "far end of the galaxy". ship. Here, the characters and story of the Farscape series are introduced as much as hurry. <br /> <br /> Regular characters are properly embedded in the first half of the episode. Of course, Ben Browder has played Crichton well. He offers compassion to the audience character. She's missing and has no idea how to do something. In "Premiere" Crichton has to choose between joining prisoners or peacekeepers. He doesn't know anything on either side, but helping Aeryni (a busy peacekeeper pilot) shows he's going to help peacekeepers. He would probably not have been caught by the prisoners if it had not been Crais, a peacekeeper captain, declaring Crichton to be his brother's murderer. It puts Crichton in an interesting situation: he's stuck in strange, violent escaped prisoners in a distant galaxy he doesn't know at all. Crichton's complete ignorance of the world of Farsape makes him a particularly interesting protagonist during Farscape's first season. <br /> <br /> Supporting casting is just as weighty. There's Zhaan, the blue Delvia and the former prisoner. He is peaceful and sensible, contrary to the imprisoned Ka D'Argole, a powerful and strong warrior. Virginia Hey is completely covered with blue makeup, which allows her to cool and persuade naturally. By contrast, D'Argo's mega-makeup is down to par. She looks like silly with her giant tentacles and strange nose, and she has something special about her eyes. They look like they have some kind of allergic reaction to their man. Farscape gave some make-up to her makeup in season 1, but the overall costume would be at least a problem for me until the 2nd season. <br /> <br /> Rigel and Pilot's doll / digital characters are, simply, great. Rygel is a small Hynerian Dominar who floats around some hovercraft. Premiere gives him a good dialogue, but not much else. The pilot almost steals the exhibition as a link between a passenger ship, Moya and Moya passengers. Even in the first episode, the pilot gives the appearance of a real alien; he has never been a giant, expensive machine ever. <br /> <br /> Peacekeepers' signs are also quite interesting. Peacekeepers consist of a Sebacean race that looks like people. The main antagonist is introduced in "Premiere" as Captian Crais, who believes Crichton killed his brother. In fact, the death of Crais's brother was simply an accident caused by a Crichton ship accidentally colliding. Pilot Aeryn Sun, who helps Crichton to escape, tries to explain that death was an accident, but Crais simply claims to be "unclean" and refused to change his mind. Crais obsession with retaliation that is justified or not (should Crais be clear that Crichton is not responsible) is "mysterious" during "Premiere", but will be explained later in the season. Aeryn offers a very interesting character. He is forced to leave peacekeepers, changing his way of life and being in the same (albeit less difficult) situation in this respect than Crichton. <br /> <br /> The actual episode, as mentioned earlier, feels somewhat rushed and clumsy. So much happens that nothing is wasted. D'Argo (now) also looks like a silly run in his medieval costume, trying to threaten. However, Premiere is a definite entertainment. Special effects (such as starburst sequences) are impressive. Most of Moya's costumes and kits are original. Despite its drawbacks, "Premiere" is a must-have for Farscape fans. 3/4
