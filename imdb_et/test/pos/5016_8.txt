stuey unger was a legend playing card. he was quoted in the interview, saying, "Someday, I think someone may be a better No Limit Hold'em player than me. I doubt it, but it may happen. could ever play a better gin. it is this incredible man. <br /> <br /> I have some minor problems with this movie. as dark as this movie was, stuey's real life was darker. poker pro todd brunson said: "During the last world poker series, Bob Stupak, Mike Sexton and I had a drink and talked to Stust. In the film, Michael imperiol seemed too healthy for him to be a lifer in recent years. when the latter won his last wsop, he seemed like a skeleton, but let us face the fact that there was no time and "deniro" in this production to make such a transformation. My second problem was that I wanted there to be more poker games, real hands and situations. sure that it could have been an average non-poker enthusiast, but it would have been a nice costume. too bad that the movie wasn't 6 hours or so long. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie 3 with a non-poker player and they all enjoyed it thoroughly. As you do not have to be a former member of the colonial army to enjoy Gibson's "patriot", you don't have to be a poker player to see this gem. can't wait for a DVD. (8 out of 10)
