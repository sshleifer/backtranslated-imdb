I believe that anyone who enjoyed Eisentein Ivan Terrible's movies would enjoy this well-designed film. This movie was played as "Lord of the Circle: Return of the King" but without any special effect, but good and better drama. <br /> <br /> We have a German who is dressed as a FAQ, conquered Novgorod Russia. Russian invited Nevsky to lead them to fight against Germany to save Russia. Nikolai Cherkasov, who played Ivan in terrible films, was charismatic as Nevsky. The first 10 minutes he was involved in Mongolian transit was exciting. <br /> <br /> Many scenes were beautiful even in black and white. Waiting for war did not require any dialogue, such as "how much do we kill the enemy", etc.? Apart from a few calls, the movie can basically be played as a silent movie. The struggle for a nation's war, which is the birth of a nation, can be respected in the struggle. <br /> <br /> Another strength of the movie is Sergei Prokofiev's great musical score. Music gave the film an ethical feeling in these scenes without dialogue.
