At the beginning of the film I saw at IFC in the morning hours, I was full of claustrophobia and general discomfort. The feeling of not trying to escape was so powerful that I didn't know if I wanted to continue watching ... although I didn't think I had a lot of choices so convincing the situation at the same time, however, this discomfort (although it wasn't never completely disappeared), and I felt pulled into Tessa & Bobby's predictions and I just hope that they can come together. <br /> <br /> A really simple and powerful story that fits into a small package. I had no idea Sarah Polley had anything to do with it before she read her trivia, so now I love it. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend it. ... If your happiness has ever been captured by the Independent Film Channel or barely enough to watch it in some other way.
