Graphics are not the best part of the game. This is the best first TH game in the series. Underground. It deserves a strong love. This is a crazy game. There are enormous levels, massive unlocked characters ... it's just a massive game. Leave your money on this game. This is the money that is wasted correctly. And while the graphics suck, it doesn't make the game good. In fact, the graphics were good at that time. Today is graphics. WHO CARES? As they say in Canada, this is a fun game. (You can go to THPS3 in Canada) Well, I don't know if they say it, but they can. who knows. Well, Canadian people do it. Wait a moment, I'll get the theme off. This game tends to. Buy, play, enjoy it, love it. This is PURE BRILLIANCE.
