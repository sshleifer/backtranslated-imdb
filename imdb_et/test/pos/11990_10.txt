I'm a big minority here. I also didn't care about the original caddyshack except chase / murray duo and picked rodney jokes. Okay, break up: rodney vs jackie - with both Jewish and similar humor. Rodney is a bigger name and clearer. Jackie has a casual and observational approach to his jokes and this is more "your" at this stage. Jackie's attitude to everything is memorable and sort of inspiring! his quick lines and superfluous confidence left me a desire to express myself in this way. Rodney was good, but he wasn't enough, and he was more on his face and firing. Jackie, the look of a rare film, makes the perfect foundation for rodne (fire, gun-shaped hair dryer?!?!), Look at the little things! Play very well snob. The knight, despite her great TV / film career, shows her age. but he pulls some of the snobbish demands and wants to see him. Ted looks weak and is quite annoying, playing his anger and frustration with too much shock, while the chimney is accidentally slipping and revenge; you really hate her and you enjoy being unable to keep her. stack wins with me. <br /> <br /> murray vs I liked the murray / chase one better. murray plays his great, annoying, dirty character with obvious repair skills and is lovable but annoying. and the same can be said about aycroid. both will get annoying after a while, but this is a tie. <br /> <br /> I really loved Part 2 first. they have 2 totally different moody movies. The first part is more drugs / bathroom / sex humor with big names. Part 2 uses golf as a "sticky-to-to-the-rich" comedy to make one hour better for the working class. 80s Script? yes. a little far removed? yes, but wasn't the first? golf sport insulting? Yes, it's a movie. thin story? Yes, it's comedy with real humor - not "wolves dancing"! In addition, the 2nd part has a much better sound !! PLEASE HOW TO BE IN THIS PART ONLY! It's 98% of its kind of movie and it should never be called "CADDYSHACK" IT. that is, I'm a big caddyshack 2 fan and it's a great display of 80's fluffy entertainment with high quality humor. VIVA JACKIE MASON !!! All Reducers - Lighten Up! this is a great comedy. randy quaid was wonderful, jonathan silverman was wonderful, fuck, all were !! all this chat and now i feel like watching it! I think I want to
