It's a romantic comedy, so it's really a fairy tale, but unusual. Cinderella lives in a suburb of the ashes, with a good-looking husband who is not a prince. She can't find her prince, but she's not so beautiful. Instead of a city, he gets a little walk at least initially in Manhattan. <br /> <br /> Demme reaches the highest level in my mind. He creates a world where I want to move - the Manhattan neighborhood and a full street life with life and community. I would like to know what other movies people hated it. I'm always looking for lots of laughs and pleasant places to live "at least one hour".
