There have been many great comments on this film and I want to praise my voice for praise. Yul Brynner has never been more powerful. His major Surov was riveting. Your eyes just can't leave the screen. It's his movie. This does not mean the rest of the light, which was also exemplary, especially Deborah Kerr and Anne Jackson. Because they were mostly stage actors, they brought a lot of nuances to the performance. For example, I have seen this movie at least 4 times, but this is the first time I noticed the reaction of German girls when she came face to face with a Russian soldier. Though he did not threaten, he helped an absolutely hysterical reaction to realize that he must be in Germany after the Second World War and was likely to be raped by the Red Army. Being able to find a deeper story on a layer that may be under the surface, I want to see this fascinating film over and over again. Please put it on a DVD.
