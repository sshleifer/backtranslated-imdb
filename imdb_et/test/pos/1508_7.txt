The one who says that Lucio Fulci is not one of the most important names in splatter history is probably crazy. The Italian director is a legend among horror fans and his work goes beyond the barrier of the genre (who may forget his Western, criminal or fantasy fields). This is probably his toughest film and unfortunately the last one. The horror director (Fulci as himself) begins to hallucinate over terrible murders. He goes to a psychiatrist who believes he is a criminal. At that time, the doctor starts a long chain of successive crimes. There would have been something to fill the film with this plot. And there are rotating bodies, fallen or melted heads, clips, decapitations, chainsaw crushing and many others. sometimes the overwhelming violence that the gore addicts would like to save the film is boring.
