The documentary filmmaker investigates seemingly unrelated paranormal incidents related to the legend of the "southeastern" legend of the ancient demon. <br /> <br /> The film looks like one of these popular camcorders. in the last few months even one that will be released next week (PARANORMAL ACTIVITIES)! But unlike films such as CLOVERFIELD, REC and BLAIR WITCH, where most of these films are in full chaos and chaos with all the shades, it is mainly shown in traditional documentary style. It has TV extracts and interviews, and the fears are very fine, except for the last 20 minutes where we go into a chaos effect and where the fear factor rises enormously. <br /> <br /> And it works. The film is very appealing and it makes you think. Yes, you heard me right: it makes you think. You have to pay attention to the independent details attributed to these films and the profitability is high when the film interacts with each other during the film. The film is also very slow, which is good in this case. We, the audience, can swallow the details displayed on the screen, though they are fine or blatant. <br /> <br /> This is especially a scary little movie. I'm a man who fears more ghosts and paranormal than killers who cut teenage victims, so yes, the film gave me some nightmares. Here are some pictures that are really annoying to look at, including one at the closer end where it takes you to "What am I looking at?" Well, it's better without answer. Here are about ten repetitive characters, all of which gave authentic roles in their roles. <br /> <br /> The only thing I do not like is the end because most of the questions are left unanswered. The question "Is this?" went to my mind. It gave me a bad taste in my mouth. But the rest of the movie is simply harassing and scary. Don't look at it alone in the dark because you choose this option. I also see a couple of years after Hollywood redesign this film. This is interesting.
