Sometimes the Academy does not recognize the potential of some films or does not present them because they are contradictory or strong. Sometimes they're set, but they don't win anything (I hope it won't happen this year with "American Beauty"). It happened exactly in 1997 with the best film "Boogie Nights". The Academy preferred to give the best picture to the Oscar "Titanic", the purely commercial and hollow film and other prizes "Good Will Hunting" and the irritating "Full Monty". The other main categories mentioned were "LA Confidential" and "as Good as It", great movies, but "Boogie Nights" is even better and should have been remembered in more categories. <br /> This brilliant film tells the story of Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg, at a surprisingly splendid stage), a 17-year-old bartender Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds, Redeeming Actor), Director of porn movies, Eddie has a special "gift" and it helps him get into the world of porn movies, he changes his name to Dirk Diggler and starts to make a big success, but celebrity ... doesn't last forever. Other characters have parallel stories - Amber Waves (Perfect Julianne Moore), Buck (Don Cheadle), and others including Rollergirl (Heather Graham), an actor who agrees but he has to wear his own roller shoes. <br /> <br /> What could have been a banal, trivial film, become perfect, memorable in Paul Anderson's hand. "Boogie Nights" is such a big movie that does this, plus a smart, well-written script, a great soundtrack, and so on. Every character is very well developed and each of them is important in the context. Every feeling, weakness, fear, emotion is studied, resulting in a contemporary American cinema masterpiece. <br /> <br /> "Boogie Nights" is a strong, influential image that anyone who really likes cinema should see. At first glance, a plot that seems to be banal has a wonderful story of the peaks and lows, the things we are facing in our lives. This is an amazing portrait of the late 70s and early 80s, exactly the height of the heights and lows. It makes this movie a special and real masterpiece. <br /> <br /> 10/10
