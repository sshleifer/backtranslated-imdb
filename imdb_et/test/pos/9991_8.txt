20 years old, Francis Ouimet (Shia Lebouf) as his whole life before him - in a sense. The son of an immigrant family living in the United States at the end of the 19th and early 20th century was a very limiting fact in the classroom. When a person is born poor, one poor is left; when a person is born in a civic world, it has a small chance; when a person is born into a prosperous class, it is essentially a shadow. The British gold champion Harry Vardon and Francis' golf idol (played by Criminal Underrated Stephen Dillane) is the rule of exceptions. In a poor British family born and raised, his skill in golf gave rise to the dirty mess of poorer slums to the lush greens of English country clubs. He has not forgotten this lesson of life. Francis wants to follow Vardon's footsteps and uses his great skills in golf to get into the 1913s US Open 20th Century. However, the harsh course and terrifying opponents (including Francis' idol Harry Vardon) are not all that Francis has to deal with a less understandable father and a cruel social framework facing his own dream way of living. <br /> <br /> I know what you mean - I thought about it - Walt Disney's film about the US in 1913 Open-minded irritated Shia LaBeouf has the opportunity to be fun, but it may not be a big movie. I'm here to encourage you to think again. Regardless of what this may look like on paper, The Greatest Game Ever Playing is one of the best sports movies ever created. <br /> <br /> As with any major sports movie, The Greatest Game Ever Playing includes many exciting sports scenes but it is not a movie about golf - it's a character-centric movie about its talents, dreams, and the removal of class barriers . If the biggest game that has been played works perfectly as a themed sports movie, it works just as well as the periodic movie - the costumes and kits featured in the movie are the next best thing for the actual newspaper. The film just * seems * great and virtually unknown music composer Brian Tyler put the film on great music. There is also a fine but powerful Stephen Dillane as a British golfer Harry Vardon, a fun Stephen Marcus who is a male male golfer Ted Ray, hammy Josh Flitter as Francis's pre-teenaged caddy Eddie and a surprisingly good Shia LaBeouf Francis. Actor Bill Paxton (Apollo 13, Titanic) turns the director for the second time (directing full-length function) to the biggest game ever played. It produces a fine product that contains plenty of heart, ingenuity and attention to detail when making a film.
