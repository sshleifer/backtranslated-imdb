I watched Pola Xi because Scott Walker made a film score and I admire her music a lot. Frankly, I was expecting a somewhat pretentious and probably inconsistent French film. I was wrong. The film's vision succeeded in drawing attention to its full extent - starting with the opening sequence that shows black and white material from military aircraft throwing bombs into dark music sounds and Scott Walker's beautiful curve. The film examines Pierre's identity crisis (Guillaume Depardieu - for an excellent role in the role) and the resulting (self) destruction. The story is divided into two parts? The first depicts Pierre's carefree life in a beautiful country house in the French countryside, and the other follows his complete personal breakdown after he gave up and moved to Paris to live with his supposed midwife. Both parts contain some amazingly amazing photos? the first very colorful and bright, the second completely gloomy and almost apocalyptic - it brought a true aesthetic party. Pola X is an exciting and unique film experience.
