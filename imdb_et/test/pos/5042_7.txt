The title of the movie seems quite appropriate, considering the character of the driver Fanda. He is an older man who lives his life in the late autumn, but still talks to a central schoolboy who has just entered the spring thread. Old age weaknesses and death marks are illusions for him. His wife supports this idea when he notices, "Fanda laughs at funeral and death." In other words, death is not something Fanda takes too seriously; he has more important things than to worry about what is already inevitable. But the full fulfillment of life and way of life is the philosophy of Fanda's existence. He is not the one who just exists, but has to live every day and every passing moment, because tomorrow is not guaranteed. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be a strong comment about living, as if not tomorrow, let alone death. Too many people take life too seriously and, consequently, the real part of life is left out. For example, Fanda's wife; he is so worried that he is preparing for death, not in any religious way, but too practical, even inanimate, to forget how to smile, laugh and just spend time. His humanity seems to have become a zombie-auto-pilot mode. On the contrary, Fanda is probably too cloudy and incomplete for his own good. She needs her, like her wife, Emilie, to balance her. <br /> <br /> It's like Fanda embracing a child's invincible spirit, like a child trapped in an older man's body. He is introduced as an adventurous type; he pretends to be the people he can't get to reap the benefits, break up the money, the wrong ones, and always laugh. But deeper, he is a kind-hearted and gentle old man who wants to surrender to his overly pragmatic woman. These two are fairly pretty, although neither of them appreciates the binary quality of their relationship until they are metaphorically dead: meaning, divorce. Fanda realizes the reality of death and what he means when he is separated from his only love. Her husband is emotionally reminiscent of all his mistakes, but he is fond of being constantly loved, despite his mad behavior. At the moment when she forgave her, Fanda understands her selfish behavior in managing her wife's boners and makes an inner commitment to make her happy. Ironically, but after he has made this commitment, he becomes his later "living body" of his wife. The blood of life inside him flows away when he becomes like a zombie that passes through everyday movements. He no longer looks alive, but does exist. For example, he gives up his fake, does not waste money, quits smoking because of his wife (not his health) and generally agrees with what he wants. Excitingly, he makes him want to make him happy. Thus, the binary quality of their relationship begins to disappear slowly. Realizing that her husband is not the one he used to be, he is part of Emilie, who can't do the old Fanda. He is not able to have the unity of his spouse and the struggles they had before, because it was at these moments that they were truly alive, not just existing ones. <br /> <br /> I believe filmmakers tried to get a specific message here; that true and loving relationships are not always easy and comfortable, but often times are sacrificed and enduring in seemingly bad times. The chance of death at any moment is what reminds people to live every moment. Life is often taken for granted, but when it threatens to die, is it literally or figuratively? It's like they are afraid they will never live again so they can get better off of it. Fanda and Emilie had been married for 44 years in the fight, but it wasn't that both threatened death-separation with the possibility that they began to show their true colors. As the oldest maximum goes, "Love does not know its depth until it is separated." They both start to see what is most important in life and what they are about to meet. More importantly, they make intimate relationships with these important others.
