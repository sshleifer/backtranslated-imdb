A wonderful movie about people. I first saw four friends when it was initially shown in theaters and I've seen it several times. If I don't see it when it is on TV, I get with my friends and rent it. People I watched this movie are always enjoyable. It works with friends from childhood to adulthood, the 50s and the 60s. It is very funny and touching, dealing with first love (and first sex), racism, war, politics - throughout the 60's. It can also be quite dramatic. If you enjoy movies from people, it's definitely worth the time.
