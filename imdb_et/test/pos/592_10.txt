I'm a 17-year-old and biased Muppet fan, and although I love Treasure Island, a Christmas song, and a great muppet capri, Muppet's film deserves the best of them. It's a lot of fun, thanks to Jerry Juhli's delicate script and the film looks beautiful with some beautifully staged musical numbers. Speaking of songs, I really liked them to be not the best singing points for the Muppet franchise, but they were very happy to listen, especially never before. Never before has one of my favorite music with Muppet for the first time and with professional pirates. The muppets were usually fantastic, especially the always pleasing Miss Piggy and chemistry between Kermit and Fozzie were great. And what a great person - from Bob Hope to Orson Welles, Madeleine Kahn (the same wonderful actor who brought us fun movies like What Up Doc ?, Blazing Saddles and Clue), Cloris Leachman, Steve Martin to Richard Pryor, all of them made memorable guest performances how cautious not to overshadow the Muppet in a fantastic movie. 10/10 Bethany Cox
