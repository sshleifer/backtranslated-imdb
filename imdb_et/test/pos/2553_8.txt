This almost documentary look at the entrepreneurial boy who lives outside of the New York body shop is real. Real lighting. Real sound. Less editing in the entire movie than 1 minute in most movies. And while there is a very small script, there is a story. In the basic colors, almost all red, white, blue and yellow, we get a real sense of the boy's life, doing something. She has a place to live, she does, she has a good job and tries to bring her sister into her small universe. People in the shell shop also look at the culture I didn't know. They usually look good and pay Ale, which seems like everyday, to really worry about their well-being. The actress (guess) who plays Ale says more with one face than you can imagine. It reminded me of a real little movie. It shows what children are capable of, even without much support and love. We strongly recommend.
