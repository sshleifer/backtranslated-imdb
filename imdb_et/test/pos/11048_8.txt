This movie is worth whatever you hear. Marie Dressler's performance (I hope I write it right) when drunk old war is enough to watch this movie. This is amazing performance. He has been in a drunken stupor for three long scenes and he doesn't do that twice twice. You can actually make the smell of alcohol when it is ready. Amazing. And of course Greta talks about her first films and shes. Eugene O'Neill's story is strong and, like most of O'Neill's stories, very deep and intense. It's not easy entertainment, but if you appreciate the actors of the 30's and 40's big characters, you like it. Some movies are technically fuzzy, but everything is worth it.
