IN & OUT is, in my opinion, a very fun movie. I thought Cameron (Matt Dillon) was wrong to say Howard (Kevin Kline) was gay. I liked the Howard Bachelor party most. It was because they broke a lot of things, including Barbra Streisand's films. I also thought Emily (Joan Cusack) looked very beautiful in her wedding dress and that Howard seemed good in her tuxedo. My favorite quote from IN & OUT is: "Is everything gay? Is it" TWILIGHT ZONE "? It was a lot of fun! One sign I couldn't have was Sonya (Shalom Harlow) very understandable and nervous, all in all I recommend this movie to all of your Kevin Kline fans who haven't seen it, be ready to laugh at HARD and see the good time.
