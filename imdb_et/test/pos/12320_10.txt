The latest film by John Huston, the great American director of Irish origin, is the adaptation of the last short story by Dubliners, the largest writer who ever came from Ireland. Film is a family thing. The deadly director made this son, based on a script adapted by Tony Huston, of one of the most beautiful, beautiful and profound short exhibitions ever written in this language and read by many of THE BEST's short stories in English. John directed his daughter Anjelica to her best screen. The film is short, only 83 minutes. It does not have any sequences of action, no plot, it is almost without events and it may seem slow. Guests, friends and relatives come to the party, which takes place in the fourth week of January 1904 in Dublin, at the house of two older siblings, who give dinner each year with music and dance. What viewers see for the first hour is the ensemble's conversation. Guests speak, listen to music, discuss the latest opera premieres and make jokes, sometimes uncomfortable. The conversation gradually turns to long dead friends or relatives whose memories have never disappeared. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that you must stay, let it pull, listen to what and how the guests of the parties say how they communicate. Pay attention to body languages, their faces when they drift from today's light, laugh, and music for a long time, but have not really left the most precious memories where the title dead is not dead, but forever young and alive. When you do, you will be given such an emotional power and effect the last scene that will always remain with you. It breaks your heart into pieces, pulls them together and puts it back. The film and the story of Joyce focus on Gabriel Conroy (Donal McCann when James Joyce's alter ego gave a very mobile underestimation) as a party guest arriving with his wife Greta (Anjelica Huston). Gabriel is still in love, knows a close bond and fascinates her. She is after the party, she discovers that even after many years of closeness, she does not know everything about her past, her pains, regrets and unforgettable emotions and losses she had lived as a young girl, and she is not part of it. For the first time, he looks at him and thinks he is not his infinite part, but as a second person with his inner world, his loneliness and sadness, and for the first time "strange, friendly damage" because he came to his soul. "This is the one who tells the story of the ultimate powerful and deeper lines:" Snow is common throughout Ireland ... who falls weakly through the universe and falls weakly, like the last ending, all living and dead. "<br /> <br /> If you haven't seen a movie or read Joyce's story, please do it. They are really works of art that leave an eternal impression and make you the best in you.
