When I watch this movie, I can't compare the comparison between that and Wild Reed, another thoughtful film about the age of teenagers. <br /> <br /> Like the wild Fridays, this movie is slow and the director is in no hurry. So if you want a quick solution to things, don't look at it. This film is like a slice of life that begins imperfectly and ends imperfectly. There is no resolution, no one happily ever, just like in real life. <br /> <br /> This movie is as real as it gets. Operation is surprisingly good. The director is fond of a long, really long, shot, and the actors and actors stand out for the nuances and inner thoughts. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. I almost didn't look at it, but now I'm very glad I did. It's not a movie for everyone, but if you're ready to bring it to you, you'll be rewarded. <br /> <br /> 10/10
