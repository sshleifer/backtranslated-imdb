What is the first conversion scene that is music? I've heard it was "the Greeks can't get free". Is that right? I liked this sound. I also liked Hyde's Got Nothing to Hide in the last scene. Really a doper movie, but a lot of laughs and puns, eyesight and punches. Mrs Woo-Woo's place reminded me of some of the places I have visited myself. Ivy Venus has appeared in another matter that is truly amazing. She looks very different in the movie we're talking about, but her maturity didn't hurt her. Mark Blankfield resembles Gene Wilder in some ways. Bess Armstrong was beautiful and maintained his beauty for a long time.
