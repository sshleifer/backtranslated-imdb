The best fan boy movie I ever watched "Free Enterprise". <br /> <br /> Sometimes it reminded me of an earlier Kevin Smith movie. While playing the role of <br /> <br /> this movie is probably ridiculous. Don't expect a big budget here, sometimes it is questionable, but it really adds to the atmosphere they create. The script is truly humorous, with many spiritual moments worth experiencing. <br /> <br /> Bard, which is always killed, was running for me. The sexually confused player also played too much smile on me. But finally ... It was just a great movie that introduced some of the better moments in the life of a geek who had a great time with role-playing games. <br /> <br /> If you are bored and never got into the role playing game, it will be a good attention. Real unexpected treatment.
