How I interpreted the movie: First things. There was no scene in the movie where u saw a bad boy (Taylor) torturing or nailing Beni's hand on the wall. The same cannot be said of gals. Finally, u Taylor disappears when he walks. Looks like the message was "There was no Taylor". And the whole movie was Ben's imagination. Also, there were no scenes during torture moments where any gals stood or was in the same frame as Ben. It was Taylor all the time. But actually, Taylor was Ben. If they were two different people, why didn't there be any scenes that would have shown both frames in terrible times? But, of course, before that you will see both of them together and this is just Ben's imagination at work. Even when Ben was out of prison, the text on the screen says clearly that Ben's story was unrealistic and that the place he had explained was not (read mine, cars, etc.). find ben, he can't find him. Why ??? Because Ben (Taylor) was looking for a galsi. Instead, Kristy is always in the world of Taylor's (Ben) webcam, photos, etc ... <br /> <br /> Any amount takes only one fact that Kristy and Liz both knew Taylor was Ben. So, my conclusion is that Ben was a schizophrenic and the movie you saw him, and Taylor in one frame was nothing but his imagination. Otherwise, if Taylor really was, they would have had to find him, given all of the detailed explanations from Ben.
