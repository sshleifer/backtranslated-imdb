Maybe one of the best movies ever made. Orry's and Goerge's friendship drives deeply, and the war puts their strong friendship in tension. As a Southerner, I can honestly say that this epic is as accurate as it gets. Brothers, brothers. Can you imagine what life has lived during these times? The best part of the movie was for me when The South gave up; General Grant strongly recommends President Lincoln to stay south, he says, "Mr President, many people want the southern bleeding of what they have done ..."

Then thank God that our country has survived. As Jesus said, a "house divided" cannot stand. "
