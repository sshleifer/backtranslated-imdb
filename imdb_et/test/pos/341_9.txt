In Sri Lanka, a country divided by religion and language, civil war has been estimated to be 68,000 people since 1983, between the liberationists of the cavalry government and the separatist organization Tamil Eelam (LTTE). that as a result of the war, over one million people have been displaced, homeless or lived in camps. Children and families affected by the conflict are appreciated dramatically by Tamil director Mani Ratnam in his 2002 film Peck on the Cheek, which has won several awards at the Indian Film Festival. Although civil war is just a story of discovery of young girls, the human cost of war is quite clear and Ratnam provides a universal context for fighting, pointing finger at global arms dealers as a source of violation. <br /> <br /> Beautifully shot in South India by Ravi K Chandran in a Sri Lankan landscape reflecting a moving story of a 9-year-old girl trying to find her true mother in the midst of a struggle in Sri Lanka. P.S. Keerthana is in a memorable phase, Amudha has grown up with a loving middle-class family with two younger brothers after her natural parents Shyama (Nandita Das) and Dileepan (JD Chakravarthi) forced to flee when she left, leaving her red cross camp. In a loving setback, we see Amudha's adoptive parents, Father Thirut (Madhavan), a well-known Tamil writer, and mother Indra (Simran), a TV personality, getting married to facilitate their darker-skinned girls. <br /> <br /> Young Amudha does not know that he has been accepted until it is suddenly on his ninth birthday, according to the parents' prior agreement. When he plays, Thiru tells him almost "that you are not our daughter" and the answer is predictable. Frightened, he doubts who his father was, what his mother's name was, why he gave him up and so on, but little answers come. Amudha runs several times until his parents agree to go to Sri Lanka to help him find his true mother, now a Tamil separatist fighter. The family diving in the civil war in reality leads to some traumatic moments and complicated decisions, which are mostly dealt with by the Ratnami skills, although the sequence in which the family was caught as a crossfire seemed amateurish. <br /> <br /> A Peck Gun is, of course, a Bollywood-style movie and it means tons of music and melodrama. Melodrama did not get on track due to strong results from leading players; but I found the musical dramatization of A. Rahman's songs with the movie's mood with their slippery, high-tech techniques and fast-paced music video editing. Nonetheless, the story goes beyond the nature and honesty in which it is said, the limitations of the film. Many have criticized Tamil cinema, even in a country where they are too clich√© and commercial, but Peck on the Cheek is both an entertainment movie and a serious problem. Being successful in crossing the boundary between art and commerce is not a rejection, but a tribute.
