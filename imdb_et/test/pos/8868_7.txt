It was very funny, even if it was a little bit late. Hitchcock does not miss respect - Owen (Danny DeVito) was happy that the local cinema played "on the stranger train" so that the film's show tells you it was inspiration. <br /> <br /> DeVito is very funny, but also a little sad. He has no friends and everything he wants to do is write and have something like writing. His teacher, Billy Crystal, passes some serious writer blocks on his own and his wife has stolen his book and made it his own success that also deceived him. <br /> <br /> The best parts are Mr Pinsky's book proposal ("One hundred girls would like pork") and all the scenes with Anne Ramsey, who is so terrible that even Mother Theresa would have wanted to kill her!
