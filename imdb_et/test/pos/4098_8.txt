I saw this movie when it first appeared in 1973 and loved it. Since then, I've been looking for a video but haven't found it until 33 years later when I ordered it from Moviehunter. Sorry to say it won't tolerate. This glamorous version cannot rise to the production level of 1937. I love Burt Bacharachi's musical score, that is, when I listen to myself, and I even bought it from the CD, but for my taste, it's not a mysterious and delightful story. Just not suitable. Michael York is missing here. Sally Kellerman strikes a fine performance, but Olivia Hussy is just ridiculous and not worth the Himalayas. The best result is Charles Boyer as head of Lama.
