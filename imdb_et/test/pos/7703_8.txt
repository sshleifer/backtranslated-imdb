One of the most horrible, depressing, but striking documents. I looked for a while. There is no story or story that has been talked about, but a "third eye" type camera that follows about 2 pairs of heroin addicts in NYC through the seasons. Watching them on the floors of public laundries, "clean" their needles in public toilets ... sometimes it is a bit too much and you have to hit a break just to go to the breath. <br /> <br /> Anyone who is currently restoring alcohol / drug addiction should look at it if they want - it really shows what you could go back! After that, it is a wonder how someone could even try this medicine. <br /> <br /> The only thing he needed was in the final stages to say where these people are today. No one has any hope of deciding what is shown in the document. They mention that they want better and stop, but it seems that the only end of these habits is to give up on the way of death. <br /> <br /> This is definitely not for all target audiences. I found myself looking like a car accident - after I started looking at it, I couldn't turn it off. I had to watch in the dark / illness that is like the addicts' life.
