It was a film that I came randomly. I went through and saw it was in Showtime so I looked at it. Now look at it at least once a month. This is a movie full of symbols that can cause some people to trash. Don't listen to people who hate this movie if they want an expensive f / x movie, they should have allowed them to rent a movie. If you have a good sci-fi mood, I highly recommend. When buying from DVD, I recommend the Alliance Atlantic Edition, which contains many more extras than the Dimension Films edition.
