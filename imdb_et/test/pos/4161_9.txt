Strengthening Agnes Godard's (Beau Travail) expressive cinematography is a golden door to a visually striking tone poem followed by a peasant family trip from its primitive home in Sicily to Ellis Island in New York at the turn of the century. This is a surreal, puzzling, often strange, but ultimately profoundly satisfying experience. Bringing a dreamy and symbolic image with realistic realism is the last film of Immanele Criales (Respiro) as an impressionist painting - an image of a filmmaker that the immigration process may have been for our parents and grandparents. The "magical, mysterious excursion" of Criales began with his visit to the Ellis Museum in Iceland, looking at the photos he saw and his research on the harsh policies and procedures used by immigrants. <br /> <br /> Based on the letters he read about immigrants sent to his native relatives, Crialese identifies those impoverished immigrants who were able to see the positive side of things beyond their challenge. Salvatore Mancusa (Vincenzo Amato) and his older son Angelo (Francesco Casisa) are far from America's dream of knowing nothing. After climbing the rocky mountains to pray for the signs of the saints, they will be rewarded when they are shown with Salvatore's younger son (Filippo Pucillo), deaf silence, postcards depicting a new world as a land where they can swim milk in rivers, sit under the mints or catch a giant onion and carrot. <br /> <br /> After destroying these animals in exchange for shoes and suits, Salvatore, his two sons, and his older mother, Fortunata (Aurora Quattrocchi), put more hope into their adventure than intimidation, but the equation will soon shift differently. When they reach the boat and move to their overcrowded third-class wheelhouse, the film is the scene that speaks the most. Using a general camera that shows massively the people who pull out the ship, the frame frame is divided into a ship and those who jump from the dock and how they are separated indicate that they have been torn from a familiar person. br /> <br /> The ship has a mysterious English woman, Lucy (Charlotte Gainsbourg). Crialese does not disclose his past or the reason he travels to America, but he seems to be standing in front of the modern world. Although they look carefully at each other, Lucy is interested in Salvatore and asks her to marry to allow her to enter the country. The trip is fraudulent with the violent storm that bounces on the ship. Shot in almost complete darkness, the riders are driven to the side of the boat and later their bodies lie on the lap and twist on the floor as if Tabentanz. Ellis Iceland's immigration processing ritual does not become easier, and Crialese is attacking how illiterate peasants, for the sake of "civilized" society, are forced to work together to make puzzles, perform mathematical tasks, and undergo degrading medical examinations to prove they are "fit". <br /> <br /> The marriage mediation ceremony seems to be an auction block and young women will see despair if they fit with overweight middle-aged men. This is the only way they can enter the Golden Door because single women are rejected if they have no partners who seem to anticipate the risk of prostitution. Around the mist, the immigrant can hardly see the land of milk and honey, and there is no Freedom Circle that would ask the tired and poor, humble masses who long to breathe. But with its imagination, the river flows, waiting for them to jump. Although the end is ambiguous and one door opens to an empty wall, the other door symbolizes the revival of the soul and the passage we must all take to the new world.
