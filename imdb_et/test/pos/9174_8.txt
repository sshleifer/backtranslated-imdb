Hitch is a frivolous comedy that attracts you with some fine performances. Will Smith incredibly reveals the bundle and dagger date of the Doctor who must remain invisible to protect his clients and his profession. Smith was great, never pulling it too much. <br /> <br /> The best thing is going to the actor (not knowing the name) who plays the accountant who has fallen for the woman who is in her league. This actor did an excellent job of developing character when he listened to Smith's direction, but ultimately it is not easy to help who he really is. <br /> <br /> And finally this is the main message of this movie. Be the one you love, and you're OK. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Will Smith will meet this attractive lady and the date when the doctor will taste her medication as she slowly falls to the woman. I don't know his name, but he was pretty good too. <br /> <br /> In general, it was a pleasant, light film that is definitely worth it.
