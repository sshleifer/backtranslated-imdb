I have a 4 year old daughter and before that movie she was about Princesses of Disney, now she looked at this movie and everything she can talk about is Princess Genevieve and all her sisters. I definitely recommend this movie to all young girls. This movie is one of the best in Barbie's collection. It shows all the good values ​​that each mother could encourage girls. With big songs and dance moves my daughter gets up and tries to imitate the traces. The extras are also good, one works even when your memory is good. Certainly I would have said that it should be for children and adults.
