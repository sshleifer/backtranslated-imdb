I got it as part of the Cartoon Noir package at Portland's Clinton Street Theater and it was just brilliant; a merciful grace that was other wise, which could simply be forgotten when the films were poorly grouped. <br /> <br /> The perfect use of deep black and pure white with superb but simple animation, it's just a story of a cat chasing six. Funny, charming and touching. A small part of heaven for lovers, romanticists, and everyone else who appreciates how beautiful simplicity is. If it's in your city, look at it. This one short is worth the entrance price.
