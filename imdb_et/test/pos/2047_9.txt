Rent it, own a DVD, got it for $ 9.99. Stolen is so underestimated. Of course there are better movies. Films that have fewer or fewer holes in the scheme or activity. BUt I have no such problem with this movie. For me, if the film remains honest, honest, and exploited by its mistakes (and virtues, probably!), Then it has fulfilled its purpose. I was able to take care of me because its makers took care of it. The whole movie is reluctant to the end, but its makers took the whole company seriously, and I didn't feel the film was taken seriously. And this is so true, because I want to take every movie seriously, so much, let me down. It's almost complete and fun for this movie! What a funny scenario! It has also become irrelevant in the light of the events of September 11th. I will in no way try to minimize the damage. However, this film contains the collapse of WTC traditions before it happened in a way we never see when the film was made after those events. <br /> <br /> "... this is good or is left here." "Don't you agree?"
