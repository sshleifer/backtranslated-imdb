I was really surprised when I found this cable TV a couple of years ago. The story is a great example of how our land changes and the struggle to hang and use it as needed. Conflicting wishes of "people" and government. The actors were fantastic in their portraits and I loved the Tantoo cardinal completely - he is so plausible and it was such a movie like Rip Torn. The story was also a love story of the earth, the past, and the two main characters. I've tried to buy this movie and haven't been able to find this movie, but I'd be sure to embrace it.
