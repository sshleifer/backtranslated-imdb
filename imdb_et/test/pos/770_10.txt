Having seen Harry Potter's films, I have been a fan of the trio actors Rupert Grind, Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson; Yet, we've been waiting to see if they would do other projects to play the same characters a year or every two years J.K. Rowling series. Mainly instead of trio, cameras and magazine articles focus more on Daniel and Emma because they are the leading man and only the leading female who leaves Rupert. It does not matter that every actor has time to shine and Rupert's light hits him once in this film. <br /> <br /> "Driving Lessons" is called Harold and Mauds of this generation, Rupert Grint plays Ben's role as Marshall, a young British boy who lives with his dominant mother (Laura Linney) and the spirit of the spiritual (priest) father whom he wants to work in the summer, but can't find a job at the same time with his driving test (and failed) and writing poems for a young girl who doesn't care about her. <br /> <br /> Ben is looking for an advertisement in the church newspaper that needs to be looked after by an older woman. He takes the job and realizes that he is a wonderful surprise, like Evie (Julie Walters, Rupert's mother in the Harry Potter series), a non-working actor who is also a poet who gives Ben a run for her money. They bind together and tell each other the secrets with Evie like a child and get into the evil where she pulls Beni along the national road tour. Ben is driving not only from Britain to Scotland, because Evie has to say in the local library, but at the same time the older lady falls to the young man where Ben starts to be a man. There is an accident and at the same time we rejoice with Ben and Evie saying that I was very happy about this movie when it came out in theaters and I was impressed by Rupert Grind's example, especially when she showed the rest of the world that although he brings a little Ron Weasley to Ben Marshall, the actor hasn't stopped his brilliant performance.
