I am 15 years old, usually my age is not an old classic movie. But this is one of my favorites. I was totally addicted to the first time I saw it. It's really good if u think about technology and movies at this time, music is great, storyline is OK, choreography is great, must see it. I don't know why there is a prequel for this movie. Not many people like this movie, but I love classical love films, they are so much better than movies now! This movie makes you smile, cry and makes you dance. Music is totally ear-catching and beautiful. I have not seen Dirty Dancing 2 Harvana Nights (prequel), prequel should have original actors, that is what I hate for preforms, they destroy the original. Nobody wants a prequel, they want a sequel. Many people agree that the film has enough original, sequel and third. In addition, people don't want to look at it. Who remembers the movie about St Benard's Beethoven? I think there's a total of 5 movies.
