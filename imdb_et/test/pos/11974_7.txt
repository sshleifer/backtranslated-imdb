I consider myself a fan of Dean Koonz; having read many of his novels and liked them all, but unfortunately I never got to read the observers, so I leave no choice but to rate this movie from my own, rather than compare it with a book that I am not reading. I went into it, waiting for something terrible, and though I didn't get the perfect horror movie; I have to believe that fans of this book who appreciate it because of the right in the movie, Watchers is an entertaining and somewhat original little horror film. The plot probably has some effect on Predator and it starts with an explosion in a research lab. It is not long before a strange beast dies in a shepherd and a dead man's daughter has taken the dog of an extremely intelligent runaway. If the murders continue, there will soon be a secret government agency. The boy is still fascinated by the dog's intelligence, but it is somehow related to murders and the agency will soon be a tail. <br /> <br /> This movie script was originally written by Paul Haggis, who later abandoned him. I do not know why? Writing here is not nearly ridiculous because her 2004 hit Crash! Anyway, the main reason why this movie works is, undoubtedly, the dog that is not quite cute is the best actor in the movie. Corey Haim, who is successful in missing boys, is a human leader, and in fact the dog is quite a good chemistry, although it's a little ridiculous to see that he talks about it mostly through the film. The plot is quite complicated and as such, the film is more than a bit dirty; but the ridiculousness of all of them draws it through uncomfortable moments. The film also features Michael Ironside and is also a "bad cop" by government representatives. Of course, the monster is one of the most interesting things about the film, and the way it kills people is always entertaining and gory; though unfortunately we don't see that much and when we finally make it quite disappointing - probably the filmmakers have seen Bigfoot and Hendersons! However, it is a movie that can be easily enjoyed despite many problems, and I would recommend it to every spectator of the eighties.
