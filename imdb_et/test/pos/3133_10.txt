Two horsemen arrive in the city and meet the leader of the Mormon group, who is linked to the valley where they can live and live in peace. Arranging scenes in the city where Ward Bond and Ben Johnson were in the negotiation, and Bond introduces their ideas (Johnson and his partner Harry Carey Jr.), who take the train to this valley, are some of the best films, like Johnson, a real cowboy, banging a piece of wood, when he is driving with Bond. On one track they will come to Joanne Dru, who may have seen John Ford on the Red River, and offered him a much better part in this movie. There are several notable signs on the Morman train. Mormans is a peaceful group displaced by a truly low biodiversity group. For those (bans), people on the train, and then the Navaji band they're experiencing, and the well-written characters played by Ben Johnson and Ward Bond, the movie completely excludes stereotypes, while the camera seems to be spending so much time giving The viewer has a big picture of Monument Valley, which shapes the train as it moves along some waterways along the road, stunning in black and white, and then returning to what is happening in the community in this roll, to the accompaniment of the beautiful vowels of Pioneer Sons.
