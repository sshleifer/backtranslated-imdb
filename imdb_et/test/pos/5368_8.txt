Young couple - father Ben (solid Charles Bateman), Nicky (lovely Ahna Capri) and their daughter KT (lovely Geri Reischl of fame "I Dismember Mama") - find themselves in the small towns of California. hysterical lunatics. Worse still, there is a dangerous Satanic cult that has kidnapped toddlers for their merciless purpose. Directed by Bernard McEveety, working with William Welch and L.Q. Jones (Devil Times Five director Sean MacGregor came up with a strange story), convincingly associates an odd chart with a slow but steady pace, and gently creates a nervous, mysterious bog-booga atmosphere. Strother Martin offers an excellent job of wicked and vigorous work, like Dr. Duncan, the gleefically sinful leader of the evil sect. Exceptional prices for top-notch actors qualify as an important asset: Jones is a gruff, a no-nonsense Sheriff Hillsboro, a friendly local by Alvy Moore, and Charles Robinson as a terrible, furious divine priest Jack. John Arthur Morrill's bright, polished widescreen film, Jamie Mendoza-Nava's spooky score and wild, striking climatic black mass ritual are all the same fast. The idea that toys come to life as a murderer is simply brilliant (a place of opening where the toy tank is quite real and crushes the family in its car is really hanging). Also a nice uneven end. Pleasantly original and undervalued winner.
