I have read countless comments about the superiority of the mini-series. I certainly cannot agree to such a general statement. When analyzing all aspects of video / film production, there are numbered areas where the film is undoubtedly very good. <br /> <br /> Certainly, many comments apply to certain areas of the mini-area. -certificates. More specifically on more topics (customs officials) and more advanced threads (such as Pakistani farmer and family). This means that I found the character of Catherine Zeta-Jones much more convincing than desperate women from poverty to wealth who "don't go back." This is a much more pleasant character than the cold women who didn't feel their quick turn to evil. (And yes, I understand ... his children. He was desperate; I just didn't see him as desperate.) <br /> <br /> Besides, I appreciated some of the more detailed extracts from the mini series very convincing. Movie anchor. This yarn was changed (as an alternative to the Pakistani family) not only in good ways. Fantastic adaptation. (Of course, I am skeptical that such a system can have such a clean person, but I do not know enough about the policy of controversy). <br /> <br /> After watching the first episode of the mini series, I actually film again. Why? I read about a fantastic show. I found that the first series of mini-series performances are ridiculous. It certainly improved as the mini-series progressed. Now that you've finished both versions in a few days, I can't agree that the mini-series performs to the same level as Benicio del Toro, who was great in the movie, although Ormand, Paterson, Shah, and Lindsay Duncan were very good. I also feel the police are far from the miniseries. The Germans didn't impress me. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is a lot of nuance in the dialogue as it was in the movie. Especially in the transcripts. "Cautious, you get to know your husband." on the contrary, "HAHAHAHA! Again, I found that some miniseries are very convincing. It was a great example. <br /> <br /> Other higher aspects of the film, in my opinion: score, cinematography, editing. <br /> <br /> Should I complain that the movie wasn't longer? I think it was a fantastic customization given the format. The changes made were independent. I mean, would you sit in the theater for 5/7/10 hours. Of course not. <br /> <br /> Mini Series: 8 out of 10 <br /> <br /> Movie: 10 out of 10
