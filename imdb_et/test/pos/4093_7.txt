I have to compensate for all the terrible comments. I love this movie. I own a movie and soundtrack. I look at it whenever I need it. It is allowed that it is not a sound of music, but it is so fun when filming is not your thing. I adored late (and big) Bobby Bath, and James Shigeta has always been and always remains a favorite. I saw it coming out for the first time in theaters. I'm a big musical fan and it's 100 times better than Twiggy "The Boyfriend". It is a modern musical and should not be appreciated by anyone who went before. For me, it is best for dreamers who want this place to be found - sickness, wars, drugs, all the bad things in life are gone. This is nothing more than a good movie. It should be all movies. Shaun Phillips' title song is great and explains the whole feeling of the movie. If it's not the biggest one who cares. I love the idea of ​​a movie. Peter Finch, a very rigid actress, Liv Ullmann, proud ever, Sally Kellerman, a surprisingly good voice, Michael York, typical, and Olivia Hussey, stunning, all convinced me they were normal mill rides. None of them acted as film participants. They acted like real people, just as I would act when I found this place. Runaway between home and stay. Yes, there are mistakes in this movie, but get over it, it's not Citizen Kane, it's a good musical feeling!
