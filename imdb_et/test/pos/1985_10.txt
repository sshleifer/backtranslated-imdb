So let's start!))) <br /> <br /> The film itself is as original as Cronenberg's films usually appear ... <br /> <br /> My intention is to see that it was definitely my JJL favorite actor. She's as cute as usual, this cutie! <br /> <br /> I'm not saying it's my favorite movie. Still it is quite interesting and fun to follow. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is not very impressive, but it is not an unpleasant constellation. ;) <br /> <br /> Suggest trust!))))
