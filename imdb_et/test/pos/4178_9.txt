For a long time, I refused to watch "The Head" from the fan of "The Monkees" because it wasn't a warm and wonderful TV show. Instead, it was said that the "head" is a cynical, dark film. Finally, curiosity aroused me in the caves. Of course, I did not find a new episode for the TV show, but an exciting movie that raises my blind side. <br /> <br /> I have always been fascinated by dreams and the "head" was very similar to looking at someone else's dream, with incomplete quotes and a small detail at the end of a scene that caused the film to blend in a new direction, in a very dreamy stream of consciousness. Unfinished stories make my imagination wild, time and again! <br /> <br /> The film also features a very striking, beautiful cinematic look, with the appearance of a black-and-white, black-and-black, "Father of the Father". The music is haunting, especially the "floor song". ("Pringelo song" is the favorite song of my blind parties, while my bright side prefers "Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah." <br /> <br /> Finally, I think a "head" drama could have been used in the TV series , intrigue and intensity. But "Head" could have used some of the TV's warmth, humor and friendship.
