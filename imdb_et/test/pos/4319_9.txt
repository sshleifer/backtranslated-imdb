"Life Together, Die Alone" is divided into three main story lines, and each of them alone would have been enough for a big episode. So if you put all these together, you'll have a great ^ 3 episode. It was a bold step to give a seasonal kickback to a character (Desmond) who had only appeared in three episodes until then, but it worked: his background is absolutely interesting to look at, both informative and past. the island and the Swan station themselves and honestly moving. Desmond and Penny seem magically related to each other, even if they are in the opposite direction of the world and both characters have worked beautifully (it's hard not to cry when Desmond reads the Penny letter). The action inside the hatch is tight on your seat, as Locke has decided not to push the button again, making sure that it was just a psychological experiment, Desmond gradually understands the consequences of this decision and Eco locks out and desperately tries to come back. Clock Melting and Locke's "I Was Wrong" is an unforgettable moment. Outside is Jack, Kate, Sawyer, and Hurley, who have been captured by others due to Michael's betrayal (after they have made a reasonable discovery of Pearl) and "Henry Gale" as a leader. Even the least important line of plots, Sayid, Jin and Sun, who drive to the beach where others are supposedly camping, contain one of the greatest mythological mysteries, where the giant shape is almost completely lost, except for the four-toe leg. In a nutshell: emotion + history + mythology + adventure + intercourse + danger of destruction + hope ring = classic episode of LOST. *** 1/2 out of four.
