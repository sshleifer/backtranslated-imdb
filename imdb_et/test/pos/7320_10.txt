This is the third of the three short shorts a team has ever made, and like many of their early ones, it's completely and completely hysterical! Now you own this DVD as part of the three Stooges Collection Vol. 1, when I feel it, look at it! <br /> <br /> In this short film, Moe, Larry and Curly play with three doctors in a hospital trying to help everyone, but a boy, they're all out of confusion! This short is another of my all-time favorite of the three Stooges short pants, I am also a very big fan of comedy and the three Stooges are hit by kings! <br /> <br /> When I heard that he was the best short film award, he was really curious when I heard it was lost, I was very disappointed about it! <br /> <br /> This short is one of the three Stooges, which is by far the most fun, I suggest you see this hysterical rebellion! <br /> <br /> 10/10
