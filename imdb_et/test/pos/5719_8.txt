I've never seen any John Leguizamo condition before I looked at Frea, and after seeing it recently in HBO comedy, it was better, more lively and with things I couldn't understand at the age of 14. Spike Lee did great leadership, keeping the visual corner parallel to the Leguizamo theater and his personal storytelling style; it is a substance and style that unites but unnoticeably. We get the Leguizamo race and sex (gender classes are classic), but much of it is family, and what I still think is fresh about his father. Even if things become blind, there is something fresh or crazy or random that Leguizamo pulls out and it works more often than not. If something falls (for me in any case), it may be his personality here and there. But in general it is such a fun material that is not tired, but it is so true that it persists. Find it when you can!
