This is the apocalyptic vision of the hell of our world today. The social criticism of our low, commercially-oriented values ​​makes this film an extraordinary vision of the clichés of "war hell" highlighted by a mysterious journey from a captain of the Special Forces resurrected to Cambodia, whose mission is to remove the (extremely biased) rogue colonel who has remained in military justice concepts to create his own world. When I saw Apocalypse in 1980, I thought it was a deeply flawed masterpiece. Especially I found the end of the trip Brando, which surrounds the heart of the darkness of Conrad, quite boring. Finally, I came to see Apocalypse Now Redux and the mistakes were taken care of. Redux makes the film a direct masterpiece, which is certainly one of the 100 best films ever made. Brando's performance now looks full and full, perhaps less mysterious, but much deeper. Martin Sheen is one of the best actors ever assembled. It is nice that early screen performances are shown by young Harrison Ford, Scott Glenn, etc., which indicate which fine players they will eventually recognize. The work of Robert Duvall, Fred Forrest, Lawrence Fishburne and Sam Bottoms is greatly enhanced by additional film footage. If you have never seen this movie, leave the original and skip directly to Redux. I wish we could get a New York Redux gang from Scorcese to fill all the gaps in this deeply flawed potential masterpiece.
