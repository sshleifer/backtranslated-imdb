This is a risky business if the Venice merchant is so proud. It can be a stodgy, a wood, a periodic piece, or it can be ridiculous for its redundant. This version is neither. Although I have not sold Al Pancino completely to Shylock, he gives a competent and respectable job. Jeremy Ironi Antonio is always ripped off with his tortured-spontaneous roles. Some of the smaller roles seemed to be a little big in funny fun, "the boy's own Venice adventure story", but the central plot moves through the film efficiently and compassionately. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that location shots, costumes, and interiors were almost breathtakingly disturbed. One thing I don't want to comment on is anti-Semitic content. The film is as reasonable as possible against the Jews, while depicting Shylock as a means of self-destruction. It is a sad comment that four hundred years later, the director of this film considered it necessary to comment on his nuances of view before the premiere at the Toronto Film Festival. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful movie and I am looking forward to many views.
