This movie has a great soundtrack and great actors for pretty unknown faces. I especially like this Welsh boyfriend who has it like American rappers who are harsh. The rupture between Jipa and Koop is brilliant because they have met like the best mates as if they were in real life. I've experienced some of the things in this movie and let me tell you that these people aren't going (especially when talking to Jip and Koop and coke). Danny Dyer is an invaluable price because Moff is a "party recipe" dealer and has more funny lines of film ... <br /> <br /> "I'm happier when I recognize my salt when I know music. I knew you won't let me down, I knew it! "
