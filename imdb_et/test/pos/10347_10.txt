Recovery is an incredibly moving work that deals with the devastating effects of brain damage not only on the person but on the whole family. The drama of Tony Marchant presents a family that is unrealized at the end of preaching or Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The highest praise goes to David Tennant and Sarah parish for their incredible performances. Before I saw the drama, I assumed that I would see bleeding in Blackpool's earlier relationships - but that would never happen. Neither actor is recognizable by any of the previous work, and I did not see either of them as an actor who played for the entire 90 minutes. In addition, Harry Treadaway, as a son at his own initiative, was fantastic at the beginning of his life - the whole work reveals the brutal nature of a teenage boy who has been thrown into an unwanted role as a house man, <br /> <br /> Sometimes almost all drama characters are atypical. As a viewer, I wanted to give each of them a good taste to awaken to reality, stop moping and begin to adapt to the rotting but very current change in my life. But under the same conditions, I see myself acting like any one of them - alternating between showing a rigid upper lip and despair to escape something, including behavior that is completely different. This is the greatest strength of the exhibition - the truth, without sugar cover, to force us all to think about what we can do under the same conditions. <br /> <br /> It's hard, but you have to look. I hope this can somehow show in the US.
