It is not always certain that you are making laughter by mixing comedies. Comics must actually love or admire each other or be ready to put together one another's crankiness. Go to WEST with Marx Brothers was Buster Keaton to write a script for the gag man. Groucho didn't think too much about Keaton's ideas and tortured him at the script meeting. And while some of Keaton's gems are still in the finished film (for example, a gun that turns into a brush for a changing brush), the film was one of the weakest Marx Brothers. <br /> <br /> A better film, as well as duel comics, was WC Fields and Mae West in MY LITTLE CHICKADEE, which pulled the script between double pairs of individual liners. But one liner was equally funny, so the film continues to be successful. <br /> <br /> But sixty examples are an example of six movie comics who worked well together. The reason is simple: it's really three comics working together: Charlie Ruggles and Mary Boland, George Burns and Gracie Allan and W.C. Fields and Alison Skipworth. Ruggles and Boland were involved with twenty comedies in the 1930s, usually with Boland as a somewhat superior husband, and Ruggles as the husband's nervous wreck. Fields (usually a single operation) were linked three times to Skipworth (TILLY AND GUS and when I was two million twice). Skippy always thought how to control or fight her husband's bad activities - this is the film she makes with her stolen money (she knows that the local sheriff, the fields, is not one to trust). With Burns and Allan, they can easily get involved with the Ruggle and Boland travels in their car ride. <br /> <br /> Ruggles quickly realizes what a mistake it was to accept to travel to Gracie - at one point he can fall off the rock and branch out. He is relatively helpless when he demands 1) to take him to a perch and 2) to improve his grammar. George and Gracie Humongous Dog ("Ran Tang Tang" is its name) makes Charlie and Mary's travel arrangements easier. <br /> <br /> Fields have some options. If he calls the quartet to shout, he says he is allowed to do it - he's a sheriff! He also explains the unlikely story of how he got his unworthy monster "Aus John" during the pool game. You have to listen carefully to the story because it stops when it tries to play the pool a couple of times (if it is randomly received by the billiard table), but it shows there were also items that would not have stolen in the field. <br /> <br /> Oh, in the "summary row" I mentioned the forgotten actor Bradley Page - he was the man responsible for Charley Ruggle's suspicions. Bradley must have a reason to leave the city to reach out to unwanted Ruggle and Boland so she calls her girlfriend. She tells her to call her job and says she must leave the city because someone is dead. There is a pause when he apparently hears a girlfriend's question. "MOST!", He says - clearly annoyed. Although much of the humor in the film is in the series of performers, Mr.Page's film had the most fun unexpected lineup.
