Accounts appear real when a human factor is added to the mixture. A lot of sadness. I'm sure I wasn't her .... another thing to add is that all the women in this show were not pretty women. But I don't think it would affect women, even though it was JFK Jr. What a shame. any loss of life is a real shame. <br /> <br /> It seemed his life was good. I recommend doing this when you are in biography and melodrama!
