I just finished El Padrino screening in Germany. Great movie. We look forward to more movies from Mr Chapa in the future. It was wonderful to see that such a well-assembled film is such a relationship and story that will remain a classic for a moment. The ending with a little vagueness leaves the story next. Seeing a great quality movie really describes Chapa's serious potential and her skillful skills as a writer, actor, director and filmmaker. Chapa has been impressed with his victorious "blood and blood", and now he is a critically acclaimed filmmaker with true artistic control for everyone who sees his works. Something that some filmmakers can afford.
