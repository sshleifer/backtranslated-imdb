After six months of searching, I finally found this DVD. All I can say is that it was worth it! "Rush in Rio" can be the greatest rock DVD presence. I'm not kidding. It's wonderful! The whole amazing sound is terrible, but it doesn't make the concert invisible. I find it makes you feel like you're actually watching Rio, look at the audience's concert. This is one of the reasons I love this DVD. It makes you feel like you really are. Also Geddy, Alex and Neil have never been in better shape! Geddy's vocals are flawless, Alex's guitar game is still incredible and Neil - absolutely nothing to say. The camera work done with this concert was very good, which I have to say. They gave us a good overview of all the stages and the audience. Tissue for cameramen! Anyway, enough to rob me! See "Rush in Rio" for yourself. You're surprised. I guarantee it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
