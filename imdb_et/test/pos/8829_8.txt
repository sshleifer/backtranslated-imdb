1 stop the faith for a moment and stop pretending we could, we could, or we should know, "how it is" or "should be" in space. Human knowledge in this area is likely to be primitive, because it is said that medieval maps are compared with today's satellite maps, so we really have no idea. 2 Given that it is "just" the BBC's TV simulation, it gets a lot better than many big budget Hollywood blockers, and it's just incredible. 3 In summary, it is an exhibition worth looking at as it represents an advanced and fancy account of CGI about what we know about the solar system so far. 4 most of the fiction and CGI is probably the only way to make it big for the general public. Have you ever seen clips from REAL space missions and REAL space probes? The quality is generally poor to average, and the comparison would be when looking at the chest x-rays (and what he talks about the human body) and compares this CGI with a cyborg movie ... which one would be the most entertaining? But the chest X-ray is real, while cyber crack is just fancy SFX. 5 participants do a good job. No one I say to my grandchildren, but very fair, this is a BBC document simulation.
