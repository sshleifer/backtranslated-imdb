I tend to be inclined towards movies about people who decide to overcome censorship barriers and express what they really want to express. The character of Eric Bogosiani's Barry is like Howard Stern, but more intelligent. The character itself is very exciting. As Oliver Stone's film, I thought I was expecting more. The film falls slightly during the third act. In addition, it is quite obvious that "Talk Radio" is based on a game with long dialogue scenes. But the film generally works. Bogosian is a big leader, and the fact that he also wrote the game that was the basis of the film probably helped him. If you want to look at one of Stone's major films, I suggest you watch "JFK" or "Salvador". It's not her best job, it's a good movie.
