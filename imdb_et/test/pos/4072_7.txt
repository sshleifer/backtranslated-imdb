It's a funny movie. Bob & Eddie Show seems to lead to a sequel, but I doubt it will make enough money. <br /> <br /> Deniro proves that he can again be a great straight guy with fun and spontaneous moments. Eddie was fun to watch people working with CGI animals and rodents. Rene Russo-well he's just fun to watch in any case and he has played his part perfectly. <br /> <br /> Some natural and unusual tricks, especially garbage collection. It's worth seeing in the theater. We needed a good laugh and we got a lot of movie and a lot of extracts at the end. DON'T take a credit early! <br /> <br /> At least 7.
