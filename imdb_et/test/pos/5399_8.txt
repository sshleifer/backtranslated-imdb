The magnificent heroes, then the remarkable work of 24-year-old Dan Harris, are labeled "People are never the ones who seem to be". Perhaps it is wisely chosen as a marketing strategy; yet, I rented this movie, despite the word mark, instead. And I'm glad I did. I found the way to a comprehensive study of the tragedy. I found this personally to deal with dreams: especially those that are lost. For one son, "loss" requires a deep investigation of what he had and what was not in his life. But the central tragedy of the film, while generating tempting issues on its own, works mainly as a background against which different styles of coping are released. I believe that the film asks about an important question: how do we manage our dreams, especially when the heroes become imaginative?
