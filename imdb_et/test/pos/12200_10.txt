The surface was one of the few truly unique TVs last season. I can honestly say that I changed my schedule so I could stay home for every episode. Tones, intercourse, science fiction etc. <br /> <br /> The story was a boy who found an egg that had hatched in a marine animal. The same sea creature who had killed the character of the brother and wife of the main game had seen. Most people think that this is a deadly killer machine, but raised from the egg was very friendly. <br /> <br /> The only problem is that NBC will be canceled, so now we never know what will happen ... Hopefully Sci-Fi or some other channel will pick it up.
