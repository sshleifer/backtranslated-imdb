This film is undoubtedly the clearest example of British humor that the Germans do not understand. The film, which is one of the largest film series in the British cinema history (St.Trinians), is the victim of a single liner. The story of bureaucratic incompetence in post-war experiments allows Frank Launder to direct the maximum talent of all pains. This is probably the only movie where Margaret Rutherford meets her powerful character in Alastair Simis (although she still wins). Joyce Grenfell (bless her) and Richard Watt deserve both the Dighton masterpiece and the English label and the rigid upper lip under pressure. Absolutely brilliant. Why 9/10? Only 83 minutes long.
