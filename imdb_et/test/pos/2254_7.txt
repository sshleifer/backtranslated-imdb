"Everything Is Illuminated" is first written by the writer-director Liev Schreiber, adapting Jonathan Safran Foer's first novel. The book was ambitious and sprawling, its magical-realistic elements and the use of a living language seemingly impossible to represent on the screen. Movie reasonably, catches less. Although the end result is not as original as the novel, it is still a film about a strange Eastern European journey, or, if one of these characters were, "a very rigid search." <br /> <br This character is Alex (Eugene Hutz), a young Ukrainian man who loves American pop culture, but doesn't seem to get English straight. Nevertheless, his grandfather (Russian actor Boris Leskin), who heads the American Jewish tourism company, persuades him to serve as Jonathan (Elijah Wood) translator. Jonathan examines his family's history and tries to find a woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis. More than one family secret occurs during their search. <br /> <br /> The Jonathan movie (which must not be confused with the novel's author) is a semi-kleptomaniac strange who steals his grandmother's prostheses from "family affairs". Wood's quiet, wide-ranging, serious way works very well in this role. Hutz is an impressive debut that is open, lightweight Alex. His malapropisms are fun, but he can also pull the character's growing self-consciousness. Dog Mickey is very funny when Demented Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. and one of the few dogs I have ever seen, which is not surprisingly cute and preceded. <br /> <br /> "Everything Enlightened" finally puts the Holocaust on a human level, asking us not as a general event, but as millions of concrete tragedies. Recalling the European film, it also reminds us of the effects of past events on young people like Jonathan and Alex. With its original perspective, there is a strong performance and some very eye-catching visuals, "Everything is Illuminated," for a great job for the first time and hopefully going to Schreiber movies.
