Ah! How good actors take the blissful material! If you think of this movie as a tight police thriller, you may be disappointed. Although the situations are very true to life, the plot runs with a very predictable clip and you can see quite well what is before the actors are there. Many criminals and side effects are really just moving stereotypes. Much of the dialogue is simply silly. <br /> <br /> But! If you love seeing the rise of good actors on such material and doing something about it, you love this movie! Sam Elliott is far from brilliant when the detective Falon's one-time sign is deep and sinful in life. Those who have never seen Elliot mimic the fact that far beyond his usual stoic attitude, he is delighted by the emotion he portrays in this film. And also in the early fifties he looks fantastic! His bare chest gives hope to middle-aged men everywhere! Esai Morales does an excellent job of raising her role in Det. Falon's avid beaver new police partner. He could have easily played this with Robinina Elliotti Batman, but he was breathing this role into reality and passion. He does it, despite some stupid lines he is told. <br /> <br /> Paul Sorvino is fun to watch! He plays the eccentric police captain. He seems to know he's slipping in this movie and having a ball. It makes it fun for us as well. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great number of numbers, but it does great performances! Sam Elliott fans should definitely get it, because it sucks to see how he can spread his wings and do much more than he usually does!
