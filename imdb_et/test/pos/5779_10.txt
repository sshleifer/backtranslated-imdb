A good documentary that looks at our society's oil dependency, our current energy problem, and finally talks about the impact of future energy shortages caused by oil production problems. <br /> <br /> This film should be educated for all students as part of their education. Show it to your children, parents, relatives and friends. They will thank you in the end. <br /> <br /> After reviewing the content of the documentary and comparing its sources, I would say that the facts of this film are scientifically supported.
