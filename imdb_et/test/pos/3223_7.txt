Every time I see this example, I want to turn it off and curse those who waste their weekly time. Dialogues or monologues tend to become so annoying as everyone just doesn't endlessly do anything. For example, yesterday, which I watched yesterday, the seemingly infinite rumor began about how a particular dish (I forgot what it was, macaroni with meatballs) always succeeds in a comprehensive war for Gilmore's family dinner. And they were just a few seconds or so. <br /> <br /> So every time, many lines seem absolutely zero. The scripts they use must be huge. <br /> <br /> But then every time something happens, something happens. Escaping stops and suddenly these wonderful, quiet, emotional moments. For example, this week it was Lorelai's division with a real estate agent. I thought it was the best TV I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> Almost everything is worth it.
