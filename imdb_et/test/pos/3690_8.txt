But big cast! Jonathan Pryce, Kathy Bates, Rupert Everett, Lynne Redgrave, Julie Andrews and Dan Aykroyd! And that's just the beginning. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if the movie and plot description describes you to see it. Suffice it to say that it has something for practically everyone: death, singing, a bright suit, cell phones, a small person (a beautiful looking woman, actually), a pull bridge (modern, not medieval), a bush and a cross lock. Oh, and psychotic. And Barry Manilow. <br /> <br /> You have to trust me when I say that 50% of you hate this movie because your DNA makeup is not an absurd gene. It's not your fault; it is hereditary. The other 50% would probably like to change the channel in 20 minutes, but you need to watch. <br /> <br /> Even at this time, you may wonder why you looked ... but keep that in mind with an absurd thing. It should grow on you. It's a test.
