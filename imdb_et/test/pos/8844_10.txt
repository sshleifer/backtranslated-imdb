I can't believe I've never added my two cents from this movie! <br /> <br /> It's one of the best movies of all time. Many critics and filmmakers talk about John Carpenter's "Halloween" trend setting and "best work". These people haven't seen this version of "The Thing" because it's "Halloween". <br /> <br /> John Carpenter's work is in this movie. He took a film that had already been made, and instead of "re-making", he made the first film based on the movie! The casting of each person was great, the tensions between them were real, it made me scream, made me scare, made me think, made me laugh, asked me a question, even today "Who's going there?" in this movie. This film did not have a Hollywood gold coin or a funny type of end, and what a bold step wasn't in 1982. Another great step. <br /> <br /> I was screening this movie when I was on vacation in Southern California. Session audience went wild! I wear these memories for years, it was so fun! We all thought that there was no way that God's green ground would be under the shock. However, because of the box receipts, it was due to two very good family-oriented films "ET, extra terrestrial" and "Poltergeist" in 1982 when the film came out. <br /> <br /> The movie was what I was looking for as an adult buff as a movie, horror / thriller with an adult script and real adult players. There are no children playing with adults. Not a little Miss "big ring" is the queen of the day's quarry, who runs around screaming for the title, but the real guys with real problems, offering some of the best monologues you will ever hear. Heck, being a feminist, didn't even want women in this movie! And Mr Carpenter's good, if not one, it wouldn't make sense! (If "The Thing" was actually feminine! Something to think about!) <br /> <br /> I saw the special effects of that time I've never seen, I saw a makeup that made me sit for a couple of nights. This is today's horrors / thrillers. Today, directors wimp out. Today, Studios wimp out. Too many CGIs and not enough faith, too much CGI and not enough story, not enough imagination. You leave the theater and after a week - or less - you forget the movie and move to the next big movie opening. It stays on ya. This is one of the great movie characters. <br /> <br /> For many comments, I've written how terrible it is to pay $ 10 for a movie now. For such films you would pay for it and you do not feel easy. This movie is not for everyone. <br /> <br /> I find it terrible that this movie is a "movie". I find that the audience is wider than many, which would lead you to belive, and although not in 1982 for commercial success, is an example of how releasing a released movie on the wrong date can make a good movie bad. After John Carpenter's movie, many people copied many of the techniques, makeup, special effects and story from this "The Thing" version. is one of the best movies ever.
