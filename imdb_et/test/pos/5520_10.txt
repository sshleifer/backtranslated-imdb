Look, this is a small budget horror film that suffers from all the problems with low budget movies. But you just have to see it to see Lisa Erickson's Julie. She is a SMOKIN 's hot and very small actor who will! This type of horror movie is often discovered by a rare pearl and The Power gave us Lisa Erickson! I don't like more than sitting in my studio with Coke and this movie. My friends Bob, Bill and Dennis agree. Lisa is not just brilliant, he's a hottie. The film itself often pans and the rest of the participants are not very helpful in this regard. But as soon as Lisa hits the screen, things will really jump. Others are obviously not in his league. It's not an exorcist, but as I said, if you want to see a small little movie with a hot little actor, that's what you see!
