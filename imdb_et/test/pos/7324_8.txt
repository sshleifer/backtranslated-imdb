It belongs to their upper levels, although there were others, such as micro-backgrounds and Punch Drunks, which were more Oscar candidates than that. But if anything else, a recurring loudspeaker message, "Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard," followed by Curly's "Woo woo woo woo", makes it a classic on two levels. First, it symbolizes everything Stooges represents; my daughter loves to repeat preaching when she is doing something stupid. Secondly, these three absurdities as a doctor in the hospital; I imagine the fear I felt when I was a real patient in a real hospital and heard this announcement over the loudspeaker. Throughout this short period of time you will hear this message and you will know that something terrible is going to happen and the loudspeaker voice will stay with you one month later.
