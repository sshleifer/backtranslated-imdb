This is news in Danish film. The mood is not the same as Blinkende Lygter, but Anders Thomas Jensen, but with a new touch. One difference is less signs, leaving them much more space. And what characters? Two butchers are perfect. Mads Mikkelsen is the dominant, corrupted parody and Nikolay Lie Kaas for indifferent relaxation when the twin brother is more or less unsuccessful.
