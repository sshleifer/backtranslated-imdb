This movie was released when I was 15 years old and I can easily associate the film with the depicted themes. <br /> <br /> It was over 24 years ago and I haven't seen this movie. This time I slipped some of the actors, but I still appreciated the movie for what it was. <br /> <br /> Life is not always fair and good guys don't always win, I think the movie did well to reflect that especially teenagers were always splashing lots of girls. It is also not important how nice you are that you cannot make anyone like you. Girls / boys like whom they want, no matter how hard you try differently. Sometimes you just have to go and say. <br /> <br /> Gary is doing a good job, showing Karen the intensity of her feelings. This is the case for teenagers as they are fixed. <br /> <br /> I remember sitting with friends who smiled our asses. The action isn't quite there compared to Fast Times at Ridgemount High, but it hits this movie just because FTARH has a flat viewer friendly, where this movie is realistic. Nice guys finish the last! Gary comes across pretty flat cringe material, but we all know men who are sensitive. We all know David, a fun man who laughs at you. <br /> <br /> Some people here end the bag, but until the end of the day, exactly what can happen in real life. Some chicks are going back, no matter how bad the guy treats them, especially at this age. I have experienced this first hand. <br /> <br /> Great soundtrack too !!
