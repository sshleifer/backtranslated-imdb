I saw this movie a few years ago and immediately bought a soundtrack because it was just great. Bacharachi's music is gentle and should be rewarded for what he deserves. Cinematography is fantastic. Critics hated it, but they hated HOME ALONE. I didn't find it on the video, but I welcome everyone who can find a copy.
