Abe Zwick refined once. He never made a second film, but created an excellent homosexual self-image in this film that is both corrosive and influential. He commands the screen by presenting man's crumbling debris, which is increasingly breaking under the strain of meaningless life. <br /> <br /> Paul (Zwick) is an aging queen who is somehow convinced that Stanley (Wayne Crawford), an uneven idiot without a future, follows his star. He is a little thief who recently hated anger. She is forced to leave the city and move to the suburb of Miami. Hidden, she dresses like a dry old blue horse with as much sexual torture as a church lady. She tells Stanley to tell her friends she lives with her "Aunt Marta". The Pope himself has no friends, spends a lot of time in the house and has to deal with Stanley's integral lifestyle. It is enough for a person to cross this border for transsexual killing. Again, Zwick depicts Paul as a tragic figure who has completely lost any understanding of how to communicate with other people. Nonetheless, in his distress, there is some poetry that burns slowly during the film. He is tragic, but also elegant. This is finally a very sad film. It certainly has a lot of fun moments, but there is so little such hopelessness and despair that humor is bitter. This movie is worth watching Abe Zwick's performance. He could have really built his career in Martha. He's pretty gas when you know him. Just make sure you cut your hair and stop your horse. He really hates it!
