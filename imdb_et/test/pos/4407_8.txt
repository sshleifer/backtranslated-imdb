I first saw "Knowledge" during one of the local independent stations in Los Angeles during the Thames Television marathon, when it was new. I enjoyed it very much with the threat of UXB. <br /> <br /> Since the film I saw twenty years ago, I should keep my memory so well that it shows its originality and the quality of its performances. <br /> <br /> I searched for a DVD here in the US and could not find any. Finally, I was gambling and bought DVD DVD from eBay and I was glad he didn't have a regional code. So those of us who would like to see this little pearl get a copy.
