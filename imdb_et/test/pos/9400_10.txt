This movie is on my top 20 comedy list. This is a truly unique film. For the applicant who said, "I need to be really missing." - You're right. You have something missing. If you do not have such a sense of humor then this film needs one thing. But don't give it a bad overview because you think it's "looney" but not intended. Loony describes both what he intends to do and what he succeeds. I laughed at this movie more often and much more intensely than in most other funny movies. was nominated for the best first competition for the Independent Spirit Award. Crispin Glover, as usual, is completely completely inexplicable, and some of his very funny lines in this movie were ever said. Glover is probably the best comic actor who is currently working. Harry Dean Stanton puts on a great comic book. William Burroughs is incredible in a small role. Dylan McDermott was perfectly cast and Lois Chiles is absolutely great. <br /> <br /> All of the above is completely funny in its perfect way, but it is one of Crispin's best performances - with his performances on the River Edge and Willard. If you are a fan of Crispin Glover, but you have neglected this film, you must stop all that you do and see it right away. <br /> <br /> But remember to relax first and maybe have beer or something. This is a great movie, but it is very unusual and I recommend you to be in a silly state before watching.
