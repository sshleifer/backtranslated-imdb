This movie was fascinating tonight. Thanks to Fox Movie Classics for its uninterrupted display. John Voight, the little-known black actor and especially the children, made it worthy of spending the Sunday night. How wonderful to see the early work of this experienced actor, as well as the great image of Paul Winfield by Mad Billy. I do not understand why someone would say that Hume Cronyn is wrong in the role of a superintendent. Who would have chosen them? Shrill character actor Charles Lane? Though his career is commendable, such an actor as Lane would have become less expensive. Cronyn was a great choice for this part. I read this movie as a real treasure to keep in memory.
