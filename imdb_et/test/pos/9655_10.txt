This is a great movie to be. I really liked every aspect of it, sword fight, romance, costumes were really well made and put together. The landscape is absolutely beautiful. I also loved the mystery and magic. The message of the power of love is that love is the greatest power. I really like the king's heart in the sense that he wants peace instead of blood and hatred of peace. I wish I could live in a world like flying ships, castles in heaven. I also think it was really nice how they brought the animals to the movie. I also thought the chef was really funny. I've been watching it several times in one day, and I still get it tired. I want them to bring it to a DVD.
