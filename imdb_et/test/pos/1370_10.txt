The crazy Scottish warrior race, deep in the outdoor space, with low food intake and free, started ten now with three who help these men with visual effects to suck halfway, but I liked it to be a useless creature when I met one, I'd escape , but not when I had Scottish companions, we would like to swear and avoid this destiny, so at last he was not guilty, it was a DVD, I was glad I was watching, but if they ever make a sequel, some actors dig , not everyone was equal, some were good, sparing, some were wood, and they could pack it, but the action kept me all watching, shooting, shouting, not stopping, I tell my friends they were not afraid, and watching yet another year.
