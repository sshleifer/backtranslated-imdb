The Sloher-sub-genre has been pretty much exhausted - in fact, even in 1979, just one year after the supposed "first gap", Halloween was released (which appeared seven years after the bay); the sub-genre was far from exhausted; but the tourist trap represents one of the more original outings. The film follows the same basic formula as most of the Slavers - that is, the madman murders the children, but draws its originality from being crazy from the beginning (not an invisible attacker or a mask man) and we actually get an overview of our character. The fact that this killer also has telecom capabilities, including the ability to control the wax mannequin in his house, adds originality. We start with a big opening order that says a young man is breaking a flat tire when he finds himself in a terrorist station. The scene is amazingly horrible, because the wax mannequins hit him and things fly from the shelves - and this gives the audience a great overview of the future; namely a very horrible horror movie! <br /> <br /> The reliability of action is the same as you would expect from the seventies, but to be honest; it's not that bad. Girls look warm, boys are not really important; and Chuck Connors is more than horrible in the role of psycho. He's not exactly Anthony Perkins; but still good enough. However, this is not the star of the exhibition, but as you can expect - this horrible atmosphere will take that award. Wax models, as evidenced by the Wax House (Vincent Price version ...), are very scary; and the film makes the best use of this fact. There are very few things in cinemas that can be just scary, but wax shapes are certainly one of those things. The special ability of the killer was easy to get into the atmosphere, but the film makes the best use of it, even when the shelves with different things fly and it goes well with the rest of the film. All in all, this is a very good movie. While a tourist trap may not be absolutely necessary for viewing; it's worth seeing and I can recommend it.
