I was just watching this award-winning DVD DVD. One lifestyle is a harsh drama that with its speed, black and white images, and the atmosphere, music has an impressive and honest image. This is the story of a life-driven dilemma of power, sex, and control that a few sad lonely lives emphasize. Mother (very well worked by Maureen Carri) is upright and self-pulled. The Father looks only on the side and is still a powerful and central part of the drama. Money is hidden in boxes and shoes. <br /> <br /> Writing was great and I liked sensual close-ups such as nails, red lips, candle, mirrors, and so on. used it very intimate. This is a harrowing story of sexual undertone, while Glasgow's dark streets slip into the despair of sad characters. <br /> <br /> There are some very memorable pictures that are simply shipped or shouldered. - Like the Trise Bridge. And a stunned and injured look at Trise's face in a call center that hopes to help people using tarot cards when he listens to a caller's talk about his abuse. <br /> <br /> At first, we see John Paul, with a wide eye and innocence, photographed when he wants to try modeling. Trise, her mother, is deceived and makes her bad choices by pushing her away when she tries to keep her. John Paul's modeling becomes an escort work and the Trise boss offers his money and eventually goes to the day. There are also moments of humor and subtle irony. One great scene is when they have a fairly ordinary meal and start to open up when the father appears in his dark presence and the clouds are all over. But this and other things are moments of hope. <br /> <br /> I felt that the movie's pace was too intense, but it is somewhat detailed in some other reasonably challenging and memorable film. a little different. It is at first different from most American films, either full of fantasy, or the actual "world" seen through blinded glasses. This film depicts life with all its harsh edges and shows unforgettable images. <br /> <br /> It's not a "light entertainment", but a way of thinking and a real-life drama. <br /> <br /> One lifestyle is a truly inclusive and emotionally honest film.
