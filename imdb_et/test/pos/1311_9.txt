I saw it initially in Channel 4 (UK) and it was a fantastic movie that impressed me. But I saw it recently on Irish television and Roy Scheider gave an additional story ("we need a bigger boat!"). It destroyed my movie. His droning monologue adds absolutely nothing to the film, and when something shines in the films. I don't know if a new DVD version that doesn't have Roy (for legal reasons?) Will stop buying people. Believe me, the film is much better for it! Cheers <br /> <br /> Damian
