This movie is just one of the best movies with a privilege. It took years to find this movie and it was worth it. The film is intended for anti-narcotics propaganda, but it is reversed, not even halfway through the film. A joyful look at the faces of the players when they get their share of drugs is pleasing to all those who follow it. Heroin comes to its end up to the end of drug-induced life. YIKES! This is an anti-drug message that was so shocking. The sound of this movie starts with the butt! So far, this is one of Pink Floyd's best albums ever! If ever there is a chance, look, listen and take a moment to witness a wonderfully made movie.
