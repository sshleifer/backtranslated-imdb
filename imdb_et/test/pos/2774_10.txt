Don't you ever miss the good days when Disney actually did great movies that really spent you? Having grown up with Disney, I always found that the characters were exciting to me. Everyone seemed really talented and knew how to act through the movie. I remember Friday nights and running to turn on the TV to watch my latest movies. Susie Q was one of my all-time favorites. I never forgot this movie. Even so far, when the song "Susie Q" is mentioned, I always remember the movie. If anyone thinks of watching this movie, I promise you to fall in love with it. I think I can never forget it. You will not regret watching it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is sad to see Disney movies like "The Hannah Montana Movie" coming out. What happened to Disney?
