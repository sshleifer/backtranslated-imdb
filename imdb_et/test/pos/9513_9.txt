An example is the heavy Nihon chinbotsu. Japanese people have benefited from their close relationship with the sea and the concept of film means that the whole world and lifestyle are in danger - thanks to its volcanic heritage. From the point of view of reality, it is quite foolish to be in a drama where the entire Japanese loss is under the waves; why Japan? So, instead of having the reality of the film fed by the spectacle (and the popcorn), let's assume that some of them can have a real impact on it. Compared to the adventures made with Japanese radioactive monsters, it comes out more mature and better. The emotional element is underestimated and it really works. (It loses some of the top-notched song song excellence.) <br /> <br /> Is Nihon chinbotsu reliable? Probably not, but the exciting break and relaxed temple make for a more pleasant entertainment that one night is waiting for.
