I can't believe I can rarely see the title that all of your eighties horror boys have mentioned, and I definitely don't associate everyone here with my colleagues, saying "bloody birthday" is a terrible look. On the contrary, I enjoyed it very much and I was pleasantly surprised by the inventiveness and surprise it offered. Not just to refer to this film as "another 80s slasher" because the victims here are quite unlikely and so are the killers. We introduce three cherubic-looking young people who were all born during the sunshine. At the moment they were delivered, Saturn blocked the planet both the sun and the moon, and because of this, the children are emotional and apparently without conscience. It really is going to show its tenth birthday when they go to a ruthless killing. <br /> <br /> These things are incredibly far removed and even slightly offensive, but seriously who cares? Unlike many other horror movies of this time, it at least tries to bring something original and imaginative. Once upon a time, children are good and the whole film has a creepy atmosphere and grizzly music. The queues of murder are gloomy and tense, and it is always terrible to see that they are committed to children facing an angel. I don't know who hired three children, but they did a good job. The girl and the child with glasses are especially memorable. The good-looking pictures of the heartless trio remind us of the classic highlights, such as the 'Village of Crime', 'Sick Sowing' and 'Children of Crime'. This movie is by no means as memorable as those milestones, but it is very fun and not one of the fears of regret will regret watching it. <br /> <br /> Bloody birthday was written and directed by Ed Hunt. Not particularly the biggest genius of cinema, but a pleasantly confused person who brought us enormously cheerful cheese competitions like "Brain" and "Starship Invasions". If all this is not enough to convince you, the bloody birthday is a lot of nudity. And not only nudity, but MTV-VJ Julie Brown's topless dance work. Oh, and keep your eyes open, so Joe Penny, later the TV series "Jake and Fatman", is totally superfluous. Check it out !!
