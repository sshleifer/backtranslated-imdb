Some people move through life, moving from one thing to another, without the eye being thrown out; others keep it for a reason, for another person or principle, and remain retaliated, committed to any situation - and figuratively or literally, they give their word and stand next to it. But we are all different, "made of different clay", as one of the characters in this movie puts it that makes life so interesting. Some people are just crazy and maybe it is that you have to be among the masses to live. Who knows? Who knows what it takes to do things - life - work? Writer / director Lisa Krueger takes it off using a white approach to studying the interruption of commitment - and how one goes into the action and obsession with Heather Graham as a young woman who is careless, committed, obsessive and may- just be a little crazy. His name is Joline and it's his story. <br /> <br /> It's true that Joline has always been a dedicated person; in work, in relationships, in life in general. She is a woman of her word who puts it on. And if she marries Carl (Luke Wilson), it's forever. The only problem is that someone forgot to talk to Carl and 597 days of marriage, he's gone; to find out and save everything. If Joline realizes she is not coming back, she refuses to give up her or to get married. Perhaps it is because of the "clay" it is made of. Regardless of his departure from his home in New York and giving up on what he does - in all places, El Paso, Texas. But if he knows where he is, he will keep his distance by giving him his "space" and not even letting him know he is there. He finds Carl to be a "spiritual coma", and his job is to keep him "spiritual vigilance" until he reaches his mind. And when he looks and waits, his life is nothing but boring because he meets a young woman named Carmen (Patricia Velazquez), one of the local eateries. Carmen's Grampy (Alfonso Arau), who is mystical; T-Bo (Mark Ruffalo), a driver with problems with Carl; and Neil (Goran Visnjic) an artist who makes pinatas and takes pride in him. For Jolini, this is a discovery journey, in which he learns a lot about Carl, but even more about himself. <br /> <br /> There is a sense of humor, romance and some insights into human history. this peculiar film, which is more of a character and character than a plot. And Krueger does it all very well, offering an interesting and fun movie. His characters are very real people, whose desires, needs and drawbacks are a human condition; a rich and eclectic cluster through which he tells his story. We see this from Joline's point of view, because Krueger puts us in Jolin's thoughts and hence in his motivations, which makes a decisive perspective on events when they open up. This, along with the deliberate pace that it allows you to inspire the atmosphere and the atmosphere, provides very effective storytelling. There is serious seriousness on this subject, but Krueger decides to avoid something heavy or too deep and instead focuses on the natural humor that develops in Jolin's meetings with people and situations. And the result is a well textured, influential and spooky look at what we call life. <br /> <br /> Heather Graham keeps this role in the first frame of the movie to make Joline perfect. creation. He makes himself part and gives an idea of ​​what is convincing and plausible by adding small personal traits and nuances that make all the difference between the representation of a person, and what is real. And for this movie to work, it was imperative that Joline be viable and credible - and Graham succeeds on all fronts. The presence of his screen has never been tempting and his lively personality, or even as he uses his eyes, is enough to draw you completely. it is all part of his created character; Jolin has a call that comes out of his face, who is inside and out. She is a pleasant, pleasant person, and since you have shared your inner thoughts, you know who she is. It's a good job at the beginning of the road, starting with how the character was written, as Graham brings to life in a vivid way. <br /> <br /> Like Carmen, Patricia Velazquez is also fully involved. Her performance is very natural and understandable and she uses her instincts to create her character effectively. He has a charismatic presence, but it is less than terrible and gives him an aspect that is attractively down. He is refreshingly open and front; you get the impression that Carmen is not something that holds back, but is completely honest on all fronts, and that is also part of her complaint. And like Joline, this sign is well written and Velazquez proves him convincingly to life. <br /> <br /> In general, there are a number of remarkable performances that are the heart and soul of this film. Luke Wilson, Casey Affleck (like Joline's brother Jay), Goran Visnjic, Alfonso Arau and especially Mark Ruffalo as T-Bo, who can create a memorable character in a very small real time. <br /> <br /> Supporting pain includes Kim Dickens (Jenny), Clea Du Vall (Mimi), Summer Phoenix (Meg), Art Alexakis (New York Army), Dylan Baker (Carl's Editor) and Mary Kay Place ( psychiatrist). A film that says something about the value of the return, to consider the big picture that reflects who we are, where we go and what we really need. definitely worth the ride. 8/10
