A good (not big) small horror film with a high "slip" factor (which must not be confused with the 1991 film of the same name or newer (2001) Campfire STORIES). A central story about stranded teenagers who talk about ghost stories around a ghostly forest fire brings along and connects different stories that make up the majority of the movie (Watch for Ron Livingston (office space, brothers band) and Jennifer MacDonald. Furious, sexy segment ("Honeymoon") )). Strong action and some truly "scary" moments make this cooler above average. A good example of an interesting line with high quality ensembles, resulting in a larger sum of all its parts. "Surprise", which ends in the main story, adds a nice horrible twist, although some may see it. The movie is not available on DVD, but it is available in VHS.
