One of Warner Brothers' best and most strenuous films in the thirties was a charming widow of a family drama living with her daughter who raised four daughters. But not four daughters every day. All of them are instructed by their musician father and one of the singers. They make beautiful music together, even for long hairs. <br /> <br /> You can watch the infinite roles played by Claude Rains over the years and wonder if he shows another aspect of his creative personality. The opportunistic Vichy captain in Casablanca is as different as the scientist seen in Invisible Man, such as patient and wise work at Mr Skeffington. All the same man and all so incredibly different. <br /> <br /> Here, he raises four girls with love, flavored with a small heart, the willingness to receive contemporary music. Lane Sisters and Gale Page may feel Beethoven, but they are also hep-cats and can win eight times each time. And if Rains gets a little too annoying when Aunt May Robson can put her in place. <br /> <br /> Four daughters who were single while you know it was changing. All nurses develop romantic interests in Dick Foran, Frank McHugh, Jeffrey Lynn and John Garfield. Of course, the mating process becomes a bit more complicated, and one of the sisters suffers from a tragedy, but promises to work at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Four daughters are also known as John's debut. Garfield. Apart from a small part of Footlight Parade a year earlier, Garfield had no other film roles. But he became famous at the New York stage because his golden boy was in front of him and Warner Brothers wrote down on him and found the role of a perfect film debut as a cynical musician who just can't get a good break in life. It earned him the name of the best supporting actor in 1938, but he lost Walter Brennan to Kentucky. <br /> <br /> This movie was so popular that it practically created a small house company for Jack Warner. Descendants who are cast with members, such as the brave girls, the four mothers, the four women, were harvested at the cashier before World War II. Warner Brothers handed it over to Frank Sinatra and Doris Day, playing parts from John Garfield and Priscilla Lane. Now these two beautiful music. <br /> <br /> Still, a timeless form was created for four daughters and the film is 70 years after it was first seen.
