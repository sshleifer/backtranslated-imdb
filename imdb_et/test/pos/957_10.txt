I have to admit that I love this movie. Of course, as I am sure you know that "Malcolm is in the middle" of Frankie Muniz, and ever so Amanda Bynes "Amanda's Show" played in this children's comedy, two friends who are sure we can all - shoot. The film is about the boy Jason Shepard (Frankie) and his friend Kaylee (Amanda) who go on a Hollywood adventure. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS AHEAD <br /> <br /> Jason is a typical 14-year-old boy who loses everyday life to solve problems. One day, Jason will hit Mr Wolf (a big bad director). Jason's English paper is stolen by Wolf and the adventure begins with the kayak to earn his father's trust. They fly to Hollywood, looking for Wolf to get him back. Frankie and Amanda make Wolf back with all sorts of crazy tricks, and all he has to do is call Jason's father and say he stole his idea. But the end is not a real surprise, being in the good province and victories. <br /> <br /> The story is cute and the fifth class is humorous, but what you expect is rated PG. I really believe this is one of the best family comedies of the year. Not only do kids work great, exceptionally painful, well-written, but it's good clean fun. It made me laugh and love this innocent message. I recommend this very much and I would not agree with someone who gave him ten zeros. The unemployed critic is not unemployed. I give it (well I voted from ten out of ten) to perfection.
