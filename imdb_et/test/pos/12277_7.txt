You have to love spaghetti in the Western universe. A vision of the West, where for the good boys is an empty point without warning, comic roses landscapes in extreme close-ups and an anti-hero walks away from a former girl. Many people call "Corbucci" "frustrating". I find the descriptions go a little bit frustrating. I think the blind and unforgivable are mostly mostly suited to the fact that "frustrating" refers to the sentimentality that almost every Eurovestro leader ignored in the striking of characters with wide strokes. <br /> <br /> GLI SPECIALISM must be seen across its wide screen before he gets his seat on the Sergio Corbucci canon. This is a beautiful movie. And it makes sense that Corbucci wanted to shoot with one big double and large stroke after steaming with COMPANEROS (although he later returned to his usual tricks that were exposed to SONNY AND JED). There's still a lot of cartoons that are damaging the film's gloomy, imo's more painful than the three kids dressed as hippies hugging the city and looking for gold and trouble. And it is painful when Mario Adorf plays Mexican with one hand on El Diablo, because he always plays his characters. <br /> <br /> These small grips are more than enough to moisten the spaghetti mouth. enthusiast. Attacks are great, the entire city population has cut the naked stroke of naked, laconic antihero (Johnny Halliday) typical iconic bad, almost every movie character's moral bankruptcy. Corbucci may never hear the recognition of the most famous Sergio or genre American patriarchs, but you and I know it is very unfair for a very talented director. His dynamic blow-shot, in-depth performance with close-to-camera features and backwardness, his fondness for fast paced and feverish energy to move a story that wasn't always as he photographed in open spaces, everything in his work makes me confident that when Corbucci was America, and 15 years later with Mann and Hawks, Cahiers du Cinema critics would be the author of serious criticism.
