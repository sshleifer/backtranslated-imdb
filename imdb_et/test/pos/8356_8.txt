Where do I start? Walt Disney's happiest movie "Lady and the Tramp" is the Disney animation theater canon, if not my favorite. But the point is ... at least say, enjoyable. I liked the whole movie. It was (flame shield!) Divine! The Broadway style and film type of the songs worked, and I worshiped for the rest of the night. When you asked me, I can still sing all the songs. <br /> <br /> But when the movie was (really) good for me, it was bad in many other places. Animation was sometimes scary. Every time I saw someone, I don't know ... it just seemed scary to me. And where the fuck was Lady? He gets like two lines of dialogue and only doggy hugs at the end of the scamp. She gets 0% communication with the plot and her only son! <br /> <br /> But it all liked it. Compared to the original, is it? No. The songs are not so good (still memorable), the plot was much less involved, Lady was almost nothing to do with it, and it's not as cute as the first one. But if you go with the open mind, you will have fun and maybe "hang out!" Like?
