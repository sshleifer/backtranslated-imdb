Five teenagers set up some camping opportunities in the Oregon desert and, despite being warned at the park house, they will soon realize that something is going on in the wood parks waiting for the strike. <br /> <br /> Old horror movies, the only ones to keep up with every conversation, are Friday 13th, so I took it for myself to find those old horror movies that didn't fit just on Friday, 13, JUST ENNE DAWN just so it happened to be among those I found, and it was really very impressive, it was not as sharp as some of the things found today, it was very sharp in terms of character development because it was quite unattractive and it is very casual pace, no hurry to get to cages and slashes, take time to set the right mood and tone, and it is very atmospheric and builds some murderers, letting you always have a sense of it, but you don't know where it is or when it happens where i live my definitely overlooked gem just because people have never heard of it or give it a chance, but i say it is not hanging on friday 13, these two concepts don't go they are even close to each other, but in my opinion it is usually one of the most impressive slasher I have seen for a while.
