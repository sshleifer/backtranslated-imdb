Tracy and Matt, Michelle and Sebastian: These are the two pairs whose dependence, crime and foolish life is the raw and honest HBO documentary. They are, in turn, petulant, charming, reluctant, amazingly stupid and dedicated: drugs and each other. They are all very different: Matt is a working-class boy who obviously delights in his disappointment, while the prep school drop Tracy supports a few Western Union money from his father who surprisingly makes a sympathetic head-end at the end of the film. Meanwhile, widow Michelle (whose hub died of OD) serves her daily bread by presenting NYPD as vice president who wants to reduce her future Johns to avoid jail time, and the sad bag companion Sebastian lives on income. You will be drawn to their northwest and the film is wanted to last twice as long. Unlike most of these documentaries, there is no update on their progress (can Matt and Tracy really keep this Brooklyn apartment? Will Michelle return to Bellevue for more detox? And will Sebastian be more pathetic?). As a result, the film seems incomplete, but it may be a point. Important viewing if you're not completely reluctant about the scene where people take pictures.
