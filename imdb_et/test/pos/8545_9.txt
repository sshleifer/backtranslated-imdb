There are many, much older movies that deserve to be transferred to DVD format. This is definitely one of them. Anthony Quinn Triumph! The film depicts the victims of Nazi atrocities before the war and during the war, but I do not think any of them would fall under the victim's and predator's psyche. Anthony Quinn was really a man in every season. He was able to portray the more humble beings lacking human vision for extreme nature and pulling it out to a credible audience who didn't watch what they just saw! Really one of our biggest artists. He's missed.
