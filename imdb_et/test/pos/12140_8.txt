This is a black and white film from France, <br /> <br /> A simple plot, a running gangster who wants help and more. We've seen this type of film many times over the years. What makes this movie different is mainly its action and style. All actors act quietly, nobody praises, and hardly anyone loses their temper. There are many deaths, some surprising. There are also beautiful women, but not sex scenes. No cars drive. <br /> <br /> Speaking / It's so refreshing to listen to people, and here we have to read subtitles. <br /> <br /> The actor is almost perfect. especially Lino Ventura & in smaller but important role Jean Paul Belmondo. These two actors were one of the best. <br /> <br /> I said the film is wrong, some of the points have some shortcomings in the script, they are small, they work in this movie. Production is also first-rate. <br /> <br /> Ratings: *** (4) 88 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)
