(Very light spoilers; basic plot area, no real details) <br /> <br /> If you go to this movie with low expectations. I saw this movie a few days ago in Free Screening in Maryland and the only reason I promised to go ... was because it was free. I was expecting a few smiles, but since I've never been a big fan of Tenacious D, not much more. <br /> <br /> The first ten minutes of the movie are fun because we get an overview of Jack Black's humble Christian origins in downtown America. The film takes us for years to come, the first meeting between JB and Kyle Gass, Tenacious D. for the other half. We see the formation of the band and its name. Finally, as the title suggests, the other side of the film shows its aspiration to become a smart "Pick of Destiny". Again, the beginning of the film smiled loudly and most of the film kept a smile at least. That means there were times when it seemed a bit long; it is only 100 minutes, but it still seemed a little shorter. The story is a bit as absurd as it sounds, and it's not the movie you see when you want a real plot. What's good, except it means that many jokes are very hit or missed ... and if they don't leave, they will be bad. Same thing with songs; it is musical, but many songs lost their appeal after the first minute or so ... they still stayed. <br /> <br /> I say that the R-rating really saved this movie from bombing; The humor of D just couldn't work without the references to sex and drugs. But if you are not a real fan of the band or at least you know that you appreciate your comedy style, I would recommend you save money and rent. "Pick" makes you a little bit confused ... but is it worth $ 9? I do not belive. I was tempted to rate it 6, but since I think many would enjoy it enough to justify it in theaters, 7 seems more appropriate. Just make sure it is your style.
