After watching the "Texas Tale of Treason", you will feel the renewed nasty nature of the Hollywood beast. In all interviews and interviews with participants in the project, there is a common and rebelliousness ranging from background, social classifications and even geography. This may be due to the hard work involved in the whole production-related immortal commitment to the project and the love of the original film, and the creation of a complete vacuum that is its creator. The number of people who took part in "Waldo Hawaiian Vacation" was amazing for me, without a prize. There were no trailers or craft services, no convenience at all, and yet all involved were there. If nothing ever comes from this project, Antstuie Productions has laid the foundation for being a serious, honest company that never intends to take and take away and sell and make a movie just for money. I would like to see that no director of L.A would lead the immigration process. CG and green screens have no more realistic live movies. The masses can enjoy the entertainment that they have been fed with nice bite-sized censored peaceful bits, but there are a lot of people in the world who share the opinions and insights of filmmakers that still make movies or love of storytelling, not DVD sales or ticket offices, for the love of material. I loved this documentary and I hope that the IFC has cahons to pick it up and breathe, so maybe another person might decide to take the camera and shoot the real life so that the viewer would even get a temporary understanding that everything is the same everywhere and everyone can be a real storyteller.
