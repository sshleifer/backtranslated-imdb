its years when I've seen these exhibitions. I've been looking for someone else who has seen or knew about it for years. I thought I made them up. what I remember most is a soldier and death. I would ask the fanatics of the film if they had seen them, mentioning Jim Henson and people still didn't know. these are big fables. I was very young when I was, not even 10, and left a lasting impression on my life and beliefs. I would suggest someone to look at them, remember that they come from the 80s, so they don't see them as movies today. just give them off. Jim Henson was ahead of his time and died early.
