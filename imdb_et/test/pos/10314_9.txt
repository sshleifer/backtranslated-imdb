It may be interesting for people to know that this film was made without turning to Phoolan Devi and when he finally saw the parts, it was so fierce that he announced that the film wouldn't show in India or cover himself with gasoline and ignite himself. I don't know if it has been shown at all, but when I stand at a time as a growing politician, I doubt it. Since then, I have seen a report that he has resigned from his Dacoit day and accused him of further crimes and hides in the result. <br /> <br /> His own troubles are left aside, this is a great movie that is more pronounced in its refreshingly brutal; no rose-tinted melodrama that could be expected from a typical Indian movie. It should be emphasized that the concern about the messages of the feminist film and the like is essentially irrelevant: it is a real story. It seems that his doubts are not depicted, but the way in which the film is portrayed.
