This is probably the best picture many don't see. It introduced culture in a truly uneven way. You have to see everyone who likes Indie and those who don't. I think this movie pulls the Indie scene more. Action was the upper limit! Alice's character was so good. Perfect akwardness. This movie should be brought to mainstream! I think it would work phenomenally! ALICE is the most realistic view of our cultural element I've seen from GO ASK ALICE. The look that Hollywood does not touch. Such films show young people that these things are not glamorous, but they are real and compelling. If you liked APRIL APRIL, then you love it!
