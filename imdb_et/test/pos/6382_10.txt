I saw this week after screening the test at Chatsworth and went with my girlfriends. we all loved it a lot. James Franco is amazing and so hot, I would see it just for him !!!!!!! but Sienna Miller is also very good and plays a southern girl who is so in love with her that she can't be let go. David Caradine, who played at Kill Bill, plays a cowboy and is ideal for it. The story is kind of strange, but if you believe in the power of love and magic, then you love it! It's really original and it's also very funny and everyone laughed a lot, but eventually it gets more serious and we all started crying. I see it again with my friends as soon as it comes out, it's really good !!!!!!!
