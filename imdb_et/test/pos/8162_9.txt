I'm a snowman story. It was a "typical" predatory gay man and "typical" missionary of the Mormon. But all of them also had friends and family who balanced their lives well. There are several signs, some nice and some not so nice, everyone has their own personality nuances. And most reminded me of people in my life. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a number of humorous moments and slowly develops into heart-warming movies. The story is progressing without clear plots and never talking to you. It makes you think, waiting to see what happens. Even though I thought I could do something, I was surprised at how it actually came about. <br /> <br /> Not many movies make me laugh knowingly in a real gay dialogue and then put a tear in my eyes when I feel the pain of the characters. I watched the movie on a DVD and could not stop watching it until it ended. (I usually watch a movie in a couple of days.) It's nice to see a movie that's amazing but not preaching. I highly recommend this movie! And not just for the gay audience. Relationships exceed sexuality.
