I just saw this on Channel 4. Having seen some earlier comments here, I would first like to point out that I am not in favor of the death penalty. By this way I was expecting great things from this movie, but it just didn't give anything. Dead Man Walking is very clean, with a good ring and good script. In fact, it is difficult to spoil it artificially. However, I felt that although he tried to resolve the death penalty issues, it seemed that the religious / moral attitude seemed to change aside (hardly surprising, since the main character is the nun). Although I am not a heartless individual, I did not feel any kind of character. If you don't take religion seriously, you probably don't see much in this movie. I think let Peter Medaki have a much more powerful and moving film, and I would strongly recommend that someone who looks at it looks at it.
