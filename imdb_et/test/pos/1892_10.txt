I don't know what some people thought when they said this movie was bad. It was great. Classic Bruce Campbell, yes, it was a small budget and a special effect showed it, but that's not what you see for Bruce's movie you look at Bruce. Also Ted Ram was great. I found this movie fun and entertaining. Now, I admit that this movie is not for everyone if you don't like B-movies that you probably don't like if you want a big budget effect and clear the participants. But if you like to eat and put sci-fi on the wall, this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> Hail The King Baby!
