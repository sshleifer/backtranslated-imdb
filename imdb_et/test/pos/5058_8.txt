When you see the show, I was waiting for an exciting movie with big name participants with a controversial theme. I didn't expect a movie that was so appealing, exciting, poetic and sad that I had chosen from the beginning and didn't let me go, even after leaving the theater. Advice for anyone who has not yet seen it will not let your policy enjoy (or not enjoy) this movie. Take it for what it is. I saw it with my conservative Jewish family (I am a black sheep, a pseudo-liberal college student) and I thought they would write it as "liberal propaganda". Instead, they said it was a great movie with great performances (they love to show off their film critics). <br /> <br /> It is sad that such a movie must be marketed by Oscar-related actors through the constantly undervalued Sarsgaard and new talents like the truly wonderful Metwally. The whole cast gave good results, some of which were much more than others; my only problem was that there was a lot of things that did not allow a lot of screen time for each character. In fact, I felt that the "sub-region" of Fatima and Khalid was as spectacular as the Anwari story. <br /> <br /> All characters can fall into stereotypes, but the participants are doing a good job to give them the depth, because they have little time. Streep is truly terrible as a heartless senator and as much as I do not want to see the actor in such a terrible role that it is impossible for him to believe. Gyllenha, who is probably one of the Oscar for this film, seems a bit insecure in his role. H tries to portray his inner conflict, but usually just comes out as he forgot his lines or he doesn't know how he should feel. Sarsgaard gave excellent performance; his unforgettable confrontation with Streep is one of the best parts of the film. Once again it was terrible, and I hope to see her in more mainstream movies. It is a shame that Gyllenhaal is likely to be in front of him. Yigal Naor, as shown in the IMDb, has some movies, but he's a newcomer to me. He gave great performances with Mohammed Khouas and Zineb Oukach. <br /> <br /> The story of Fatima and Khalid did not get any credit for ads, but it brings this story to sad humanity. The narrative was interesting because I tried to really connect the two stories until we were finally told. I have read some comments here that say the love story was useless but I disagree. I think it shows both the controversial issue and the human side in general. Khalid was a real terrorist, but he did it to his brother, and although he is responsible for the attack, you see him on the human side of Fatima's story. Not that I think we should feel bad about real terrorists, but I think the "we are all people" theme is definitely relevant. <br /> <br /> Whatever your feelings about terrorism, politics, etc., theater. The bottom line is that it is an interesting story with the message we all have to hear.
