D.I. (4 outta 5 stars) Wow, I certainly didn't expect this movie as much as I enjoy. I had never heard of it until I saw it at any time on the discount video holder. I thought Jack Webb was playing an army drill instructor, might be a good cry, but I thought the drama would be for the recent films D.I., depicted in "Full Metal Jacket" or "Officer and a Gentleman". Boy, I was wrong. This is probably the best job Webb has ever done ... farther and farther than his one-star "Dragnet" performances. The transmission of his difficult dude-dialogue is just brilliant ... it's done in his patented body monotone, and yet you know * that a man means it. The story may seem a little hockey compared to the grittier military films that followed, but I still found the movie exciting and haunted. Even a totally unnecessary musical difference in the military nightclub had tried me. Anyone know where I get this dreadful Ray Conife song "If'n You Don't, Somebody Else Will" copy? Webb will ever play the toughest dangerous cage teacher ... and he will be under pressure to hit the deadlock Private Owen, but he will be happy to see the man buried somewhere in this sissyboy and drag him to hit and yell! Good stuff!
