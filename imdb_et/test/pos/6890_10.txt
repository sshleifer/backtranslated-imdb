All I can say is this show is really missing !! My wife and I got married at the beginning of this time when this show started! Why did CBS take it off the air? I think it was the best show for the whole family! It made me laugh! It also made me cry. But when CBS took it out of the air, I thought CBS made a big mistake. You know what would be so big? Get a reunion! That would be so cool !!!! Does anyone know if it's still on DVD? In the last season of the allowed land, CBS showed the last season? I think CBS took off this season. My wife and I will never forget it. Opening with this song was fantastic !!! This exhibition comes only once in life! Should We Never Forget Promised Land !!
