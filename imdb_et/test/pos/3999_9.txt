What a movie! I've always liked Asian style, and this movie doesn't deceive at all! Photography is breath-taking, ranging from stunning landscapes to swirling colors. The main actor is really realistic in representing the painter (whose paintings are amazing). The end is also very well chosen, very poetic. The only remark is that they should have shown a slightly deeper connection between his inspiration and alcohol and abuse of women. But it's a great movie!
