Well, as you can see, I got this party pretty late, but I prefer to read all the previous entries before making my comments. I found this site a chance when I searched for other Marine Corps movies. So, let me start by saying I played in Pvt. Labarsky, and was placed at MCRDep, in San Diego. Jack Webb and his team chose 15 permanent staff, some of whom were talking about parts, and another 15 Marines who had just finished Boot Camp. It formed a group and a Navy who depicted various "DIs". To my reminder, The Capt. And Pvt. Owens (Don Dubbins) was not a Navy. We spent about three weeks (Studio City Film Lot), CA, taking pictures of the part of the movie we were together with, and then finished the other shots after leaving. <br /> <br /> Just as I let me explain some of the things that have been questioned in previous records. "Cuff Daddy" commented on our platon's ability to "Yes Sir" to tilt without moving, etc. Yes, we made the Sound Guys shout and it was during the scene shooting. If you remember your Marines when DI or ever started asking questions and before they finished, you have already taken the breath of air that allowed you to get the right answer at the top of your lungs. That's how it happened. <br /> <br /> "74Before" commented on walking from the same building on the island of Paris, but as I mentioned earlier, the City City, CA scenes were shot. They were built on photos taken on the island of Paris and on the cruise advisers on the island of Paris. Sorry, you were in real buildings, not in sets. <br /> <br /> "schappe1" brought out many good points, but in the case of the case on the island of Paris it said that all this Jackb said. we were, "the movie came because of an accident, and the Marine Corps didn't want to display anything that would affect some of the family members of the navy who died that night, and the help needed to answer the public why the marine DI does what it does." <br /> <br /> As some of you mentioned, I was at a time when we were thinking about ourselves in scenes, this dialogue has been cleaned up, and obviously it is not the way it is in real life. it had to be done. <br /> <br /> One of the stories I would like to convey is the interaction between our marines and the film crew and the film team and Jack Webb. Marines from the beginning "Yes Sir" to everyone who moved. During the week it was more and more common to hear "Yes Sir", which came from all directions. During the performance, somebody asked to do something with illumination and say "Yes Sir" from above somewhere upside down. unofficial meetings, Jack Webb noted. "If I knew I would have received much respect from this team, I would have brought it here years ago." A leader from San Diego was playing to play DI with another group and Jack Jack, but during one shootout he was ready to take number 32 and Webb was still trying to work on how he wanted to do it and didn't show him patience. The next day they used an advisor to the island of Paris who was DI Sgt. From the island of Paris and he worked out. <br /> <br /> At that time, I was somewhat of a camera buff and found out about the camera body to get some cursor and when it turned out that it still gives me some 35mm movies and everyday movies that are not used. These movie strips that I cut and slipped out of them. After the movie came to the VHS tape (DI, 11706 B & W / 106 min.), My children and grandmothers have an explosion when they try to find who can find me the most time on the screen.
