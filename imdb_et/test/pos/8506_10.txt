I like this version of DORIAN GRAY and the MGM version. Both add a little girl at the beginning of the story, who grows up with Dorian (not in the original book) and that is my only complaint. I especially like Angela Lansbury like Sybil Vane and George Sanders as Harry's MGM version, but Shane Briant as Dorian in TV version is much better (I think) and much more merciless than Hurd in Hatfield's MGM version: I think Briant is a novel More for Dorian. Finally, this is a very good adaptation of the novel (it is even a hint of Doria's contacts with men like Wylde, which could not be done in the MGM version).
