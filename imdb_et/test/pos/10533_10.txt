I had such great hopes that Teleton Retro puts this in the air, but instead of getting such exhibitions, the ones they deserve are breathtaking in the things I've seen dozens of times. Centurions was a highlight of my pre-teen years. I know it may seem a little clich√©, but it's true. After Duke GI. Joe, Jake Rockewell is one of those characters I really shattered. <br /> <br /> It's too bad that Teleton Retro doesn't see it the same way as my generation's people. Otherwise, Teleton Retro would be much better than it is.
