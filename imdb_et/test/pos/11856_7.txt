Complex sex comedies are always difficult to pull out. Watch Blake Edward's films, which are arguably the master of the genre and find the same number of answers as hits. Because if such a film can never work, it can never come back to a test of teen sex comedy and true humor [i.e. "American Pie"] or warm up the audience with the sentimentality of the romantic comedy [s. Julia Roberts' entire career]. It can only hold hope in the end and hope that the viewer will appreciate the almost irony needed in its resolution. <br /> <br /> Wally Wolodarsky and Maya Forbes, Wife / Wife's team, wrote "Seeing Other People" with a couple of involved Ed & Alice [Jay Mohr & Julianne Nicholson] just a few seconds away from the front end of the car. When the frame is frozen, we suddenly hear the thoughts and fears of both characters. We welcome the fact that the opening story enjoys the perspective of both sexes. <br /> <br /> Two months ago, Ed & Alice has already seen his promises as an old couple. . In the early bathroom scene, their activities alone show how comfortable they are with each other and how long they have been together. So, if a line is pushed to the thrust - presumably the two most likely - it is as if the relationship itself requires change, even if it means destroying itself. <br /> <br /> When all the basic rules are set [Ed can't sleep with his mother or Salma Hayek], both have to find some pointless sex in their direction to strengthen their relationship. First of all, it seems that everything goes as planned, because their daily activities only help to burn the passion between them. But predictably, the deeper the feelings of regret and jealousy begin to emerge, they will soon find themselves on the brink of separation and disintegration. All of these actions, which result in a resolution that may or may not like - depending on the degree of your cynicism. <br /> <br /> For such a comedy, there is a need for a solid lie that has as strong supportive signs as leads. And director Wolodarsky will not disappoint. Here she has directed two of my favorite actor sisters - Julianne Nicholson & Lauren Graham - and lets them play their strengths. For Nicholson, who has always reminded a young Shirley MacLain, he brings Alice a naive and vulnerable air even when his action seems less. And like Graham, an actor who has proved to be able to outperform the entire Howard Hawks ensemble, he steals every scene where he is with a nervous "no BS" person. <br /> <br /> As for boys, Jay Mohr is used here as Josh Charles. "Malcolm Middle" In Byron Cranston, we must praise the British accent and let him catch all the breath. But here is the real treatment of Andy Richter and his sub-block, with single mother Helen Slater. Although his scenes seem almost to be in another movie, they are the most funny and his dead peptides steal from the shipment. <br /> <br /> For independent production, "Seeing Other People" is a more personal and introspective feeling - something that would be noticeable from such a great Hollywood movie. Not to mention that this movie also has some really funny moments - unlike most Hollywood comedies in general. <br /> <br /> Rating [5-star system]: 3 1/2 stars
