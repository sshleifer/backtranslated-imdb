A lovely little movie about introducing movies to China. Captures the amazement of the first audience in the movie, as it has been described worldwide, and uses real Lumiere movies for most of the reality. I disagree with other people that the British accomplice is bad because I thought he was good, but the leading Chinese leader really showed. In any case, I found a smile on my face through most of the film. People who are afraid of subtitling may notice that many movies are in English (which for some reason is given to both subtitles and Chinese on DVD).
