I watch a lot of movies - DVDs, features and classics. At night, when I looked at JERICHO MILE, my wife (who had ordered it on the internet) said she remembered it during her stay in high school that she was with them all those years. Somewhat reluctantly I sat (with our daughter and son) and was riveted from the opening order to the end. We were all. <br /> <br /> He who remembered the original, and our kids (18 and 16) who had no idea what the film was, couldn't believe it. Our favorite scene? There's no way Peter Strauss is so passionate about kicking his fist down and saying, "I'd do it with AGAIN!". It did not promote violence because it was a crime of the Defense Forces, but it caused the intensity that we could not believe ... when his coworkers gave him his food to support his efforts, no one was dry in our eyes, please make such films more. POSSIBLE !!
