Although I feel SITR is the best Gene Kelly movie, but it's pretty good. I liked music and dancing and how Gene girl got. My favorite song is undoubtedly the gene dance with my ego ego. I love watching two Gene Kellys for one price. This shows what talent Mr. Kelly really was. This is a movie I think everyone should look at at least once in their lives. So you haven't seen it and found it today! I am sure everyone has a friend of Gene Kelly who has a collection of this movie. So go over your house and pop popcorn and enjoy!
