This production was quite surprising for me. I absolutely love to hide 30's movies, but I wasn't ready for this story in the last 25 minutes. If you can not make sure in the first half, then hang the finals there. Of course, you have to look at the blatantly razorous racism. An exciting viewing experience, but I think CAT CAT is not yet available on video / DVD. See your PBS lists!
