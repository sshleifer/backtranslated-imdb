Stephen Hawking has one of the greatest thoughts, or if it is too easy for him to have one curious and daring to coin, it also happens to be trapped in a body that is sick, leaving him in the wheelchair and communicating with the computer. Maybe I didn't know enough that Hawking was going in (I always knew him as "the man who talks like a computer who knows a lot, the universe, and things") that he is a British that he was a normal boy, and Perhaps most remarkably, the disease that could have left him dead in the 21st century put him in focus. <br /> <br /> According to Errol Morris, this is such a curious and coolly visually stunning portrait in the short history of time, Hawking was already brilliant, spurts (when other Oxford students faced terrible algebraic equations, he answered more than three times more than an hour) time), but when faced with challenges, mainly the theories of other scientists, he bounced back on his own. Under some difficult scientific talks, and if you have less than a B-astronomy, you must keep your ears particularly up-to-date over time for possible infinity or peculiarities of black holes. a person who just wants to enjoy his own birthday. <br /> <br /> Morris catches Hawking just for those who don't get enough of their theories about how particles can go in and out of the black, or even if it's a creator or not, depending on how much Einstein and time are counted. But he also hits the background of man and his condition, which makes it much more interesting than Morris would have done one or the other. We talk too much about space, which makes our head hurt, and too much about his personal life and may ask what all this noise is about who the title book of the movie was in the bestseller lists for more than five years. <br /> Almost despite its appearance, Hawking defines what it is like to be a conscious universe in the universe that it observes that it will not depart from whether and when the universe is going to be another ten billion years now. All through this, in the short history, we get a glimpse of genius and his humility (not to mention his colleagues and family's ten cent here and there) through the thoughtless hypothetical and mathematical process of the universe.
