Irene Jacob narrates in this last part of the trilogy of Krzysztof Kieslowski, and the story is endlessly satisfactory as it succeeds in linking all three films. I'm just amazed at how many talents he took for one of these stories, not to mention the three. It seems that everything fits so accurately that all the elements of filmmaking are so beautifully executed and the end result is as much as the sum of the individual parts. Trois Couleurs is epic in nature and is on the list of any excellent cinematic achievements. Just great!
