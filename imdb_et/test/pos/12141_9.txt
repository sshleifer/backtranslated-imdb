Classe Tous Risques (high risk) is a French gangster film that doesn't catch style. That's why it's style. As the film is so underestimated and so important, it becomes more and more inclusive. And since Abel Davos is playing with Lino Ventura, we end up emotionally with the silent, heavy woman who loves his wife and children, meeting with customs agents on the shores of Nice at night, that neither he nor we are expecting, and who proves he is just as ready. to shoot a cop or betray as little emotion as a little tape. We first meet with a husband in Italy with Davis and their two little boys, one about 9 and one. 4. "This man was Abel Davos, who was sentenced to death in retrospect," they say. "In the meantime, he had been watching his resources shrink, even if his anxiety kept him moving. With the closure of the Italian police every day, France was again his best choice. Maybe he had forgotten." <br /> <br /> Davos was the top gangster in Paris who took care of his friends. It was several years ago. Happy to give her money to return to France is going wrong. He now hides his two children. She calls her friends in Paris to help her. He and his children have to go from Nice to Paris, but the police hunt him and they have created roadblocks. It's time for Davos' two best friends and they have moved on. They don't want to put themselves at risk and why? Duty may be cautious. So they hire a young thief, Eric Stark (Jean-Paul Belmondo), to take Davos and the children in the ambulance, then drive to Paris with Davos's strong bonded and hidden children. We are on a journey where David's choices are increasingly limited, where he has to find ways to take care of his children, where he realizes that there are no more friendships where betrayal seems likely and where his only friend is likely to be Eric Stark. <br /> <br /> This somewhat cynical movie works so well because it does its job without creating confusion. There are no dug trenches with a collar that would not play the gangster code with the melodrama so many French directors have loved. Classe tous Risques gives us Abel Davos, the man who once was someone who is now slipping to be someone and who reacts with violence and resignation. <br /> <br /> Lino Ventura dominates the film, but when he's involved with Jean-Paul Belmond, he's curious about chemistry. Ventura as Davos is grim and worried about caring for his sons. He downgrades his situation. He is a tough person who sees some killing as part of business, if necessary. Belmondo, as a young thief who is originally sent to head for spending, and who reads a friend whom he hoped for, provides the brightness that keeps the movie one more drive along the elevator. Belmondo was 27 years old and seems younger. His unlikely star power as leader actor - broken nose, lower jaw - shines from right to right. He makes Erik fit for Ventura when they share the scene. And Belmondo's scenes from Liliane (Sandra Milo), a young girl who becomes her girlfriend, radiates charm and good-natured sex. The end is the fate of the bittersweet and without the stylistic position. We hear Davos says, "Abel is gone. Classe tous Risques is worth seeing what it means. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of fine French gangster films.
