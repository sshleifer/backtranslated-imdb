Bottom is my favorite sitcom ever since I saw it t.v and the movie is even better than your bottom fan I say it has to buy! The plot is that Eddie and Ritchie run a hotel called the Paradise guest house, but not everything is right for them when customers leave until the famous actor stays in order to impress her, but not all. cinema to buy it and you will be laughing. also starring Simon Peggi (shaun of the dead) and the bill with his neighbors (love in fact) that it may not be good to look at the cash register or this website, but don't listen to them when buying it and I swear to love it
