I saw this movie at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival. Since I have worked in the wine industry, I had seen this documentary quite enthusiastically and I was not disappointed. It's known to be made of more than 500 hours of film material, the good news is that Nossiter will release not only the theater section next Christmas, but also ten parts of a ten-hour movie from the DVD (ThinkFilm distributes it). The bad news is that it is still a clumsy beast. When it was shown in Cannes, it was almost three hours long. For Toronto, he's been cut for about half an hour, but it's still 135 minutes. Now, for me, it's great. I love wine and I love hearing that has escalated in my business. But not everyone wants so much. <br /> <br /> The Nossiter flops around the world, from Brazil to France, to California, to Argentina, and talks about winemakers and PR people and consultants and critics about the situation in the wine world. . The issue that arises is that globalization and the wine critic Robert Parker's over-influence forces wine into a sort of similarity. Small local manufacturers buy either larger conglomerates (both American and local) or pushed to market forces to change their wines to the taste of Mr. Parker, who dictates to most of America (and the world)) It's a complicated subject, and I understand why Nossiter wants talk about your topics. There are Robert Mondavi, Patriarch of the Napa Winery and his sons Tim and Michael, whose efforts to buy land in Languedoc were confronted with opposition from local vignerons and government officials. It is Aim√© Guibert, the founder and producer of the wine of the Daumas Gassac, the iconic adversary of the Mondavi plans, and the crusader of local fears. It is Robert Parker himself, expressing some inconvenience to his influence, refusing to stop writing his preferred wines. There's a "flying wine producer" by Michel Rolland, a consultant for dozens of wine producers around the world, giving them advice on how to make Parker-friendly wines. There are many interesting personalities in this documentary. <br /> <br /> If you are a wine lover, you want to look for a ten-part series and a theatrical version of this movie. But even if you are not in the wine, the film has an interesting look at how the forces of globalization change with the oldest and most established traditions in the world. Impacts on local cultures and the economy cannot be ignored. <br /> <br /> (8/10)
