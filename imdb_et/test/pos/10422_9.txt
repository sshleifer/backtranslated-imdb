Wow, I'm sure Kelli McCarty is pretty much this summer. I didn't know this woman had made so many cushions in the last three years. It's like seeing a soft star in front of me, like Michelle Hall a few years ago. <br /> <br /> "Passion's Peak" is the third quality cushion I've seen in Kelli McCarty's, "Girl for Girl" and "House of Love" are others. "Desire and Fraud" was okay, but it was not remarkable. This review has spoilers, so read only when you want. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Christina's (Kelli McCarty) big city and mountains. He has inherited an expensive departed grandmother's house and plans to turn it into a mountain house. Before she can even put things down, a woman called Kim (this film was not credited, but rather aggressive) will book guests for a stay. Now he has to design the house quickly - Chip (Bobby Johnston), a childhood friend, can get saved. The chip helps it work in the house. She hires two local sluters working in her building - Chip's sister Bait (Samantha McConnell) and her sex buddy Hank. <br /> <br /> Guests can now start. Eric and Linda (Flower), the first two stereotypical money-first lawyers, will be the first. Linda and Eric enter a huge argument during the dinner party, which is halfway through the film, leading to their breaking; sad stuff out there. Next is the novel by Sophia, played by the B-goddess Monique Parent. She uses this silly alias Scarlet Johansing again and has a very professional look - naturally with blonde hair. It wouldn't be Monique if she didn't have at least one scene she was playing - and she would commit to one of Eric's and Linda's sex scenes. <br /> <br /> James and Shene (Devinn Lane - either, porn star Devinn Lane) will also appear a little over the weekend. Unknown to Shene is James and Christina's real history. Until now, James and Christina used it, but Christina broke it to this mountain house. James arrives at the guesthouse to get Christina back, but her plan is back. Christina casts beans on Shene, which causes Shene to walk and the local bar to record to local people. Shene will now come to Eric's sleeping bag and leave together. Bait realizes that she wants more than just having sex, and Christine finds true love with Chip because Sophia sucks it all and writes it to her next novel. <br /> <br /> Actually .... when you ask me, this whole movie played like a novel novel. I don't know if the screenwriter did this effect, but I definitely have that impression. Sophia had some of the best features in this movie, playing the idea that it was a live-action romance novel. He seems to enjoy all the struggles and setbacks. <br /> <br /> Now sex. There was quite a lot, and it was a normal bunch and a grind. Monique did a fair share of her two sex scene stuttering. This film was dignified, and the story keeps the audience somewhat interested in sexual scenes. <br /> <br /> Women: A- (Monique was just Monique for years, I think she's the best, she can really act and be sexy, so she keeps # 1 from my Skinemax Top 10. Kelli McCarty is better off making soft stuffs when he's a soap opera "Passions", I don't know why he doesn't do more of them - the flower was just a backdrop in a limited role, Samantha McConnell continues to impress me and Devinn Lane is another hardcore actor Soft job is this for a soft area and doing a semi-decent job.) <br /> <br /> Gender: B (It was good, but not terrifying, remarkable. Much bewildered. Don't look at R rating Version, trust me .... most good things My class is uncut for version.) <br /> <br /> Story: B (a definite story that ich casts a busy "Ooh, building inspector closes us" to the end of the sub platform that brings things together. Christina and James The story was nice, and Sophia's dialogue was full of novels there were nice touches.) <br /> <br /> Generally: B + (I found this movie it's not sure Softcore Hall-Of-Famer is like "Girl for Girl" but it's a respectable addition to the Skinemax collection.)
