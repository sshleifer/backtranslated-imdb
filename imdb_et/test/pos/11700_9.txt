Crackerjack is not a pleasure for everyone to see, the tongue is planted firmly on the cheek. Jack Simpson's pleasant character, played by Mick Molloy, scores local "bowlo" free parking and makes a few dollars on the side by selling a parking space to his colleagues. When the Bowling Club members have to raise money to rescue their club, they invite Jack to their bowling team and play contests. <br /> <br /> Aussie is filled with magic, Mick Molloy's laconic mind (he also wrote the script), reminding the viewer of his earlier work on the radio. Perfect casting of Aussie with Bill Hunter as Jack's bowling mentor Stan Coombes, John Clarke (fame of games) as a ruthless businessman and rival bowl club owner Bernie Fowler with Samuel Johnson as Jack's companion Dave and Judith Lucy as ninja journalist Nancy This is a flick, but deciding whether a blue rinse machine is worshiping is a movie for everyone.
