The All-Monster congregation in the Universal Film Classical Horror Story. Count Dracula (intensive, dapper John Carradine), calling himself Baroness in Latos, comes to Dr. Edelmann (Onslow Stevens), asking to cure his suffering. Of course it's just ruse. Then, by chance, Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney), called "Wolf Man", appears to be healthy. <br /> <br /> As others have pointed out, monsters are not getting the same screen time. The Frankenstein monster (Glenn Strange) is being thrown into it just to include all the universal monsters. Video and library music are also used here. The film spends the story with the part of Drakula, or a little too much, though Carradine gives an impressive, non-bite in the role of stories. The film is mainly an exhibition for Stevens, a tragic character that is its own and does a good job. Women are proud, and I have to say I loved Jane Adams as a white sister - who happens to be scary. <br /> <br /> Of course, this would not be complete without the involvement of angry villagers. <br /> <br /> A competent, professionally made cooler is not at all scary to my liking, but interesting. This is the generic name of a reputable series. <br /> <br /> 7/10
