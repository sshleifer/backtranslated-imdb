I was pleasantly surprised by the story and the evolution of character. Fulci was a master who created a terrible atmosphere using inventive camera works, lively cinematography, and yes - a wonderfully explicit gore. <br /> <br /> This movie, however, is no exception to its later films (The Beyond, Zombie 2 Live Dead Town, House at Cemetery, etc.). The characters here are very well developed and the emphasis is supernatural, and it is more classical who is among the lush mountains of Italy. The landscape is in memorable folklore-like moments and then immediately contrasted with the mud and blood-wetted terror surrounded by the ruined ruins. The gore of this film is not quite as common and seems modest compared to Fulci's later films, but spraying and giallo fans are likely to be closer to pair wounds and the last 5 minutes of the film. <Br / In general, it's a fantastic and mature movie from one of our great Italian horror leaders.
