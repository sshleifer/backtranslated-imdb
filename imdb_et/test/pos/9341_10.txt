The stars and planets must all be in the right alignment on the day THRILLER was created. Michael Jackson's album hit charts, John Landis still had a lot of good intentions built on his genre "American Werewolf In London", not to mention his classic comedy ANIMAL HOUSE and BLUES BROTHERS and choreographer Michael Peters. creating the most innovative and influential parts of music videos of this period. <br /> <br /> Not before or since one part of the film has been illuminated, misused or stressed by the incredible talents of MJ or more aspects of "other worlds" his person is like THRILLER, the world's most successful (if not officially, first) long-term video , and most pleasantly. Also the most expensive at this time, but every penny and every bit of talent behind its creation and execution is on the screen. And how wouldn't it be complete without the original song "rap" offered by late, great Vincent Price to add more chills to the chills already? <br /> <br /> One of the world's greatest performers has long gone, but no one can ever take away the man's powerful achievements, which is probably the most memorable one. If you don't think so right now, remember: Halloween is coming. I'm not a little surprised if it, like other Halloweens, before he goes back decades, appears on some of the special features of a Saturday night event. <br /> <br /> Like next year and next year. .
