Many people have said that this movie was not a good movie, horror perspective I agree, it wasn't very scary, it had some terrible ways of torture (hooks where they shouldn't) but not scary. but it was a good movie comic, i thought it was fun, such bad behavior from dee snider with his foolish theological survey, and every other word he said came out "what's the, define______", then the angry mobile in his house, where one of them keeps telling us to say "we are not going to take it" (which is the song of his band's twisted sister, but I think the part that smiled me the most was a boy's wife who was dead and dee snider kept her up and made her dance when I saw I broke tears ... so I wouldn't want it for lovers of enthusiastic fear, but for those who love horror for their comedy, I recommend this movie 100%
