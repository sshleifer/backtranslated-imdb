I was really surprised when I saw this movie directed by Iain Softley; it differs so much from traditional Hollywood mass production. The plot itself is simple - Kevin Spacey plays the mental patient Proti, who claims to be a K-pax planet who came to Earth with a beam of light, while dr. Powell, played by Jeff Bridges, tries to help him solve his fraud. .. First of all, I have to admit that cast is completely chosen: Kevin Spacey is really great, depicting Proti's intriguing character, always walking with a fine line to convince us that it is real and then makes us questionable whether he is misleading or not. Some of the gem scenes include where the Prot fires the whole banana (even the top) innocently with Dr. Powell in the session; or an observatory scene where he confidently shows his knowledge of the astonished astronomers from the K-Pax system ... but Jeff Bridges is the subtle, rational side of this film and he gives it a great deal. A whole couple of great actors (like Saul Williams' convincing force Ernie) who make this movie really workable. <br /> <br /> K-pax has everything, comedy elements; Sci-Fi, even a psychological thriller (which concerns the Prot identity), but most importantly, can be classified as a heart-warming drama. The main premise of the film is quite complicated, but the director will never let it get rid of, he always sees it as believable and still two-way interpretable. Camera and photography play a very important role here, continuing the main idea of ​​light travel, focusing on a lot of light shade, flash settings - one of the most memorable scenes is where Dr. Powell has a crystal shape in his office that throws light back, but all the time he suspects, can the idea be true? <br /> <br /> A subtle and slow pace, intriguing and pleasing, K-pax is a real pearl, one of those films that may not be for every taste, but those who see it can fall in love with it.
