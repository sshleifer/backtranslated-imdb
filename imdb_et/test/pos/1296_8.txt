Kahin Pyaar Na Ho Jaaye is a great family film. Salman Khan is looking beautiful and big than ever! There's even a scene where she takes her shirt off! What a surprise!!! Rani Mukherjee is also great. Pooja Batral had very few lines, but I am glad she has acknowledged her role because she definitely has the potential. <br /> <br /> This is Prem (Salman Khan) and he is a wedding singer. She married Nisha (Raveena Tandon) but rises up. Prem goes to Nisha's home and asks why he was forced and because his brother is sick and he has to marry NRI, Satisfied (Inder Kumar) to get the money to treat him. Prem moves and arrives at Priya (Rani Mukherjee). Prem falls with <br /> <br /> love with Priya, but it's a shame she's married to NRI! Who could be this NRI?! Priya also falls in love with Prem when Peace is with her. Prem gives Priya one day of offensive comment and she goes down and goes to Agra with satisfaction. Does Prem Stop? Check out KPNHJ to find out! <br /> <br /> The movie was very funny! The songs were excellent especially for the song "O Priya O Priya" It's a shame that the movie is floped in India and I don't know why?! Every Indian movie is on the flop today! This film deserves a stroke. The only problem I found in the movie is that they had an obsession with NRIs! They think all NRIs are rich! The film deserves 9/10!
