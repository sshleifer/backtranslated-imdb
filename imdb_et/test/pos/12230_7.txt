"Fare to Remember" is a completely derivative, almost ridiculous movie, but it has a warmth that makes it a very effective and joyful holiday movie. He celebrates quite a newcomer, Challen Kates as a high-power advertising manager, who must rush from L.A to Seattle just before the wedding to keep every second presentation rejected by the customer. He has the difficulty of transport from the beginning and the seemingly lack of money. This is the first stupid thing - were there no ATMs? He must make a fortune. In any case, he meets a cab driver (Warner) who looks like a homeless man, and he drives him to his presentation and when he appears with a big beef beef (a customer's product), he takes him to the airport. All flights will be canceled so that he will be hired by L.A for his wedding. <br /> <br /> Along the way, they bind and learn from each other. This is a very sweet movie, although there's nothing new about it - it combines "six days and seven nights" and some other movies. But the chemistry between the stars is good, they are nice and the actor is good. Look for Jerry Springer as the manager of the beef nervous business and Karl Malden's chatter. <br /> <br /> This is a nice movie that takes place during the holidays. It's a lifetime.
