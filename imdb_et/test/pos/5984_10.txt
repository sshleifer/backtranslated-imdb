This is one of my favorite films; delightful comedy; so I was glad to know that this is going to be released on DVD in Britain in September 2007. Romual, played by Daniel Auteuil, is a rich dairy company president. Juliette, played by the great Firma Richard, is cleaner of the Paris office. Juliette, the mother of several children, discovers a plot against Romuald, who initially ignores her attempts to warn her. She slowly grabs what this charming sub-class lady in Paris has been trying to do. "She is seeking refuge in her overcrowded apartment because her marriage and career break up. Unlikely flower of love. Cultures are breaking into what is truly cheerful frivolous comedy.
