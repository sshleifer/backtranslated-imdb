"Satan's Brotherhood" is one of the least underestimated horror films of all time. Why not have a cult status, it is more distant to me. What is the cause of hysteria? The movie is really terrible, some scenes are really nervous and definitely not just forgotten. up, action is really good, and the climax is odd and disturbing.
