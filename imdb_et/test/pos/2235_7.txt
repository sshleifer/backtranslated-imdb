Is this a good movie? No, certainly not. But for Jolie lovers, it's black. His non-polished actor and semi-naked scene will want his fans over the years to come. However, the current rating (3.2) is too low. The film may not have a good story and it is not a good sf movie, but the actor is good enough (and as mentioned earlier, Jolie's actor is nice and raw), the film is very direct, very close to the procedures. The landscape is odd. And last but not least, van Damme's departure was a very good choice. Probably not Jolie lovers would like to have sex with her. This movie is all about a cult film.
