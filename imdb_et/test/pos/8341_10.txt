Too many Christian films focus on the fear of judgment, and this results in both sprawling and involuntary cheesy. The "second look" gets it right. This is an almost perfect evangelical tool; it deals with the real reason why so many young people want to do something about Christianity. This guarantees viewers that they must give up their sin - not fun - to succeed in the Christian way of life. "Second Glance" even works as a film. The filmmakers obviously worked with a very small budget, but they managed to write a sufficiently dynamic script to draw the attention of the viewers to this obvious fact. This film brought me to my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and thanks to Christian stations everywhere that shows it has certainly affected more people than I do.
