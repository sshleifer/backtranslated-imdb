This film is now much shorter than it appeared in 1918. In fact, it is now available with two more medium-sized silent Chaplin features (A DOG LIFE and PILGRIM), which Chaplin re-released in the 1950s. On the day, the SHOULDER ARMS was a big hit because it was a unified approach. It is still very funny (Chaplin hidden as a tree that spits the Germans is so ridiculous that it is hysterical) but it suffers at its age. Charlie is engaged in World War I, a terrible conflict that killed 20 million people, but not the worst of the 20th century. Chaplin would also live to see this war and violate its main architects in a large artist. But the latter is more accessible to the modern audience because this film is a spoken picture. Hitler also seems to be a target for the audience in 2008 more important than Kaiser Wilhelm II and his general staff. <br /> <br /> SHOULDER ARMS had to take us through the tram, his training, his use. ditch warfare and his actual struggle against the "Huns" west. Much of this has now disappeared - one segment (when Albert Austin is a doctor studying Chaplin in his center in a prison center) still exists and was fully shown in the documentary CHAPLIN. This is unfortunate because the film is about forty-five minutes long and it seems these scenes are full. It remains for the first time, but one misses the wish more ... and feels a little cheated. <br /> <br /> Sydney Chaplin and Henry Bergman are doing well supporting parts, especially Sydney as Wilhelm. He had done that with a short Charlie to sell the bonds, giving a militaristic speech before the tramp was labeled "with military bonds". Here we can see that trampil succeeds to stop Wilhelm and the general staff. It was only Stan and Ollie, who grabbed PACK TO YOUR TROUBLES with a German army tank and barbed wire. The funny thing is that Chaplin actually had a big crisis because of the war. . He was not a naturalized America - not in 1917 or 1952, when Attorney General McGranery publicly announced that Chaplin could not return to the US because he was an enemy alien (Chaplin and his family were traveling in Europe - anger Charlie settled in Switzerland for the rest of his life except when he made HONGKONG COUNTRY and went to Hollywood for his "Oscar" private barrier in the 1970s). Because he was not an American, he couldn't make it to the US. So he sold (with Douglas Fairbanks Sr and Mary Pickford) US military bonds. But in the United Kingdom, tens of thousands were destroyed on the battlefields of World War I, and the public was disturbed by Chaplin, who considered them "bursting" and cowardly. Eventually Chaplin won this, but the traces of resentment followed him until he died. It does not reduce the success of SHOULDER ARMS as a film, but it indicates why Chaplin did not make another modern war movie and a more worthy target in 1940.
