My kids, DD 7 and DS 10, enjoyed the movie so much that they were in their seats. It was good, old-fashioned, rated G, family fun. This movie was made for kids .... no one really understands them. <br /> <br /> Julia Roberts, Brice Will, Garth Brooks and other stars were fun to see. Since a city living person designed a fictional "Big Texas", I can say that they made a fair and accurate image. The kids looked like kids, not like superstars. <br /> <br /> I hope everyone will support this movie to send a message to Hollywood that we need such movies. Go look, then spread the word!
