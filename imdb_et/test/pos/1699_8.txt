this movie is not as bad as some say it is infact i think it is more enjoyable than the original. maybe this is why some people hate it as much as they don't want to admit it to good (not big) movies. <br /> <br /> Most, if not all, of FXs were made by CGI, which I didn't know at all was this pleasant movie. Phil Buckman - (Chris) was, in my opinion, the best film that Julie Delpy was quite attractive to, she brought the film to sex. <br /> <br /> There were many wisecrackes in the movie that I thought. good. this movie is in my collection but the original is not because I don't like it as much as it does. I wasn't bored when I watched the movie he watched, looking differently from some horror movies I could mention like oh say = driller killer & suspiria (dario argento`s movie) to name just two. <br /> <br /> is a real werewolf movie that should be in the collection of people when they love werewolf movies, maybe I can get the original at some point. I have only one complaint and that is Phil Buckman - (Chris) should have been more than he was, but besides that, the movie was very good. <br /> <br /> The rating of this movie is 8/10 oxu werewolf movie not the worst. <br /> <br />
