I was watching it for the first time in black-and-white, during the sixties, when it was shown on British television. I was absolutely hooked and looked at it again when it was on TV (only two or three times when it happens - if only we were video recorders!). <br /> <br /> As described by other participants, the plot of Hoppity's grasshopper describes the return of Forty towns in America after a lapse of time. He thinks that everything is not as he left, and his good insect friends (who live in the "west", which are directly in the fence belonging to the singer and his wife) are now in "human" danger. The broken fence, which fixes the property, is used by a shortcut. <br /> <br /> Insect houses are flat with feet and are often burned alongside cigars and games. The old Mr Bumble and his beautiful daughter Honey (Hoppity childhood sweetheart) are in serious danger of losing their Honey Shop for this threat. a romantic design for Honey Bee and hopes Swat the Fly and Smack the Mosquito with their henchmen, forcing Bumble to hand her into marriage. day and save the community of mistakes from their foolish destiny and especially its precious metal? Enjoy the classic songs ("Katy Did, Katy was not" a great, swinging, pleasant example) and colorful visuals when the story comes. <br /> <br /> Time hasn't been fascinated by the masterpiece of animation and storytelling, and I was very pleased that it was posted on the video, although later I learned that it was in NTSC PAL format. Never, I sent the video straight away and only then bought a portable TV / video combination (with NTSC playback). <br /> <br /> Since then, I've been enjoying a lot of nostalgic views, and I've even discovered that TV rights have passed from the BBC (who informed me that they probably won't show the movie at any of their stations) to FilmFour, who is (finally!) at their digital stations in early 2007. <br /> <br /> My grandchild (three years old) was absolutely entranced when we looked at it together - and this is a child affected by the digital age and the resulting computer products! <br /> <br /> We strongly recommend this movie to every age and especially younger viewer. <br /> <br /> Give Max Fleischer a hit on Oscar!
