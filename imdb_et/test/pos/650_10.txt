Great movie before your time, <br /> <br /> I think so, in the eighties, it was all about winning, greed is good? Remember this? I've seen this movie more than 20 times. For me, this is a real desert movie, I look, because there is always more to know about the bad signs I just love, Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronin, are just wonderful Also Beverly D'angelo, Beau Bridges, come close, can't me wrong, this movie has much bigger results, and this is how it is written for me and i hope you, the movie you want to see over and over again, i think tv shows like "Northen Exposure" and now " Earl "owes much to this movie. but remember this is not a Tom Cruise movie.
