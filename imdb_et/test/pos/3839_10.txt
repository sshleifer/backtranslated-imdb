* May include spoiler * <br /> <br /> For the first time I saw this movie when it was about 8 years old when it was re-released on the video. Now I'm 17 years old and I look at it when I get a chance. "Aristocrats" was a lovely heart warming film that I fell in love with. I loved this song, especially what kittens are singing with piano. In fact, I even sang it with my sister and friend's talent show because I loved it so much. All three kittens are so cute and their mother is one of the most beautiful cartoons I've ever seen. Ally's cat had a great voice! <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie is when the kittens play the piano. This part is divine. I also enjoy their homeland. It's wonderful. This is one of the best Disney movies I've ever seen and one of my favorites. Everyone should see it. I'll give this movie the 10/10 stars.
