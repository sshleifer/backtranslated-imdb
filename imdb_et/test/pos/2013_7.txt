Jon Cryer reiterates his role as a neurotic guy in two and a half men he improved in this series. She wants to have a good relationship with a girl, as her co-worker has developed, and tet-a-tet between her and her partner's best friend is pretty funny. Then they realize that they are against each other and start getting acquainted. One of the funniest lines of TV EVER - I think the last episode - he discusses with his partner that he wants to offer her. <br /> <br /> His partner is preparing him for now, suggesting: "What's the worst that can happen?" dinner. To whom he answers, "God, no!" <br /> <br /> I laughed so hard that I cried.
