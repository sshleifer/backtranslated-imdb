At first I thought of a cautious, remote location and a chain of forest that I was thinking of the opening plan "Once upon a time in the West". When it reaches the city, it will seem like "kitchen stories" or "drifting clouds", even "Grimm". <br /> <br /> Then it turns out to be more like a "Joe Versus Volcano" theme (not style). And the movie has the same, underestimated style from beginning to end. , wall color, furniture, bedding, mirrors, cars, music, background noise and even people's expression. After all, a completely different tone - warm orange-yellow, soft music and ocean squirting, kids and laughs, much more to see the alternative or to it what happens after the end of the end.
