This film is probably the best new French film I've seen in this century. There have been some great ones, including Noe's Irreversible, Green's Le Pont des Arts and Hadzihalilovic's Innocence, but none of them are close to Les Amants Reguliers' timeless glory. <br /> <br /> Film is a description of the events of May 68, followed by a refreshing and respect for the Nouvelle Vague films of these days. As far as depicting the riots in Paris, the film is exactly accurate (I am only 19 years old and I was not there, but you know what I mean) and almost in real time and very long rebel scenes staged the stage well after the events on the streets of Paris . The riots are not honored or decorated like Bertolucci's The Dreamers (to which the film is comparable in many ways), but are filmed in grimy black-and-white techniques by excellent William Lubtchansky. The love story, which is the main concern of the film after the riots of 68, is filmed in stunning and much less blurred in the shots, and succeeds in creating true feelings of love and confusion among adolescents in otherwise politically concerned and seemingly cold environments. > <br /> This movie is a beautiful love story and it radiates through the director's desire to portray his own experience at the end of the mythical 60s, making the film even more convincing. But the film is also a tribute to the entire Nouvelle Vague canon. Much of the dialogue creates an early Truffu, and the length and non-function, and the less structure of the plot, resemble Eustache or Rivette. People who look directly into the camera and even turn to Bernardo Bertolucci have even Godard-like verfremdung effects. This film is undoubtedly a response to Bertolucci The Dreamers, and it is also a tribute to Nouvelle Vague, but it is still a beautiful and bright love story. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: This movie is incredible and if you love French cinema, you shouldn't sleep. It may be the best French film of La Mamain et la Putain in Eestache.
