Plunkett and Macleane is a fun, fast and refreshing film. Refreshing, as unlike most other periodic films, it doesn't try to give the audience a story or preach - indeed, all historical accuracy is overlooked. This film does not take itself too seriously and tries to attract rather than enlighten. Plunkett and Macleane have been set in the 18th century, but director Jake Scott has a 90's. There's deed, sex and petting, and inevitably burning aristocratic dances with no disco. Jonny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle are brilliant as always, and the rest, especially Alan Cumming as a flirting fop, is also a lot of fun. The film is visually appealing in a mix of comedy, action, and drama, where Liv Tyler offers love for an engaging vibrating English accent. In short, if you are looking for a fun couple of hours then this is your movie. It doesn't make you think, but it can smile on your face.
