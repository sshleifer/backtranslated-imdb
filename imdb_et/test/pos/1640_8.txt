The FBI Agents Mulder and Scully are sent to the test to investigate what happened to the Arctic drilling team in this early "X-Files" episode that David Duchovny himself sees as one of his first "rockin" episodes. It pays tribute to the great praise of John Carpenter's 1982 theater feature "The Thing" and sees similarities. Visually, color and lighting schemes combine to make the story hell. Production planning / artistic direction is particularly impressive; The exterior images of the Arctic camp resemble an earlier film to automatically create deja vu feelings for some viewers. Of course, the weather in our heroes is threatening, so that "The Thing" is created due to the wind-sound design. <br /> <br /> The culprit is an ancient worm that had been in contact with the crew; if it is in the host, it stimulates aggressive behavior. This allows the paranoia aspect to be fully respected and the way the script is created cannot be too sure who is infected and who is not. This leads to an inevitable scene of testing. This episode will definitely work, showing how tensions can cause malfunctions. This even allows Mulder and Scully moments where they are not sure if they can trust each other. <br /> <br /> The guest who plays is a good little group of actors: Xander Berkeley, Felicity Huffman and Steve Hytner as. the scientists undertook to accompany the mission with Mulder and Scully and as a pilot of Jeff Kober, who is in the camp. You'll also see Ken Kirzinger, one of Jason Voorhees's imaginators, once as one of the untrained original team members. <br /> <br /> By the way, there is one direct link between "Ice" and "Thing": the art director Graeme Murray, who worked on both projects. <br /> <br /> 8/10
