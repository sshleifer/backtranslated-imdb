One of Fuller's (veteran fighter himself) average quality of early works, but exactly the work of many controversial life areas in post-war Germany. The main character starts the film in April 45 Sgt with C Co, 157th Inf, 45. Div, which really ended the Munich War as in the movie. (The same unit last month won heavily in Aschaffenburg and then released part of the Dachau facility). An uninformed film may seem confusing when a good and bad show of the German people appears. But anyone who has stayed there, or at least read it well, would know that most of what is portrayed in the film is what really happened in Germany. The only inaccuracy I noticed was small: when the remnants of Remagen's bridge travel on the Rhine cruise, he notices that he was over there. But his unit rose south - Worms Germany north.
