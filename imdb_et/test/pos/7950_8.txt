How would you feel if you were living for just a few weeks? This film will help you to know one of the men who are facing this situation. It is said with compassion and without excessive emotion. Some may feel it quite slowly, but I think it adds to the film's realism. Some may see it as a love story, but I think it is secondary to seeing his last days through his eyes. The love of his life is part of the end of his life and gives it more influence. Low key and gentle, this story rolls as much as life does. Without clich√©s and unexpected events set against the background. If you like your movies gently emotionally realistic, it may be for you.
