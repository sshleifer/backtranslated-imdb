(Possible spoilers, but nothing critical.) <br /> <br /> I just watched this classic low-budget movie, and it disrupted the screen's energy level. All actors are proud of themselves, especially John Daniels, to see another movie. This movie not only boasts great performances, but controls stylish sequences, such as when a baron throws someone out of the window and we see a glass well falling into a swimming pool that breaks down from the impact of a fallen person, I love this slow-motional photo used in the 70's movie theater, dreaming and hypnotic. The cool and clever black debris pulls out a large single liner, while the slippery white trash can reach the unpleasant end. I love it, my rating 10/10. If it ever appears on a DVD, read me for a purchase.
