AAA is my favorite movie ... I've seen it several times (don't forget the list now) and every time I just love it .... It's Raj Kumar Santoshi's best film. Dialogues and performance are amazing .. All the actors and actors have done a great job ... You can't stop laughing while watching this movie ... its just fun ... Amir khan and Salman Khan have done a good job. and Paresh Rawal acted perfectly as always ..... Music is inspired by old Hindi films (60s music) and is good ... most of the movie has done a great job ... <br /> <br /> Generally, it's great Indian comedy movie to watch ...
