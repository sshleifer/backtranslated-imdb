I got it on local Mexican television at 2.00 am and decided to give it a chance because it is based on a real-life case of a typical All American family (father, mother and young son) murder. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, the hints point to Walker that this is a murderer because he had very different differences with his father. Soon after Walker and Luke are taken to the Sheriff Department. when a false detection device examines things are very different ... <br /> <br /> Even when Walker and Luke meet with their father's attorney, they learn that Luke is getting $ 200,000 and Walker is out of heresy. Luke buys a convertible directly. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's a great mysterious film about treachery, ambition, feelings and cold, very cold blood. <br /> <br /> I know the real names changed, but the experience is the same. Try this movie. I know it exists under "real murders" or similar events, but it is really worth it. Pure quality for operation, direction and plot.
