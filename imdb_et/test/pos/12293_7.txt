I agree with "johnlewis" who said that there is a lot between the lines of this movie. Although I think that the pace of this film could be improved, I think the complexity of the relationships between the characters is exciting. marry her cousin, although her love for her looks very cousin-y? Pierre and his stepmother are relatively curious. not quite sure ... <br /> <br /> Lucie's brother is a little eunuch or is it? <br /> <br /> And Isabelle, who is she? In general, I think it was worth my time. An interesting movie and what makes me read about Melville.
