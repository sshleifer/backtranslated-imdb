Being an avid Carpenter Fan, I really loved this movie (although the wigs leave much to be desired!) And agree with many comments that some areas of life were missing or touched. Whatever - it leaves your curiosity well and truly dissatisfied, so I went to discover more. I have to recommend Ray Coleman's book - Carpenters - The Untold Story. The book is a smart reading, and unlike the movie, it is "real" and on earth. I hope you enjoy it. I remember Cynthia Gibb's day of celebrities and Gypsies. She is a singer (as well as a dancer) on her own and I think it was the edge needed to create a character. Some other actors could fight it. It's an ashame movie deeper into your story. After all, this is the title of the movie, but I felt we could learn more about Richard, but I think, like any performer doing salt, you should always want to miss them!
