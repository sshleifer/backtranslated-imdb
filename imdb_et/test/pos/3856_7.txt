There are some movie films where animals or something "not human" represent people and I think this movie is one of them. In addition to some plot points and characters, this movie can be changed to all people, not primarily to animals. Though - this is good for someone - I feel that cats are in a movie that depicts people, happily good! :-) <br /> <br /> This film also focuses on a lot of questions about adults - which is quite strange for the Disney movie. He mentions alcohol *, shows a dog that teaches another dog how to attack people, and it shows male cats (Abraham Delacy Gieuseppe Casi Thomas) O 'Malley, a woman's cat fancying, surprisingly human and adult way. br /> <br /> Like a cartoon - or just a movie, I feel it is of good quality - the story and the characters are especially good. The film (in general) is set for France and with the feline family - the Duchess of Mother and her kittens Marie, Toulouse and Berlioz. You will also meet a (rich) old woman who adores cats, butler Edgar and an old man (who has lost CLEARLY's marbles) named George. Such an old woman discusses George's will and Edgar hears that he will get the will he gets after the cat. He is NOTING this - and he has in mind an evil scheme ... <br /> <br /> Very cute movie for every age - enjoy "Aristocats"! <br /> <br /> * Does not include "Basil Great Mouse Detective" and some others may be what I currently don't think about.
