Like almost everyone, I'm familiar with Ray Charles music. Who has not heard of "Georgia in my mind" and "The Mess-Around" and some other wonderful song in this film. But about Ray Charles's life I was sad ignorance until it was seen. I have to say that Jamie Foxx brought life to Ray Charles perfectly. His performance was powerful, only until manners and voice effects. The film also offered some of the trials and tribulations Charles dealt with during his lifetime and some of the demons of the past that turned him into adulthood. Perhaps the most powerful scene in the film was the heroin extract scene, which was painfully realistic. The film depicts Charles's growing awareness and involvement in the movement of civil rights, the culmination of which is his refusal to allow the Georgian public to be present before he forbids him to appear in the country. His drug addiction and matrimonial affairs are also well documented. The film revolves around her mother's claim when she was a child: don't let anyone or anyone make you stupid. â€œThe thing is that the drugs did just that and he had to beat them in order to respect the memory of his mother. Because of his heroin habit violation, there is not much more about his later life and career, but until then it is really powerful.
