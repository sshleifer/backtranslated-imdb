Young Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazzello are two great boys in this great film who have promised to "take care of their mother" and how they will cope when their new father starts beating the younger boy. The supporting cast of boys is also top-notch. The script really represents the mind and heart of the imaginary child. It's hard to believe that Wood could grow to look at something about Tom Hanks, but it's not new to Hollywood. This is honestly my only film criticism.
