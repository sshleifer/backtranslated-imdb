I just watched this movie and I have to say I'm surprised. It was very well done, with a good example and a deep look at Japanese students, in adolescent love. <br /> <br /> The look and feel is much different from many movies and you can easily enter the movie. Much of the pressure seems to be the story itself, which is extremely fine. The main theme and relationships with other characters are a bit complicated. But the general feeling of reality and dimensions will still draw you. <br /> <br /> The main recall is, of course, those who like something simple. What's not here. You have to be open to many things, including a new culture, to get more movies. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie. Worth a look.
