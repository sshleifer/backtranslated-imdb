I can't comment on this production, historical or literary accuracy, but I can say I enjoyed it. If there is a God, the sound track is released, the work of Ilona Sekacz is truly enduring. Twenty years on, the haunting issues of this production are still being moved and often come back. <br /> <br /> The story surrounds Catherine Moreland's entry into society. A somewhat uncomfortable and unhealthy interest in Gothic stories (early cellulose fiction?), Catherine goes to Bath in Mrs Allen, where she meets Henry Tilney. He is invited to visit Northang Monastery in Tilne, a terrifying (and somewhat financially challenged) General Tilney, who has the unfortunate idea of ​​wealth. <br /> <br /> When a reciprocal attraction mixes with family finance, the dispute is inevitable. This, together with Catherines' lively imagination, makes her fear for her safety. His possible departure is violated by accusations and fraud and reluctance. <br /> <br /> But the attraction between Catherine and Henry is for these challenges. He returns to offer a happy ending. This last scene is especially important given the random music of Ilona Sekacz. <br /> <br /> It can be a "bad" production from a purist point of view, harsh costumes and trembling performances will not tolerate, but for me it is 88 minutes of bliss.
