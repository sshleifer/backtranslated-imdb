One of the very few cartoons of Scooby Doo's "Scooby Doo and Loch Ness Monster" turns out to be entertaining, exciting, interesting, funny, and also surprisingly well interpreted by the Scottish Highlands. One annoying aspect of the film is the voices of many characters - Americans who try to feel the Scottish movie are unfortunately not so successful (although some people do better Scottish accents than others). <br /> <br /> Daphne has reached the Highlands to see her cousin Shannon and Highland games at Blake Castle. Gravely Shannon tells the gang that he believes he has seen a Loch Ness monster. If there is still chaos, Mystery Inc Gang still has a mystery ... <br /> <br /> Good Scooby Doo for fans and people who want more information about Scotland! Enjoy "Scooby Doo and Loch Ness Monster"! :-)
