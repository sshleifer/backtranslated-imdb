One of Starevich's earliest films in France is probably his only political satire. The story of the frogs who wanted the king reflects its title as high croakers who feel that democracy has gone flat, so they demand the king of Jupiter to rule their country. When he carries a stump, the frogs ask the other king, saying that the stump is just "political tree". This time Jupiter will send a hungry stork whose eyes will eat the inhabitants of the city. Since the original "croaker" slides under the stork beak, he speaks of his moral: "let alone well." This movie has some beautiful crowd scenes from dozens of dolls. Starewicz tricks the audience into believing that they are all moving at the same time, keeping the background in constant motion and animating only about six frogs or so at a time. Slightly sparse dialogue and lighting problems in some places reduce the quality of repetitive views, but its historical significance in Starewicz's life makes viewing important. His feelings to the government immediately after his escape from Russia are likely to be reflected in this film. In addition, it is amazing how many animations are animated in a stop-motion movie.
