I saw this fine flick right after leaving college. When I sat there happily, I saw Alice go between repressed virgin and sexual adventurers, thinking why her sexual encounters seemed familiar. Then I remembered - Intro Psych 101 Lecture! One of the lectures dealt with the psycho-sexual development stage, basically the transition from time to time, which part of the body and the accompanying stimuli is our main focus, as well as the changing emphasis on what gives us joy. Alice's first meeting is swimming, emphasizing the genitals and the bottom. His next meeting is oral, with Mad Hatter's dingaling. I forget the rest of the lecture and the order of the Alice meetings, but I remember how well they fit. It is interesting to see that the skin slips behind some brain rather than the clich√© "I'm here to deliver my seal. <br /> <br /> I can't see how Kristin DeBell's career could be this movie because it was his first film. And Reagan's tiring hypocrisy was still picked up during the liberation of this land, but so that he and his stories Man influenced Mrs DeBelli. When Man directed his anti-pornography commission (to repel people from their criminal activities), the services of the man's anti-wage activist Judith Reisner were hired. Reisner was obsessed with the pictures he had about child pornography. He saw that Alice's cover, Mrs DeBell, made for Playboy and immediately announced that she had scientifically proved that Mrs DeBell was actually a photocollage of several grown women and ten years of age. Share, of course.
