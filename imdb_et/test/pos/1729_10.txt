Okay, I grew up Who, but didn't love the doctor because Tom Baker. Christopher Eccleston made me love Who again and I'm with him forever. <br /> <br /> Writing is great, the actor's great, management (which was terrible in old times) is just fantastic. I was very skeptical about this program and I just looked at it forcibly, but I'm a big fan of it and love it (I have a song with a song that screams "to destroy"). <br /> <br /> A few things I love about the new program - 1) People note that Rose (Billie Piper) is disappearing from the planet. Some of the old exhibitions that the assistant would drop for a while, and then come home like nothing happened, no one noticed. 2) Doctor Chris Eccleston loves Rose - romantic or not, but there is no doubt that 9 loves and cares about his companion. He would have destroyed the world when he had to save him, what the old exhibition was missing - often the doctor would not care if he could see his assistants again. 3) They talk and think like real people - if Rose is shown something extreme or new (like foreigners), she acts like a real person - gobsmacked. I never wanted it when an old exhibition assistant, who didn't see anything from an alien, would fit immediately and instantly. I want to see Rose's face as a surprise when she sees a plastic mannequin. He gives it to me. <br /> <br /> Few things I don't like about this series: 1) Almost everything happens on earth (London or Cardiff) and I was sort of hoping for more out of the world. 2) This Eccleston left so fast that he really showed it great. <br /> <br /> But I can go with these little things - I enjoy a lot more than I have ever expected, so I don't mind having things on earth. <br /> <br /> Just don't take this example seriously - it's fun, it's smart, it's fun, but it's not a very serious heavy truck. It's pure fun and clean British, and I can't get enough. Watch it openly and put your brain in a neutral and enjoyable state! <br /> <br /> ps - don't look at the 2nd or newer series. The first series was great, the first episodes of the 2nd series were good, but don't look at it when it comes to love and monsters. Use garbage, completely destroy the exhibition.
