I can't quite explain why I find it so attractive and "Leopard" is not; this may be because the focus here is on what was great about this movie, the intimate moments that Visconti can make so wonderfully. It is majestically slow on this film, but this time it's not too long. This is a movie where nothing happens, but 20 minutes pass by. I think it must be partly due to how the film deals with the setbacks that work on its mini-story. Like "Leopard", he has a sympathetic leader who highlights the same type of worn-out pathos - although Bogard's performance is more likely to open himself up unlikely, especially in appearance: he really has a stupid stack that's easy to enjoy. In quiet moments, it is often quite beautiful. This is the richness of Visconti's films, the greatness of the scenes of the balls, which I find annoying because they change the individual's clarity with the accuracy of the mass. But here, it's part of the Gustav, surrounded by a visual din. <br /> <br /> The way Gustav's affection is introduced to us is quite brilliant - the camera shows the girl, the girl, the girl, then this beautiful, feminine character. It's like a hint of Shakespeare's sonnets and it doesn't feel great. (Only when Tadzio fully looks at the camera pulls it back and we can see his long, slender legs that we understand that he is not a boy but a youngster - at first we are forced to ask Gustav's attractiveness uncomfortably; Visconti must know it and he is not ashamed) Visconti is extremely patient with Gustav; we know a man, we know him. It is largely silent and when it opens its mouth it is poisoning; No wonder he wants the angelic, open object boy to prepare himself. Tadzio is different (we never know him like we never know a handful of Fellini grotesque, but because his life is another, his film), but it's not as funny as it seemed (there is one) in the scene where he spins too much). Tadzio may not guide him - he looks at him; Visconti just zooms in on everything. <br /> <br /> The film does not describe Gustav as gay. Tadzio is not even really a man, he is a boy's pretted version (gentle, pale, lush, with golden locks) that everyone loves (including one proud, slightly older young man with whom he wrestles). The closest they show, what could be understood as a reference to Gustav's homosexuality, is a famous haircut that opens its repressed vanity. <br /> <br /> It's not entirely successful - all of Alfred's waste is waste, and some unnecessary scenes, people wearing bags with a long shot, could have been cut off. Some parts are heavy-handed, for example, when the Gustav boat pulls and speaks boys, - his face is too obvious. (But during the same scene, Gustav casts a fit, wishing for a new rower, something so inexplicable that he does it.) But there are some scenes that relate for the first time - which create significant and quiet intensity. Tadzio repeats the piano song over and over, notes in the air can be the best example of anxiety. There is one debate that includes debate I am particularly interested in: can art be spiritual if it satisfies the senses, or does it have to go further? (We may consider that Tarkovsky, who appreciates both Visconti and Manni, is the best example of someone going beyond sensation.) I think it can do both. 9/10
