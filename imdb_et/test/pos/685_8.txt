I swear that if I ever tried cocaine, I'd be able to communicate perfectly with this movie. Its pace, as well as the dialogue, radiates at a speed that some viewers may need to stop and relax. <br /> <br /> There are very few elements in the movie, as Rob Lowe's character always seems to be losing his shoe, or how some characters run around the spirals around their zigzag path. The story was put together very well and the direction seems to be flawless. <br /> <br /> The film is clumsy and bright. This is one that I think would be most useful. Some laugh-loud-even-if-you-single moments ensure that I look back at it again.
