Radio laughs, cries, feeling. This story, based on a true story, is the perfect film for a couple to watch. Both are enough. The character of the Cuban Gooding Jr.portra title is perfected. His performance is worthy of the Academy Award nomination. The sympathy of the film is obvious. The film creates many emotions. I sincerely enjoyed this movie.
