Hair is one of my favorite films. Even if I'm not part of my generation, I watched this movie 9 times and I don't get a clear understanding of the message of passion, beauty and love. This film is against the Vietnam War and shows how people should be independent of color, origin, religion and class. I like the characters from Berger and Woof, and I think the 70's central park is one of the most beautiful places I've already seen in my life. <br /> <br /> By the way, I have this music in my mind: <br /> <br /> When the moon is in the seventh house and Jupiter aligns with Mars Then the peace is led by the planets And love directs the stars <br /> <br /> This is the Aquarian age threshold. Aquarius Aquarius Age! Aquarius! <br /> <br /> Harmony and Understanding Compassion and Belief in Abundance More Lies or Decisions Golden Living Dreams of Vision Mystical Crystal Revelation And the Real Liberation of Mind Aquarius! Aquarius! <br /> <br /> ps: I'm surprised that the director of this movie is the same director of AMADEUS. I love both movies!
