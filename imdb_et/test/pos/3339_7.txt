I want to start with a review of this documentary filmmaker, this is obviously a job of love and I think they did a good job of making an enjoyable documentary about someone who has got so little information from him. Certainly he has worship fans, which is good. <br /> <br /> I had heard about Bruce Haack, but he didn't know much about it, and I found the start of this documentary frustrating because I heard other musicians talking about him, but Bruce Haack himself was too far away. I wanted to see this Bruce Haack man !! I felt like the makers thought I already knew him and those musicians on the screen I didn't do, so I felt a little dark. <br /> <br /> When Bruce was finally shown in action it was great and gave me the taste of Bruce Haack, but it was just a taste. We were treated more with musicians and I felt like saying, "Look - all these cool musicians are inside him, so he must be cool!" I didn't care about Bruce's comment. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see Bruce as a person. You know, important things - more interviews with people who worked with him or knew him. More about his life and yes, about his drug use and other issues. I would like to know much more about my "Hackula" project. I wanted to enter my mind. Even if they did it through "God's Voice" comments and photos that would have been OK. <br /> <br /> Animations were good, but again I felt that they were used as fillers, they didn't really do anything but let me hear his music and see some shapes based on Dimension 5 items. I thought it was smart and creative, but again ... I wanted to know more about Bruce! Maybe Bruce Haack was hard to understand in real life? <br /> <br /> Anyway - finally, I enjoyed this documentary and felt sad that such amazing pioneers and geniuses as Mr Haack were forgotten as a journalist's march. I'm glad that this movie is meant to educate people about Bruce Haack even because of his mistakes.
