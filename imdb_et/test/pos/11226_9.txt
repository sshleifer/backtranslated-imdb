The Big Sky Country's harsh, cold terrain, with majestic snowy hills alongside unmatched plains, is here for the poetic use of lynx tongue / slide, which shows the deaths of young and talented Polish brothers and melancholy (who used to treat strange and exciting indie film fans). Twin Falls Idaho - A movie about a young woman who falls in love with two brothers who have been Siamese twins. The little orphan dies and the city is going to flood for progress (in the form of a dam and hydroelectric power station). With their gentle pleasing music scores, minimalist dialogue and character, and some fantastic sequences with some very unique angels, the Polish brothers focused their attention on what every good filmmaker pertains to the movie, moving pictures ... pictures, scenes ... deep beauty of celluloid photography paintings. It is best to look at it late at night, so haunting images can keep you in mind and wash you when you go to bed. The fact that it all happened in a budget of less than two million dollars in shoe structure, makes Hollywood ashamed of its bloated movie costs and hollow films, and shows that in the future Polish brothers will have a great deal.
