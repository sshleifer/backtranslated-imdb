If you want to see a very small horror comedy that is terrible, that's it. If you wait for blood and intestines, these pants will scare you, then that's not right for you. <br /> <br /> For the budget for filming this movie, music was particularly amazing! Although the film was filmed with a budget, music and sound were definitely better than most of the huge budget films. <br /> <br /> The story was really well done and the leader was praised. In this movie, there is almost a perfect mix of comedy and horror! Acting is top-notch and leaves room to make a sequel that I will definitely earn! I have no doubt that this film will become a direct cult class. <br /> <br /> In short, this film crowns the story of a son's life who steps into a grave. It tells a story of all the more fantastic experiences a robber duo has. Vampires for zombies and even aliens! Our stars begin with simple tombstones that steal jewelry, but quickly become body-wearers crazy doctor (Angus Scrim), who requires their medical practice bodies. When a duo finds a vampire to send his cruel employer, hackers discover that undead carcass trafficking is much more profitable than stealing conventional corpses. The only problem is that there is another gang called Murphy's House, which is competing for the same dead bodies, and this is where both grave robberies are head-to-head with consequences. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the freshest and most exciting horror comedies I've seen for years, and reminds me of Evil Dead. Don't miss it, you'll regret it!
