Like classic Hollywood musicals, the plot is just an excuse. Those interested in the French music hall (including the song of Ã‰dith Piaf) and the wonderful 10-plus-minute channel finale. Dancing in a movie is not at all the one that usually goes to the Canaan. <br /> <br /> Some may object to Technicolor costumes and bright lighting, but it gives you a clear overview of some great costumes and outfits. <br /> <br /> Take this into Jean Renoir's love letter to Paris where he grew up. Definitely Jean Renoir's film for people who don't like his serious movies or just want his Hollywood productions. <br /> <br />
