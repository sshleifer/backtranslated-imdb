I really enjoyed this movie - I generally like prison movies (I'm not sure why - I'm sure some shrinkage can do something!) I spent one night in prison more than 20 years ago and I knew I'd never go back - I got an individual version of "scared"! (I got a couple of hours in Alcatra's isolation box, compliments to the park ball, but that's another story!) Anyway, the genre interests me. The soundtrack, namely the Rolling Stones' sympathy against the devil, was the perfect background for the film. Until now, I think "Jericho Mile" is every time I hear this song.
