Fellowe's drama is a couple of marriages that are threatened by a younger third party who is interested in a house wife (Watson). Wilkinson plays a role very well when a troubled husband who is unable to control his wife's cheating, and does it. I also like Rupert Everett in his role as William Bule, the man with whom Watson has a deal. Although I think Emily Watson is a great actor, I had a little trouble writing her character, she didn't make her too pleasant (I know the fraudster shouldn't be pleasant, but some of her actions and things) she had no reason behind them). The scenario was probably a weak part of this drama, although Fellowese's direction was good and the performances were also quite good. This film is better than an infidel, but not a kind of masterpiece. --- IMDB Rating: 6.7, My Rating: 8/10
