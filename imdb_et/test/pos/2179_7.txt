Well, I've just seen Buster Keaton's film debut at Fatty Arbuckle's The Butcher Boy and - despite the raw way it seems, everything just happens for almost any logical reason - I found a lot of laugh. Buster says that if Buster orders molasses from a muscle, Batty says he paid it to Buster. stuck, greasy test removed, when molasses fall on the floor, Buster's legs are now on the floor and so on. It was probably not funny, but the screen was fun, like there were some tears that covered the flour, and the later queue, which takes place at Fatty's girlfriend's staging school, where Fatty dresses and Buster also helps to drag Fatty's rival. As I said, many scenes don't make fun, but visual, especially those related to Arbuckle and Keaton, are laughing inducing even today. Recommended viewing for Keaton graduates.
