The quality of animation here is definitely below the IMO parameter, regardless of the age of the OAV. The plot itself makes sense, but there are no characters. <br /> <br /> It may sound like a laugh, but given that Olympus is almost completely inhabited by living machines, do you feel comfortable? Can any machine emulate quite effectively human arrogance, myopia, and greed? I doubt it. There are some references to this in the film, but only when the team might be disturbed by them, "bioroids" (or any of them) can be replaced by human characters. It seems to me sloppy. <br /> <br /> The main characters seem to be some kind of emotional obstacle, although there is no light. The little light is thrown to the back at all, great damage. The short length of the film, with its focus on mech and crime, means that we don't see any depth of signs. The main job is all left behind, but we have no final products. A truncated version of this OAV would have made a great TV episode when some badge slots were created. <br /> <br /> This short film highlights mecha designs and action / espionage. <Br /> <br /> Errors really start showing when you have had the chance to digest all the events so I couldn't suggest it, but it's definitely worth a look or two! While this review is mostly negative, I really think it's worth it to look at, but it's not something to rush and buy. In short: a traceable waste of opportunity.
