DO NOT SEE CAUSE This little forgotten pearl has a special place in my heart and in the Video Nasties list. The flute-sitar-board box's soundtrack is classic. The main character, though hotter than most small budget stars, is a pretty low budget. The doctor's postgraduate character is well written and well-functioning. Some of the smaller characters are pretty stupid, but add nostalgia to the film. This is Campy. I'm not trying to lie. The character of this character is Faulknarian Man-Child, whose name is Sam, one of the sick flick patients in his sanitary hospital. Gore is quite common, though I think blood color is fantastic. It's so ..Red. This movie, in my opinion, got badly because of this advertising scheme. Some breathless small advertising managers got their revenge and thought, "We left the last AD campaign to the left, that's fine". Such small wedges have destroyed the film world. All balls and no brain. The editor may also be an alcoholic. Maybe it's all drunk. You see what I mean. One more small note. Don't buy it from the Wally-Mart dollar shelf. They have cut it and traced it. Try to find the longest section.
