I watched this movie on ITV and I enjoyed it a lot. It was very observable and very funny. Julie Walters and Rupert Grint were perfect in their roles. Separately, Julie Walters is mentioned because she creates an excellent, diverse, interesting character to look at. Ben's character is a bit shy and Stoic, but the changes he's going through are working great for Rupert Grind, I would say he has a future after Harry Potter's behavior. <br /> <br /> Laura Linney has a pretty good role to play in her defensive mother, the only thing they went wrong is doing her ... Villain-y. Ben's father was also an interesting contrast to his mother, and finally he is quite respectable. The only sign I didn't want was Bryony, he was a bit plain and unnecessary. I think this is a great comedy drama that is very easy to watch. one of my favorite movies easily.
