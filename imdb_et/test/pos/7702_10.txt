The great suspending thriller that works is first-rate and the plot keeps you away. This well-executed and focused film is based on real story and worth while while Joe Penny is very well placed and Ann Gillian is a convincing and frightened sister. Joe again proves that he is acting powerful and amazing. It is worth watching that I hope they will repeat it on every channel, I will definitely record it. For Penny and Gillian fans, it's worth your time. Rent it if you can buy it even better. Ideal triller tracking for the early nineties <br /> <br /> The film is great.
