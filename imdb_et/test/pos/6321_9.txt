The mystery and its solution was a great noir. However, I have some questions, maybe I didn't pay enough attention. <br /> <br /> Who killed the neighbor and why? Who killed the replacement event and why? <br /> <br /> And with some small prisoners, they should have shown the hotel switch. Not that they had to show the switch, but they should have shown that Jim and the girl who went to the hotel, Jim, went to the bathroom, coming out and the bartender said his girlfriend went out without help. > <br /> Then Jim arrives at the car and saw a sleeping woman and a little girl in the back seat. <br /> <br /> It would have given the viewer a solution to the sport. I wish I would record it, I would like to see it again.
