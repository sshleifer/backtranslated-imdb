... means "take and read", which is what I saw after this wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> Von Ancken stimulates and inspires this breathtaking and well-accomplished adaptation of Tobias Wolff's 1995 New Yorker article with the same name.

This is a lyrical stimulation that invites us to look again. <br /> <br /> Look at this young director ... he'll be there.
