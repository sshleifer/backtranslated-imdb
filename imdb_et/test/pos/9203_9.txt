I was shocked when I found out that Jimmy Caan has left this show, does anyone know why? I find James one of the greatest of all time and was not surprised that he came to the TV, which may be better than the crap seen on the big screen. Stories are slippery and the camera is faster than the speeding month! Don't forget the rest: James, Vanessa (yum!), Nikki, Molly, Josh, Mitch. Also, can someone tell me why there is a multiplayer setup on the DVD, but the Elvis JXL remix The smaller less conversation is used for initial NBC transmissions? Wouldn't it make sense to use a melody that you would associate with an American Gambling Center DVD?
