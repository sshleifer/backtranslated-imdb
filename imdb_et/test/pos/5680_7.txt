The basic piece of this movie has been described in detail in many other comments so I don't worry. First of all, I would like to congratulate the manufacturer, the cast, the directors and the team on creating an excellent entertainment film from the $ 1M budget, a small portion of the usual Hollywood fare that is not cheap. These people have the opportunity to do something new and entertained, but do not spend that fortune. It is essentially in the interest of art. I know, I know, some of you will decide that this is not art, but less, and that is good. I am quite glad that such people will continue to work for us in time and effort without waiting for huge millions of dollars. <br /> <br /> Now for criticism. I think the scenario that is presented is certain. It's wonderful when everything works and the hero / hero saves the day and everything well. I get the blatant manipulation of events that blind happiness is more than courage and strength. <br /> <br /> When the lee was attacked, but not seriously injured, she somehow blew the mud bank directly into a dead guide. Then, wonderfully, his loaded revolver is still in his wrapper and it actually works (after some cleaning and bluntness). Finally, if Lee is attacking the mud bank and jumps in the water, then the crack cannot kill him again. He reaches his (mouth) mouth with his hand and manages to pull the trigger repeatedly, ultimately bursting out the croc's brain (literally). <br /> <br /> I came to the conclusion that Lee was going to foot with the croc was just a way to stop the movie with a human triumph. Based on what I have seen, the croc attack is continuing and stops until the harvest ends the fight. Croc is spin around and around to demolish and drown the catch. It happened to the first three victims, but not to Lee. He had tooth marks, but they were not deep. <br /> <br /> I think the end would have been better if the crock was honestly saying that it shows its dominance in mangrove, millions of years on its territory. But how many of us would be upset or disappointed that a beautiful girl couldn't get out of life?
