Why do people have to follow the opinion of the masses and critics? RANDOM HEARTS, led by bright Sydney Pollack (who also plays a small role in the film), is another Harrison Ford vehicle. As such, it is pretty good and fun. Certainly, anyone who goes to see it has this in mind or read a book that is no better. Even Kristin Scott Thomas fans, including themselves, knew it was his variation again playing the love of his oldest uncle. Even as such, the film is satisfactory. What's so bad about this movie, which is much better than other (much higher rated) Harrison Ford vehicles? This film is not a masterpiece, but it is not as bad as the masses would have a potential viewer.
