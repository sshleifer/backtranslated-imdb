(The review is a non-restored version of the original 1950s version of the 1980s) On Earth, where no one likes the king and nobody likes the king's shepherd, and the two nearby painters live and run the chimney sweeper. A king who loves a shepherd, kills a real king and takes his place. A huge bird, the title of a wonderful bird, acts as a hero of the varieties and helps our two lovers. <br /> <br /> This is a strange strange movie ... not surreal, very very surreal. <Br /> <br /> The background style is very European, while the characters at Fliescher meet Warner, but early on Warner is unnecessary. They move in both realistic and comic-like ways. <br /> <br /> This is a strange film and takes a little while, but Peter Ustinov is a bird, his kids and puppy are wonderful. There are police officers and a bear design that will make you smile. <br /> <br /> And there is a deep philosophy in the film about the existence of the world ... outside the Metropolis rural town. <br /> <br /> It's a really clean movie. There's something so strange and unique that gives you a prize when you stay with it all the way. It's not perfect, but what the fuck. <br /> <br /> This is a movie to look for. If your local discount DVD has a Capcom version (with Paris Alice), buy it. It should run you under ten bucks, probably about five and the price is well worth it, especially if you realize that it is two full-length cartoons, two short cartoons, and several clean ads and other fun things.
