I liked this western starring Randolph Scoot and Glenn Ford.it has pretty much anything to be in the West. Edgar Buchanan, who plays Uncle Willie McLeod, a character who pretends to be an old fool, but is actually aware of what's going on. Randolph Scott plays in the city of Sheriff and Glenn Ford Plays Cheyenne Rogers / Bill Smith, a cool bird who finally tries his ways change. I liked the mix of different characters in the movie. I didn't always find it fast, but I never found it boring, though the film is 1943, it's colorful. 8/10
