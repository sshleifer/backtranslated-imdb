Well start Rajkumar Santoshi is not a comedy film maker, and it is really unfortunate because the only comedy movie he has made a masterpiece. This movie is really funny. Loud bits, overacted by some scene, but still dialogues r really laugh riots and signs r truly fun . A simple billionaire daughter's story comes to India for marriage and two young knees behind r, the story is also complicated with a gangster connection. Amir plays a role-playing man Amari playing his role with brilliance and Salman played the perfection of innocent fools. But the real show stealer r Paresh Rawal and Shakti Kapoor enter the frame and start to laugh automatically. Generally, such a pleasant movie that you can watch is not. times without boring.
