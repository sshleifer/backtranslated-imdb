This movie is so wonderful that it plays the life of games. I smiled so hard while watching it. The film is a gambling group that has a difficult time with the campaign that its prison captain came out of. The film switches from the real world and the game world when they play this campaign, showing them as their character in the game world and then, when they don't play, back to the real world. The campaign is the basis for the module that the master, Lodge, writes in the cave. The problem is that Lodge can't finish its module because the tokens can't stop the campaign. They are more to kill and loot instead of role-playing. The Lodge wants them to play something they never did before. They decide to bring some extra help so they can, wait, girl play. The Lodge also does npc, not the character of the player, to the palad who can't play if he can't see or do the wrong thing. The film is how they do it all and the more I don't want to spoil any movie, so I'm not saying any more. This movie may not be a big budget movie that the actor may not be worthy of the Oscar, but if you are into games or prison dungeons and dragons, be sure to watch it. They had a lot of fun doing this movie and it shows that I am not going to have this movie with any film problems, such as consistency or any low budget movie that is just fun. I find it a pleasant little pop comedy that I enjoy and some fucking good writing. So if you want to try a fun movie.
