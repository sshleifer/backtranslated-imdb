I have to say that I did not expect much sitting to watch "Pitch Black", but I got back a lot of excitement and pure fun. It's like a flick type, where you can just relax, relax and have fun. It is in no way a deep film. All that it offers is recovered or broken from other movies, such as "Alien", "Predator" or other. But when I look at the rip-off, I want it to be good, and this rip-off is great. <br /> <br /> It opens with the stars galaxy. Some of the biggest films of some time opened this type of scene - "2001", "Star Wars", "Alien", "Predator". The ship travels through the room when the entire cryogenically frozen crew is awake. The ship has hit something. They break up on the earth with three suns. Everyone is grazing out of the ship when they find that the transportation of these prisoners by Richard Riddick (Vin Diesel) has escaped. They scan the desert for a planet in search of it and eventually find it, but they don't have the opportunity to fly their ship again. They are looking for water and civilization on the planet, but it all seems suddenly disappeared from the planet a long time ago. <br /> <br /> Then they find that every 22 years the planets are in the sunshine and the whole planet becomes dark. It also happens that aliens living in the darkness on the planet - what are the opportunities? They happen to the right of the planet when shading happens - what are the possibilities? And Riddick has a rare talent - he sees it in the dark - again, what are the possibilities? <br /> <br /> There seems to be a lot of coincidence in this movie, but such a movie is not excluded to get Oscars for originality or credibility. It's for the audience to entertain - it does it easily. Vin Diesel is a big gorilla man with no talent. But I have to say, is there someone who suits trashy, homicidal felon, Diesel. Listen to her, nut: "She didn't know who she was." Great things. <br /> <br /> Aliens from this movie are confused between shark sharks, "Alien" and Predators. They have long, horizontal heads like the hammerhead, the fast movement of aliens and the Predator's insidious. I assume that David Twohy (film director and writer) did not expect the audience to believe his creatures were really something they had never seen before. At least I hope not. <br /> <br /> "Aliens Redux" may be a better name for this movie, but then it's better than the second and third "Alien" movie. At a time when the seemingly finished series is being revived - "Terminator 3", "Alien 5", "Predator 3", "Alien vs Predator" - "Pitch Black" is a brand new series. There are two more steps in the plan. We just hope that they won't be left out. I can just shoot it twenty-five years after: "Aliens vs. Predator vs. Pitch Black Aliens: * Fighting the Year." <br /> <br /> * The title of the year's title can be shared with the upcoming film "Freddy vs Jason vs Michael vs Leatherface vs Norman Bates vs Alien vs Predator vs Terminator vs James Cameron vs Barny Dinosaur." <br /> <br /> 4/5.
