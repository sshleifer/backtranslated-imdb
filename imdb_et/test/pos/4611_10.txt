This is the best example of unhindered film making. Richard Greene (who plays a good role), when he searches for his two lost friends, he leads the Black Fort domain and one-eye Count Bruno Castle (Stephen McNally), his previous enemy whom he has never seen face to face. The incredible movie has so many awesome elements (one-off) for one movie - crocodile cake; hulking (played by Lon Chaney, Jr); cunning doctor (played by Boris Karloff); leopard wolf (very well done and very atmospheric); love story; the fortress; sword fight; sadistic, one-eyed hope and his two evil companions (John Hoyt and Michael Pate !!!); an intriguing background that makes the movie even more interesting; and more!. Jerry Sackheim's manuscript does not allow you to bind - to make a film that is highly recommended for anyone who has unlimited filmmaking, with a terrible and ambitious atmosphere.
