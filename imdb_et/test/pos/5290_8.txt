I have read many different opinions and comments about this movie and I understand why many people get confused about Ponyo, be it story, animation, dialogue, and so on. And I think the easiest way to answer this is that this movie is for a much younger age group. Age rating much younger than Tonarino Totoro (My Neighbor Totoro). <br /> <br /> Being a fan of Miyazaki like most of the surfers on this site, I waited for a wonderful animation, a composition of music, a complicated story. The great constant development of the characters, how the story intertwines with modern society, etc. etc. A typical Miyazaki movie and the like. And to really say, I didn't understand exactly what the hell was to have this story, or what the hell lasted for an hour and twenty minutes (twenty minutes left of the movie) that this movie is NOT for deep thinkers and hard core, but for toddlers and young and happy to go to happy Japanese people. I also believe that this film is based on simplicity and creative animation; Ghibli Studio Style. <br /> <br /> The fact that the villain is not there surprised me, except my father and maybe this crazy ass-typhoon. But besides this, it's just fun; stimulate the young mind and feel happy time. That is all. <br /> <br /> Animation dates back to the mid-80s to the beginning of Miyazaki's films, where a very specific detail was not large, unlike Mononoke Hime (Princess Mononoke) and the last. I admire the simplicity that caused little nostalgia when I looked at Ghibli's films like Tonarino Totoro when I was a child. Children's reaction and movement are all very similar to children and much of Studio Ghibli's body language is very noticeable. Studio Ghibli added some creative moments and landscapes so they can only make great animators, but apparently this ritual won't take awe from Ghibli. <br /> <br /> The Japanese dialogue also sounded very child-friendly and many scenes and dialogues are very, very relative to what Japanese children and mothers would say and do. Music, if it is very dull and "fluffy", I think you could say (like Totoro) from start to finish. Even darker scenes didn't seem convincing. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie is sort of. Every part of this movie is for children. And I waited for the entire 80 minutes to understand it. Frankly, I've never seen a movie that would have said or shown how Miyazaki did it. It is refreshing to see that Studio Ghibli still has a story for a broader and more diverse audience and retains the brand Ghibl's impression.
