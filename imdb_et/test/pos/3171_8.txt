The tempest has been interpreted in many different ways, ranging from more or less traditional perspectives than dealing with art with more postmodern approaches that want to play a postcolonial, feminist, gender, or deconstructive line. The reason why the Jarman version was quite cold for me is that I had no idea what he was. What is the vision / idea / concept underlying Shakespeare's presentation? Earlier reviewers do not get much further than the revenge tragedy, the punk show, but definitely there is more, isn't it? This does not mean that there is no vision here, but that I have found it hard. As it is, there is still something to enjoy. The taste of the tree is refreshing and funny. Toyana Wilcox like Miranda and Jack Birkett as Caliban are wonderful. I didn't care about Williams as Prosper ... I don't have enough magic I think. Exchanges between the old monastery / castle and the outside world (very English) can be somewhat disturbing at times, but I think it is deliberate. All in all, it is interesting, but not quite successful, which I hoped for (especially after Jarman Caravaggio's viewing).
