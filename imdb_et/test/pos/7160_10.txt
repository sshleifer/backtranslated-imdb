I agree with other 9 and 10 stars. I saw it at the South West Southwest Southwest Film Festival in Austin. Of the 20 movies I saw, 7 were really good and that was the best for me. I am a mammalian filmman with a plot of equipment where characters pass changes that completely change their lives. A great show was mainly done by people who were on television or their first film. It was written and directed by Jay Floyd. It was his debut debut. Jay's day-to-day work is obviously the manager of many famous films. Franklin's forgiveness was the perfect joy and extremely funny places. This is one movie where I would buy a DVD and watch it again, a great addition to me. Well done, Jay, yeah ... give up your day!
