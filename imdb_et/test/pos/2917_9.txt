After reading all the comments on this movie, I am still surprised at Fox's reluctance to release a full-screen DVD recorder. Yes, history may be a bit inaccurate and certainly not as powerful as the book, but it was Fox's second film, made in Real Cinemascope, and whose merit values ​​are only worth restoring and distributing. I saw this movie in second grade and it brought my lifelong interest in all the Egyptian things that culminated in my visit to Egypt 4 years ago! Amazing movie power for the child's imagination, right? In high school I read a book and gave myself one day to dream. Now, this film is made in the "old school" style, which means that the Egyptians were depicted by the pink skinned and blue eyes of the Britons. But has anyone seen the current "HBO" series "ROME"? Everything old is old again. One cannot imagine why we, at that day and age, are still showing actors who will crawl like Mayfair's aristocrats. No ROME actor was able to provide ancient Italian. This means that the AMARNA period in Egypt is still one of the most exciting events in human history. This movie is tremendously tempting (to borrow from NEFER) its historical information (BEER! BRAIN SURGERY! IRON!) And its excellent cinematography and score. I have a terrible Taiwanese DVD version that I watch again, praying that one day there is a real revamped widescreen version. For anyone interested in this topic, I recommend recommending and accepting the author's historical novel "God Against God". If someone is filming from you, knows how to contact Fox to invite them, please let me know!
