I've never seen the original "Wax House," so I really didn't know what to expect when I went to the new movie. After a somewhat vague introduction to introducing our young stars, "House Of Wax" shifts the gear and becomes an extremely effective horror. <br /> <br /> Plot really isn't too much here - I think most people are seeing that these stranded children meet a nasty killer and find great things in the wax title. Here are all the special effects and these are the top limits. Observers who love their horror movies with lots of blood are happy here, but there are other spiritual effects. The production design and kits are excellent and cast the least of their written roles. <br /> <br /> Of course, many people have probably wondered how Paris Hilton has arrived. Frankly speaking, Hilton is doing quite well and does not "pretend" as many people predict. Her character is sexy and cute, and I think her good work will hopefully change many people's opinions about her. Elisha Cuthbert is also good at moving from her previous movie, "The Girl Next Door". His character is much over and Cuthbert turns out to be a heroic hero. Chad Michael Murray, like Hilton and Cuthbert, is beautiful to look at, but unfortunately this group is not very "bad boy". as screened to the audience, I shouted and shouted through many parts of the film. Congratulations on the work done for the team and well done. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the Paris Hilton to prove many people wrong. As he always says, "It's hot."
