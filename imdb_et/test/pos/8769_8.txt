Alfred Hitchcock's "Saboteur" (1942) (which must not be confused with another Hitchcock movie "Sabotage", made in 1936 with a completely different plot) is not the master of the biggest film. This dose does not include "Vertigo" (1958) depth or "Rebbeca" (1940) symbolizing atmosphere, and it certainly has no emotional effect and acting talent that can be found in "Notorious" (1946), but what this dose is excitement, adventure and nail biting. Both drivers are quite weak. It is easy to understand why Hitchcock wanted Gary Cooper to play the role of Robert Cummings and the role of Barbara Stanwycki in Priscilla Lane. Also, the patriotic speeches that Cuumming says (written by Dorothy Parker) are dated from time to time and the meeting with the circus troupe is badly done (beard is clearly wrong for beard). However, the last half-hour observation platform has been very well done at the top of the freedom status and the film is a clear predecessor of the North-North (1959). Two villains, Otto Kruger and Norman Lloyd have a very good and original fire at the Aircraft Factory is a great sequence. It's not the best movie of Hitch, but it's one of her most fun.
