Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks) is a hard-fitting, feminine Texas Congressman with no noticeable legislative record. In 1980, he became interested in the difficult situation in Afghanistan, which is central to the USSR. Under his old flame, arch-conservative Texas, under the auspices of social Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts), he travels to Afghanistan to assess the situation and is stunned by what he sees. He returns to the US, who decided to help the Afghans find their colleagues very indifferent to the situation - and himself is investigating the use of drugs. Wilson recruits herring and vulgar, attacked by CIA agent Gust Avrakot (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) to start armed conflict with Israel, Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and mostly ignorant US Congress. Finally, defeat the Afghans against the Soviets, but while America celebrates its victory, Wilson and Avrakoto find their warnings of post-war instability in Afghanistan on deaf ears. <br /> <br /> A truly clean movie for intellectual viewers and fun entertainment. The film collects an amazing number of talents, both in front of and behind the camera, and promises to be a good time. There's only one mistake in the movie that we'll get later. The 20th century's biggest hidden war of disguise - and perhaps the way the CIA and other intelligence agencies do it - is exciting. <br /> <br /> The film is interesting on many levels. The story depicted in the film - with all of his terrible double interactions, hidden hidden operations and perhaps most of its success - would be such a fiction that it would simply be rejected as a satire. But things really worked in this way, at least within reasonable limits. The film depicts our three main characters in an interesting way that highlights their virtues without concealing their drawbacks. Wilson as a person who is non-pathological about his vices (even covering them), but is ready to embrace the right cause. Herring is something elitist and her born reunion is fair, but she is committed to the cause of the Afghan people. Avrakoto is a CIA foreign affair with a relative problem, looking down at his street background, but his love for the state and communism for anger is steadfast. The fact that this bizarre trio can play an important role in the collapse of the USSR is not only proof that everyone can change, but also the truth is unfamiliar. It is also very interesting that all this is played in comedy - not too surprising given that our writer is Aaron Sorkin, but it is an interesting way to turn to this story. <br /> <br /> The film, however, has one drawback that is a bit surprising. The film looks like Wilson and Co's achievements unabashedly. It's okay - is there anything wrong with defeating the Soviet Union? - until it is believed that the Soviet defeat from the ashes in Afghanistan came from the Taliban and finally from al-Qaeda. Regardless of the level of responsibility in the United States, this happened, and Wilson's success is almost non-existent. To be fair, the film is dealing with this issue to the end, according to Wilson, it is quite topical for the US to be unable to clean itself up, but it takes place on the third level that the average viewer is unlikely to take that much. The general impression is that these three notable people helped the Afghans win the Soviets. It's not a lethal setback, remember, but it's another worrying aspect of an otherwise genius movie. <br /> <br /> The film's talent is remarkable. Legendary Mike Nichols brings out a slippery and gorgeous look; the material fits perfectly into his undervalued, nervous production style. Sorkin gives another great scenario; the film has dozens of quoted lines and classic Sorkin shifts (the best is the "Scotch Bottle" discussion between Wilson and Avrakoto) and is behind a political and historical perspective. The film is admirable: Tom Hanks delivers a fine result as a loving scammer because Julia Roberts is alternately charming and reluctant because of the nasty but committed Joanne, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman steals every scene (par normal) in abrasive Gus. Always lovely Amy Adams takes another step towards Wilson's long-term assistant and Ned Beatty, Om Puri, Emily Blunt, Christopher Denham and Ken Stott grinding the back pain. <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson's War is a smart and fun movie, wonderful a bit more than easy entertainment. The fact that he decides not to be more than it should not be opposed to it; that's great what it does. <br /> <br /> 8/10
