This is a new Barbie movie. The graphics were really good. They made the film partly realistic. I did the ballet and this movie made me go on. This film was like a Cinderella movie, but a little different. 12 princess's father gets very sick. Her cousin poisoned her and wants a throne. Girls find secret magical land because of their dead mother's stories. His job is to save his father and society. Their beautiful prince. It was a funny movie and I and my friend were having fun. We enjoyed it a lot and enjoyed the Indian speaking parrot. The music was very nice and made the film even bigger. He had a great classic orchestra. The voices were great and the characters were divinely cute and cute. I liked it to enjoy the movie with my family. All in all, I would look at it again.
