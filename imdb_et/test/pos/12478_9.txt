What do you get if you have a hairy, experienced French police inspector named Maurice Martineau, who has been called to resolve a murder case? Well, just a very fun and fun movie. The re-mastered black-and-white film "Quai des Orfevres" delivers goods regardless of romance, jealousy and marriage, which just seem to be on the way to the truth who did it? <br /> <br /> Core by customs, with the technique and experience experienced by intuition, the patience of this inspector repels the truth - but, of course, with a wife full of dirty police interrogation tricks. <br /> <br /> Martineau is at the heart of this movie. The use of director Henri-Georges Clouzot with fierce background music to intensify the film's noir-style drama is a wonderful wrap around the visual experience. <br /> <br /> Martineau finally solves the mystery and arrests the culprit. Hey, he's good! But, unfortunately, Martineau can keep a dark secret in the past. Who is this boy who may not be his son? <br /> <br /> Some things can never be solved - even after the end credit.
