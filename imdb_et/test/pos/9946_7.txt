Johnnie Socko and his Flying Robot four or five episodes were changed together. An entertaining giant robot struggling with giant monsters for children. Of course, the parents go crazy because the action is violent when the robot / monster battles resemble a professional wrestling and a person with the violence that is in Al Capone's. Valentine's Day School and Gangster Training Academy. I liked it, but then I grew up again in the series. If there is a problem with the diversity of the effects of "men's suits", the fact is that the film plays like a series of episodes sewn together at the top every 20 minutes. Recommended for those who run out of Ultraman or Godzilla
