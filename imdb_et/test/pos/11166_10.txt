Great movie of a big man. Thomas Kretschmann is first-rate than any other film. I would never have seen him as Pope John Paul. This tells the composer the volume. Why do they cast him in a movie as a German officer? And he started paying attention to the "pianist" at all? Of course he looks so hot in uniform. I know that many beautiful faces are girls. But this guy is a big actor and he has such great opportunities. If you don't believe me, check out "Stalingrad". I hope he will have many great roles in diversity in the future. Otherwise, what is the breaking of the big talents from the heart.
