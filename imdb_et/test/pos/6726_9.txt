Good to see that I'm not the only person who remembers this great movie. I have very nice memories of this movie - it looks like I recall when I was about 8 years old and I watch children's TV shows after school (someone at Broom Cupboard?). It was the first and last movie that scared me - and the pictures of a boy surrounded by fog on the hill will stay with me forever! Like most movies of this age, he also has a happy ending for children, but with the ability to capture adults' attention. The lovely Cornish landscape makes the movie feel isolated - and "ghostly" scenes are simple but very effective! I love to find this movie again - see if it still comes home!
