So "One Crazy Summer" - the better twin - starts with the evil twin. How can any movie be bad when David Lee Roth opens songs? <br /> <br /> This movie is a complete blow. Reconnect John Cusack with Curtis Armstrong, but this time adding Bobcat Goldwaith to the mix is ​​a great, funny result. The hyperactive Bobcat grills the nerve of everyone, Curtis "Ak Ak" is the army of the army kidnapped by pacifist trends and Demi Moore (natural breast ... wow!) Once again, the chronically depressed interest in Cusack's <br /> <br /> story is quite simple. The laughs are there, but both Savage Steve Dutch movies are of some quality ... they're funny, but they're also sweet. The scene where Curtis finds a targeted puppet on the beach and starts thinking about how a little girl can't sleep was stupid, funny and touching. The entire animation used is quite surreal. "Ship" is hysterical (with Watsamata U sail and Odie plush doll). In general, a fun movie, though not as good as "Better Dead ..."
