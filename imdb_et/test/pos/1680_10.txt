Du Rififi Chez Les Hommes / Rififi (1955) can be described on the surface as a French variation with John Huston's Asphalt Jungle (1950). The difference between the two films is Rifif (1955), which gives a little more attention to the order of robbery. Similarly, the police have not participated in the Asphalt Jungle after the robbery at Rifif. Finally, in my opinion, Rifif (1955) is a bit better than the Asphalt Jungle (1950). A remarkable Noir picture that defines French cinema from the 1950s. <br /> <br /> Spartacus (1960) may be the one that created the notorious blacklist, but I think Rifif (1955) was a film that began to break down into the unbreakable Hollywood blacklist. The first film, after five years, to Jules Dassin, who sacrificed McCarthy's Communist fear from the late 40s to the early 50s. Rifif (1955) became successful in France and Europe. So fighting the poisonous black list of Hollywood in a big way that probably inspired others to do the same. Rifif (1955) is the most important film of Dassini's career, as he not only restored his name but also gave him another chance to make films. <br /> <br /> Jules Dassin gave the world of film and its growing audience a masterpiece of influential proportions. His handling of the material is exceptional and the direction of the actors is flawless. Builds tense situations with precise finish. Dassin reached the full circle of Noir, directing his best and the latest Noir, Rifif (1955). At the end of Dirin's filmmaking time, he noted the end of the Dassini period. <br /> <br /> Rififa (1955) is a feature film for Jules Dassini's thirty-plus arsenal. Masterpiece acting, cinematography, management, editing and writing. Not a movie that would leave its place for one minute, because there's always something memorable. As brilliant as Jean Pierre Melville, who was the master of this type of film. Masterpieces such as Rififa (1955) are relatively small compared to films that are probably made with billions of film history. <br /> <br /> One of the most exciting aspects of Rifif is the precise planning and careful execution of robbery. most of the 118 minute duration. The main characters plan and execute the jewelers in the same way as the film director is preparing for pre-recording, production and production of the film. Shows how complicated Jewel is about them like Rifif (1955) and why very few would do something like this. The fact that the scene does not contain confusion, as in other films, makes this scene even bigger. Close when you can get the perfect sequence on the film. <br /> <br /> The absence of an unnatural sound in the temporal order of the landmark's historic minute puts this in the realm of absolute realism. Any dialogue or music would destroy all the tension the director tries to create. The use of natural sound makes the sequences of theaters satisfactory for watching movies. Now, filmmakers and producers are using dialogue and music in such a scene, because patience of the mainstream filmmaker is not trusted. Preserves a level of consistency that will never let you down. <br /> <br /> Maintaining a high level makes the queuing sequence perfect. The director is getting a very fast queue, rarely equal to most robbery programs. Jean Servais and the rest of the main players will help with some of the low-pitched techniques. Making the scenes placed on the scene is a task that few can do. Rifif's robbery sequence (1955) comes between Hitchcockius and tension. <br /> <br /> Many filmmakers from the years that followed Du Rifif's Chez Les Hommes (1955) are affected when not inspired. One filmmaker influenced Jean Pierre Melville (the original choice for Rifif's director) who used Heist sequence variations Le Doulos (1961) and Le Cercle Rouge (1970). Another filmmaker was Stanley Kubrick, who made a similar theme to The Killing (1956). Also Quentin Tarantino, whose debut film Reservoir Dogs (1992) was inspired by this film. Other film directors affected are John Woo, Michael Mann, Paul Schrader, Ringo Lam, etc. <br /> <br /> Du Rififi Chez Les Hommes (1955) is comparable in many ways to Bob le Flambeur (1955). One, Jules Dassin and Jean Pierre Melville directed revolutionary films in Rifif (1955) and Bob le Flambeuris (1955). Two, each film contains an aging criminal who plans and conducts bold gossip. Three, Bob le Flambeur and Rififi are finishing with fatalism. Four, each film shares many motives and situations that categorize them as two film teachers. <br /> <br /> Part of the Rifif's charm is the colorful characters that surround the story like Tony le Stephano, Jo le Suedois, Mario Farrati, and Cesar le Milan. Most violence is indirect, but actually brutal. The main characters led by Tony le Stephano follow a strong obsolete code of remembrance that resembles Sam Peckinpat and John Woo. Jean Servais gets Tony le Stephanois' role in his cynical outlook and tired look. Du Rififi Chez Les Hommes / Rififi (1955) became my favorite when I saw it on the big screen from start to finish.
