Since 1942, the character of Sherlock Holmes, which was portrayed by Basil Rathbone, was now "modern" in Britain. Many Holmes purists have praised the first two entries of the series (produced by FOX) but rejected the following 12 features. I was never an avid reader for one, so I appreciate the movies as they are without the initial bias. In fact, World War II puts its entry into this period with all British propaganda in the film. Modern Holmes performance is treated much more cautiously than the previous entry (Sherlock Holmes and Terror Voice) and fares are much better for two reasons. First of all, Roy William is on Neil's way (and it would be for the rest of the series), and secondly, while Holmes is against the Nazis, the involvement of Professor Moriarty feels like it is a battle between the two rivals. . Many have been criticized by Lionel Atwill for being inferior to George Zucco and Henry Daniel, but I feel that this would be more of a script than an interpretation of character. Especially since Atwill was very capable of being more diverse and enthusiastic in other horror roles. By contrast, Basil Rathbone is extraordinary. She seems to enjoy herself as Holmes, but that's why I'm blaming you for writing. For example: Introducing Holmes in Terror Voice is an attempt to determine immediately how fabulously intelligent Holmes is as soon as he is on the screen, while this movie shows Holmes' great deductions, as well as his shortcomings. Even at the peak, Holmes is at first the upper hand, but his blood is slowly drained from his body. Now there are some mistakes in this movie that I thought I could mention. First opening; Do Germans cheat too easily? Maybe she just me, but the book seller just hurts the bar, says she gets Tobel not only to hide her door after a week, but let her come in and then go with her for a walk? What !? Secondly, Tobel seems to put everything around him at risk. Leaving secret parts of the bomb with genius scientists. Leave a note to your fianc√©e. Like what he thought? He threatened them all. I thought he was a great scientist trying to save England? And is not the whole term "use them before they use us" a little harsh. Obvious propaganda. Third, how would God's name be Holmes to fit the bottom of this front? It's really small! In fact, finding Holmes, which found Moriarty in ex-con disguise, doesn't really explain it. I've seen this movie more than fifty times, and there are still such parts that I find to be very confused. Fourth, okay, Holmes discovers that the first three scientists are dead, and immediately assumes that Moriarty didn't know the fourth person's name because he was not dead yet. Well, if Holmes didn't know the name, how could he expect it? The boy can be very well below the lake. Good luck. Fifth, again, confusion. When Holmes died at Moriarty's operating table, how can he recover so quickly? He was sure he would lose a few pints of blood, but not enough to save him a day. Despite these mistakes, it is a very fun movie. The masquerades are well done, the mystery of the dancing men is well done (especially the back scenes of Holmes and Moriarty, each of which sees them over-analyzing) and Dennis Hoey as the inspector of Lestrade is always a plus. And the last note, the query scene still bothering me, I've always thought it was one of the best made sequences in the entire movie. In general, this film has a special place with me because it was the one that secured my Rathbone as Holmes obsession. Classic. 7/10
