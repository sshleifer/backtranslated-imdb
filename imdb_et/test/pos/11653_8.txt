It's the most human and human film I've seen for a long time. There are plenty of railways, Susan Sarandon as a nun, Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon in a movie that doesn't talk but doesn't condemn. It's the best in cinema blood, but the story is fictional about a number of real events. <br /> <br /> Which one is more amazing, Sarandon or Penn? It's easy to say who's more comfortable, but it's hard to say who's more convincing. they're just great. <br /> <br /> You may think that all killers should be killed or you can claim that life without a password has no life and that death is more merciful. Whatever your personal feeling, this film gives you the opportunity to stop and review. <br /> <br /> Finally, one just wants to sit quietly and think. This is what the great drama does, it gives catharsis, creates a moment, a shared memory that touches our humanity.
