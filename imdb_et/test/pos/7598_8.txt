After seeing this movie, I realized that Drew Barrymore is a great actor. This film would not have been traceable without Drew. The fact that someone is as attractive as Drew can actually get me out and he did when he was "Josie Grossie". His attempts to "transition" as cool girls called it fun, especially when he tried to dance in a nightclub. best friend. One of the funniest scenes in the film was Anita, who tried to teach class sex. It was one of Mollys's most funny shows and the best. <br /> <br /> Leelee Sobieski was also a big part and I knew him very much because I know people like him were tortured. /> This movie is for Drew Barrymore fans because Drew is making a movie.
