On Monday, this week, sometimes in July, I was under the influence of a sweet leaf and I was a spooky fan, wanted to see something frightening. I was thinking of Ammityville's horror 2, but I got something better. I was at a friend's house and had VHS Evil Ed. No cover or anything, he didn't even see the whole thing himself, but he told me it was "A man who goes crazy and kills a lot of people." Well, this movie was very shocking, I've never seen the sad brutal nature of sadistic violence until that movie, both Ted Bundy and Ed Gein! It's also pretty funny, referring to the Evil Dead trilogy (and plus Evil Dead 2 poster everywhere in the movie!) The film is about an obsessive-compulsive nice guy who happens to be a movie editor. He is then borrowed to another department of the building and sent to the positive but violent world of Sam Campbell, Splatter and Gore. Sam Campbell, Eddy's new boss, tells Edd about the great breakthroughs of his films, the terrible loaths, and he needs Edd to make the film somewhat more violent so that they can be shown across Europe. Soon, Eddy will be unfortunate because the pictures and scenes displayed to him by a lonely suburban house will be sent to work, and then what's going on will be really horrible. Imagine yourself! Action is great, overflowing is a little funny (Sam Campbell's voice is often funny, the same with other participants). But the work of overdose was pretty good, I give this film the 10/10 and it's a good introduction to Gore's Horror. Very good, spooky, bloody ....... You have to see it yourself. <br /> <br /> quote from the movie: "Where is f ** k rape my Beaver?"
