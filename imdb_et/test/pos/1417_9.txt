Stephen Hawkings is a genius. He is the king of geniuses. Watching this movie makes me feel. But it's a great movie. Not very fun, but very interesting. The film centers surrounding the wheelchair tied Stephen Hawkings, who makes Einstein's middle, and his theories and scientific discoveries about the universe, time, galaxy, and black holes. Anyone who, at some time or another, at a really high altitude, reaches the moment they think they got the universe and the cosmos thought out and they swear as soon as they dig, they all write down. Well here is the guy who actually felt this feeling for more than six hours. Here is a man who, despite the suffering of Lou Gehrig's disease, has become the greatest in the world. Look at it and listen to how it has formulated the theories of black holes. Awesome. You can't see it the same after that.
