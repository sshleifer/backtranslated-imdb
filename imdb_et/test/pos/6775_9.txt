Absurd art is lively and successful in the current cinema in Denmark! Well, at least that's in the movie. No one in this movie is amused. They're all upset or shocked, and if they're not, they're coming soon! This is the story of screws, murders, embarrassment, dignity and finally love and redemption. Cooling, uncomfortable humorous style is idiomatic and not like everyone, but personally I found that I have the right and interesting confusion about strange and absurd. Distant characters would be unfortunate even if you don't like them close and personal. But their story is so tragic that you find it for yourself to forgive them and be happy, even when they leave with murder. <br /> <br /> This is definitely the best Danish movie in recent years. <br /> <br /> 9 out of ten.
