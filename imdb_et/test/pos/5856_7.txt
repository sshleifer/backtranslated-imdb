Now, I know that Sandra Bullock produced this film, but she has to learn that sometimes it is necessary to make some sacrifices to pass on the story ... like not trying to make the whole movie about her character! <br /> <br /> The story is about two high school students (one rich and popular, the other smart and antisocial) who formulate a murder plan and follow this number ... just to see if they can go away with it . Enter Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin as a detective who is trying to solve the problem. The boys have planted evidence, created an alibis and cleaned themselves so well that the police are falling for the whole act. But Sandra feels that everything is not as it seems. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been a very small Hitchcock-style thriller, but the film spends too much time on feeling Sandra's character rather than focusing on real crime. You see, something happened in his past that worships him all over the film. And we'll find out about it ... ALL about it. It will become quite annoying after a while, especially if you are right in the midst of an intriguing investigation of the murder and then you have to stop this investigation to hear what happened to it in the past. <br /> <br /> Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are the real winners of this movie. They play their characters convincingly and with just the right amount of mischief. If the script had spent more time focusing on the characters and keeping the detectors there just to do its job, it would have been a tremendous fun thriller. As it is, most of the excitement disappears. They should have cut all of Sandra's character and make it a separate movie on the Lifetime channel. But I ground. However, it is still a fun movie. I recommend this movie ... but wait for video / DVD.
