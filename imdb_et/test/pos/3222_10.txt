Obsessed !!!!! I have every season of Gilmore Girls and I think the reason I love it is because the script is smart, it's not your average comedy with no break after the joke that it just continues if you missed it it stayed. And it doesn't like the drama of soap opera because it doesn't use dramatic music and the actors never see such fools. I think Gilmore Girls is one of the best shows in T.V. Its fun because they talk so fast that you won't get everything the first time it's nice to go back and laugh with other jokes. They also have so many references to their amazing how smart it is. <br /> <br /> And you can touch the characters with both the real and those who are great from the funny Lorelai to the hermit Luke until the immature Kirk the show is just amazing. I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to spend a good time and spend time with my family, this is definitely a play for them. There is only one word that describes Gilmore Girls .... CLASSIC !!!!!!
