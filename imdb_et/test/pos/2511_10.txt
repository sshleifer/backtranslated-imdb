I don't usually like romantic movies, but I love this movie very much. The story is really touching and the end is very appropriate. I feel I take care of this movie for many stars. I feel I feel my feelings. While most romantic movies always make me leave and get bored, it makes me completely involved, starting with the Capshawi scene running along the beach to Scott until the end. I want to rate this movie out of 10 out of 10 because I want to finish another point. The working part is very strong. Kate Capshawil is a great way to show off her talent. Although Scott has not impressed "Dead Man on Campus", this film completely changes my perspective. He is so irresistibly charming here. Geraldine McEwan is as terrible as ever. <br /> <br /> This movie may not be as good, complicated, deep or plausible as other movies that deal with a bit of a relationship like "L" ecole de la chair or "Post coitum, animal triste", but "The Love Letter" can still be proud, because it rarely produces a different light for such a relationship. And this difference makes this movie extremely enjoyable. Being ambitious and based on the little stars Dreamworks, this is my dream this time.
