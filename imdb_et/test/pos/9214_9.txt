I have to admit that I'm a fan of the 80's cartoons, but that's one of the best. Rainbow Brite and Star Stealer are one of the most traceable and fun of the Rainbow Brite cartoons and are much better than the TV series. I especially like the relationship between Rainbow and Dariani and find it very amusing. However, my favorite character is Starlite, who is definitely the "great horse" of the universe! <br /> <br /> I also recommend Rainbow Brite: New Beginnings, which tells the story of Rainbowland. Do you have a Rainbow Day!
