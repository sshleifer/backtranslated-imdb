I don't think of any film that better understands the concept of grace in theological sense. The little congregation's good intentions of religion, which have gone after the death of the leaders, robbes them of what they proclaim: grace. The precious gift of the humble culinary gene in Paris returns their call to love one another and lowers the aging society it wastes. OPTIONS are the central theme and grace. At the same time, an artistic gift that has a powerful, transcendental role in everyday life and in the future is recognized. Impossible to repair or ignore. This is a life-changing film for those who hear the message.
