When the film "The Cure" begins, we will find out the young man Erik (Brad Renfro). Erik is a teenage boy living with a paranoid mother who lives next door to Dexter (Joseph Mazello). One day Erik and Dexter connect and direct to supermarkets, where Dexter gets its first Butterfinger taste. When Erik learns that Dexter has AIDS, he is trying to make tea and water with better water. But when the National Enquirer's front panel says the New Orleans doctor has found AIDS, these two boys don't need to treat New Orleans. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, "Cure" is easily one of the best friendship films ever made. It shows unconditional love between the boy, his (best) best friend and his best friend's mother. Everything is so well done, nothing needs to be changed. Not only does it give me a fantastic movie of friendship, it is also a sad but humorous and fun AIDS movie. And the tragic finale of Dexter's AIDS contraction is enough to make me tear. Very well done.
