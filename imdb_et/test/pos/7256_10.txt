Plunkett & Macleane belongs to my favorite film genre (historical adventure with comedy), which is probably why I appreciate it so much. who gets into her and her schemes (Macleane). It brings with it all kinds of escapades and adventures, all shaded by comedy. Of course, this is also an interest in love. The rest of the cast consists of many living, larger life signs that add the film to the atmosphere and show the excess abundant at present. <br /> <br /> This is an enjoyable movie with a pretty simple but valuable plot that offers a lot of entertainment.
