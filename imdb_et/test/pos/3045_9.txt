I saw this movie for the first time when I was in the eighth grade and I remember that it was deeply affecting me. I saw again about a year ago (I'm now 29) and he still moved me like that. This is a great film that personalizes the struggle for "principle and prism". The character of Voight is an idealistic teacher who does not give any superintendent, Skeffington, pisedo-racist tendency. This story also personalizes the struggle of how older people often face change and more specifically cultural change. Often at the expense of children. When these battles finally arrive, Pat Conroy loses and pragmatism prevails. Or is it? The children he has to leave are better to feel him, to be more in touch with the "real" world and classical music. Another school teacher honored her and learned a lot about herself. A big movie with a burst of heart. I recommend that anyone who enjoyed the movie read Pat Conroy's book "Water is Wide". It will stay with you!
