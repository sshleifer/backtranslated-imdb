Lifeforce is definitely one of Tobe's best films. It has some great special effects and a lot of nudity, so it looks like it is a typical horrorist's dream. The film, however, is creative and I think it is because of the script by Dan O'Bannon and Don Jakoby. Nice cinematography and a good scary atmosphere make it a solid film.
