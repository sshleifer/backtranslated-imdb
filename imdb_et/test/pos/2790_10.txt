My favorite movie this year. Large characters and plot, direction and editing were smooth, visually beautiful and interesting. <br /> <br /> The film set in Barcelona follows the lives of six foreign graduate students for years and chooses others. Cultures and languages ​​break down, but the hearts and lives are intertwined. He would never have played a leading role in Hollywood, but he did a great part of it. The characters were well developed and their combined effect was honest and accurate. There were two particularly remarkable scenes, the climax was truly inspired. The film is sentimental and the last ten minutes could have been cut, but it was wonderful. <br /> <br /> I almost didn't look at it, but I only saw Audrey Tautou. His role, albeit settled at the second or third level, was small and was characterized by several other characters. I want to make more of these movies. It reminded The Big Chill or The Breakfast Club. Don't start this movie late if you plan to sleep 1/2.
