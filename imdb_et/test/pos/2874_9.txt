Watch No Evil is the first movie on WWE movies. Yes WWE, Word wrestling entertainment, pro-wrestling. Of course, this is a WWE movie that the wrestler has to play in it, the wrestler is Glenn Jacobs or Kane. What's not really important, if you didn't know about Kane or what WWE stood for you, you never know that it had something to do with the wild, wrestling, because the film has nothing to do with wrestling. See No Evil is a movie of fear that is common, it's a few moments when some people can jump, but most often it's just saying hey see how we can get gross! Not that there's something wrong with it. Jacob Goodnight (played by Kane) is a kind of Jason-like character, his mother tortured her as a narrow (undervalued) child with Christian beliefs and is distorted. Now he's a big scary cutting machine. 90% of the film takes place in an abandoned hotel where Jacob hides six teenagers (surprised?) And a handful of adults. I could explain why they are horrible in an old hotel, but do they care? Despite the lack of originality, see No Evil is well done because of what it should be. Kane plays an awesome killer and needs little to be scary. One film error is the most annoying thing people will survive, I really look forward to killing them terribly, but unfortunately it won't happen. I wish the film had no stigma attached to it, although, as I said, there is no wrestling in the film, people are still closed enough not to see it, because if they are wrestling, anger. Then the film can also make money because wrestling fans want to see it. Either way, see No Evil has top-notch effects and little CGI, and as I said, it's pretty brutal as I say it's a good thing .... if you like this thing.
