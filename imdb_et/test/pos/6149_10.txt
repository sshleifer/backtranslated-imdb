I do not agree with the syndicate of imdb.com that it is about a bisexual man who is preparing to marry. It is more of all that we pass through - with ourselves and our parents - that we must overcome when we grow up. As Linda McCarriston's poem says, "Childhood is the barrel that they will drop you." This film is rather a narrative poem. It is the life and mistakes we make and hurt we cause and experience over the years, and how it is ultimately love (I don't want to be hyper sensitive or schmoopy) and find and be one special person.
