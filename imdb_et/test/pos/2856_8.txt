Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) lives her life through a soap opera "Reason to Love" to slip away from her husband and eternal life. After a shocking incident involving two hit men (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), Betty goes to shock and travels to LA, believing she is forced to marry the main character of the show (Greg Kinnear). <br /> <br /> Nurse Betty is this rare thing, a lesser-known movie with all the stars and a fluffy Rom-Com plot that surprises you with a terrible script and action on the ground. Indeed, such a plot makes one R-rating questionable, but it is all justified. The shocking incident that sends Betty to the edge is too graphic compared to the light, an entertaining comedy that comes and feels like something else in the film, but at the same time it is necessary to believe in Betty's transformation If we go with Betty on her journey, the director Neil LaBute works somewhat with an extraordinary magic that makes the film unique and high in its bog standard comedy. An example of this would be Betty's first meeting with her breaking. She pours her heart and plays together, thinking she's looking at a part of the show. Even if we know the ridiculous nature of Betty's ramblings, music swells when he speaks, giving us, the audience, the emotional perspective of Betty. We almost believe what he says, but we understand that his mind is broken. When other filmmakers try to emphasize the ridiculousness of the situation to bring out every ounce of possible comedy from the scene, LaBute is sensitive to his main character and treats him with supreme sympathy and understanding. <br /> <br /> The resurrection between the men captured by Freeman and Rock is invaluable, a great scripting doling through a smart line where they rake. Especially, Freeman is always very good when he falls in love with his character slowly and blindly, loves his Betty Idea, not even knowing who he is or what happened to him. Aaron Eckhart once again shows that Betty is not a grateful spouse and is almost unknown. Another revelation here is Kinnear, whose depiction of the soap star is not too hot. There is a tendency to place the fame on the fresh clich√© as thick as possible, and Kinnear, on the contrary, is simply pompous, but restrained by self-importance, rather than just being a soap dish. <br /> <br /> The soap opera has been realized so well, it can almost exist. LaBute and hit this nail and good. Had the soap opera been too satirical, much of the film would not have worked. To make "Life Days", this friend would have seen this movie wrong. Commitment to detail pays off because the style and feel of the soap opera is becoming more and more bleeding into Betty's reality while following the genre's general inadvertent comic. The scenes in the kit feel real, unlike movies where the atmosphere is so made that you don't know why people who live in it don't get it right. <br /> <br /> The final act, while predictable, is completely satisfactory. It is a shame that, following LaBute's direction towards this wonderful film, the mainstream came, calling for him to lead Wicker Man's infamous remake, a good example of a man who is completely given the material given to him. Unfortunately, he cannot be released from all responsibility. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen Nurse Betty, it's something of a discovery. If you have, you should visit again. There is a gentle sister to Betty, which is infectious, even if it doesn't leave you much to think about after that. Hidden pearl however.
