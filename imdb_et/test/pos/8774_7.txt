In general, it is an entertaining and strange film. Don't try to figure it out. Nature has more holes than a computer could keep up, but Robert Cummings and the lesser signs are mostly fun to watch in this "Fugitive" -like story. <br /> <br /> Unlike the popular TV show and then the 1993 film, this refugee is not looking for a man with one weapon, but with two armed Nazi saboteurs called "Frank Fry". Cummings ("Barry Kane") is accused of defending a defensive factory in Los Angeles and continuing looking for a man who did it (Fry) to delete his name. <br /> <br /> The first 40 minutes or so are very tense and interesting. Then the story of Priscilla Lane ("Pat Martin") enters and it starts to be a little bit striking. Director Alfred Hitchcock often did this for his female characters until I knew if she had a clue how she spoke. The character of Lane was a bit flat here. <br /> <br /> In fact, Otto Kruger ("Charles Tobin") and Norman Lloyd ("Frank Fry") played the best-known crooks. .. just exciting. Kruger's action and dialogue window was particularly good. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie, but you saw Hitchcock known as "North By Northwest," you will end and enjoy it. Instead of the climatic scene on Mount Rushmore, here in the state of the Republic is memorable every 10 minutes. As usual, the corners of the Hitchcock camera are big and fun.
