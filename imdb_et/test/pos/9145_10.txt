Soul's Midnight stars Armande Assante (Simon), who looked at "The Mambo Kings" and Elizabeth Bennett (Alicia Milford). With Sexy Vampire vixen, Lucila Sola (Iris), Simon attracts her pregnant Alicante and her husband Charles Soul's Midnight world. Assante sucks his fangs in the script of writers Brian and Jason Cleveland and you enjoy him and killing Iris. Alicia and Charles (Robert Floyd) are trying to stay alive while gore keeps their lust for blood. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler Warning) In today's jaded landscape, it is not surprising that an upside down preacher can bite. Set it down cool? The Borgo Hotel has many details and endless special effects. I watched this movie very fun? it does not take itself too seriously and looks good.
