This is my favorite kung fu movie. It has a very authentic taste, tasted by a terrific musical score (traditional Chinese instruments, I think) and some wonderfully superfluous melodramatic moments that are in contrast to heavily influenced comedy. Indeed, when they tried to create their own "Western" (ie Cowboy movie) genre, the Chinese made a completely new animal, characterized by kung fu fighting and associated sound effects. <br /> <br /> Five Fingers Story Death is easy, the story of revenge (killing a loved one) and the main character's attempt to manage the Iron Fist technique, which allows him to make his enemies holy revenge. It is even interesting to love, though uncomfortable and polite (found in films from most of the Chinese ages). However, the end result is big and much more authentic than any Bruce Lee movie.
