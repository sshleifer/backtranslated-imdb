Chuck Jones 'Rabbit Seasoning', another much loved trilogy of hunting, is often considered to be the top three. Although I find it almost impossible to choose between this fantastic trio of cartoons, I should admit that "rabbit seasoning" is the finest silver script. Here, emphasis is placed on language, as Bugs and Daffy run a series of complex dialogues in Abbot's and Costello's "Who's Next" routine. As a long-time fan of Daffy, I have always been delighted by hunting trilogy because it is consistently Daffy, who gets all the best lines (the famous "Pronoun problem", one of the all-time classics) and most of the work. Bugs play cool manipulators while Elmer, as always, is a mirrored dupe. Part of what makes hunting trilogy so much fun is that Daffy and Elmer are so little threat to Bugs that he is basically just a setback and easily laughs. Elmer gets into every trap put on him, but it's the poor old Daffy who is the worst, shooting his face over and over again, his beak ends in more and more ridiculous places. It's all based on the inevitable climate talks, "You're despicable." As a complicated example of the perfect time of Chuck Jones, when you come across, Rabbit Seasoning is a real classic.
