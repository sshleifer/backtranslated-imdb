Wagonmaster viewing is unlikely to cause deep thoughts, unlike many other big Ford movies such as "The Searchers", "My Darling Clementine", "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" and "The Wrath of the Wrath", but it is likely to create a sense of awe and deep satisfaction . The story is very simple: two cowboys decide to help a wagon on the Mormon train to California. Along the way, they get in touch with the medication whose mules ran away, a group of bank robbers and some in Navajo. There is a lot of adventure and excitement on the track and the movie is fun and beautiful. Music is absolutely beautiful. The landscape, again in the Monument Valley, is as beautiful as ever. And how can James go wrong with Arness? Wagonmaster may not be one of John Ford's best-known movies, but it's a must-see if you get that chance. 9/10
