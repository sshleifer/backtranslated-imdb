It was the first leading job of Sebastian Gutierrez, magic and Gothic snakes. Anyone who has read my comments knows that I love capers and it was cozy. The kidnapping and the woman were kidnapped in the process. The FBI has a case of robbery Emma Thompson and police chief (Roscoe Lee Browne) assigns Alan Rickman to the murder that happens as a spouse of Senator (Hal Holbrook). These two form an excellent pair when they work together. <br /> <br /> Robbers / murderers have loved Simon Baker (the Land of the Dead) and the ultra-hot Carla Gugino (Sin City) with a couple of partners. . They robbed the hotshot computer puzzle and they run their accountant across the city before they get the dough. Things go quickly from there when new revolutions come in. The whole thing is brilliant and definitely "pee in your pants because you can't go to the bathroom or forget something". To be absolutely honest, I would have given this film 10 if there were more movies that you looked at when opening a security guard. I would have loved seeing more Beverly Hotsprings and Yvette Lerat, but hey, it wasn't part of the caper; Thompson and Rickman should definitely make more movies together. One Cure: <br /> <br /> Agent Hawkins: So fill me up. Detective Friedman: This remark may be misunderstood for sexual harassment, agent Hawkins. Agent Hawkins: Let's get it out: you never worked in front of a female boss. I came where I was pushing paper and playing nice - I've never fired a weapon before, I'm just in that job to prove to my dad that I'm not a coward. I give a decent head, so I got promoted to all worthy candidates who were all men, all equally talented, but there was a gender quota. I'm also stupid and idealistic; you are hard and cynical and usually right. I love you secretly, but I find it hard to show. Did I miss something? <br /> <br /> Hell, it's a great dialogue! Gutierrez not only manages a big movie, but can also write! <br /> <br /> And did I say Carla Gugino was hot? <br /> <br /> Put it on your list.
