A beautiful, magical, thought-provoking and heart-warming story. Great direction, perfect cast, great script, great score, beautifully lit ...... do I need to say more? <br /> <br /> If you love movies that not only think but also warm your heart (some of it is spring to remember, "Contact", "Field of Dreams", and "Earth Day"), then you are sure you love K-PAX. <br /> <br /> Most Recommended.
