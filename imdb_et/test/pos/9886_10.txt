I saw the premiere of this film at the 2005 Phoenix Film Festival and was impressed by the skilful leader Jeff Hare, who demonstrated this timely theme. Seeing the characters is remarkable and allowed us to explore the question of parents who want to die under their own conditions in a very warm and humorous way. Peter Falk was brilliant because Morris and a group of family members and friends were perfectly cast in their roles. The interaction of family, friends, and outsiders with Morris gave a realistic insight into how families deal with the problem of parents' aging and their desire to die dignified. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is seemingly a movie of Jewish actress and her family is really a movie of all families. Family jokes and Morris gaps in this "nature" life are fresh and realistic. The rivalry of childhood, the advancements and failures of adults and the hope for children are an integral part of this scenario. While many doubt how you commit suicide "humorous", I thought the treatment was logical and timely. If you are not afraid of a few tears or laughing with a family fighting this problem, you must see this movie. <br /> <br /> The film was awarded "Best Picture" on the Phoenix Film Festival.
