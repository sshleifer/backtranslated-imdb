An excellent introspective / interpersonal piece that really had some teeth without feeling hopeless or worse, manipulative and artificially joyful. There may also be a good double function with American Beauty. To date, the best results I've seen from Anita Mui, and all the actors in it seem to be a source of strength. Hats for Ann Hui and Ivy Hoi for a great script. Seriously one of the best dramas I've ever seen, especially if you have a taste of classical literature in ALA poetry. Again, great.
