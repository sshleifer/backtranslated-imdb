"Fire on the Line" is one of the best thrillers I've seen, builds and builds a great climax. This movie will draw you into beating in your heart and you are not a soul of action. Molded turns are strong, especially Clint Eastwood and John Malkovich. This film is directed by expert master Wolfgang Petersen. Thrillers don't get much better than that, don't miss it.
