Even if it is not labeled as Slasher's flick, it has all the elements. The fact that slashers are known for their low budget, flat plot, cheesy effects and everything that can be added does not mean that there can be good movies. "Opera" performs the description. Even if it is part of an Italian giallost; Dario Argento proves that he deserves one of Horror's best directors. "Opera" is one of the most stylish Horror movies in the last 30 years. While the film takes place in a beautiful shinning place; The situation and gore make it one of the most frightening places ever used in the horror film. <br /> <br /> I think Opera is a stylish Slasher, although it has a thorough plot and character. The cheese factor commonly used in most Slasher staples is not here, but in return we got a stopping, visually stunning gore. The film's plot is simple (as in any Slasher). There is a psycho in the opera that is somewhat of a real actor / singer with real estate, and forcing him to look at terrible deaths. The scenes of death are extremely tough and the best with the film. The infamous "dead" death scene is, in my opinion, a highlighted film. This is a terrible death scene that no one else except Argento could get. A knife through the neck (and mouth) is another terrible scene, but less violent than the death of scissors. Opera "gore" enjoys lovers of violence and violence. <br /> <br /> What I did not like about the film is the lack of coherence or logic. I mean, after the first death observation, the leading female was reassured if nothing happened to be able to go home and not do much of what she saw. He is also alone at home and does not take security measures. Still, the relationship between the film makes us forget the lack of logic. Argento knows how to create tension and how to intimidate the subconscious. For example, when a friend of Betty tells him that someone looks at him from outside, he speaks and skips when something happens. <br /> <br /> The film's direction is great. It is great for Italian giallo. Argento's creative POV pictures are impressive. Stones were also added to the film with a horrible feeling. Argento adds its unique spice. <br /> <br /> Opera is one of the most underrated, but popular among the Horror community: - peep-hole-death scene (brilliant) - attacks are finally attacked - opera - knife through neck and mouth - heavy metal score with opera music (this music has never blurred me before) - killer wild <br /> <br /> The only thing I do not like "Opera" is heavy metal songs used in death scenes. It is OK to disturb the audience, but I think Opera's music could have brought some excitement. However, the "shocking" use of heavy metals in the film is a unique disturbing aspect. <br /> <br /> Watch "Opera" even if you don't like gore. There are many tensions and tensions that could scare a more skeptical person. It's not "Suspiria", but it is worth Argento's best.
