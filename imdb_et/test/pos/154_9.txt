Not intended. I'm not breaking anything about this story, but it's safe to assume that you already know what character the main actor is. And of course, being a priest, being "naughty", exaggerates it all. Plus it's the most erotic movie from Park Chan Wook. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Wook's previous works / movies, he's very visual (good way) and it will show you here again. Although he is obscured by the revenge of his earlier films, it is still quite hidden. And when it boils, a lot of bad things are going to happen. But through all this darkness, there were also moments of light (fun). A very stylish and provocative film that lives outside the mainstream and does a great job ...
