A truly wonderful look at the world and the reality as heroin addicts. The film is the one that hits home too close to those involved in drug culture and who has the knowledge of what is (or is) a heroin addict actually. A good movie that has never expired. The great performances and minimalist outfits of all involved are the preminger way to show how the JUNKIE world can change. It is worth looking at - different types of education. The golden hand is concerned to see the pain that junkie lives.
