Even if I had never seen or heard of Georgetown, CO, it would be a small little movie. But my father was born and raised there, and these are my uncle's horses you see, pulling a comb! So this movie is very special to me. Many interiors are captured by buildings and houses that I feel and are very realistic. The story is a bit of a hockey, but Georgetown is such a magical place where things could happen. John Denver was a better actor than many people gave him credit. Mary Wickes plays with such "smart ladies who have a lot of sass" she played in so many other films, especially "White Christmas". Usually I can't go there in the winter so I like to see this movie during Christmas so "river me over" to the next trip!
