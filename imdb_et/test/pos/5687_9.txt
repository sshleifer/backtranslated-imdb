The purpose of this movie is to do something very specific, as well as not doing certain things. In short, it has a certain predetermined trajectory - to deal with death (very few choices and all the bad ones) as a serious and realistic, not accidental or amusing idea. In seeking this realism, he has given up certain conventions, such as the obvious arches and hooks of character. It is not so much a character as a human being. Don't forget what the actors would do ... what would you do in your situation? <br /> <br /> Open water can be the beginning of this movie, but it goes a lot further. Unlike this movie, the audience does not end up turning to the end when you find there are no sharks at all. It has a real monster, not just a monster idea and not just an animated stand. They also have fine production prices, considering what these very resourceful filmmakers had to work with. And again, unlike this other film, this climax has some inspiring and brilliant action. Let us not forget whether we say "dazzling", the existence of the screen of the youngest star. He may be quite a discovery.
