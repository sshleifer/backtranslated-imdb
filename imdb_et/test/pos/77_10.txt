Julie Andrews plays German Spy, who loves American pilot Rock Hudson while being in Germany. <br /> <br /> The songs are beautiful. These two are well connected. Julie shows a more temperamental side in the film than a nice girl she usually plays. <br /> <br /> A half-German, half-English girl singing beautiful and entertaining World War I forces, Julie sings some loving Mancini songs. <br /> <br /> I loved the movie. Some say it is a "chick-flick" but what then. It's wonderful. <br /> <br /> Supporting characters are somewhat stereotypical. It may not be up to Rock's performance pillow Talk, Magnificent Obsession or Giant. <br /> <br /> Blake Edwards released a movie in Ireland and used authentic WW I aircraft in the car. The landscape of England and France is absolutely proud.
