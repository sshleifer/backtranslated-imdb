It may not be 10 out of 10, but for me the jokes were unsuccessful. I've seen it many times when I was younger and I believe on DVD again, and I smiled every time. Humor is simple and fun, this movie was just one of many small pieces. I found parts where people saw invisible people from the invisible loop. These expressions were invaluable The big movie, if there is a chance to ever see it, I suggest to see it in a good fashion laugh. My favorite character in all Dexter series should definitely be Dean Higgins, I love his voice and hear him upset, especially when he saw his expression at the end was just pure hysterical for me.
