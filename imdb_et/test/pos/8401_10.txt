My God, this was a fantastic movie. Every time we look, we go to another WOW site. Rhett & Scarlett played great with Joanne & Timothy. They did a fantastic job of looking at the roles of our two favorite sites. Everything! It's a must see ..... Don't take this movie away. If u loved the wind, you will love this mini-series. Go Rhett !!! Go Scarllett !!!
