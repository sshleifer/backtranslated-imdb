In the 1960s, this gloomy study by a young proletarian woman, Joyi, was an introduction to Ken Loach's career as one of the most outstanding and respected British filmmakers of all time. By that time, I knew very little about Brecht, politics or under-represented reality, and I was very impressed with the aesthetics of the film, its free style, the oyster color and Joy's monologues in front of the camera. I was also surprised that Terence Stamp (who had become a celebrity thanks to "Billy Budd", "The Collector" and "Modesty Blaise") was so little on the screen. Though the 20th century Fox distributed Panama's poorer cow, Loach was not left in the mainstream cinema (hardly this film) and I lost contact with my films. I just heard his success, "Who", "Family Life", "Black Jack". until I arrived in the 80s. By the way, Donovan's beautiful title song is available in his anthology "Troubadour".
