I saw this film twice at the Transilvania International Film Festival (TIFF), the film is in the competition and I hope Esteban Sapir will receive one prize (at least the best picture prize). As a quiet cinematographer, I am interested in contemporary movies that cite or re-create the spring cinema language. Previous Reviewer Fritz Lang and Fr. W. Murnau. As I see it, the film refers directly to Lang's metropolis and to the allegorical-parabolic character of his plot. But I didn't see Murnaut in that. There is even more obvious Melies tribute: Moon (here with cigar smoking) on ​​the face of the human being, with paper, painted mountains and urban landscapes. I enjoyed the movie mostly for my visuals, and in the meantime, I found a very interesting story about reciprocity and creative communication tools used by the noisy city residents. From this point of view, this film is a unique reflection on the side of the silent cinema, because in silent films it is hardly possible to find silent characters. In this case, one might ask whether the stories of the stolen voices were motivated by the silent form of the film, or whether it is planned to play silent films on a reciprocal basis. Another example of the reflection I found in Guy Maddin's Careful, where mountain village residents have restrictions on their use of votes. I am going to write this on paper if you know the movies related to this topic, please let me know !!! <br /> <br /> I recommend Esteban Sapir to every filmmaker (one of the critics' name: the gem of the festival). <br /> <br /> PS: Winners were announced and the film won the prize for best cinematography!
