Many people give this movie a lot of nonsense and all this is really undesirable. People give this film a hard time either because it is such a sick subject or when they look at some of the technical aspects of the film that no one else is watching when they watch it. If, just looking at the cover, you think this film will make you uncomfortable ... DON'T SEE IT! However, you should exclude one of the best cinematographic experiences in the late 1990s, no matter what someone else says. <br /> <br /> Dee Snider is wonderful here, as Captain Howdy, the depth of madness to play this character must be beyond words and be much farther than any of us should be ready to go. Working here is wonderful. The film itself was beautifully shot. For many, it can be swallowed too much, but it's still worth your time. If you haven't seen this movie, check it out.
