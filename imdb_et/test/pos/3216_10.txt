honestly. this exhibition warms my heart, I look at it every day in the fox family, and now that the new season has started, I am more than before. The characters are so well developed and their relationships are so real and their relationships are so real. would recommend this example for every woman or mother and daughter. Lorelei is a super-fast-paced, spirited girl who truly inspires you and performs historically hysterical and never too serious but serious enough to be totally addicted. it is an hour long, which is great PLUS because you never get enough Gilmore! even after one hour .. Emily and Richard Gilmore are KIKKID (loralie parents, Rory grandparents) who are the average rich parent. Emer's President DAR and Richard are well-known lawyers and Yale alumni. in the footsteps of your grandparents and could not make them happier, of course, Rory's mother is very proud of her, but her whole life has been working for her parents to attack, and when she went to Rory Yale she didn't help her, but believe me, every episode he gets closer;)
