Celebrity appeared in the US a year before birth; I was too young to remember Fame's original version - and I heard and read a lot about it. Such as the fact that he created television series and that his soundtrack was directed by Irene Cara, Giogio Moroder hit, "Celebrity". <br /> <br /> Celebrity was said to be the first of its kind to portray and show the world of performing arts as a feature film. The lives, struggles, barriers that the pupils and some teachers go through themselves were in the eyes of the viewers. <br /> <br /> The performances were great, but especially prominent was Gene Anthony Ray, who played a challenging yet promising Leroy. Angry, frustrated and at first glance rude, his character became more angry and disappointed later, and devoted himself to his studies - not only practical but also theoretical. Irene Cara was good at the Coco scene, where she took off her blouse, while some pervy director was in the movie because she was quite uncomfortable to watch, as well as Paul McCrane with her amazing imagination of a vulnerable but closed homosexual who tried to cope with life while listening to New In York, a performance school when he came out of the army when he told them he was gay. Ralph played by Barry Miller was interesting, but sometimes he got his character on his nerves. <br /> <br /> Choreography was great, some of the good dance numbers were involved and the cafe had a "hot lunch" worth watching. Another great scene that was great was playing the "Fame" song, and all the kids in New York were hurried and dancing wildly and carelessly around the world. It was a street hat like no other. <br /> <br /> The only star that really benefits from this in the long run was, and is, Debbie Allen, who later became a producer, director and star - although she mostly worked behind the scenes at an exhibition like Everybody Hates Chris and Bel Air prince. Later, Paul McCrane continued in the Robocop movie, marked with Peter Weller, where he played the offender and ER as a judicial, unpleasant doctor Roman. <br /> <br /> British director Alan Parker shot it very well, promising performers to dance, act, sing their heart without wanting to disturb and influence their styles. <br /> <br /> Throughout the duration of the movie, we see the different stages that pupils encounter with their 4. years from their hearings to the first year until their completion at the New York Art School. <br /> <br /> Celebrity is one of those films that is designed or targeted at a specific audience who is not necessarily a general film-loving community - it is not necessarily for everyone. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed it all because I have an interest in arts - not as a technical performer because I am not one but someone who appreciates that creativity and artistic expression can be irritated by hard work, dedication and the passion for what their talents do. So, if you are an ambitious dancer, actor, or just someone who is creative, you may be interested in a movie like this, even though Fame's events are something he's at a College of Performing Arts. this is a completely different thing. <br /> <br /> The 2009 release of this movie was released recently and, frankly, it's almost equal. <br /> <br /> As for the original fame, almost 30 years later, though, it is a bit outdated, but it is still a great movie. <br /> <br /> This is not just a classic, but the 80's cult classic, compatible with other 80's dance hits with films such as Footloose and Flashdance, Fame hits the spot. Isn't it a coincidence that all these dance films start with the letter 'F'? <br /> <br /> Tough, touching and intriguing, it's worth watching.
