Surprisingly, the director (Sebastian Gutierrez) was a young Venezuela (28) and bored with so many predictable films, I was pleased that the script shows so many small stories and clues that were spread here and there. With black humor and taste, I steered the tension between the very Boggart Rickman and the very natural but beautiful Thompson. Each band member deserves attention, Gil Bellows is the best. Gugino is remarkable.
