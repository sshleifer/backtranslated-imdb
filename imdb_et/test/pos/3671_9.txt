This little film is hysterical, full of stereotypes of gays, straight, dwarfs, British roads and pubs, American culture, divorce and marriage; he still manages to be sensitive to any surrounding question. Kathy Bates is "amazing" Grace Beasley and as an amazing range character actress, she brings her remarkable comedy talent to justify this somewhat unusual movie as she did in Fried Green Tomato. With the help of other comedy talents like Dan Akroid like Max, his former lawyer husband and the downtown of Chicago and downtown England, the story is just interesting. Jonathan Price plays Victor Fox, a homosexual singer of cabinets, who was murdered by a chicory killer in Chicago. His cheerful Dirk Simpson, played by the stunning Rupert Everett, must surpass Victor's siblings, including Lynn Redgrave, who want to turn their home into a tribute network, and teams with Bates and his dwarf, Maudy Beasley, to find the killer among the homeless in Chicago. <br /> <br /> The whole cast sings in different places and is great. talented Price and Bates. This unlikely story, both funny and strange, is one of the most common films. Julie Andrews, Barry Manlow and Sally Jesse Raphael Cameos should tell you how strange this film is. Strange, funny and out of center but with good looking people who have any difference.
