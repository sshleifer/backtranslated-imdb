*** SPOILERS *** Though the film "They made me a criminal" is nowhere as good as the later John Garfield hero classics like "Body & Soul" in 1947 "Evil Force" in 1948 and his last and very poorly rated " He Ran All The Way "In 1951, it is a film that defined its career from that moment until its premature death on May 21, 1952. young at age 39. <br /> <br /> Garfiled is played by Johnnie Bradfield and Jack Dorney, who has fled the law later, who is innocent of the murder he has accused of being officially dead. Jonnie's Head Doc Ward, Robert "Doc" Gleckler, who died reporter Charles McGee on the drunken victory, John Ridgely, who was going to publicize his fighter Johnnie Bradfield, hides him as a female man and not a drinking mommy boy. Doc Gleckler crushed the bottle of McGee on his head and killed him because Jonnie was almost dead drunk with several women who took his hotel suite. <br /> <br /> Doc was later killed in a car accident with Johnnie's girlfriend Goldie, Ann Sheridan, but Doc burned crisp and Johnnie's watch was wrong with Johnnie. I said his lawyer, Malvin, Robert Strange, who died dead and was buried, took $ 9,50.00 for Johnnie's money he had for this great advice. Malvin said to Johnn that he would take on a new identity and now call himself Jack Dorney and hell from New York; talk of foolish shadows. Johnnie now Jack Dorney rides from New York to Arizona on his way to Rancho Rafferty Date Farmin, where most of the film takes place. <br /> <br /> If John Garfield had no leading role in both Jonnie Bradfield and Jack Dorney's film, it would have long been lost and forgotten. Garfield, who was only 26 years old at the time, brought the best of everyone in the movie. Even the Dead End Kids, dragged by us, can call them Arizona Kids, acting in the hollow of what you would have expected of them, and they became real and sensitive people who were not clustered with clams as in almost all of their films. All this because John Garfield was at the same stage or filming. <br /> <br /> "They made me criminal" is a good story with a secret champion who acts like nothing but does not pay any attention, not just behind bars, but behind an electric chair. Finally, Jack just showed what kind of man he was not fighting with the great struggle and all the opportunities that dramatically win at the last minute, but with four cruel rounds to get his new family found on the farm, including his farm. girl Peggy, Gloria Dickson, to open a gas station with it. <br /> <br /> Giving European champion Gaspar Rutchek, Frank Rigg, his life a fight and getting $ 2,000.00, it's $ 500.00, because Jack showed it to everyone who saw him like "Arizona Kids" to sometimes punch is much bolder and bolder then throwing one. The fact that Jack could have easily stapled, but did not do so to get himself out of the police, like the killer Johnnie Bradfield. But instead, he went so far as to take all that Rutchek would take to help his friends bring out more than all the battles he had won in the boxing ring. <br /> <br /> I didn't find that the end of the movie ended at all, but it just fits the story. Police Morty Phelam, Claude Rains, who came from New York to Arizona for Jack's arrest, had to live with him for years, sending him to an innocent electric chair. We were all told at the beginning of the movie. Why knowing that Jack / Johnnie was guilty of the murder he has accused and is not sure whether he is innocent, does he want to make the same terrible mistake again? I see it just in real life to see why not in the movies.
