Finally !!! A good film made in the history of the most demented serum killer. For those who are less familiar with Ed Gin, he was basically crazy about being abducted and skinned by his victims (most of the horror fans hanged). A stylish period that perfectly reflects Wisconsin's birth rates is just the most atmospheric horror film that still depicts Gein and his terrible killings. Kane Hodder (from Jason's Friday 13th Series) and Michael Berryman (Hills on Eyes I & II) offer chilling options in this series opus that easily leaves the former Gein's aspirations. So far I would say that this is one of the best horror films released this year (Tourist = 0).
