I watched it on television in 1989 and regretted not doing so. I was very intriguing and suspicious. It's amazing when events open up and this man's past is trying to get along with him. <br /> <br /> The exhibition is the primary and the story is exactly what the title claims ... "Fate to twist" ... but no one could live the life that this man was at the beginning of the movie.
