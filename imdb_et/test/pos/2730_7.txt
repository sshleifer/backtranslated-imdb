I have to say it was let. In general, it is great to see how Aparna Sen has dealt with the schizophrenic issue, I am not much aware of it and did not get what it depicted in A Beautiful Mind, and here also her interesting image. <br /> <br /> But the thing that caused me hope was an artificial dialogue and the use of English. It is true that in India a new class has been formed that speaks English even at home, but I'm sure it's not as formal as in the movie. Besides, Waheeda Rehma didn't seem very comfortable with everything in English. Charu's dialogue in the Bihar tone was probably much more realistic and digestible. Another thing around it is the abstract taste that he has tried to give the film. I usually like open-ended movies, but there were lots of open ends here. Its similar cut pieces are connected to make a movie. The film also didn't seem to be a central issue. Certainly, Schizophernia's main line, but with a nurse-sister, mother-daughter mixing, adding a doctor-to-ass relationship, without actually using a brother-in-law relationship with Bose's husband ..... everything was not required and made an audience what he actually tried to portray. <br /> <br /> In general, watches that love off-beat movies must avoid those who simply see movies as entertainment.
