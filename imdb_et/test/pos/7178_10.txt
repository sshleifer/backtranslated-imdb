High intelligence and action movie. In addition to being a strong capsule of the 60's and personality, the film is also a STILL surprise for its forward-thinking topics and a unique presentation of power in the group. William Greaves calls himself an authority. He asks his team members for a movie and a movie and keeps filming. First, two participants, then the team filmed the actors, then the whole set, including bystanders, policemen and finally a homeless man who lived in the bushes for 9 weeks in the central park. <br /> <br /> Greaves edits a movie (thousands of feet) surprisingly with a strong narrative with interesting curves and motivation. Don't expect this movie to be boring. Each team engages in engaging artists and often repeats what the observer is watching. Greaves does well when using multiple synchronized images and other shifting techniques to integrate multiple cameras. <br /> <br /> Finally, a movie is only effective if you are looking for: if you are looking for an abstract artistic film that feeds your self-conscious ego, but who never has a point, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a film that speaks and thinks long after you want honesty and sincerity documented in "reality" and the resulting inevitable transparency, then this is the perfect film.
