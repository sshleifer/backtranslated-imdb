I recommend this as the most successful attempt to make a film about the Soviet war in Afghanistan. And this is a very honest and responsible image from the small details of the uniforms and weapons to the interpersonal, military and central Asian landscapes. In Tajikistan, it has been fired right after the withdrawal of troops in 1989, not in 1985. The Italian star Placido was just the perfect Major Bandura role. Other characters also seemed very naturally, especially always in the drunken club manager :-) The scenario seems to end up being a bit stuck, but it may affect the civil war in Tajikistan, which started right after the filming. The entire film crew sometimes had to flee even under fire. The last scene is a purely "harakiri" behavior and reminded me of the last phrase of a famous samurai movie - "We've won all the battles but lost the war". It can also be a metaphor for the collapse of the USSR - a great country that allows itself to be thrown back by a small offended child.
