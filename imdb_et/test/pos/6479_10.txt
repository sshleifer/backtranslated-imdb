You don't have to be a fan of Notre Dame to enjoy it because I'm not .... but as a football fan in general, it was nice to watch. It makes me almost an Irish fight. If you can't get into the emotions of this movie, smileys, or better, check your pulse better because it's an emotional film with some very touching scenes. <br /> <br /> I loved watching the classic film material early. They then had a lot of natural games with lots of lateral directions. They confused that the film shown with Pat O'Brien showed that he led Knute Rockne and some players like George Gipp (Ronald Reagan). <br /> <br /> Reagan gets pretty good billing in this movie, but his part isn't really that big. O'Brien is the only actor who plays a big role here. The rest - everyone who plays a nice character - contains the name of Gale Page Rockne's wife "Bonnie". Donald Crisp, like Notre Dame's "Father John Callahan;" Albert Bassermann as Professor of Chemistry "Isa Nieuwland" and Reagan, Gippi, perhaps the most talented and famous player of Notre Dame. Neither angle is superfluous. The characters here are all the people you can grab, because there's no crooks. At my last glance, it was interesting to find Johnny Sheffield - Tarzan's son-playing Rockne at the age of seven, and see that one of the players is George Reeves, TV Superman. <br /> <br /> Hollywood has for some reason made very few football movies and little good. This is one of them.
