Anyone who enjoyed the series the first time he / she was first (I hurried home to see it) is now at a certain age so I can only add my comments to those who want a DVD edition to allow us to remember our first transmissions Upgrade before it just becomes a piece of unremembered TV archive history.

March 2009 So finally the DVD is here and congratulations to those who have done it. The picture quality is remarkably good and the performances are as small as the memory thought.

Given that the BBC made a series made by British players in the UK, it is strange that DVD distribution is not available in a 2-seater region (Europe) on DVD and can only be imported from the US and played with modified players. It is unlikely that there will be major rights issues, perhaps the market seemed to be too small, so why wasn't the "free area" released on earth? so everyone can enjoy it?
