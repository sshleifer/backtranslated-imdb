I thought the movie was good, but I want to read the real story "based on the real story" films. Does anyone know the names and locations of real characters on which the film is based? I've done a full Internet search and can't find any information about this case. All I get is movie information and the fact that it is based on a "real story". I find it hard to believe that the judge would immediately change the penalty in the courtroom even after the brother was very affectionate (gorgeous John Corbett), but in general it was very engaging. Anyway, if someone knows the real "real story", I thank you for sharing it!
