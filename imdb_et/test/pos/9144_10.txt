Like a big fan of horror, I had abandoned the vampire subgroup because in most vampire shots, the vampire has become feminine and non-dangerous, benign, and fundamentally weak. It was the attitude I looked at at midnight, and I am pleased to say that the vampires of this movie have at least hunger for killing old ladies and victims! Armand Assante, one of my favorite actresses of my time, was born to play the charming vampire with the intensity of the wildlife. Another interesting thing for me is the central location of the Borgo Hotel. It's cool because (and I went back to my high school copy to see it up) in Dracula, Borgo Pass is where Jonathan Harker has to go to Dracula Castle. who made the decision to make the creature a real and not tough CGI! It's a big deal for many low budget movies, they can't afford the effects of garbage computers that cover many Hollywood monsters. <br /> <br /> The bottom line ... it's better than Underworld sure, especially if you are the vampire is the cleanest. Cheers, JA
