In protecting this movie, I have to repeat what I had said before. The film is called Arachina, it has no name cast and I do not mean a name like the actors who play little in the art scene. I mean, the name, like your local high school, didn't decide to make a movie name and it might have a $ 2 budget. What to expect? Hitchcock? <br /> <br /> I felt that the film was never taken seriously, which automatically takes it out of the worst movie list. This list is only for a big budget, which is all the stars with stars that are too serious. In the movie Oscar comes to mind, most of Sylvester's Stallone movies. The two leaders were not Hepburn and Tracy, but they did their job well enough for this movie. The woman threw the butt and the boy was not a buggy idiot. The actor who played the old man was really very good. The man who played the anal retentive professor was not Clifton Webb, but he did the divine work. And for Bimbo's lack of better, two competent players played. I laughed at 50 cents with special effects. But it was part of the film's charm. He played like a hybrid Tremors to meet a living dead night. The prerequisite for the film is like all Giant Bug films from the 50s. The meteor or radiation interferes with the ecosystem and before you know it, we have giant ants, lobsters, rocks or lizards who terrorize the locals. This time the meteor was the cause of the problems. I was very entertaining. I didn't expect much and I go much more than I wanted.
