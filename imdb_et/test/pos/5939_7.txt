It was essentially a new version of Diagnosis Murder minus Victoria Rowell, Scott Baio & Charlie Schlatter. Dick plays a college professor who teaches criminology 101 and can't even find his classroom. Barry is now a private eye that is not related to Dick. This will allow Barry to shoot the guys who are away from him, which the policeman cannot do. Barry still gets to the girl's end. Tracey Needham is a girl. He's the main suspect and Dick and Barry believe he's innocent and proven. It's all the spoiler you get. The end is unexpected that you don't already know it halfway through the movie. <br /> <br /> Don't take it seriously. Don't criticize it. Just sit back and enjoy Dick and Barry Van Dyke.
