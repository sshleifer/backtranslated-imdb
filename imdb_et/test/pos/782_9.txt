I only heard about driving lessons through ITV ads, and frankly I didn't know how much I would like it to. I switched the TV last night and was totally surprised. Driving is a modest, simple movie that pulls you right from the start. Rupert Grint plays a great part in the socially uncomfortable teenage Ben. He is certainly one of the future prospects. Dame Eve Waltoni plays fabulous Julie Walters. I loved a simple plot and how the actors portrayed their feelings with great sensitivity. For me, highlighting the film was Evie's pretty colorful poem. This shows how friendships can form between the most likely couples. In my opinion, looking at driving is a great way to spend 2 hours. The landscape was also striking, especially in the countryside. Anyone who can forget this sparkling comedy, I very much agree
