I've been watching this movie many times over the years and have always found an entertaining experience. As a pensioner pilot, I am interested in most aviation films and this is one of the best. I know that Lindbergh had his historic solo flight in Paris just 25 years old and James Stewart was almost 50 years old in making this film, but I can't forget that because Stewart has always been one of my all-time favorite actresses and one of the most prominent performances like "single eagle". <br /> <br /> The whole movie has a good mix of comedy and drama and good setbacks. It also helps that James Stewart was a pilot in real life in both military and civilian life.
