Of course, the film is full of black military stereotypes and a lot of time jargon. In this sense, the film is indeed dated. But as a satirical look at the American numerical parallel industry, advertising is still a target. But just as important is the response message, namely the impact of big bucks on those who make the industry more socially responsible, not promoting war toys, alcohol, etc. So the film is also a temptation of capitalism. Note, for example, how Putney's glass suddenly turns into a revolutionary Fidel of the Third World, just before it pulls out of the company. For a moment, it seems that Swope's mini-revolution has been successful among its employees and is moving forward, perhaps spreading the movement. But then the ex-soldiers will leave the big bucks and he will shake his head, maybe hijack the plane to Cuba. Downey's last word, however, is ironic, because Arabic (I believe) burns down the money tower, leaving (advertising, capitalism) a metaphorical structure to destroy smoking. It seems to me that it can only become successful as a cleaning action as a destruction and not as a reform process that corresponds to the radical spirit of time. <br /> <br /> Whatever the subtitle is, there are some really funny moments, especially with ads that are playing as well today. Those who compare the anarchic style with those of Marx Brose make a good note. The bumps fly along with the embarrassing settings in the thick and fast. Forty years later, it is still a difficult film to get a consistent handle. Despite the fact that the films are still sharp, the film remains a bold originality with some real moments.
