I looked the other night. I have to say that I was very impressed with how the film looked. It seemed like a documentary. I also think that the film presented realistic options. In the film, Vietnam's war rises to China's involvement. What if it happened? I think the scenarios would be similar to those in the movie. There have been camps in this country ... and still ... <br /> <br /> Very recommended for everyone ... especially for radicals ... <br /> <br /> I said when I was in this situation that these kids were just letting my ass go. I love America and its great wars
