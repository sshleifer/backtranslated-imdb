I recently saw episodes 1-4 and now I can't wait for 5 & 6 to be available! (I've heard that they will be coming soon.) The Commander log seems to be about to turn into a university crowd and all other magic comedy. It is obvious that the budget was small, but the caution in handling the script is quite obvious. In fact, the simplicity of the exhibition made it possible to understand writing and doing more. Bowlsby is the Resurrection Master ... I just wish I remembered all the best that could later be used by unsuspecting companions! Let's just say that if you don't like the Commander log, make sure your underwear gets extra starch!
