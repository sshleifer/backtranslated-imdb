When I saw this first preview, I was almost out of excitement. I have long been a fan of the twelfth night - it changed me to Shakespeare, so there is a dream for modern adaptation. My expectations were not disappointed. <br /> <br /> The plot essentially follows the original story and it means: complicated! I don't even want to try it, the plot's summer will probably cover the basics. Imagine a girl pretending to be a boy at school and thinking about all the possible situations that would arise. I do not even stop questioning the credibility of such a plot; reality is not a movie point. <br /> <br /> What it is is completely fun. Almost every scene nails make comedy. Tissue for writers, directors and actors about this story. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes is the star of this movie and she carries it perfectly. She is very cute, not vixen and can make flawless comedy. I admire him so much that he is not in his films or in public life as a full-length tramp, because so much today. I'm glad that there is at least one decent young actress in Hollywood. Okay, I'm out of my soapbox ... <br /> <br /> Channing Tatum, yes, he's hot and built like a flippin gorilla, but he makes me laugh! My favorite scenes in the whole movie are when he first tries to talk to Olivia about the cheese and then his training plan. The characters of the classic evil girlfriend and the Monique forms are complementary. <br /> <br /> Generally, there is a lot of fun, the pilot is laughing and very attractive. Maybe not the original in parallel, but it captures modern versions of other games, including 10 things I hate you.
