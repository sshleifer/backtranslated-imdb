This movie I remember was such a great movie! I watched it on television when I was 11, and I didn't remember its title. When I remember correctly, I believe it was a special Christmas television movie. One of my friends at work and I discussed it several years ago, but neither of us remembered the title. But we remembered almost the whole movie. Nobody else ever remembered it! Thank you for the goodness on someone's TV movie website replied to my post! Now I have fun working to find this copy! It's amazing what you remember as a child, but this movie will definitely be on your head ... even after 28 years. And I believe I only looked at it once. Perhaps it was because I was the oldest sister of my family or maybe because I was a babysitter and worked in day centers that it was so long with me. Regardless of the actual reason, it has remained one of the films I really want to watch lately! If anyone knows where to view it online or a copy, please let me know. I love to see it again !! Big thanks! Seriously I tried to post it and it says my comment is not long enough. So, apparently I have to write more, did you know that Melissa Michaelsen is the sister of Peter Billingsley who played the Christmas carol? I know I'm not the only fan of this movie, so if anyone has any idea where to find it, I'd appreciate it.
