When I first heard the Greek, I thought I was looking at it because it sounded ridiculous. Another ABC family with so bad-these-almost good exhibitions. But finding a college friend found us both enjoying a lot more pilot than we had been waiting for. <br /> <br /> As a member of Greek society, I can say that many of the stereotypes that have been raised here are those that come almost every time someone starts talking about campus corporations and brotherhoods. And it is also very fun to play only on your own, let alone a television screen. The Open Scene only reflected a slightly dramatic version to prepare for the actual official haste in some corporations, and it continued there. <br /> <br /> This is not an example of a sensitive Greek. If you can offend even jokes about things that aren't so big about Greek life, you spend the first episode and probably many others yelling and yelling. But everyone else should have a dance to watch it. This is nothing new, but there is never anything in college.
