Sport, which seems to be more suitable for Looney Tunes than grisly giallo, "Don't Torture a Duckling" (1972), however, is the A-thriller of the maestro Lucio Fulci. There's someone complaining about preteen boys in rural areas, in the village of southern Italy, and there are many suspects for their gials. There's Barbara Bouchet (Patrizia) who looks more funny than you've ever seen her, a rich girl who hides after a drug scandal; Florinda Bolkan (Martiara), local epileptic voodoo woman; his witch practicing beau; Giuseppe, local idiot; a sweet-looking priest; his mother; and on and on. There are some unusually violent pieces in the film, including the whipping of one of the main characters in the grave (one of the most realistic bloody sequences I've ever seen) and the terrifying duke when the killer ultimately appears. The film's violence compensation compensates for the fact that there are no real intimidations or arrests. Nonetheless, it looks like giallo with its unusual rural background, mourning murders of children, strangers, and the amazing results of Riz Ortolan. The film is beautifully captured in what I expect it to be in Monte Sant'Angelo, near the Adriatic Sea in southern Italy (at least the police forces of this city are thanked for the final race). And while subtitling would have made this fine DVD work even better (the American slang does not convince this rural Italian environment), Anchor Bay must be thanked for another well-done job. Oh ... this title COMPLETES perfectly!
