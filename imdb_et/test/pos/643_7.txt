It can be the most intense movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It's not that nervous that I haven't looked at it two years ago, but I'm after a DVD. Here were a couple of scenes that are almost too much to watch .... so if you have problems and need to "get in" for an hour and a half, this movie won't let anything else. <br /> <br /> Russian actress Marina Zudina did a super-work with her facial expressions, which she had to do because her character here is silent. She plays a lovely and healthy master for the artist. After taking the day and leaving "Billie", she hears something. He takes a look at the room where they filmed and discover that they are shooting "snuff" and killing someone. Billie's interception is discovered and runs for his life when the killers go in search of this great warehouse type. <br /> <br /> There are two extended scenes where our heroine works for her life and both. they'll carry you out. First described above. The second scene, climatic, goes too long and is not as well done as the first. In fact, the film should be a bit trimmed, but in general, because it is so good to keep our attention, it was entertainment.
