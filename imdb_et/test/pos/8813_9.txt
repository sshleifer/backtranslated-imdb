I have a completely biased position, mainly because I live and enjoy the club culture lifestyle. Being a DJ and often a club visitor, I see the film's honesty and I love it. If you don't know the club / rave culture, it's a great cultural birth for anyone who doesn't know it for the first time. Fair presentation of human emotions and questions in Jip's love. The characters were well designed and thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I really don't enjoy having to write ten lines on this website. I write at least 6 or 7, but I feel I can imagine my point in less than ten. Here are some additional ways to make the IMDb gods happy.
