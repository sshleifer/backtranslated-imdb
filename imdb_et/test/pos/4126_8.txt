It happened to me when the last scene of the movie froze to reveal the little details of Buddy Holly's death, that there are still people who were there on Clearlake, Iowa, who remembers it alive. It has to be a strange memory that gave even more signs of "American Pie" because it honors the day when music died. The world lost some tremendous talent that day, lived a short path before its main, and can only wonder what could have been the trio of musicians killed that day to preserve even greater musical heritage. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie today about thirty years after it was originally a theater release. For thirty years I have some problems because I think about it. I had forgotten it a lot, remembering some small things, such as a wall cricket, who got the band called immortalized. But first of all I remember music. It is hard to sit there and not start touching "Oh Boy" or "That's Be the Day", and you have to think about where our moral hazard would actually come from these stories. I'm at Buddy, at least with that score, how could they be the jungle rhythms if he were with them? It's funny how every successive decade brought its threat to the fabric of society - The Beatles, Motown, Disco, and a whole host of other musical forms. We're still listening and dancing, so I think they weren't so bad. This is where I learned to get rid of the phone when someone on the other side didn't see my way. I've done this several times over the years, but now that source has been forgotten. Well, I should be good for thirty years or so. <br /> <br /> You must definitely give Gary Busey a credit for depicting Buddy Holly. Seeing him today, he could never imagine he was horn-ripped glasses, but it was a tour de force characterization and performance that served Busey's Oscars arrow. Don Stroud and Charles Martin Smith are competent as Buddy band members, although their characters take a lot of back. I enjoyed the subtle ways in which other musical legends were added to the picture, names like Sam Cooke and King Curtis without ever being present. <br /> <br /> I am always a fan of Fifties and Sixties music, and they are now watching them. I think it makes me a little grandmother, but you can't replace the experience that has grown with music history, which now makes it a big screen. It only strengthens the idea that I will continue to enjoy music until I die.
