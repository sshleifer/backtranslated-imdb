I just saw the story of two sisters last night and I really enjoyed it. I've recently been a big fan of Asian horror movies and I think it's a strong entrance from South Korea. There's not much to jump with you scares like a normal American horror movie, but the director retains a very good look and predictive mood, especially in uncomfortable interactions. Most fears are more conceptual and play everyone's "there under the bed" for fear when they were a child, but in this case it's a closet and sink. I also liked how the director was able to operate this household with scenes such as the first dinners that the characters have together. She is also good at exposing people's inner life and vulnerability through simple scenes, such as a stepmother who swept her makeup in the mirror or sitting in front of a shaking TV. I think this film is mainly about investigating the consequences of guilt and guilt. ) I was watching this story quite well, but I started to confuse while dragging the bag. But I think at the end of the day, everything was definitely tied together. The film is very similar to a "mechanic" so that the two offenders' common guilt finally leads to mental breakdown and confusion. <br /> <br /> Here is my movie interpretation. Su-Yeon, which we see after the girls' expected return, is either Su-Mi's fraud or the real ghost of Su-Yeon, which only Su-Mi can see and interact with. The first stepmother we see is, in my opinion, the mistake of Su-Mi. However, it is a real stepmom, and she first appears on the film when she is wearing a gray pantsuit. I believe it is a real stepmother that the father speaks on the phone during the first part of the film and does not appear until she takes her and brings her to the house. To this point of view, Su-Mi (perhaps part of his shared personality?), Which explains the odd dinner party, when stepmother's brother sees him as he is crazy and doesn't remember something he's talking about. I think it was Su-Mi, who made his useful part of his shared personality. The film later shows it in the scuffing scene of the bags and scenes like the mother who swept her makeup into the mirror, which later turns out to be, in fact, Su-Mi who wipes her mirror. /> I think Su-Mi does not think that house gums are fully prepared and either Su-Yeon or mother or both. In the final return, it turns out that Su-Yeon wore a green dress and was dying on her hair. This is a green dress they showed before the dining room with a ghost at the table when the stepmother looked down at the sink. It is also the hairpin that Su-Yeon wore on the back that appears on the floor when the stepmother is looking under the sink. <br /> <br /> True stepmom, finally, is punished with the ghost of Su-Yeon, who comes in a scene like Ring. After that, the setback scene is all related to how the stepmother was primarily responsible for death, while Su-Mi played an involuntary role. <br /> <br /> I don't know if "mother" is Su-Yeon when she returns to her room to shout, she's already a ghost. Maybe by that time my mother had already killed her. It has remained ambiguous. <br /> <br /> The others that are offered but not explicitly mentioned in the movie are that the stepmother has been a sister at some point, maybe she took care of her mother, and somehow she may have died. It is not clear when his relationship with his father began and whether it caused the mother to kill. It is also recommended that the mother also had mental problems that require a nurse. Stepmother hints when she says to Su-Mile, you're starting to take her mother. I don't think he just thought physically. <br /> <br /> Also, if we agree that the original stepmother we are seeing is actually Su-Mi, there are also incest suggestions because the father is sleeping with him. Is that why Su-Mi speaks and shouts: "Don't touch me" every time his father comes to him later? Is it "dirty things you've done" that he refers to a later conversation with his father? This film is interesting in different interpretations. Some scenes, however, were such as the black indexing woman who reminded me of Kayako's hero movements in Ju-On / The Grudge. Also, the last scene where the mother finally gets her desserts is around. Moreover, the idea that some characters may be ghosts is taken from the "sixth thought" or "from others". <br /> <br /> Overall, I enjoyed it, and it is interesting to see how the Hollywood Revolution (which is already in production) turns out to be. I have to be honest, I liked the "Ring" and "The Grudge" so I'm not one of those snooty types who claim that remakes can't be good either. One remake that I am very happy about is the "Dark Water" that will be released this summer. I haven't seen the original Japanese version yet, but both movies are definitely on my watchlist.
