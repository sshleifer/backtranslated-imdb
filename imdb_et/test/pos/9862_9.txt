After reading some earlier unpleasant comments, I had to put my two cents. This exhibition is NOT, in spite of what this gene thinks in Essex, the worst thing that ever fueled television. I think most of today's television is a lot worse (when does that stupid "reality" ever end?) And there is no current exhibition I can watch. Give me the things I grew up with. I am a child of 1965 who is not ashamed to admit it. <br /> <br /> This show has been my favorite for almost 30 years. I was in high school when it was originally inspired, and I think it helped me hang out during those unhappy days. I was so wrong, and "Fantasy Island" turned to my imagination. Since I was a writer these days, he gave impressive opportunities for practicing watercraft. What a wonderful prerequisite! I'm not saying he has no mistakes. Sometimes the scripts were bad and some problems were trivial; but it can also be good and it was a blast to watch and still do. As for the cheese factor, I think it is unfair to label every 70's products. Then there were many good things, and that was among them. (BTW, most of the seasons were presented in the 80s !!) My favorite episodes came mainly from the 2nd, 3rd and 4th seasons. <br /> <br /> For those who frighten Herv√© Villechaize with their heavy French accents and short growth potential: INCREASE AND NONE! It's so easy to do if you're "normal" and "perfect." This man did the best he could, and if you don't like it, it's just tough. Little sympathy. He's been dead for 15 years and how easy is anyone who can't defend himself. There is no more shame. <br /> <br /> I love this example. So it seems dated. I hate to tell you, but we didn't have splashy specials or Blu-Ray discs. We had happy video recordings. Live with it. Accept what it is, and it's just fun. "Escapist TV" describes it perfectly and it was for me - escaping from my rotten real life. And it's still fun to watch.
