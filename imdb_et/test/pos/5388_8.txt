I can differ from many people on this board, but I enjoy watching Mind Of Mencia. The reason for reminding me of Mencia is the host is not afraid to talk about her mind or use stereotypes. Carlos Mencia does what we all do with our friends, but we don't want to admit and then some. Although he gets a lot of flack for it, it is fresh air in these politically correct times. Mencia doesn't care if she offends anyone, but she is not racist and even jokes about her race. person or recent event. Mencia then comes out and makes a 5 or 6 minute stand where she talks about different issues. The exhibition has two separate sketches, which are divided into ads. In these sketches, Mencia does a variety of things, such as having fun with people, giving personal opinions with funny twists, or just making parodies of people, events, or movies. At the end of the show, Mencia appears for one minute with one final sketch or something else. Carlos does just what everyone else thinks of certain races but is afraid to say. As for Mencias, she only speaks her mind. I can't find anything wrong with that. <br /> <br /> The exhibition is not perfect. Skits can't put together the best and sometimes Mencia goes over for fun. Mostly, this is an exhibition where the comedian says what he thinks are any consequences and humorous things. So if you're not afraid of laughing at stereotypes and seeing someone talking about your mind and often telling you what you want to say, look at Mind Of Mencia. However, if you are easily offended, you should not look at this example because you will be offended or even worse if you even laugh.
