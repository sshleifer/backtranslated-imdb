Anyone who knows horror films knows that most of them aren't scary at all. Some people have gorefests with the development of subjective traits and character. I personally enjoy horror films that focus on the atmosphere and interesting concepts (eg A Tale of Two Sisters, Cairo, etc.). Regardless of what type of horror film personally likes, there are only a few who scare you. Noroi is one of them. <br /> <br /> This is a documentary-style movie, which means that the whole movie is a collection of video clips associated with the legendary name Kagutaba of the demonic unit. It is a prerequisite that the journalist filmed his film material by interviewing people related to demonic rituals in Southeastern Africa, and then compiled it from other sources related to his research. What results are a relentlessly chilling experience that seems very real and very disturbing, even though the story itself is fake. <br /> <br /> Some have compared the Noroi and Blair witch projects, but the only similarity is the documentary. style. One obvious difference between films is that Noroi scares the viewer by linking events to each other using different sources. For example, the journalist registers the exterior of the house he is studying and sees something strange on the porch. Later in the film, the same strange event of another person's home video clip is introduced. The viewer's memory combines two incidents and the chills start to go off their spine. Another example is a television show with a childrens' bag that answers each question correctly except one. In fact, his answer is so wrong that the viewer can ask what the filmmakers think. Later it turns out that the wrong answer is related to a very disturbing event. It's really smart movie making. <br /> <br /> Another difference between Noroi and Blair Witch is that Noroi does not offer one, but two very long finals, one of which is placed within a minute after the start of the credit and is one of the biggest fear factors in the history of fear cinema. I don't say such things lightly. It shattered me completely strangely. <br /> <br /> Other aspects of film making are well done. The Southeast legend and the ritual background are very interesting and most of the participants did a good job. The only top force comes from the one who should be crazy anyway, so it's welcome. Cinematic art is deliberately sharp because all the footage is videos recorded with video cameras. Japanese films are not known for their special effects, but the effects used here were fantastic. In some cases, they create with another world (eg static disorder or first finale), but in other cases they are alarmingly realistic (eg second finale). <br /> <br /> When all is said and Noroi goes as a terrible movie I've ever seen. I would like to go so far as to say that there is no movie that offers such a harsh terrorist from the beginning to the end like Noroi. Look at it now.
