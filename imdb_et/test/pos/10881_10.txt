Surely the best game of N64 ever. I say mostly that I was disappointed tomorrow that I will never die, but the world is not promising to be better than goldeneye (according to the website). I love goldeneye so much that I can do anything every time I play it. I've even built up my level of tasks. The multi-player is the best of any kind of game and the graphics are amazing even now. The first day I got it, I remember, they want them to go back and make all the bond movies into games. Can you imagine that you are driving this speedboat alive and let you die and make those incredible jumps or fight ninjas or fight the jaw spy who loved me and the moonrock. (I think it would be more fun to fight these games if it were.) What is Sanchez's search for gas trucks or St. Cerilide scatter only on your eyes. oh well let me go back. All levels are unique and make for very fun killing environments. there are many places to hide so you can sneak into people (especially the statue park) and this game does not deserve the rent you have to buy today.
