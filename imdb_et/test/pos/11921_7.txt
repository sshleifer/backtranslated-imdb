Yes, this is not a great cinema achievement, but Toy Soldiers is a fun and fun movie. The young master does a great job of dramatic as well as comic aspects of the story, and I especially liked Shawn Phelan as Derek / "Yogurt". I've seen this many times over the years and probably more. Just don't think too much and you love it - enjoy!
