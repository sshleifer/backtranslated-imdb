This film was a heart-shaped cinema that helped show the darker side of childhood and the little things that Tom Hank made. Using a very secret story, they could give you an idea of ​​what really happened to Tom Hank as a child. And while scenes such as a flying machine may never happen, it helped show if even denial can help tell the truth. In all good consciences, I could not appreciate it from less than 9 out of 10, the great performances of all the actors, and although many may not understand the secret ending in which the brother stepped by his father, and Tom Hanks covers using a far-fetched story of a flying machine, attention to small details such as his turtle, although his brother "flew" with it. Really, a beautiful cinema and every actor deserves this recognition.
