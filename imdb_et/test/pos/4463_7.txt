I didn't know what to expect when I rent this widescreen DVD. I knew it had a cult, but I had also seen many of the director's later works, which, while cheerfully gory, were pretty much inconsistent. DON'T CAUSED DISCHARGE was actually a linear and mystery that kept me almost to the end. And after all was said and done, it was a truly restless and horrible experience. One major warning: I would have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles as uneven duplication found here.
