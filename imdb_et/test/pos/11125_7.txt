This movie was well done, but it made me feel uncommon. For anyone who is considering an exhibition activity, it has to see it, because it shows the raw material that is going on for these heavy workers. The music was definitely cool and the actor and dance congratulated it nicely. Some of the pupil's attitudes might have been a bit far removed from Leroy, especially as I am sure that someone would have already been kicked out to refuse reading and being a true performing arts school. Coco's screen test is hard to see if people are there with weak snakes, please see my warning. Although it is very sharp, I know that this is the truth about what happens, so the film is right in this respect. Generally, it is entertaining and while some parts draw the majority, it really goes fast. <br /> <br /> Final grouping: <br /> <br /> Movies: Probably it would have missed. <br /> <br /> Buying a DVD: Nothing I could see again and again. <br /> <br /> Rent: It is worth renting at least once in your life!
