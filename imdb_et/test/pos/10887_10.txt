In my personal opinion, I think it is the biggest video game ever created! For the first time I played this game in my friends house years ago, the next day I went out and got my own. That day, almost seven years ago, I haven't played it any more. I can't help it, I just can't get bored. I've been addicted to other games from many other newer systems, but I'm still more Goldeneye. Each mission is amazingly fun and challenging, with multiplayer modes like no other. I hope you can be as happy as I had been playing with four players in multiplayer mode because I had brothers and friends who would come together and play this game all the time.
