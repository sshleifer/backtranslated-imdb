As far as I know, it was my first experience with Icelandic films. Such relief is something other than the usual Hollywood movie. Too bad that such films have a small world to succeed in the big world. I can only hope that people look at it randomly, on recommendation or otherwise ... <br /> <br /> Because it is really worth it. I left the cinema really sad. I didn't get the tragic fate of the characters in my head. And it's even more impressive than I thought about the complexity of the movie. It was not only a tragic story, but also an excellent comic relief and a very good soundtrack. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance, look at it! It is really provocative and made me think. <br /> <br />
