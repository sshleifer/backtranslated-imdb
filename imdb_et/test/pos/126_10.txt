CONTAINS "SPOILER" INFORMATION. Watch this director's second film "Earth" at some point. It's a better movie, but it's not just different. <br /> <br /> A rare feminist sight from an Indian filmmaker. Tradition, rituals, commitment, secrets, and portrayal of rigorous gender roles make it an interesting and culturally dynamic film viewing experience. All married characters do not have their own couple with their spouses. One husband is a celibate and forms a form of religious adultery, giving all his love, honor, time, and respect to his religious swami (guru). Her wife is lonely and wants the intimacy and affection she finally finds with her closed lesbian sister who has to live with her incredible husband in her house. This incredible wife publicly loves her Chinese mistress, but was forced to make a marriage with a lesbian. They have sex only when his closet lesbian woman loses his innocence. Another important feature is the matriarch of the elderly who cannot speak or take care of themselves because of a stroke. However, he uses the sound bell and his dissatisfaction with family members to pass on his needs. She lets them know through their watch or fist them that she knows what's inside the house and how much she disagrees. <br /> <br /> Finally, the truth comes to everyone and two female lovers finally flee together. But not before there is an emotional scene between a swami-dependent wife and her former straight woman. His series tries to burn and initially we think he will die. But we see two women connected to the last scene of the movie. <br /> <br /> The writer / director of this film challenges the traditions of their culture, but shows us the individuals who are trapped in their culture. and sex. We really come to care about the characters and we don't see them as stereotypes. Everyone surprises us with their humanity, their vulgarity, tenderness, anger and spirit.
