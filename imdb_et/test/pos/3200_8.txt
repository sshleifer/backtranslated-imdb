This short film (and the poem behind it) is one of the greatest metaphors I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> The poem is beautiful! It describes exactly the feeling of a person who dreams of dreaming and cannot understand it? but it also tells you how to fill it! I see "The Story of Cats and the Moon" as one of the most beautiful metaphor for human relationships, passion and love. Technically it is also a good job. Despite being very simple, the animation provides a black and white allegory of the film and its message, as well as tenderness and nostalgia. Addictive music also contributes to this poetic feeling. <br /> <br /> "Nothing else matters! I'm waiting! He'll come when he gets or if he wants!"
