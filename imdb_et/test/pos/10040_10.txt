Although "They Died With Their Boots" is not entirely historically accurate, it is a great fun for the West. Flynn is not the perfect Custer, character actors are great. In addition to Flynn and DeHavilland's love scenes, they are very touching and credible. (Flynn and DeHavilland knew each other in very real life). Flynn was always so tortured that he would not be taken seriously if he only knew there were very few actors who could play the character and play them well!
