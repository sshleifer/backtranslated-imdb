It was the biggest movie I've ever seen in my life, the action was great, and I was so scared that there was a lot of gore, which was great, I'd see it 1000 more times and Paris Hilton, D * MN he fined in this movie . But I would still recommend it to someone, even children (like me). You would probably have a nightmare at night, but next to it is honest, I know I will stop it. ASK ONLY IF HOW TO RECOMMEND AND BRAGGED, and at school I gave out a flyer saying that 6 wax houses would see it. I got it all over the school. But still I would definitely say that IT IT can be 6 wax houses, be there.
