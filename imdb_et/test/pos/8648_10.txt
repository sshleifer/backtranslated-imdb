10/10 <br /> <br /> PLOT DISCUSSION <br /> <br /> This is one of the best films ever made, and I'm not saying it because I see this meaningless presentation cheating. Those who do not like the film because they do not understand the story often criticize those who praise the film by saying that they expect their genius because they do not understand it. I'm not watching this movie very allegorical. For me, this is the beginning, the middle and the end of the story. People interfering with the film because they expect it to have a deep, philosophical meaning, which they interpret on the basis of a supposedly pointless scene. I feel they do not understand that crypticity is a result of a finely grounded and reorganized plot with a very long and rather explanatory sequence of fantasy, rather than a visual allegory chaos. Due to the length limitation, I try to keep it short and touch the main concepts. In Audition he meets Camilla with whom he falls in love. Diane is furious because Camilla sleeps with other men and women. Diane discovers another person (director) on the film and discovers the other party's (casual blonde) Camilla and director's engagement party. Diane hires her rage and peculiarity motivated to kill Camilla. After that, he has surpassed loneliness and slides into the unconscious world of fantasy where he lives the life he wants. Then Diane is awakened. In his consciousness, he stands for what he has done. <br /> <br /> The Importance of Fantasy: The film begins with credit with first person p.o.v. an image depicting someone who falls into bed and slips into unconsciousness. Here's Diane's fantasy. The accident is an excuse to bring back her dead girlfriend and justify the fantasy life. She depicts her girlfriend as bright and innocent as she wanted it. In the meantime, he acts like everyone in "movies" because he has an escapist personality. It also kills itself in some ways and takes on the identity of a reporter named Betty. The revolutionary story of the director is a direct consequence of his sense of being victimized in reality, as he was and "convincing" himself that he was forced to choose Camilla. It was also an unconscious expression of the lack of control she felt during the party. Camilla Rhoades is a casual blonde in a fantasy workmanship. He hated him so much that he turned to Camilla and made a final antagonist. Then he took the real Camilla and turned him into a perfect, submissive filmmaker and used Rita Hayworth as inspiration. He also paints the hit man as a very clumsy and powerless person to justify Camilla's survival. His fantasy world, unfortunately for him, was a search for Diane, which ended in himself and died in dreams by taking a series of reminders of reality. The first reminder was Club Silencio, who called "no band" and "instruments" that you hear are not really there; this is a metaphor of fantasy. He starts to shake violently because it shakes his understanding of his surroundings. The second reminder is the blue box ... In fact, the blue box itself is not a reminder (more of a Pandora box, but a blue key that opens the box). The blue key reminds him of Camilla's actual death, because what was hit by the man would appear when it was done. Along with love, this whole of his creation is escaping from reality, living in the ideal Hollywood, which he is supposed to be part of when he arrived. <br /> <br /> This is a story that shows the psychology of a very uneasy woman who has lost her dream. It is not a series of random things specifically designed to distract and it is not a secret philosophical message. This is an unfortunate human condition that has been beautifully presented. <br /> <br /> Finally, it is my opinion. I can be out. Or it may not mean anything. There are many who disagree with me. Great! Afterall, why should it mean something? Why can't it just be a statement? What, if coherent, sensible narratives are the chains of artistic expression? For example, Peter Greenaway has many assertions that clearly support this idea with statements such as "I argue that if you want to write narrative, be an author, be a writer, do not be a filmmaker. "And where is the written rule that everything must be immediately understood with only one possible interpretation? There is no such rule because the clarity of the film is not related to this art. "I didn't understand it!" So ...? The story of "Mulholland Dr," or not, affects viewers, harasses them, drags them, scares them, repels them. The way it interprets is amazing. It will never get old. It never loses its luster. Its visuals are always effective and beautiful. This is cinematic perfection, no matter what. Enjoy.
