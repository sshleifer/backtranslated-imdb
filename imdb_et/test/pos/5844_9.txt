Oz is a great series, one of the undervalued TVs. It has a certain connection with the soap opera that something evil is always happening, and that is the opening of every instance of evil. From my discussions with people who are actually in jail, it tells the truth. Each interaction has a background processing. Every activity is backed up by a scheme, a diagram to make someone else's place. I like this series so much that it is one of the few TV programs I've completely bought on a DVD. <br /> <br /> And, yes, I agree with my writer who said there were satire elements in it. The character in the wheelchair, which offers his yellow view of life, does it with some ironic humor.
