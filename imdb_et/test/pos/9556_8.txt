The "Best in Show" is often a fun mockumentary that takes us to the world of exhibitions and some dog owners prepared for the event. The only thing that separates this movie from the actual dog shows is that "Best in Show" dogs work better than their owners! Funny things from top-notch light that includes Eugene Levy (who wrote the movie together), Catherine O'Hara, Parker Posey, Michael McKean, Jennifer Coolidge, Jane Lynch, and Christopher Guest (who wrote and directed with Levy). They are all funny, but Fred Willard steals the movie with his explosive funny performance, such as a dog actor who says the most frustrating things. In addition, dogs are also cute. The "Best in Show" is not just the laugh that I was expecting, but laughs and it is worth it. <br /> <br /> *** (Four)
