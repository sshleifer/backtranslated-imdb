It was the first picture of Chaplin and the results are different. The film is the biting of Hitler and Mussolini, their henchmen and their fanatical way of life, especially in connection with the persecution of the Jews. It was bold and successful by 1940 and must have done a lot of people. <br /> <br /> Compared to Chaplin's earlier works, it's pretty pale. The sweet, funny style of my demonstrations is, in my opinion, much better than her first talkie. There are many pointless bits that drag. If it were quiet, it wouldn't have happened. <br /> <br /> I find that one of the funniest moments is a musical hairdressing moment and world dance. One of the most touching moments is obviously at the end of the call. <br /> <br /> The great dictator is an effective and at times moving film that is very much a part of both Chaplin's history and film history. It's faulty, but Chaplin is in big shape.
