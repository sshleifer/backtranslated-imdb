I watched SEA OF DUST at the Rhode Island Horror Festival in Providence. It was the festival's highlighted film and won a couple hundred records in my opinion of the best picture. The director and a few stars answered questions after showing. One star, Suzy Lorraine, was personally even hotter than the movie, and she was an eye-catcher in the film. <br /> <br /> This movie is independent, but it has many cinematic touches that give it a sense of quality. He even has the original classical style musical score. <br /> <br /> I am a Savin fan and he is a star villain here, in a black navel, he is more of an evil force than a real person I think. He sucks souls out of people and uses them as soldiers in a twisted attempt to create his own version of the Kingdom of God on Earth. In his view, Christ was all suffering, and Savin was going to suffer. <br /> <br /> The main story that keeps your interest is young doctor Stefan who is sent to investigate strange events in Savin caused by an isolated city. He's doing an aristocratic chick, but his father's father tells him he's wrong. Then he meets a strange, but tempting, state girl. I think she loves her, but she's trying to kill her as well as many hot women in the movie. <br /> <br /> I found scenes in the woods to be the toughest and most eye-catching, with strange people along the way (bad twin girls scared me out of hell). <br /> <br /> The movie has a lot, too many to list. There's a lot of blood, torture and gore. Hot chicks lick the blood off the boys' fingers. The head of a frightened girl explodes. It was unexpected. Ears get slit. Some brutal carvings. <br /> <br /> Then they sometimes play laughs, a bit of fun in the evil black forest genre. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Hammer movies and Ingrid Pitt, it's interesting to see him in this movie. He displaces one of the leaders by moving his skull. Great. A man who played in the silence of "Multiple Immigration" sheep lambs is a great ax. <br /> <br /> The film is surreal and with the end I am not sure that the events were happening or when they were Stefan's head, because his rejection was his desired bride. He returns to revenge and this scene is brutal. <br /> <br /> The director also spoke about the theme of religion that it is used for wars and killings. I see it, Savin's view of religion was scary. <br /> <br /> It was a strangely extraordinary movie with a few stars like Savin and Pitt, lots of good support, including hot babes, big gore scenes, and all the time if you don't know what the hell is going on and what happens next. <br /> <br /> It deserves ten stars because it is an excellent independent film effort; thoughtful.
