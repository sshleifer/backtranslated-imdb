Anne (Natalie Portman) tells us how much she hates her mother Adele (Susane Sarandon). That's how the film begins. Adele decided that she and her daughter moved to California without asking anyone and leaving her husband for no reason. The story is related to the relationship between mother and daughter. It's really deep and touching, thanks to the great work of the actors. Natalie was named Golden Globe for this role. He's one of the most talented actors I've ever seen, and so is Sarandon. They look like a mother's daughter. The soundtrack is also great. The film is incredible. * 10 out of 10 *
