It may not have been big budgets, celebrities or Scream, Urban Legend approvals, or I know what you did last summer, but Campfire Tales had one thing these three films lacked: a real horror. <br /> <br /> This movie A year before the legends of cities was dealt with in a legend of cities that was apt and less than enchanting. It was intriguing, masterfully written and logical in the way I know what you could only dream last summer. Finally, it set the focus and stopped with excitement, while Scream tried and died. <br /> <br /> The most exciting thing about this movie is how many horror writers and directors have achieved. The general story of the teenagers at the camp was a classic fear of the unknown (but certainly awaited) destruction that awaits them in the forest, but the stories themselves are where the film really looked. <br /> <br /> The opening order is a clean, fast paced city myth. It is based on a popular legend and the director plays it with style and pace, making it more interesting because we know what happens. <br /> <br /> The first campfire story is a straight forward thriller. Based on another popular myth, we do not really understand it until it blends so well into the story and the action keeps our attention. As a trilogy thriller, it plays our fear of the unknown and includes a number of well-made "jump" sequences that don't know almost as cheap or indirect as those in films like Scream or Urban Legend. <br /> <br /> Another story is more tense. This time, although the characters still don't know what's going on, it gives horror. No need for cheap excitement here. <br /> <br /> The final story includes supernatural elements and uses a creepy / trippy atmosphere to intimidate the viewer. Because we can simply associate the characters and their situation, our fear comes from their intensity and what they can't explain. This is the true story of the trio. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect to enjoy Campfire Tales when I rented it. I thought if I didn't like his more respected colleagues with more budget, how did he like it? <br /> <br /> The truth is, this movie will succeed if others stay beyond the mark.
