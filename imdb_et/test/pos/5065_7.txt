The reviews of RENDITION have generally not been favorable, so I waited until he moved to the local useful theater to see it. The film tells Anwar El-Ibrahim, American-Egyptian scholars who have completed their international flight and have been asked about it after a strange coincidence that binds him to a country not mentioned in a recent terrorist attack in North Africa. Not as bad as I was afraid, it's an interesting and thought-provoking entry into the "ripped-up" thriller genre. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film asks serious questions about US entertainment methods from political prisoners: is there a series of suspected torture suspected terrorists that our country should do? Does it provide useful information to help save lives? If so, at what price? What kind of monsters are we creating when innocent people are imprisoned and tortured? By punishing the use of torture, what kind of monster can we get as a state? This is always a disappointment if the film with such provocative material is somewhat vague when some details make good movies great. For example, I would like to empathize with Anwari's wife who spends the entire film trying to suppress her, but the only identifiable trait she has given is an advanced pregnancy. It also seems that RENDITION means that Arab women who do not go with their parents' marriages only need trouble and have a badly prepared guestbook, which is kept by the other main character of the film, which too well describes all the details about what he the interests of love just happen, it is imperative at this moment. I laughed out loud when the moment was terrible. <br /> <br /> The film has a good performance by Jake Gyllene and strong (but too short) performances by Hollywood veterans Meryl Streep and Alan Arkin. also Omar Atwally's impressive moves like Anwar El-Ibrahim and actors Moa Khouas, Zineb Oukach and Yigal Naor, all of whom would like to see in future films that have nothing to do with terrorism. Good luck to them. The next five or so RENDITION is well knit until the filmmakers add a light but effective twist, which is the end of the endless massacre that the violent terrorist attacks begin.
