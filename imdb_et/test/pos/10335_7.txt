"My German soldier's summer" was one of many TV films that became the main part of the small screen of the 1970s (others were "Brian's song", "Sybil" and "Someone watching me!"). It depicts a Jewish girl (Kristy McNichol) fighting with the German War (Bruce Davison) during World War II in Georgia. One thing the film shows is that many German soldiers were not really Nazis, but they were simply drafted. When I was watching the film, I got a real sense of how things had been in the south; I mean, can you imagine it being a Jewish person accused of supporting an enemy? <br /> <br /> So, I definitely recommend this movie. I believe it is always important to show the things shown here. Accidental overuse keeps the movie a incomplete masterpiece, but they usually do it quite well. I hope the movie will finally be on DVD. Also starring Esther Rolle and Michael Constantine ("My Big Fat Greek Wedding" Patriarch).
