What makes it one better than most movies is that it does not recognize counterfeiting. In the film, there is a story about the hair-directing director and his rise and fall and rise, using real and recognizable names and events during quiet and early ages. Instead of the general "sound puts us out of business", in reality SHOW Jolson and The Jazz Singer. The actors are really quite good, especially with the incredible performance of Don Ameche, Alice Faye and J. Edward Bromberg.
