I don't understand why IMDb users would rate this movie 5.2 / 10? It's really great, very funny. I strongly recommend this movie to you, adults, teenagers, and especially kids! The story is about a 14-year-old boy who always lies at home and at school. One day his homework was a 1000-word story. But he didn't, so the teacher told him to write it and gave it to him in 3 hours, or he had to go to a summer school. Yes, he wrote it 2:45. "Great fat liar," I think it was a story about yourself. When he got to school, he hit the famous Hollywood limousine and gave him a ride. But the boy forgot the story. He told his parents and the teacher, but of course they didn't believe him. And the film maker took the child's story as his new "Big fat liar". When the child saw the trailer of the movie, he told his parents that he had written it, but they did not believe. So he and his friend had to go to L.A to prove one thing: the truth was never overestimated. Don't trust the 5.2 / 10 price level, it should be 9/10! Believe me! <br /> <br /> P / S: So sorry, my English isn't good enough to comment!
