are you crazy or what? this film has a talent with which you criticize a film made by famous directors and producers? I mean, you have to look at the somewhat dirty version, because if you had the right version, you wouldn't think it was some low-resolution gameplay. <br /> <br /> This movie is for people who enjoy Hong Kong's cinema on the other side of what the Asian people are watching. You are such a salesman. Hong Kong cinema is completely different from Hollywood, hk cinema is in its class ... <br / > <br /> so if you don't enjoy watching movies from Hong Kong producers, don't go and talk about watching time to watch .. just let other people enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> And personally I've seen this movie and I love the story and the way it was done.
