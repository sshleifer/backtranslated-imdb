"Thursday" is a good movie, but we know too many other movies in our genre, and that's why it lacks originality. If you have seen "Goodfellas", "Reservoir Dogs", "Pulp Fiction" and a number of other films inspired by this latter, you have seen almost every "Thursday". There is a scene that includes torture, which has the same dialogue as Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs. <br /> <br /> However, this is a good movie. Since not every part is taken from the same movie, the whole thing is some new ideas and some nice touches. The starting sequence starts quite impressive. We meet Nick (Aaron Eckhart), Dallas (Paulina Porizkova) and Billy Hill (James Le Gros). They get into a cup of coffee with the gas station secretary and end with the death of the secretary and the arrival of the police. We've already seen a lot of money in a suitcase. <br /> <br /> Then we will meet Casey (Thomas Jane) in Houston. She is married to Christine (Paula Marshall), but she used to work with Nick. He knows nothing. Then Nick gives him a speech and says he's coming. We find out that he is forced by his friends and that the problems begin. <br /> <br /> What happens exactly is not for me to reveal, but we'll meet another character who is all interested in money or drugs with Nick. Casey has to wash them down the drain. <br /> <br /> Very funny moments, a lot of blood, a very funny sub-block with actor Michael Jeter and some surprises (although if you really think you see them coming) this is a good movie with some very fine performances Skip Woods.
