First I remember that this story in primary school is said vaguely, about 6 or 7 years ago, so I'm familiar with this story. <br /> <br /> Many of them have changed, however, and many differences and mistakes (sometimes unnecessary) in the movie that die for hard fans do not understand. <br /> <br /> But generally I love this movie. I saw it for the first time at Christmas about 2 years ago (well part 1), then I probably caught the whole Christmas again on the same channel during Christmas. <br /> <br /> I was very impressed, sometimes it may be a bit uplifted and long, but inclusive, with decent action (especially from the cold Foundation and Hobbs) and the beautiful scenery, costume and small magical touch makes it a truly special movie - What really reminds me of Christmas. <br /> Despite the differences in the book, I think this movie contains new themes and ideas (seasons with autumn, winter, and so on, with a new school that I think will represent autumn) for the whole picture, if you notice it's pretty amazing and brilliant execution . <br /> <br /> I live in the UK so I have been waiting for a DVD for a long time and I have fortunately seen an ad that featured a free DVD in Daily Mail, which I usually can't get, so I got the previous one days and finally I have a DVD. If you forgot about it and you want this rare DVD to Region 2, I suggest you collect the characters from the Daily Mail and send them out because your DVD is then sent during Christmas. <br /> <br /> Christmas time this year, put your fire, get cozy and watch it, because you and the kids will probably enjoy this great movie. If you don't have it, it's probably going to happen on July 4th this Christmas so save it!
