"You were on the way and got into the skirts!" Gilligan tells Jim Leonard. It summarizes the story of Leonard (YOUNG Humphrey Bogart), when his dream goes aside from Carol, the heir of a bomb played by Dorothy Mackaill. Leonard has been working on a new and improved engine, but now his love life and automotive manufacturer's ups and downs in his 68-minute race. Bogart had not yet developed a silent, stylistic style. Most of the supporters - his butler, his associates, his sister, the interlopers - are very good. Some adult themes because it was done just before they really used the movie code, but it's still the way it is today on television. Directed by Thornton Freeland, a year before Freeland led the incredible "Flying Down to Rio".
