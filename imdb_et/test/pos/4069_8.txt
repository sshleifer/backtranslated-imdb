I've read a lot of comments about Showtime on IMDb and many look like this sign. I've noticed that many reviewers call it a typical "friend" movie. De Niro is not mostly Murphy's friend most of the movie. In fact, part of the comedy of this movie is De Niro's reluctance to be with friends. <br /> <br /> Murphy looks like this. He has done what he does best, acting like a full ham. He is a policeman who wants to be so much an actor and enjoys being in reality. De Niro is perfect because a straight guy who thinks the whole thing is stupid. I thought these two had great chemistry and they were the perfect choice. Rene Russo is also a great television producer. Of course, he loves everything Murphy does and tries so much (with Murhpy) to go to DeNiro. <br /> <br /> Many reviewers have had a fun scene with William Shatner, who reiterated TJ's role as Hooker to train Murhpy & De Niro how to "act" like the police. But my favorite scene includes Murphy's "religion", hoping he'll get a Wesly Snipes-Like policeman to compete instead of De Niro. Man, it was fun! Comedies often depend on your personal taste. Of course, you could make openings on the plot, most often with comedy. I was worried about seeing Murphy and De Niro pairing ... I think it brought out the best Murphy's, which was nice to see him again at the top of his game. I can only imagine that Murphy was honored to be associated with the great De Niro. Rated 8 out of 10 stars.
