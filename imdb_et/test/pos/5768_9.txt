I saw it coming out for the first time and found it to be a genius-related job; but I have to admit that I was clearly a minority at that time. <br /> <br /> For me, the progressive embarrassment of the owners of Guest House Paradiso is better and better during the entire movie. but never recommend it to the mother. <br /> <br /> Humor lovers of comic books with a collection will appreciate this movie; are funny jokes, but usually flat on a comedy pan. Rik Mayall and Ade Edmondson are great and also dead body, an unsuspecting guest is great.
