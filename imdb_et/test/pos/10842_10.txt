This is one of the best lesbian movies I've ever seen! This series brought sadness and sorrow to the love of truth. In the 19th century, there was an amazing look at lesbian life and the desires of lesbian women. The pain was not expected! Rachael Stirling is an amazing actor, I have never seen her other works, but her portrayal of Nan made me unite her feeling with her heartache and pain and love. One thing I feel most important is to combine the characters I look at. If anyone doubts about seeing this movie ... Think twice! It must be a series. Well done for the BBC! We need more lesbian movies that represent true love and pain like this. Living in Canada, I had imported this DVD and I'm so excited that I bought it.
