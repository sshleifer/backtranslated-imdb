It's as good as it gets. <br /> <br /> This is six episode tracking (briefly) about what life can be like when dinosaurs reigned on earth. Created in the style of a natural documentary, this exhibition shows off with talking heads, but gives us good things with dinosaurs trying to survive. seeing the screen can be proved with any certainty, but its best thought and entertaining. Here's an exhibition that brings dinosaurs to life in a realistic way that doesn't bring them to eat. This is an exhibition that should be shown to every child who loves dinosaurs, as it instils them in the OH WOW factor to go out and learn more. It also attracts them out of hell and you. <br /> <br /> Look at it. If you love animal husbandry or nature or science or Disney True Life's adventures (except someone really kills) or just a really good trip somewhere else and get yourself a copy. Your brain will thank you.
