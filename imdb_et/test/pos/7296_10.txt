<br /> <br /> When I undoubtedly rented thousands of acres, I thought I was a fun King Leah story and of course Michelle Pfeiffer was in it, so what could go wrong? <br /> <br /> Very soon, however, I realized that this story was about thousands of things other than Acres. I started crying and couldn't stop before the end of the movie. Thank you, Jane, Laura, and Jocelyn for giving us such a wonderful and compassionate movie! Thank you for participating and portraying these symbols so deeply and gently! <br /> <br /> I felt an angry sister; Runaway sister and sister Denial. I knew the abusive husband and why he was there and then Father, oh dad ... everything was great. I also recognized myself and this film was an eye opener, a relief, an opportunity to meet my own truth and finally do something about it. I really hope that the Thousand Acres will have the same effect on some others. <br /> <br /> Since I did not understand why the cover said the film was about nurses fighting over the earth - they didn't fight everybody else - I looked at it a second time. Then I could see that if no one had lived a similar story, the submerged stream of fear and fear would be lost and the deep bond between all the nurses passing through it. This is the reason people generally forget about their neighbors, for example. <br /> <br /> But one more reason why this movie is so perfect! <br /> <br /> Give the rat ass (forgive my French language) for what King Leah's story follows. I only know that I can honestly say: this movie has changed my life. <br /> <br /> Keep up the good work, you can and do something. <br /> <br />
