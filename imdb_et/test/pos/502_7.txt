An interesting vampire twist - fast, loud and moody. Despite his initial fear, Kris K is doing quite well and Snipes, or Blade, offers a great physical presence. A lot of blood, steel, silver, burning and exploding bodies offer an enjoyable :) 110-minute confusion. If you like the Matrix black look, Blade will turn to you, Blade even has a "dodge the bullets" sequence.
