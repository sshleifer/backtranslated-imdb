MPAA rating PG-13 <br /> <br /> My rating: 10 and higher <br /> <br /> My * rating 9.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> William H. Macy offers a stunning Neuman role. He makes you feel sympathetic and scary. The story begins with comedy and slowly, but it is constantly changing like the twists of horror that Macy is struggling with. I couldn't finish this movie after that, and I couldn't believe it ended when he did. TAKEN IF NECESSARY. <br /> <br /> THIS CURRENT CAN BE INCLUDED IN THE SPOILER'S DIMENSION <br /> <br /> After watching the movie, look at the plot as follows: Neumans is the United States as a Whole and Meat Loaf Aday plays American people who are anti-Semitic. <br /> <br /> It was a very enjoyable movie and suggested someone I saw on the street.
