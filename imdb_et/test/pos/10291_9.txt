Apartmente'L is one of the most interesting films I've ever seen. When I was watching this movie, I experienced extreme frustration when I joined these two leaders. It was never the end that made me disappointed. But the end ends with a more cynical film with a more cynical disability. This is not a film that people are likely to rewrite, but one at a time has a profound impact on people. From now on I haven't reviewed the movie and I don't think I will. <br /> <br /> The story follows a man's Maxi experience of being married to Muriel. She remembers her old girlfriend Lisa (she sees it as a love for her life) when she randomly listens to talking to the phone. So he's trying to find Lisa. Here begins her extremely frustrating Lisa. There are many layers of this film. There is envy, vouyeurism and so on. There is another sign, called Alice, that is all about confusion. The film then moves through a series of turns and ultimately leads to an end that can be interpreted in many ways. It's fascinating how this movie has only four main characters, but smart writing makes it interesting and unique. What I love is that obsession, jealousy is done with such a light heart. This is a very fast pace, which is probably why it can turn to a large audience. The main character Max has gray tones and I felt that the end was perfect. I don't think he should be a pure character, given that he is looking for his long lost love when he is involved, and he is also flinging with Alice. <br /> <br /> Alice's character is even worse. His manipulation and his compulsive lying can really irritate the viewers (this is the point I think). The scene where he breaks before Lucien really shows another aspect of his character. It shows him what he wants to receive and that he is tired of all the lies and games he wants to lead a normal life. Finally, he understands that he has to go away from it. The end gives a cynical touch. Because it seems Max's love for Alice is temporary and fake. Just like saying that love in general is a temporary emotion and it is better to choose a safe choice (i.e. Muriel) if done in such a short time (ie Lisa or Alice). In many ways it is not a romantic film, but a satire of romance (in some ways). <br /> <br /> Performances deserve great praise. Vincent Cassel as Max gives excellent performance. He is an excellent man in confusion who is not convinced of his work. Its geeky look is an added advantage as it fits perfectly with nature. But the real star of the movie is Romane Bohringer as Alice. His nuances depicted a woman who is jealous of Alice and is in love with Max. The scene in which she screams "I am a nutcase too" really shows her despair and her longing to live a normal life with a man who loves her. <br /> <br /> I also thought that lesbianism is another interpretation that may be based on this film. There are several ways to explain Alice's activities. And his unreasonable detention with regard to Lisa can also be explained as a lesbian desire. Given that she encourages Lisa to forgive her current boy, it may be far removed. But I felt like she was a lesbian for a long time. He also avoids adding questions about the boy. She spends a lot of time with Lisa and she is happy during this time. This can lead to many sexual orientation being questioned. <br /> <br /> In general, I'd give it 9/10. I think it deserves it, but I divorced it because of the transcription factor. I think it's a perfect movie otherwise.
