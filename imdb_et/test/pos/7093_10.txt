Not surprisingly, the majority of the higher rated votes were made by women aged 45 and over. This is the lifetime of women as carers for older and sick parents. In June I lost my mother from the complications of cancer and went through most of the same emotions that Zellweger portrayed in this film. Yes, it made me cry, but the tears were real, the characters were real and the plot was very accurate. Knit all the cast and the crew for a great life and death, and for future promises.
