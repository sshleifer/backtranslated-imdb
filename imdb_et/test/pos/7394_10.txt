Some say this film is a blame for pleasure. I loved this flick, but I don't feel guilty. You can say that the whole cast and the team have fun making this movie. But Jack Frost 2 doesn't go well with some people. From the very beginning you can say this movie is cheesy and it is definitely an amateur look. Well, if you get the privilege of watching this movie after Jack Frost 2: Mutant Killer Snowman's revenge is a joy, not an innocent pleasure. Now, because I can't complete ten lines, here are the big scenes: <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Three women on the beach were dead. The first was in Jack's tree, trying to stay with one of them. He disappeared so he fell down. The next woman fell on the ice buffer. The latter was stapled with eyelets. The other big one was where two surfers were standing near a frozen pole. One of them gets stuck in their tongue (of course). Jack Frost pulls his tongue out, saying "COWA-TONGUE-A DUDE!". Well, you have to see it for yourself. <br /> <br /> And of course, the snowball kids threw their ass. <br /> <br /> ** FINAL TIMES ** <br /> <br /> Infinite Stars
