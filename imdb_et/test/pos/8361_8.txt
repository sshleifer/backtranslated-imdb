Like many episodes of twilight zones, one of my favorites was the public social commentary that Serling makes a story. As in the recent episode "The Howling Man", I was reminded that my long-standing suspicion that, for example, Jesus should come to earth to bring his followers to heaven, is immediately understood to be mad and likely to be thrown into refuge. Our main character in this episode responds to a similar problem when we try to convince Americans of the 1860s that he is the future and that President Lincoln has already been murdered. The episode wrongly states that it means that some parts of the past can be changed while others cannot, but it is still a fun time to travel. <br /> <br /> We don't know if we can change history with history, because time has never been achieved and unfortunately it has never been. However, it seems to me logical that if you could physically put yourself in the past, you could physically prevent something like you did not speak like shouting murders. <br /> <br /> One of the consistently interesting things about time movies and TV shows is, in my opinion, the way in which time is happening. There's no way here, our main character speaks of time travel to the gentleman's gentlemen's club and then walks out and leaves from the early 1960s to the mid-1860s, but no matter what. The Twilight Zone has not yet hit me for complex sets or high product values. <br /> <br /> Russell Johnson plays a part of journalist Peter Corrig and discovered he was somehow transported back to the exact day of Lincoln's murder, he managed to throw himself into jail, but fortunately John Wilkes Booth just hanged in the police station and heard for some reason a desperate Corrigan, who is desperately trying to describe that Booth's plan this night. <br /> <br /> Booth calls for Corrigan's correction for some psychiatric attempts and the police officer does not see anything wrong when he gives up this man. After all, he had a business card, how bad was he? <br /> <br /> The show shows that you can change people's lives by changing past events slightly over time, and if I don't want to accept that travel includes such restrictions, it's still a fun episode that really thinks what is one of my favorite choices in a good twilight zone.
