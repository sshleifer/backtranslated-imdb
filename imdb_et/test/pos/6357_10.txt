First of all, I have to say that I don't speak Spanish and I usually don't get Spanish-speaking movies ... BUT Two Coyotes are an extraordinary film. There is enough action and hard drama that it does not matter to his Spanish film. Subtitles were easy to read and did not block action - OR Drama! <br /> <br /> I would say that fans of Spanish-language films and non-fans of Spanish-language movies would see this movie. Action and drama are worth every penny. <br /> <br />
