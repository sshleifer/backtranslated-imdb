The second "Eko" episode has somewhat less interesting feedback than the first ("23rd Psalm"), but in almost all other departments it is one of the best episodes of season 2, promoting a series of mythology / background as well as characters. Locke and Eko discover the new Dharma Initiative - The Pearl - and their discovered and traceable orientation film ends with Locke's transformation from a believer ("Orientation" - after the end of the movie: "We've got to see it again)" to the suspect ("SOS" - "Did you reject this button, Henry? I need to know ") not to a believer ("? "- after the end of the movie:" Do you want to watch it again? - "No, I've seen enough"). Terry O'Quinn's performance is as powerful as usual ("every other pathetic little life is as useless as this button") Meanwhile, Eko takes on as a man who is sure to be on the island as part of a true destiny, which is to continue the button pressing. Others "?" being a human B (this is a bold idea that LOST's current season can be much more used) and Libby's last word haunted scene before h a special death and the way Jack and Hurley don't know its true meaning. *** 1/2 out of four.
