When Northfork debuted at the Cannes Film Festival, they didn't like many because they felt it was boring and too slow. Although I agree that it was slow (one of the slowest films of the year), it was not boring. As Roger Ebert said, there has never been a movie like Northfork. I usually disagree with Ebert, but when he tells the truth. Although John Sayles' Sunshine State may have the same direct themes, nothing I've ever seen or known can compare to the outstanding originality of the Polish brothers Northfork. <br /> <br /> Northfork is a perfect example of how many times it is better to go a few minutes to go to the latest Jack Black movie instead. The plot is not a hessney, cookie-cutter plot; it's just so amazingly original. In the small town of Montana, called Northfork, there is a nearby dam that is about to be landed. Therefore, the entire city must be evacuated. But some people just don't want to leave. In the lateral field, the young orphan (Duel Farnes) is very sick and linen; he takes care of his father Harlan (Nick Nolte). The boy depicts himself as a fallen angel, so he helps him through illness. <br /> <br /> While much of the movie is simple, some of it can give David Lynch money for him. Fellini's pride is odd weathering, weird, wood, big dog star and symbolism. This is not as confusing as Lynch's film, but it's still quite strange. That makes Northfork so big: it's so simple and so simple and plausible. <br /> <br /> Northfork has this magical feeling: almost as you look at something you are not sure what it is, but you feel it. As I said earlier, I agreed with Ebert about how this movie is different. But I disagree if he says it's not fun. He says it's just "tempting". Maybe he thought he should give him good reviews, because everyone else is, but instead of being slow, I thought it was a lot of fun, something that many dramas are unable to do now. <br /> <br /> Northfork may not be the fastest movie or the most popular movie, but when you get to it and through it, you will be very surprised as I was. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> PG-13 is a short sexuality.
