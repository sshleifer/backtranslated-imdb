Often happens, as the Hollywood film impresses young people. Not only does it last a lifetime, it inspires him to explore a career in old cultures. It was the 1954 film "Egypt". At this point, the audience was amazed by the set of sets, costumes and great performance of the film, so that other films soon followed in vain. This is the story of a young Egyptian boy who stayed with parents less quickly after birth. With such a suspicious start it is not difficult to think about why he spends his life by asking questions. The boy Sinuhe (Sin-oh-way), which means that "the one who is alone" (Edmund Purdom) grows masculine and continues to ask why, even if he has graduated from the Life School, he becomes a doctor. In his year of development, he acquires a life-long friend, Kaptah, who has been a great player (Peter Ustinov) and Horemheb (Victor Mature), who raises the defender from a simple officer to the army leader. His life offers everything from the rapid rise of social status to the condemned offender, the dead, the miraculous healer, and finally the life-long station he never expected. The fine actor goes to Jean Simmons as Merit, Michael Wilding as Akhnaton, Bella Darv's bully, Nefer and John Carradine as a memorable Grave Robber. Tommy Rettig, Thoti, son of Egypt. In the last few years, "He who is alone" is finally discovering what he was looking for all his life, which he suppresses his son, now taking care of his lifelong friend. Great movie! ****
