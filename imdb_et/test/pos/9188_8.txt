It was a movie that at the end thought "now it was enjoyable for 2 hours!" I hate spending about $ 20 (except for $ $ baby outfits) for my husband and myself to be "feeling". <br /> <br /> I think I like Will Smith better than a comic actor as an action hero. He was well cast in it. His character was very pleasant, as did Kevin James. <br /> <br /> There were several laugh out loud scenes. It's also a romantic movie, so guys, if you want to impress your life, take her here. Women love it as much as any chick, but I wouldn't classify it as one. There are many men with humor to enjoy men. I think this is one reason why this movie is as perfect as a movie. It has romance and strokes. I don't usually like as much as it is, but it wasn't superfluous and I can't think of those scenes that don't laugh. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie. The first thing my husband told me after it was "I want to see it again!"
