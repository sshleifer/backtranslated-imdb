Although Dr. Seuess should have been credited with "Horton Hatches The Egg" for robbery, it was a good film. It touched both emotions and intellect. Particularly because of the incredible result of the seven-year-old Justin Henry and the sympathetic scenario of each symbol (and every contradiction), the thought-provoking elements are long after the tears are drawn. In general, it is a good actor, great leadership and a very powerful script. With the right sense of humor will help keep the "heavy" topic quite tedious or difficult to sit down. Finally, this film is a test of time and does not seem in any way decades after its release.
