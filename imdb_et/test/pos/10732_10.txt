I've seen a lot of Dustin Hoffman movies, such as Straw Dogs or Rain Man, and I liked them, but his characters are often calm or even shy. I was expecting him to be the same as he was in Straw Dogs, but I saw a completely different person. He was much more energetic in this film and reminded me of Al Pacinot Serpico. The film was very interesting from start to finish. I liked how Dustin Hoffman's character was ready to do almost anything to stay with his son. This film is also revealing. Personally, I think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise that they themselves do not involve.
