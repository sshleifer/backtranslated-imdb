"Tempest" is a somewhat self-conscious, uneven, discursive film. But like another Greek visitor, Lord Byron protested his friend John Murray about his self-sensitive and discursive "Don Juan", "It may be bad, but isn't it life, isn't it?" > <br /> Connections to Shakespeare's "Tempest" may seem like a bit of a commentator here. But after reading the movie "Tempest", watch the movie again and they look beyond. This makes this film wrong, because it is an inconvenient blend of ordinary, ordinary narrative and sudden, obvious improvisation, especially between Cassavetes and Rowland. But to be honest, these scenes are the most remarkable and captivating in the film when they are the hardest to watch. <br /> <br /> The music of this movie, made by Stomu Yamashta, is also neglected. Particularly good is the perfect little piece played with the afternoon siesta, like people, animals and the seemingly collapse of the whole island to sleep in the hottest part of the afternoon. It is a superb moment and represents the best aspect of this film, and one thing that keeps it somewhat uniform is the fact that (in addition to extensive setbacks and end) it is one day on the island, from waking up to night. In general, I would look at this film more than a hundred times as any bombing Hollywood piece. And in fact, I thought it was being tracked several times ten times. For the most part, I see something I didn't miss before. <br /> <br /> (Confession: I am biased. This was the second film I saw on my Greek-American goddess's wife.) <br /> <br /> Trivia marks this flick: <br /> <br /> - It was both Molly Ringwald's first film and Sam Robards; <br /> <br /> - It wasn't filmed on the island, but on the southern trolley of Gytheion, a remote peninsula in the Peloponnese of Greece; <br /> <br /> - (according to today's standards) made the primitive special effects Bran Ferren, who later became Disney's Imagineering leader and later was the United States Intelligence Community Advisor, <br /> <br /> - director Paul Mazursky chose his recent autobiography entitled "Show Me Magic", "Tempest".
