NO SPOILERS !! <br /> <br /> After Hitchcock's successful first American film Rebecca, based on Daphne DuMarier's lush novel and intrigue, he returned with some of his earlier British period-known themes - mistaken identity and espionage. Since the US was based on World War II and extensive civilian forces, building planes, weapons, and other necessary militias, the evolving movie entertainment company began to change the wartime theme of paranoid and often jingist thrillers. These thrillers often included, among the shadows, networks of deceptive and qualified operators among good, law-abiding citizens. Knowing that the director was in this genre of espionage, producer Jack Skirball turned to Hitchcock to direct the property he possessed that dealt with corruption, sabotage of wartime, and a helpless hero who pulled the vortex of coincidence and mistaken identity. The darker elements of the narrative and the keen sense of Dorothy Parker's literary model (with his short style in Hollywood before he returned to his bohemian roots in NYC) who wrote the script were ideal for Hitchcock's sensitivity. <br /> <br /> This often neglected film speaks of a deplorable 25-year-old Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) working on a Los Angeles aircraft factory, meeting a new employee with Frank Fry (Norman Lloyd) and moments later sabotage. Escaping from the authorities who do not believe in their far-flung story, he meets several characters on his way to Soda City Utah and finally to New York. These memorable characters are a circus caravan with a car full of useful "freake" and popular stall model Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane), who fall in love with her life and the worst crisis of national security! Of course, Hitchcock's land falls on Patricia, who is expected to be kidnapped by the alleged saboteur Barry, adding a romantic tension to the mix. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock develops a national network for a good form. old ladies, middle Joes, and respectable businessmen who double secret terrorists who harbor criminals, pull weapons and bombs to move things. This is a terrible plot that takes its time to move on and when it burns, culminates with one of Hitchcock's most memorable finals. See incredibly life like NYC tourist attractions (all created by Hollywood art directors, thanks to the "firefighting" ban in public attractions). Although Saboteur may not be one of Hitchcock's best-known films, it is a popular b-movie, which is sure to be sure and appealing with lots of smart spots and, as usual, a terrible Hitchcock villain. Remember to look for the other side of the movie with a Hitchcock camouflage look outside the drug store. Hitchcock's original comb idea, which was shot (he fought in the sign language with his deaf spouse), was defeated by the Bureau of Standards and Practices, who feared deaf damage!
