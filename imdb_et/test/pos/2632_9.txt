I agree with all the above comments. This exhibition was a joy to watch. Funny, witty, terrible acting and girl. It is always an excitement to find an exhibition that is wisely written, assuming that the audience has a brain and a subtle sense of humor. I would spend good, hard earned money to see it again on DVD. And as long as we're asking for a Smart Series that has never been able to ... How is the maximum Bob released from the DVD (another well-written, odd duck event with a plethora of characters.) And add a list. .. Middle Ages or Frank's Place. These examples can be released from vaults and dedicated to fans and new audiences.
