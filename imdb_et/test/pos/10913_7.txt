The most fun presentation was Shalom Harlow, like Matt Dillon's supermodel girlfriend. He was more interesting to me than all the main players. This movie got it all wrong; even the most reliable century actress Joan Cusask was unable to rise to the plot's ridicule. I enjoyed listening to the villagers by "Macho Man" for the final sums. The rest of the film could have been acceptable if it rose to such an energy level.
