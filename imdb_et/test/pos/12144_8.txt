A career and criminal boss, Abel Davos (Lino Ventura) has been running for over 10 years, hiding out of Milan, Italy. In his absence, he was sentenced to death for his crime in his home country. She is disappointed with her life in Italy and the police who closed her have decided to return to her old floor in Paris. Sending his wife Theres and two young boys to Nice, Abel and her next Raymond Naldi make one final blessing to finance her new life in France. Mr. Proffers has a little less than half a million francs, the fewer their sources were, despite the fact that, in pursuit of the police, they both do it in Nice, where they briefly hide. After stealing the local recreational craft, they catch a tourist point in San Remo, where they mix more easily, but they are stopped by armed customs officers on an abandoned beach, shot out and Therese and Naldi are both killed. Currently, the police are easily wounded by two caught children who have been wounded, so he calls his old friends in Paris to send help, but they have moved on because their old friend hid in hiding and is not too inclined to take the risk, so they send a little thief, Eric Stark (Jean Paul Belmondo) to save him. Davos is disgusting to send such a spouse to his help, even though he is striking it with a charming Stark to find out why he's caught, but their betrayal doesn't stop there. /> <br /> Classe Tous Risques (aka Big Risk) was screened by former death penalty and offender Jose Giovanni (Le Trou, Le Clan des Siciliens), with Ventura for the project, Giovanniwanted someone who is unique in project management, Ventura proposes to assist the director's assistant, who had received his attention to the previous project, Claude Sautet, who was best known for helping Georges Franju at Les Yeux sans Visage. Sautet immediately agreed and the rest, as they say, is history. Sautet designed a fine gangster film that plays a lot of characters and relationships. Davos constantly hides enough time to contemplate his life, past, present and future, his friendships that no longer seem to be what he believed, his dead wife, and his two young sons. Ventura, as a character's actor, has always been astonished at me, as comfortable as convincing for both the police and the criminal society, here his tired performance in the world is overwhelming and powerful, because his world is crumbling around him, such as loneliness and loneliness. The former profession of Ventura as a pro wrestler will be of great benefit if he throws the couples of the Parisians into perfect simplicity. Belmondo as Stark animates another movie in his relationship with the girls who meet on the journey. His direct charm, his fire to the woman who is in danger of being just "Voleur", and that "my only good thing is my left" when he strikes his aggressor is also a joy to see him fall anyway. Belmondo's presentation was neglected at that time, as Godard's A bout de Souffl√© appeared only three weeks earlier, Godard got credit for discovering a new child, his versatility between the two films, being there to see and admire everyone there. Sautet's film is a stylish thing with a lot of attractive locations, the film has very little dialogue, Sautet prefers to let the actors work to find a story that is enough to defeat. check out more about Sautet's work in the future.
