If you want to spend time, it's a movie. <br /> <br /> Take the prerequisite - this is the college that admits BA, B.Com, M.Com, MA with the minimum qualifications. MBA, MCA, BE, M.Tech and BCA. So you have to take into account the time spent and so it is obvious that all students are 40+. The school also recognizes the "heavier" abandonment of students and also considers the P.Hd course, and the only student who did not, of course, is Manisha Koirala. Only he was a snake in an earlier life. Still not convinced? OK read on. <br /> <br /> There is a scene here. College student Akshay Kumar is wanted by Armani and takes out bazooka and fires her! Then the grenades throw. Then one of the grenades will hit Akshay. But not to die and continue to fight, snake, Arman, falls to Akshay on the foot of a taxi and punches on it, but Akshay is still there. Then Akshay arrives at jet ski and follows Arman. They fight and Arman strangles Akshay underwater and finally Akshay is dead. So we think that as soon as Arman is out of the picture, Akshay will go to this college director Raj Babbar + Boxing Refree + Parapsychology as a professor + mumbling priest. one takes a cake, but a certain Mr Nigam. You can learn more. :-)
