Inglorious Basterds is a dark and violent comic fantasy. Based on the dirty tenth framework, Inglorious Basterds builds the obtuse training sequences of The Dirty Dozen to get there right away. In the process, Tarantino fixes one of Dirty Dosen's main mistakes, giving bad guys the screen to remind us of the bad Nazis. The Nazis, who have the most screen time, become the most perfect person in the film, ironically making them even worse for monsters. <br /> <br /> By mixing training sequences, Tarantino can give us a picture. throughout the war, showing us not only British, American and German soldiers, but also gives us a glimpse into the world of French and German civilians, both co-workers and resilience. the film has a fantastic dialogue, but when Tarantino decided that French characters speak French and the Germans speak German, Tarantino adds that his dialogue in French was so sharp and funny and clever as in the English dialogue. <br /> <br /> The case of Hans Landa (Christian Waltz), a Nazi Jewish hunter SS Colonel, listening to French dairy producer Perrier LaPadit (Denis Menochet) during the opening order. Landa suspects that LaPadite hides the Jewish family. LaPadit is pushed fine by Landa's glass of milk. After she slips herself, Landa LaPadit congratulates her daughters and her cows, "à votre famille et à vos vaches, je dis bravo." The thing is, in French, "vache" means a cow, but it's also a vaginal name. When this vulgar fraud is intimidated, Landa can quite argue that she does not understand French well enough to understand it, but Landa means it and it means a threat. And LaPadite understands its meaning too well. <br /> <br /> It is really a subtle action and word game that many viewers don't try, or at least they can understand the subconscious without knowing the exact nature of the threat. The film is rich with such a detail. The whole French and English dialogue is chosen with the same attention to detail, and although I can't swear to the German, I suspect it shows a similar level of craft. <br /> <br /> Inglorious Basterds opens the phrase "At one time ... Nazi occupied France". Personally, it reminds me of the opening of every Asterix book and film, another comic fantasy of a war-ridden occupied France. Like Asterix, the Inglorious Basterds are funny funny even though the film becomes dark. <br /> <br /> In the toughest moments, Inglorious Basterds reminds us that the first victims of war are compassion and the ability to relax. <br /> <br /> Tarantino reminds us that the film is dangerous, even flammable, and that its power deserves respect. <br /> <br /> When you see this movie as I did in a packed theater full of knowledgeable fans who get every joke that you see this masterful movie as it was seen. If you're not so happy, everything you see is a great, great movie that offers a darkly funny punch.
