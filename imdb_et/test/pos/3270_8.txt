Jimmy (Heath Ledger) gives a simple job to the kingpin of Pando (Bryan Brown) to give money to a specific address, but if no one meets the door, Jimmy decides to go to the beach for a while, but he notices that his clothes on the sand are confusing and 10 big lost. Jimmy tells Panda to tell him the problem, but he doesn't want to hear it. Pando and his boys try their best to find Jimmy, which no longer means Jimmy when they get him. Now, Jimmy is going to hide the bank's robbery to get Pando back. Even during this confusion, he meets innocently sweet Alex (Rose Byrne) and, together with one hell, crosses the King of Sydney. <br /> <br /> "Two Hands" is just appealing to me a movie that is brisk, exhilarating and incredibly fresh. What you have here is pretty much a city gangster movie with a poor background and violence on your face? what, how this fresh you ask? Well, because it takes us to the underworld where Australian culture shines off criminals who wear straps (bicycles) and short pants for football. and will not forget the Australian sense of humor, dry and sarcastic. You can say that it is a lot of inspiration for "Pulp Fiction", "Goodfellas" (my stupid) and "Lock, stock and two smoking pillars", but for me it is still a separate one. The film has a real mess of light moments, but also of an average draw with some unexpected shock and black humor that can actually disturb you. You just don't know what's coming and it has nice funny irony (especially the end) and good humor. One scene involving bank robbery gives you stitches, I guarantee you. The plot contour is really an age story (or a path that hasn't been taken), accompanied by a punching love story, and then a gangster element to end it. Most sub-plots were wisely constructed and interconnected, maybe maybe he could have gone without a supernatural element connected to Jimmy's dead brother, but in a general context, a versatile plot seems to be all together. An intense, natural and crisp dialogue filled with a terribly colorful script where Aussie Slang / Twang Quick Jeans is a fair dinkum! <br /> <br /> What really made the movie was Bryan Brown's Pando. He gave his character to such a harshly charismatic / disgusting person that if he wasn't on the screen he still seemed. He gave his character to two sides - one to jab, but the other half has such a good flap. Young Rose Byrne glows with her nervous sweet / peculiar character Alex. He looked radically proud and added a bubble personality. Then you have a Heath Ledger who fits naive Jimmy. With great support, Susie Porter, Tom Long, David Field, Steve Vidler and Steve Le Marquand are cast. Such raw power has been achieved and you will get riveting, fun and credible signs. Powderfinger and Alex Lloyd are like pumping the rock music to burst into a cool vibe. Also when picking up the place of the King of Sydney, it really helped to keep his life and showing his way of life in Australia. Sliding the camera into the tricks took the city perfectly, especially the nightclub. It was a movie that ended I was completely satisfied with what I got. All in all, a slippery lively thriller that will achieve what it is going to do ... fun, smart and crazy skater with excitement and excitement. <br /> <br /> I say it's a successful Aussie "Lock", Stock and two smokers "director / writer Gregor Jordan in his debut film. If you come across it, don't be afraid to go.
