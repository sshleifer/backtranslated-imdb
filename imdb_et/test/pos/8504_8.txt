The famous French detective Henri Cassin takes his first vacation in 11 years in St. Petersburg. Margot, where she meets Nanette, the daughter of vacationers. Despite Nanette's admission to childhood, Leon, Henri and Nanette love to marry, despite Nanette's father's objection to Henry's age. On his wedding day, Leon and Nanette will return after him. There is nothing to hear of these two until both are dead, and Henri swears that he will not rest until he finds the killer. The only idea that Henri needs to work is Leon's footprint, but he has also warned in writing that others will soon die. Soon Nanette's mother will be found dead and Henri doesn't know what kills the killer. Thinking of himself as a failure, he understands (and fears) that only one person can be a killer, although none of his colleagues can believe his explanation. The mystery of a conventional murder that Columbia or other B studios do not really fit into any other genre. The credit is that it's definitely going to be directed by Lewis, who can turn this film into a tough film, supported by good camera work and lighting. Geray, with very good results, is probably his only lead and the rest is capable of performing. Assessment, 8.
