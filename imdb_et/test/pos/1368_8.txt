Man, I can't believe in much of this movie's harsh and negative comments. Okay, this is certainly not a complicated job of cinematic art. But this is a lot of fun sticky fun. For starters, the title of pumpkin seemingly a killer guy must be one of the most ridiculously silly and unscary things ever to stumble in front of the camera; she looks like something you would see in the fourth class carnival spookhouse. Secondly, moderate gore is ridiculously falsified and convincing, with a strong emphasis on this annoying ultra-conservative woman receiving an electric shock by the toaster. Then there is always the wonderful welcome of Linnea Quigley, who has taken a memorable introduction to a nice, long and totally free shower lasting two minutes. Surprisingly, we also have the legends of the killed script, John Carradine appearing as an evil soldier, and Cameron Mitchell as a host of the TV show. What's more, Brinke Stevens and Dawn Wildsmith have short fires. The leading child actor Ryan Latshaw designs all the magic of the old wooden stump and the ability to act. Pretty brunette Rachel Carter jumps her top and bares her cute little breasts. The special effects of Cruddy are significantly smaller than special ones. The result is appropriately burned. However, this film has some amazing appeal, which in turn makes this honey a really pleasant hair.
