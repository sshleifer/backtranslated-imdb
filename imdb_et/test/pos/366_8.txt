It is a well-designed part of all the favorite masters. As usual, technical elements such as camera operation and lighting are prominent (especially during movie). I didn't find the first part of the movie very exciting, but the latter has definitely done it with one exciting scene after another. <br /> <br /> The only thing I didn't like about this movie was the selection of Farley Granger's part of Guy Haines. Somehow I didn't find him very credible. On the other hand, Robert Walker looks like a bad "bad guy" Bruno Anthony. <br /> <br /> In general, I would highly recommend this.
