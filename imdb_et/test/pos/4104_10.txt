It may be a remake of Capra's 1937 movie, but it's wrong to consider it just this way! It had to reveal the Hilton novel in a completely different way. As musical is great. The terrain is terrible, the characters are good and everything like "Leonard Maltin", who thinks Bacharachi's music is terrible, must be completely deaf! I highly recommend it.
