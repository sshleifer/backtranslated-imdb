Otto Preminger "The Human with Golden Scarf" is a reference to heroin addiction - something that, in 1955, fifty years ago, was quite risky for the film (nowadays the censor has a problem with drug content in films!). br /> <br /> Leading position was initially offered to Marlon Brando, then Frank Sinatra blamed before Brando replied. Sinatra represents a convincing pro-card dealer and former heroin addict who is returning home to find the demons of temptation. <br /> <br /> Preminger is one of my favorite leaders (his "anatomy of murder" James Stewart is the main and revolutionary courtroom drama). Preminger helped change the face of the cinema very much in the 1950s - the "anatomy of murder" was extremely controversial when it came out of both its plot and its content (references to rape, women's panties, "seduction, etc."). and the "Golden Scarf" deals with a subject that is equally volatile. <br /> <br /> But Preminger pulls it off without becoming exploitative. It's like the predecessor of "The Panic in Needle Park" (1971) and has more than a couple of similarities in the general motifs of classic Billy Wilder's "Lost Weekend", starring Ray Milland. Especially these three films are probably the best films about alcoholism before 1980 and are still relevant.
