After 1976-1979 In a small screen, there were five seasons, "George & Mildred" gave a big screen in the mid-1980s. Instead of Johnnie Mortimer and Brian Cooke, Dick Sharples maintained his role as a writer. writer. Unfortunately, this movie customization did not appear to be in the public domain. Shame. I liked it better than the series itself. It was a fault of joy. <br /> <br /> Mildred Roper (Yootha Joyce) wants to know if his wife George (Brian Murphy) has remembered his wedding anniversary. Obviously he has not done so, but to try and convince his wife, otherwise he will write a table in the restaurant where he married Mildred several years ago. <br /> <br /> When they arrive at the restaurant, they find the place has changed. In the end, Mildred George sees the falsehood of celebrating his anniversary at a swanky hotel. Upon arriving at the hotel, George's mistake is "Harry Pinto" (Stratford Johns) for a ruthless hit who wants to destroy the rival! <br /> <br /> No comedy like this, but good-natured jokes all the same. It was planned to end the series after the film was finished, unfortunately, when Yootha Joyce died on August 24, 1980, in alcohol poisoning. <br /> <br /> Funnier moment - George talks about his favorite diagnosis. His neighbor Tristram pulls up behind him and says, "I think we had a conversation." George, thinking he has developed the power of speech, will fall into gnome dance! <br /> <br /> Merry Christmas for other IMDb users, especially AdamFontaine, Cyril Blake, and TheLittleSongBird. Is good!
