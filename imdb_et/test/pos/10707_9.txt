The times are the story of hope highlighted by the tragic reality of our young faces. Favela Rising pulls one into a frightening, insecure and unfair world and shows beautiful color and moving music, as one man and his dedicated friends decide not to accept this world and change it through action and art. An entertaining, interesting, emotional and aesthetically beautiful film. I also showed this film to many high school students who all live in poverty and weapons violence in the neighborhood and who were in love with the protagonist Anderson. I recommend this movie to all ages over 13 (due to subtitles and some death images) from all backgrounds.
