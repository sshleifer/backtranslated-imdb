Located in Los Angeles in the 1970s, Christopher Boyce has just left school and returned home when his father got a job where he was watching intelligence. His old friend, Daulton Lee, is a robbed drug dealer who has been detained and has to choose a chewing coat or long imprisonment. Behind the bail, Mexico jumps and travels. Chris offers a partnership with Lee to be his messenger who sells secret papers to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico, for the disgrace that he feels over US governments under control of weaker countries. But over time, these two will come into contact with their motivation and will find something bigger than they originally intended. <br /> <br /> Director John Schlesinger is a movie such as "Midnight Cowboy", "Marathon Man", "Sunday Bloody Sunday" and "John's Day". Although "The Falcon and Snowman" may not keep it high, there is no doubt that this amazing espionage drama (inspired by a real incident) is a portrait of an unfairly neglected character. All that is is a rather modest thing that lacks real big features that will hit a huge brand. The film's motive must be the admirable versatile performance of Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn as two ambitious young men from Chris and Dault. The penny is especially good with its restless intensity, which works well in Hutton's cool and collected ring. What starts with just as easy, we look at the situation to gradually crumble, as two amateurs really get out of their league. The highly detailed and symbolic (predatory behavior) chart focuses mainly on a couple's relationships and their way of thinking for their actions, which ultimately shows us the hard developments that led to their decline. The plan opens like a wound that would never heal because of Deathon's drug addiction, which really puts it off the track and leaves Chris with all this. An exciting political aspect exists, but it focuses on the themes of idealism (Boyce) and greed (Lee) to get this point. Both do not interfere and the results show. The excitement is justified by its stimulating pot-kicking script and its characteristic interactions, which are then the case with visual tricks. The activity is very small, but still the Schlesinger-secured and actually dark zero pressure. Penetration is usually well done, although some sequences seem to be too long, but still seize you when it plays its authentic paranoid tone to slowly build up to an explosive tension. Integrated into technical production, it is a gently irritating music score and professionally poignant cinematography. Supporting casting is exceptionally good with Pat Hingle, Lori Singer, David Suchet, Boris Leskin, Jerry Hardin and Joyce Van Patten. Also look at Michael Ironside's small parts as an FBI agent. <br /> <br /> A predominantly spectacular spy movie that is largely useful for talented performing arts and not for ordinary games. It's a more emotional journey, it's complicated. Recommended.
