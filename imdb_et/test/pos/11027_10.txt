I watched this movie in the 75s and this film was an open mind for me to care for Naturi and wild life. When I got 83 from the dog, I called her TRUSKA (in the movie ..A dog of the candle) that this movie will never be forgotten. By the way, I have a copy of this movie, but it is in Portuguese and quality is not as good as DVD or new VHS (i recorded almost 20 years ago and SLP fast. So quality is not so good ..) <br /> <br /> If someone wants a copy .. I'm trying to convert to DVD and I'll send you OK? <br /> <br /> Ot's great movie and I agree that the movie is always traceable. <br /> <br /> Waldemar Braz - Sao Paulo / Brazil
