Ghilli is the best movie of vijay and one of his biggest hits of the career .... Because I didn't see the Telegu movie so I could enjoy that movie even more. The story is about a girl who wants to escape a local goon who wants to marry her forcibly. Because he is a goon, no body is ready to help the heroine. Vijay, who played Kijad's game, sees it and decides to help her. The rest of the movie is how vijay helps and how the girl finally escapes from the gon & goon father's political crown ties. The movie has many moments of seat thriller and keeps the viewer shut until the end. Vijay is a very good Kabad player. Trisha, Ashish Vidyarthi, all vijay friends, have all done their job professionally. The criminals of Prakashraj must be mentioned in particular. The character of the scraper has been properly etched and prakashraj has portrayed it very well. Surprisingly, for the first time, I felt compassion for evil. The "Hi Chellam" dialogue is indeed caught in the masses. Vidyasagar's music is brilliant and the song 'apadi podu' is a rage ... Dharani must be credited with a nice masala movie that is enjoyed not only by the hard fans, but also by the general Tamil film audience around the world.
