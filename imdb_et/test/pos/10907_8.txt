It's really a funny movie. His tape-made dance scene is one of the funniest scenes I remember. I thought the scene at the high school graduation ceremony "I am gay" is somewhat surreal, even though it was funny. Looking at the third time, I started to pick up small small segments. One was when Matt Dillon's girl, a classic ditz, tried to use a phone number she hadn't used before. Kevin Klein made this film a success for Tom Selleck. It was also the first time I rated Debbie Reynolds; he proved he could be funny. He confirmed this in the TV series "Will and Grace". One of the discoveries I found after the third viewing is Lauren Ambrose's 6 Feet Under. He's out with his red bangs, but it's obvious that it's one of his first films. Bob Newhart is also very funny on high school.
