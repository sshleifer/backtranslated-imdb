Hey, his big don't have to wait for the next Star-Trek convention to see the hick-track! It's a cheesy film that has a lot of treckies without a budget, but a good opportunity to spend an hour. They got most of the special effects, the dialogue is a classic trek and it just seems like the right trek-knockoff.
