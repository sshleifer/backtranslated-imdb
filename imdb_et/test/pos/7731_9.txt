Extremely gentle playing of Shakespeare (and much more open than the Forbidden Planet). It is always a pleasure to look at Cassavetes and even more so that Gena Rowlands shares the attention. His role in Prospero's role fits well with what he adds to the story. This is especially the case in the foreground when his stranger spouse and his lover are determined by a storm during a boat trip (with a suitable selection of Stomu Yamashta "Go"). It is just one of the moments of the film, where the line between reality and fantasy becomes blurred and the viewer has the feeling that magic is more possible than believing. Add to it the excellent performance of Raul Julia, as well as the good work of Susan Sarandon, Vittorio Gassman and Molly Ringwald, and the movie becomes a nice little treat to occupy the space behind your eyes.
