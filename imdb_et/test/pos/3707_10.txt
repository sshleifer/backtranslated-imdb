This film was made directly in the area where I grew up and now live. I personally know most of the real estate owners in different places in the movie. As a teenager, I worked with Ron Perlman, Jonathon Furr, and car-separated roads in the surrounding fields that were later in the movie. I have been told that Jonathon Furr and Ben Allison are natives of NC. I was happy to see it at a local show. At this show, there was one of the people who helped to choose the location of movies and secure props such as a bus (1938 Greyhound). The bus had no reverse and during the filming the driver missed his stop for a while and had to drive several miles to return to a suitable location. These details of the technical issues added pleasure to me. The film accurately depicts life in this region during World War II. Well done movie and I'm looking forward to DVD availability.
