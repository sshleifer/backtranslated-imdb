I was in the early 20s, finishing college when this movie appeared. Seeing it was a high-impact event, not only because of the high quality of the film (as evidenced by its many awards), but because of its place in the 1959 historical context. to understand that my college had started (carefully reviewed) black students only in 1953. In 1959, the main, high-budget extravagant was almost entirely black and white special novelty. <br /> <br /> The film was presented with a luxurious roadshow (reserved seating) presentation only in the best theaters, with a souvenir program that describes light and color, multiple stereo sound, and so on. the knowledge was in the movie. Gershwin's music, excellently performed and the universal humanity of hope, was tremendously touching. <br /> <br /> I have recently been able to get a lost copy of the movie's two-hour cut and recurring views have confirmed my opinion. Time has done that the sexual scenes that appeared in 1959 seemed rather annoying, but the musical quality has not diminished. Sammy Davis and Pearl Bailey are masterful in their portraits. What kind of crime does today's young black artists fail to see these performers at the top of their career?
