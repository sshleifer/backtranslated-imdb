If you are tired of the same repetitive, unknown material that the mainstream film industry publishes, you will enjoy "You're Alone". It is thought to be provocative, well-fired and riveted. a middle class environment that works as a sender and discovers his neighbor. The vast majority of the film is in the hotel room where he hired him. But the film is not frustrating. It speaks of dark things without depression. You come to think a lot about it. I like this in the movie.
