Jean Renoir's respect for the late 19th century Paris is beautiful in many ways. Toulouse-Lautrec and Mucha have not only photographed it, but are geographical in Paris; The streets that are accessible only with stairwells, the unfortunate end to popularity and the uncompromising image of the product sold for sexual opportunism in the product, in sharp contrast to the Hollywood painted picture. Lloyd Bacon's "42nd Street", made about 20 years ago, is an obvious comparison, where the dance-feeling is Ruby Keeler, a fresh-faced child who came to New York to get a show business that saves the show if the star fails - "You're going to have a boy there, but you have to come back to STAR!" "Julian Marsh" by Warner Baxter is a director who carries his art and is unrecognized. Jean Gabin's "Danglard" continues genital policy, but when he talks about this show, he's more like Knute Rockne than Julian Marsh. He's all out of the game except his witty thing. She has a lucrative new venture that has been sewn until her mistress changes into a jealous woman she knows next. His future prospects rise and fall with every such journey. <br /> <br /> Danglard takes Mistress 1 (Lola de Castro, played by Maria Felix) diving into a dive where she sees "Nini" (Fran√ßoise Arnoul) with her boyfriend and first lover Paulo. discovers that he is a living dancer. She uses her magic and money outlook to attract Nin's dance to learn to go on stage. The prospect of money and fame blesses Nin and becomes Danglar's next mistress, as well as a Canaanic student, whom Danglard has called "French Cancan" to satisfy the current Anglophile tendency of dance. <br /> Both "42. St" and "French Cancan" are honors to showcase business - modern entertainment - with its own iconography and its own mind. "42.nd." is focused on Julian Marsh, the great leader of Broadway exhibitions, which he organizes with great personal energy and suspicious sexual involvement. A minor of men is a medieval chick who is lumbago, replaced by Dick Powell, a pretty rich shelter of asylum. Danglard, on the other hand, goes from woman to woman, pleading with the promise of fame, grabbing them with what has been a very convincing gift. There is no doubt that he is heterosexual and quite active. Postcoital scenes are abundant. <br /> <br /> Days after leaving Nin Paul, he has discovered the type of Ester, Piaf and started to prepare him to sing the movie song when he plays it on his violin. This, of course, creates Nin's jealousy, as he has caused Lola's jealousy. (And, of course, Nini had already promised a prerogative of the Tsar!) The whole film talks about how Danglar's conceptualism has paid him money, but how even his troublesome horniness is subjected to his love for the show - how the viewer requires commitment and that is the strong combination of phallic persuasion and the tempting celebrity that makes Danglard a hero, claiming that a true show lover will never use as much money as men. At the end of the movie, Danglard approaches creditors and jealous babes with a new attraction, looking at the incredible (and believe it is incredible) results of the canan. "Have you ever thought of being on stage?" he asks and the curtain falls. Meanwhile, poor Julian is sitting in a theater fire, listening to Peggy Sawyer's new fans who deny his contribution to the show's success. (I'm not even going to the center line of "42nd Street", "Oh, Guy, it was great!") <br /> <br /> In addition, I'm not going to get one of the legendary Parisian enthusiasts, including a short vision of Piaf and Paris and rural vision. There is certainly an example of the styles that created Trenet and Aznavour. But this is a memory of a confident and welcoming masculinity, something not seen in any Hollywood music that could be compared to it, a pleasant relief from 30 Hollywood musicals (including my beloved Fred Astaire, not to mention Dick Powell). not to mention the films announced by MGM, such as those in the "America in Paris" All these fountains! We save this turkey for comparison with "Breakfast at Tiffany" and this American man's deconstruction for another day. <br /> <br /> Danglard may be a hopeful vision of post-war France-hyper-masculine mec, which may or may not have been, virtually aside. The fact that he is a man's husband, neither John Wayne nor Edward Everett Horton, is perhaps more of a target. The fact that he is a man who likes women is never questionable. I, one thing, wouldn't want to live my life at all. I don't know if Gabin was so happy. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of this comment I wanted to talk about Baz Luhrman and what Sinclair Lewis called "boloney". I've never come so far. Baz's Moulin Rouge ... Well, Paris no longer puts such things on Seine.
