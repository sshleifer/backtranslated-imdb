Best so bad it is a good movie that ever made. Rudy Ray Moore is my personal hero. Whether to deal with daily life or pimping ho's down the block, I can always look at him for inspiration and guidance. When it comes to blaxploitation, Rudy is a man. No one is more cunning. See Dolemit because he and his all-kung fu kung fu army are taken by Mr. Big and Willie Green. Awesome plot, right? There are so many liners there that need several views to improve your vocabulary. When you say a few lines of Dolemite, you have cooled down instantly. If you're in the mood to smile, rent this movie. Check out the Tornado of the Human, the godfather of Disco and Petey Wheatstraw to the son of the devil. Can you complain about it? <br /> <br /> "You have no business restriction, insecurity, rat soup, motha !!" "
