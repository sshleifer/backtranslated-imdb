It's a movie that glows your day. Kermit, a frog, is just a common frog in his own breed when a talent agent stops and tells him that Hollywood is looking for frogs in a movie (lol). On the way, Kermit meets Fozzie Bea, Miss Piggyi, Gonzo and his chicken Camilla, Rowl, The Electric Mayhem, Bunsen Honeydew and a beaker. But also Kermit is a restaurant chain owner, Doc Hoppers French fried frog legs. Kermit and Muppets do it for Hollywood. <br /> <br /> This movie is recommended for everyone, young and old. <br /> <br /> It has some great musical numbers, like "Rainbow Connection," I'm going back there ever, "and" Movin 'Right Along. Gonzo travels with helium balloons, one of my favorite moments;) and Kermit and the rest of the Muppets end up with an electric Mayhem bus (Dr. Teeth, Floyd, Janice, Scooter and Animal) who meet them in the wilderness after the Fozzie car breaks down. <br /> <br /> Even some Sesame Street Muppets are firing (ie Big Bird is moving along the way, going to NYC to break into public TVs. The end is also a very warm-hearted moment, every Muppet created is in the final scene, alo ng with the repetition of the final "Rainbow Connection". <br /> <br /> But these poor Muppets made their movie set so hard, it all falls down and the camera explodes with a big sparkle ball. You think everything is destroyed and destroyed, but the rainbow shines through the roof at the end, and it all takes the magic of this movie, and you know it's all right. <br /> <br /> Perfect 10/10. Look at it and you'll be fascinated by the fun and sadness of this movie.
