I play the ultimate fantasy 7 and this movie is FULL as a game, all fantasy fans love this movie. <br /> <br /> Music is fantastic and history is good, but the best thing about this movie is the visual effect, it's amazing. The characters are equal to the game and the details are good for the fans. <br /> <br /> You don't have to play this movie, all people can enjoy the movie because history is somewhat different and it's easy to understand. I buy a DVD because it is FULL, IS 100% ADVISABLE if you don't see the movie, what are you waiting for? Believe me, you lust like me
