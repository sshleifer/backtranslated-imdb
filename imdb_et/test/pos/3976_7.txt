I saw a trailer and read some comments and I had little expectations of this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. Although the plot is a little off-beat, all this movie made a pleasant flick for many laughs. Writing and jokes are more literate than I've been waiting for. It is better that unknown actors who do a good job, they all deliver together. Long is "Ed" and a new Apple computer ad. He was just his own "Edis" actor and he was great here. He's natural in front of the camera. Lewis Black is a social commentator who doesn't pull strokes. She is in "Daily Exhibition" at Comedy Centralis about once every two weeks, but she looks like HBO's "Red, White and Screwed". I regularly try her on the uncensored comedy channel of XM Radio. Give Black the idea and let him improvise. Whether his wrinkles and lines are written or improvised here is not important. He is invaluable in giving his thoughts to middle-class anger. One thing about Black's delivery, his hands gestures are not a comedian. She seems to be talking to you and I think it makes her subconsciously more effective.
