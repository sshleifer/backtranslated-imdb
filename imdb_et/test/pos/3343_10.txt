I saw it for the first time on a big screen with my girlfriend. It was fun music. Kristine was on the Playboy cover and in the middle, as I remembered. She is really cute and perky and has a lot of charm. The film made me want to see her more and so I looked at her from other things. He is Steven Spielberg's "I want to hold my hand" and Barbara Streisand's "Main Event" and Bill Murray's "meatballs" plus a lot of TV shows like Night Court and TV movies. I and my friends really enjoy him. But his main role in Alice in Wonderland puts the focus right where it should be, right on Kristine as the center of attention, probably the most beautiful, hottest girl I've seen in the movies.
