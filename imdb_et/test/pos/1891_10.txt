I went to see this movie in a book signed last night at Lexington. After a wonderful evening of some short words with Mr. Bruce Campbell (you have to say it all, not just Bruce or Mr. Campbell; D), friends at the signing of the books and the QnA session with our favorite deadite killer lights are dim. <br /> <br /> In order not to spoil anything, I won't go into detail ... but I loved the movie! Mr. Bruce Campbell did an excellent job of maintaining a classical b-film lesson. The characters were classic "b" characters, the place was refreshing (what movies * do you know about what is in Bulgaria?) And the device was both original and fun! In addition, the whole movie has a sense of humor that kept the audience laughing through much of the movie. <br /> <br /> Although this film does not have such a general desire for people as some, it's fun and a laughing season (as Mr Bruce Campbell put it) "b-movies" listed as "a-movies" ( Bewitched, Hazard Duke, Charlie and Chocolate Factory?!).
