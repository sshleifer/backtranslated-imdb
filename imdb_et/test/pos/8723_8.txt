As far as I like Walter Matthau, I felt that most of his roles had been adapted to his personality. This role is one of the exceptions. He plays a dentist who is so charming and dishonest. This role requires much more action than most of its other roles. I liked the fact that the film was honest about how a professional might be dishonest to avoid commitments in relationships. His whole goal was to find a way to be in a relationship with a much younger woman, but not in any way. Alibi - using his secretary (Ingrid Bergman) to pretend he is his wife. At some point in the film, there is a pretense that Mr. and Mrs. are really disappointed to believe they are really married. The end was good because the middle-aged man found that trying to reach someone in his age group was more beneficial. The film was funny, entertaining and not selling by preaching.
