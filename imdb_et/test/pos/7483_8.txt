Thursday is clearly derived from the "new wave" of criminal films that appeared from Quentin Tarantino in the early 1990s with storm shelters and Pulp Fiction. . On Thursday, some signs are mostly used in one place. It works because every character is peculiar in its own way to be memorable, and when it is put together, it is a very fun little thriller. There is little substance inside the plot, but it doesn't matter, because no one is going to go to the movie that is waiting for life to be confirmed. The plot follows Casey; former drug dealer who has gone directly and now lives as a successful husband to his wife. The couple wants to receive the child, but things turn awfully when Casey can visit his old criminal, Nick, who brought with him the heroine and the police stolen money. Thursday is a very interesting day for our former criminal proceedings ... <br /> <br /> The first scene sets the movie quite nicely and ensures that we know what to expect. We see that the coffee arrangement goes wrong, which becomes a murder picture, where the culprits immediately interrupt when the policeman receives updates. The scene is soaked with dark humor and funny dialogues and done in the rest of the movie. Thursday is a very funny movie, and scenes such as those who see the adoptive person turn up for an inconvenient time to make the movie difficult to dislike. It is true that the film does not produce anything new kinematically or graphically in the table, but the fact that it rejoices with its descent ensures that it is more time to rebuild the average characters for an absurd situation. Action is decent enough, the whole cast is obviously fun with this plot. Thomas Jane keeps the film together in a leading role, while the fun images from James LeGros, Paulina Porizkov, Michael Jeter, Glenn Plummer and Mickey Rouge. This film is unlikely to affect an experienced movie fan, but if you just want a little fun with some enjoyable twists and performances; Thursday is enough.
