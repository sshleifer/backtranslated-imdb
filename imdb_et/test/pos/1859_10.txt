I've read the reviews of this movie that found it to be disappointing and confusing. I'm sorry to understand why this should be the case. From the beginning, I found this to be a remarkable experience and full of joy. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: Opening headlines overlap with the visual images of the beautiful evolutionary process and present the story in a calm and wide-ranging style. The film is not a process itself, it concerns Charles Darwin's struggle with his conscience, his love for his wife, his dead daughter, and his search for truth. <br /> <br /> His daughter's performances are manifestations of a tortured spirit that knows that it has "killed God." The daughter is an adult who makes adult comments on her work and tortures Darwin's personal doubts. Was he in any way responsible for his death? Man and woman in real life Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly give really great performances like Charles and Emma Darwin, as well as Martha West as Annie. Bettany's size and uncomfortable walking give Darwin's reality a real reality, while Connelly looks very fond of her English accent and sometimes somewhat heavy. <br /> <br /> It is easy to understand the times of living in this movie. The faith that religion had in society and in the internal struggle that a man like Darwin must bear to find the truth in what he saw. Science and religion have always been uncomfortable beds, and although it didn't cost him life, as was the case with so many earlier men and women, science put a barrier between man and woman, facts and faith. This film represents this barrier very well. <br /> <br /> I give ten stars to the creation, because I think it is a beautiful, deep, well-functioning and real, foreign-cleaning requirement to look at one of the true geniuses of the world. <br /> <br /> What seems obvious to everyone today (well, almost all ... see Bill Maher's wonderful "Religulous") was hidden for millennia. The truth, when discovered, was undoubtedly painful for many. Creation explores that pain and understanding that we are all we have. <br /> <br /> Great movie experience.
