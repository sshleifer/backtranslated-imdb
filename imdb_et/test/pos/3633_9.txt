Years ago I read "A Máquina" (Masin). When I read this little book again and again, I could never be fascinated by the imagination of the writer and the wealth of Brazilian culture. <br /> <br /> When I knew about the movie, I was really scared that someone was breaking one of my favorite books! Fortunately, my fears were unfounded and the film is a wonderful and delicate work of art. <br /> <br /> I can't remember any other movie that could bring tears because of very beautiful eyes. text. Nor can such powerful results as Gustavo Falcão be recalled. <br /> <br /> You will see and feel how great his love for Karina is. You understand that he is moving in the mountains and doing something for this love. <br /> <br /> Do you see this movie, watch it through a child who lives inside you, fascinated by yourself!
