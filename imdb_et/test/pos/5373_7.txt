The family travels through the middle of the west. There's a widow with Ben (Charles Bateman), his girlfriend Nicky (Ahna Capri) and Ben's little daughter K.T. (Geri Reischl). Then the city was called Hillsboro, where everyone is more than a little strange. Their car breaks and they are forced to stay. Soon they will find that the witches who have been hatched are on the town and it is unbelievable evil. <br /> <br /> The story is not so good. People just think out of things and they just happen to find out where the witches are at the end. There are also many gaps at the end that remain hanging. Action is too poor. Bateman and Capri are great and everyone else is about the same. Only the old pros Strother Martin and L.Q. Jones has good results. Still, this movie works. It gives up blood and gore (there are some but it is PG) and manges to work on some very horrible visuals and atmosphere. It works a lot, but still works. Martin especially looks at the landscape in his role. I can't explain exactly why I (such) like this movie, but it worked with me. It is a silent fear that is no longer done. Hardly a masterpiece, but it deserves to be rediscovered. A 7.
