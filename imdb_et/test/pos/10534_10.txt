Centurions is one of the best caricatures ever and it has to be put on TV and DVD so that people have younger generations who enjoy such a good example that is much better than the rubbish over the last 14 years. I have a web-based statement on the website http://www.petitiononline.com/6600F/petition.html, which originally tried to get this example five days a week, but now it is trying to show the DVD from the TV channel on which it was focused , have bad public relations. We all need to convince the people who own this exhibition to DVD so that it can be seen by future generations. From now on Hasbro Toys already has a toy from this show that we could convince to persuade them to make a live movie just as they did with Transformers and sometime this year at G.I.Joe. We need good cartoons like this to come back and enjoy the younger generations. Please sign this petition so we can one day have DVDs from boys who are famous "Power Extreme!"
