I liked the movie, but it should have been longer. The participants did a great job. Portia De Rossi is a fabulous actor and Kristoffer Polaha is a hottie. He didn't look like John 100%, but he preferred him far. I look forward to seeing him more on the big screen. He did not have John's charisma, but he certainly has his own charm. She has beautiful eyes and a big smile. She reminds me a lot about her boyfriend. Mrs Bissett was too breathless for me. He should control this asthma. I'm not going to comment on Darryl Hannah's character. My mother always said, "If you can't say anything nice, close hell!" that's what I'm doing. <br /> <br /> Molly
