Ice Limerick: <br /> <br /> The virus pulled out of the ice. <br /> <br /> Just couldn't play nice. <br /> <br /> Kill <br /> <br /> As you are sick. <br /> <br /> This medicine needs to be infused twice. <br /> <br /> Ice is a great episode; one of the seasons that started to make the show and when you ask me, I couldn't really ask much better in the whole series. It starts with a great teaser, which I think is one of the best teaser. Scientists at the Alaska Group have drilled out of the ice, which for some reason has caused each other to kill. Mulder and Scully are sent with three other scientists to investigate what happened. As Mulder says, it's because they're great or spending. I think that means they would be better off being brilliant or otherwise ... The group will soon discover that chaos is causing a small parasite that pulls out of the heart of the ice. A small worm that enters the bloodstream and causes violent behavior. As the pilot is infected, the rest of the exhibition turns to an alternate person who has done this with a paranoia thriller, because others are suspecting each other of being infected. That's not too helpful for the paranoid doctor Hodge, who doesn't trust anyone we learn early on with the first thing he asks: to see everyone's credentials "make sure we're who we say we are." Events bring along who is infected and learned how to treat them. <br /> <br /> There are a number of things that I like about the episode and, of course, certain characters that I want to smile with this episode, as well as a few gaps, but most may be due to increased caution and not clear thinking. I like Bear from the moment I first met him. His shame must die. I also like the scene shown by other scientists, as Mulder and Scully claim in another room. This gives our usual idea of ​​the spectator's interesting twists and it can be said to me that we should not assume that simply because someone is a government, they know all the secrets of conspiracy. As far as Hodges disturbs me in this episode, I think Mulder was guilty of some impact. I really like Scully in this episode. First of all, he's capable of a frickin linebacker! Secondly, I would really like to focus on her fears that happen to them, and how she tries not to let the Mulder trust and make friends with her judgment. I love the scene when he goes to sleep, and first looks at the picture of the previous group, all the hugging and birthday gifts for those who slept in the room, and then how he suddenly freaks out and pushes the clothing in front of the door and the final nuance when he sitting on the floor, pulling his chest on his knees, we see a poster on the bottom of the wall that says "Bosom Buddies". This is such a great letter. One way to say without words is that Scully is worried that he may not even trust his best friend. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this heightened suspicion leads the group to believe that Mulder is infected because he discovers a dead body in Murphy, even though they haven't checked it at all. This was my main problem with the behavior of the characters because they could easily solve all the doubts by just giving blood. But I think I would probably have acted in this situation too. But then the stupid Hodges decides that he must assume that Mulder is infected, even though Mulder deliberately gives up and then deliberately checks over and almost infects Mulder. Fortunately, he sees that Dasilva is really infected and finally we come to a resolution. At least as much as expected from the X file. The "government" does not waste time on evading evidence, as always happens in these cases, and Mulder still has a frustrating "unresolved" case. Finally, I'll give "Ice" and it's easy for 10/10 and I'll leave you with a haiku. <br /> <br /> "We're not who we are. It doesn't go further. It ends right now."
