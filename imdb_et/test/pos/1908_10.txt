Yes ... I read David Lee Roth's autobiography, "Crazy From the Heat" (which by the way is an amazing reading), and DLR says it was his favorite film as a child. In fact, he says he has always portrayed himself as a black guy from Southern Calist. Mr. Roth has said: "We saw every picture of Blacksploitation and these films were a huge impact for me. Trouble Man, Superfly, Foxy Brown, Shaft, Cleopatra Jones, Blacula, Rudy Ray Moore" My Dolemite " i vibe - i saw all of them ... "<br /> <br /> He continues to say:" Dolemite - Rudy Ray Moore was one of the originals. "He was a blue comic, making blue humor , like Redd Foxx made a premature party record, so he was the best new secret player, his answer was not "Bonds." James Bond. "His response was" Dolemite, motherf *****! "We look forward to this line in all of your "Get Whitey" would appear at least once in every movie and we expect They had cars, they had shoes, they had weapons, hair clippers, slangs and scams, and we all knew that all these would make white bulls at the end of the movie decisive *** She's trying to feed hungry children, but she's actually pimp ... bull **** It was meant to be our e dads and fathers make them look at the picture. "<br /> <br /> Spoken like a real genius. So, reading Dolem from Mr Roth's book, I bought the DVD right now and I like it. Yes, it's a super low budget and yes ... I hate rap ... but as a fan of Tarantino movies I see many similarities, especially in the 70's fusion / funk sub-jaco pastorius music in the whole movie. I also love the scene where two police get him "hooked" and one of them strikes a whole lot as he would done it a thousand times before, and says something, "Aww yeah .... this real mccoy! "... and then he continues to talk and he has some coke on his lips. CLASSIC! Some of the violence is just over the edge, but it's shocking, which I find positive. Not as predictable as I expected it to be. "Man in the gymnastics" very soon.
