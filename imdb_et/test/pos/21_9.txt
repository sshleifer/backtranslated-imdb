"The Dresser" is a small but absolutely wonderful film that worked great with Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay. How this little film in the world attracted enough attention to five major Academy Award candidates in 1983, is a mystery to me, but it is nice to know that the Academy can be guilty of occasionally good taste (of course, they gave the award award this year - after all Finally, they don't want to blame too much flavor.) Albert Finney is a drunken Shakespeare actress "King Lear"; Tom Courtenay is a man who works twice behind the scenes to keep this indicator in front of the headlamps. It's so much fun and terrible to see Courtenay's character to pay attention and affection to Finney in the shower, but to see her efforts completely unacceptable and fired up to the very bitter end. Finney and Courtenay do wonders together, and while Finney gets the most outstanding moments (she can finally read Shakespeare), Courtenay is the heart and soul of the film. <br /> <br /> Rating: A
