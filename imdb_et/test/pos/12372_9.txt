Victor Sjöström's "Körkarlen" puts a large part of his working time in the deeper depths of the viewer's life, with the scenes of bad alcohol breakdown, domestic violence and suicide, but the most memorable passages include the mythical image of death itself. Here, death has turned into a strange horse lift led by a sad sinner who was the last person to die at the turn of last year. One year must hate the newly lost soul, and twelve months after this terrible servitude, the leader's own soul is released when the latter dies on 31 December becomes a new leader. <br /> <br /> Scenes related to this shipment (the film was known as "The Phantom Carriage" or "Phantom Chariot" in English-speaking countries) is scary and mesmerizing using double exposure cinematography, which was quite complicated and effective for its time , seen. The most striking move is to the ocean floor to gather the soul of the dead person. But as these scenes are interesting, most of the film is linked to the downward spiral of David Holm, which the director himself plays in the underrated imagination of a person who has given up the opportunity to live a decent life. Feedback We see Holm's pleasant day at the beach with his wife, children and brother, and he seems to be an ordinary man. Suddenly, without a mix or explanation, we see Holm as an alcoholic wreck that is struggling with law and alienated from his family. Usually, this jump seems to be before Estonia tells the story, but in this case, the filmmakers trust us to get familiar with the detailed data. It has been suggested that Holm is mistaken for his delightful friend Georges, a comrade who first associates Phantom's carriage, but any reason for his fall Holm seems to have been a lost cause, an average drunken man who takes perverse joy to his family in causing pain and rejecting reforms. <br /> <br /> While David Holm is our central figure, the story is a true catalyst for a young rescue army nurse who is keen on his case and firmly believes in him despite his hatred. When a nurse dies - indirectly through her service on behalf of Holm - she demands to see her and thus involuntarily triggers a chain of events that will lead to her recovery. <br /> <br /> At times, when this film resembles Dickens' story of Scroog using its ghostly visitors who inspire deeply defective people to appreciate their lives, they suffer from his misbehavior and reforms. I was also reminded of Sjöström's 1917 drama "Terje Vigen", in which a man returns from prison to find his house empty and his family went there (repeated times). The director also repeats the Scandinavian folklore standard theme, which previously found his "Berg-Ejvind och hans hustru" ("The Outlaw and His Wife", 1918), that no one can overcome their destiny. This time, however, it can be said that David Holm succeeds in avoiding his seemingly inevitable fate because he has been given an unexpected second chance to change. <br /> <br /> Viewers who are expecting a supernatural penetration will appreciate the sequences that contain the Phantom Carriage title, but may not be ready for the painful exploration of this film about the alcoholic degradation of a worrying person. However, people with intense and powerful silent drama taste "Körkarleni" as a whole. It is the most serious cinema of its time and is certainly one of Sjöström's most successful works.
