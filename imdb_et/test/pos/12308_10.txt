Atahualpa Yupanqui, an Argentine music poet, said some folk music would be repeated in any country in the world. They look the same, but everyone sees them as their folk music ... <br /> <br /> This movie is, in my opinion, the same music that repeats the history of the world in every country. . First, some listen to it while playing and try to hear others. Then some think they hear it, but they don't. Then nobody says anything and some people listen to it. And others admit they've heard it, but didn't think others could hear it. Finally, everyone listens to the same music and maybe it doesn't sound any more ... <br /> <br /> Love and poetry, true nationalism and father's legacy for their children ... <br /> <br /> Why did he call the movie, dead if anyone dies? The title in Spanish refused to follow the same rule and we call this Dublin name, following James Joyce's title ... <br /> <br /> Beautiful 1900 Irish Filmed Postcard!
