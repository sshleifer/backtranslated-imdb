"North By Northwest" first "Saboteur" entertainment project has some great moments of Hitchcock (one of the best occurs at the table when a hero asks a woman who has not yet seen her wearing handcuffs to give her a plate, trying to do it, she also drops a knife on the floor, exposing itself even more!) but suffering from poorly selected lead (whether it gives patriotic speeches, romanticizes Priscilla Lane, makes jokes or tries to worry, Robert Cummings is wooden) and the absence of really special bad guys (oh, there's a villain , many of them, but hardly anyone has enough time on the screen).
