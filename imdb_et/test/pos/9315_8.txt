I've heard a lot about Porno Holocaust and its twin movie "Erotic Night Live Dead". Both films are interchangeable and filmed at the same time at the same place where the same actors changed the clothes of each film (and took them down). If you expect the D'Amato gene, which is shown in movies such as Buio Omega or Death Smiles, you won't find it here. However, this film has a fascination that the fans of exploitation are unable to resist. Where else do you see hardcore sex mixed with zombie / monster and his huge penis that suffocates and suffocates women? Only D'Amato. There are some gore in which many men are put to death. The film is set on a beautiful tropical island. As far as I know, there is no subtitled version, so if you don't speak Italian, you don't know what's going on ... but who cares right? Frankly, Gore fans are likely to rush to hardcore sex. And if someone actually looks at it for sex, it must definitely be offended immediately. I can imagine that today's porn fans watch D'Amato's output and come through this fright! Of the two, I find living dead erotic nights much better. But don't worry if they're cut. The Holocaust of Porn is, as expected, an extremely low budget. Even the monster looks as good as the character of George Eastman in Anthropophagia. The film is worth laughing and ending D'Amato's movie search.
