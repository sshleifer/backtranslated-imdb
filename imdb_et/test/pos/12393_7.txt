In general, it is accepted that Marcel Carné 1936-1946 films are masterpieces and it is polite to say that the rest are mediocre. This is an unfair opinion: at least two of the last days are remarkably traceable: "Thérèse Raquin", his best post-war work and "les tricheurs". <br /> <br /> Between the preventive golden hour and the "les tricheurs" there is a strange development: "les enfants du paradis" "quai des brumes" or "le jour se lève", true love is a failed villain. There is no true love for "Les tricheurs": we are dealing with young people who do not believe in something, falling in love with this young person. Adults are not at all villains: Mic's brother and mother are kind people, but he is outside his command. Very few adults will appear anyway. <br /> <br /> Within two hours, the characters don't stop playing, dancing, listening to jazz records (music that's not yet part of a civic culture) and drinking. If two of them discover that they care for each other, it's too late. <br /> <br /> The cast is pretty good, Laurent Terzieff is an existential claw and André Parisy as a rich child. On the other hand, Pascale Petit and, above all, Jacques Charrier (who married Brigitte Bardot in the same year as "les tricheurs") are not uncertain about their parts. , too sweet and pleasant to be credible. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, "les tricheurs" was labeled "nouvelle vague"! u know what the cinema school priests (like Godard) thought of Carné, this is really a good joke. But the disappointment you feel in the whole movie is really annoying.
