Apparently this Australian film based on Nevil Shute's novel is in more than one form. Beware of severely cut versions that are sometimes displayed on a cable or satellite network, working anywhere from 95 minutes to 2 hours. Only a full 5-hour version of the minisers will tell the story properly. This is a very close realization of the story, which only carries the editorial errors in TV films: fraud and episodic progression. However, this great finish is very good with the good results of their work. Yuki Shimoda is remarkable as "Gunso Mifune", one of the guards whose task is to involve women in their agonizing track. Eventually he becomes a friend. You agonize with him when his face loss leads him to death. Helen Morse, as "Jean Paget", beautiful but not great beauty (she resembles a bit of Sigourney Weaver) just records the right amount of wilting and charm when she calls. . Minisans properly emphasize beautiful love stories, three of them: "Joe" and "Jean", "Noel" and "Jean" and "Jean" and Willstown. Gordon Jackson plays "Noel Strachan" pleasantly, but somewhat younger than Nevil Shute in the novel. The third love relationship I mentioned does not pay much attention and the full meaning of the title has diminished. Jean is dedicated to the goal of bringing entrepreneurs to Willstown, which attracts young women and girls and their civilization to influence this sense of God back into the city. He wants to make it "City like Alice"; Alice Springs, that's it. We get just a few tips. If you have five hours, this minisium is a truly rewarding experience. Nevil Shute relied on his novel against the cruelty of the Japanese military to maneuver a large number of women and children from one place to another on the Maylay Peninsula when it came to life. But Sumatra happened to Shute, not on the peninsula. The crucifixion of the Japanese officer "Joe" to steal a chicken for feeding women is probably a fiction, but the cruelty of Japan in dealing with prisoners is definitely a record issue.
