I'm not sure where to start. In short, it was a disappointing film. Having taught a short story, I was aware that making a movie would be a difficult story. There are a couple of interesting lines in the film (mainly between Alfred and Aschenbach), but it does not represent a debate about art that basically shapes the story. One, I was expecting an older Aschenbach and younger Tadzio. Tadzio is in the book fourteenth, but he is described as pure, ideal, innocent, while in the film he is sexually abused and tempted. He is an accomplice of Aschenbach, he looks back at him, almost provocatively. The book steals a look at the boy Aschenbach. As for Aschenbach, I imagined something closer to the professor's clown at Blue Angel (the story of Thomas Mann's brother Heinrich) than that forty-year-old, barely gray hair. In all justice, I think Dirk Bogarde did a good job, but should anyone else have done it, or he should have looked at the parent first. <br /> <br /> I know that discovering homosexuality is important for the story, but the film minimizes talking about art and the duality of apollons and dynamic inspirations, and instead focuses on and does not justify Aschenbach's Tadzio obsession. I liked the fact that Mahler's music was used because he finally inspired Mann to write his story. I'm not sure that making Aschenbach a musician was a particularly good step. Or the creation of Alfred I can't remember in the book. <br /> <br /> And one thing that really got to me was the sound and how it didn't match the actors' lips. I was wondering if it was duplicated because I expected it to be in Italian. But then I remembered that every Italian movie I watched was a problem. It just disturbs me, because these leaders (Fellini is the other person I mean) should decorate the perfection of the Italian cinema, and here their characters laugh without sound, then you hear the noise that doesn't match their face (I mean scenes when Aschenbach almost collapses and starts laughing. This scene could have been / should have been the strongest, but it was annoying instead.
