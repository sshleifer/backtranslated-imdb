Lone Ranger was one of my childhood heroes, and I never missed my adventures again in the mid-1950s. Somehow, this movie came to me until I had the opportunity to politely receive it from my local library. I was a story about a number of elements, because from the beginning you have a new Lone Ranger theme song before you hear the traditional opening used in TV shows. The adventure uses Tony (Jay Silverheels) in a nicely expanded role, although he takes his share of the pieces all the time, beating and kicking more than once. Perhaps the most interesting thing is that Ranger lets you kill in a few cases, putting your character in conflict with the vision set for the TV series so that it never uses your weapon to kill, only wound or protect yourself and others. <br /> <br /> In addition, you have a rather traditional Western adventure. Ranger and Tonto will help the Indian tribe, whose members will be murdered by hooded robbers who are trying to capture five medallions that together form the key to a fabulous treasure. Interestingly, the head of the bad boys is already a wealthy woman armed by Noreen Nash. His upper hand game is played by Douglas Kennedy, and it was not surprising that Lane Bradford was one of the bad ones. The character of Bradford was one of the men photographed by Lone Ranger who thought to me how many times happened in the TV series. A quick check showed that he appeared on Lone Ranger, showing 15 times, while Kennedy appeared six times. <br /> <br /> What could be most interesting about the picture is to try to portray Indians in a revisionist light at a time when television and Western Western Western still depicted the red man as illiterate wild. The character of Dr. James Rolfe (Norman Fredric) is the most revealing in this respect; he is India, who achieved education and went to the doctor, returned to his tribe land to deviate to the needs of all his citizens. For the story, he had to embody a white man accepted by local pastors. It was the most difficult story for me to really accept, as Dr. Rolfe was the grandson of the head of Tomache (John Miljan). That no one, except Paviva (Lisa Montell), knew she was really Indian, had something stretching for me. I think it was possible that he left the tribe early, but without it, the story was back, it was not reasonable for me that no other tribe knew who he was. <br /> <br /> I do not know why I intrigue so much, but after watching and reviewing over two hundred Westerners on this site, I have suddenly come across three films in the last month using a blind competition like the one Tonto Horse Scout in in the picture. In 1952, Roy Rogers' Trigger made a stunt similar to the "son of Paleface", and I got it again in 1958 by "Big Country" called the Old Thunder horse. It's made a bit of a comic relief in a situation that doesn't usually come in front of the horse, and now it makes me curious if a little could have been done for the first time. I have to look more at the old west. It shouldn't be darker if Silver had the chance to show up in the picture, too, by rescuing an Indian baby who was used by a bad man Brady as a hostage. <br /> <br /> Talking about tricks, Clayton Moore borrowed tactics from the TV series as he hid like a southern gentleman to smoke frogs who were posing as a hood. When he did it in half an hour, he was always smart enough to hide his real qualities, usually with a beard like here. One of the most interesting episodes I remember was related to Ranger, who embodied the actor in the shadow of Abraham Lincoln. <br /> <br /> Keep your eyes in pairs that I saw along the way. Open in the scene, one of the hooded riders opens up to the Indian, and there is blood in his neighborhood, but there is no ball hole. Later, the story of Ross Brady and Wilson drove on to the Indians after they kidnapped one of the prisoners. Brady puts him in a permanent position to prevent him from identifying the robbers, but it is immediately shown that he is escaping with Wilson.
