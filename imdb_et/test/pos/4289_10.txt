Can a spouse's love for his wife cover him for a crime, despite being betrayed at multiple levels? Tom Wilkinson is not a brutal Othello for today's England. So the web of fraud will gradually weave. And we are witnessing cycles of jealousy and drunkenness and guilt and whoredom. And so the network of "stand-alone lies" will fail and then again together. And life (and death) goes on, despite the brilliant flame of a man's love and deep despair and guilt that has been woven into so many lives. How many fraud networks are displayed in this growing tapestry? This impulse is to support reputation and career and relationships in the most civilized corner of the world. Wilkinson gives emotional performance, full of grace and discretion and ornamentation, but of humanity, to those who are much hidden. Those who want clarity and openness through justice are frustrated with so much fraud. And yet, who among us has nothing to hide with our loved ones? However, the viewer may ask if this website has been crumbling for some days.
