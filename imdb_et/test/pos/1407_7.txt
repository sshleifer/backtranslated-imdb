I found West Point a pleasant movie, though I doubt I'll see it again. The performances were convincing, William Haines was another reluctantly entertaining young man, who has come to the end of the film. It is hard to believe that stardom called Joan Crawford less than a year after making this film, because he seems at times quite uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> I would also apply another movie commentary on this film about Ramon Novarro's "Huddle" (1932). Here's a great movie that is waiting here, but there's nothing missing. The background and integration of the corps were well used, but I was less involved than I thought I was. Maybe the character of Haines went too far or too much. His "repentance" seemed not genuine enough; and what message did he send him to ride every military naval game last minute? Where is the "housing" in it? Maybe the other ten men could take out and let him do it himself. I also doubt that William Bakewell's weak, hairy character would ever be a real life colleague at West Point. <br /> <br /> All this, the film is sometimes very touching and inspiring. This is a good understanding of the daily practice of a respectable institution. I appreciate the goodness that tradition still means something in West Point, unlike the "traditions" of steaming "Ivy League" schools, but only in these days. <br /> <br /> As for the score: it was a martial art. But eye drums were clearly used over. Their use on door strokes, scene transitions, and more than half of the scenes had to be quite annoying. Rather, it reduced the viewing experience. I was ready to say that I got this point. <br /> <br /> Enjoy a movie, but don't expect too much emotional involvement.
