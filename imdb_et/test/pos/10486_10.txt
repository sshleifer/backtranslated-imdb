Babette's party for me is healing: it improves the relationship between mind and body in Orthodox Christianity. This Puritan community, far from Denmark, is not sufficiently aware of all God's gift in nature. They have taken St. Paul's dualism as extreme and emphasize the life of the "spirit", not the life of "flesh." Both older sisters in their youth were scared of attracting love and temptation of life outside their simple village. They and their congregations confirmed the narrow biblical interpretation of their former leader and father of the sisters. An aging church has become tedious and cumbersome, and sisters do not know what to do. Enter a French stranger, Babette, and someone to whom they can show kindness. They have no way of knowing that he will eventually return to his goodness and give his dry dust theology to the fertile surface. Babette gives everything she has, and teaches the grace, sacrifice, and sensual experience (like the Eucharist of bread and wine) of a sister and their flock can change life and why true art moves us so deeply. When they can forgive one another and themselves, they can focus on the love of God that is present in their specific way. As a minister and an artist, I can't recommend a movie. True art and true love!
