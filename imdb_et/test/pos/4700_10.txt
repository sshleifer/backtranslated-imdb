"Sister Helen" is a great documentary about rigid, intolerant, evil, bitter, empty (civilian) nun who drives shelter for fountains and dopers in the southern Bronx area. All but one of the 21 residents are gutter / drug addicts. Robert, the only middle class representative? he had a real job, a house and even a BMW? regrets that he died before he spoke to him. Why? <br /> <br /> Robert, like six residents, had a password. She complained that Helen had used her enormously and threatened to turn it on constantly when she didn't get her. In the "extras" interview, he said that Helen ran in the center to compensate for the death of three men in her life? his wife and two boys. The man was an alcoholic who died at heart attack 55. One boy died during heroin overdose and the other was put to death 15. Helen stayed with one of the daughters he gave up to run the center. The daughter was not happy. She wanted her mother. <br /> <br /> What's exciting about how little Helen changed. Outwardly, he seems to have made a big change at sea. But after seeing this riveting and disturbing video a few times - once telling the directors - it turned out that Helen replaced 21 male addicts who replaced their three dead men. <br /> <br /> Helen admits she ignored her children and spent every day in bars. But his boss, intolerance and sharp language did not appear at the age of 56. Survival with her must have been extremely difficult. Even Robert says he was clean despite Helen. <br /> <br /> The film opens with Helen violently lowering the man who wants to live in the shelter. He allegedly shows his street life. Once more, when he unveils Mel, his "assistant" that he does not bathe for a year. Then he waves his dirty air in the pillowcase. The film is viscous with people threatening and humiliating Helen. His signature song is "My Way". His favorite phrase is, "I'm completely honest with you." Often, people who use such phrases turn out to be the opposite. <br /> <br /> The inhabitants are really down and out. Only Robert has a cultivated skill after pushing the broom. They all desperately need a roof over their heads, and Helen, as she runs her own place, has the right to recognize or invite whom she likes. He has no board to answer and get no public funding. This is her show. <br /> <br /> Helen believes in the approach of cookies to shine. He stopped drinking cold turkey and that means everyone else gets it. He accuses drug abuse of drugs or faeces and not the underlying problems that drove men to drink and drugs. She is not a therapist, just a landowner who paints her hair, wears her habit and uses full power over her tenants and stopped drinking. <br /> <br /> Helen also drives her to her inmates, demanding urine (urine she calls it) for tests. The double Major, a very confident and respected long-term resident whom he trusted failed in his tests. Helen was furious and raised her out. Major stood on his spot and said the results were wrong because he never made heroin. Helen did not bring and should not consider the error. It was particularly worrying because he knew Major for a long time. But he discounted his relationship with him, assuming he was a liar and based entirely on the results. Finally, Major discovered that his cough in syrup codeine showed opiate. Helen did not publicly apologize, but allegedly privately with the big ones. <br /> <br /> Helen also had a very bad reputation in her old neighborhood. By default, he promised Robert that he stayed very late for one night to worship someone's tires. The person broke her and definitely earned his tires falling. She wasn't a nice woman. Eventually, he decided the only way to keep the name of Travis (his surname) alive? since three male Travise died? was to start the center of Travise. <br /> <br /> For some people it was a lot. They followed Helen and received a cheap, secure, sober and structured residence in return. One, however, said he preferred a prisoner. Addicts and drunks do not need to treat all children. Helen used old school techniques that were discredited. But no one was forced to stay in the center and for some it was definitely a positive experience. Travise Center is not a medical center. It is the residence of alcoholics and dopers who stretch out their lives. <br /> <br /> For complete sister Helen experience, see all the additional interviews and audio versions where two directors share their experiences with sister Helen and her guests.
