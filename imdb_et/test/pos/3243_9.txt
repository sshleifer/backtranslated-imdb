In this movie, Heath Ledgers really make mistakes for me, but in general it is a great watch. Bryan Brown is great when he doesn't usually like him, but then his gang is a big job. Jimmy is an unhappy wannabe gangster who can't feel anything right (SPOILERS: losing panda money, an ackos car and almost robbing a bank robbery) but still appears on it. <br /> <br /> did not know what these two children were at the beginning, but they did link some stories nicely. <br /> <br /> All pretty nice fine piece of Australian Cinema 9/10
