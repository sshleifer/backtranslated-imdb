Robert Cummings, Laraine Day and Jean Muir star "And One Was Beautiful", a 1940 film starring Billie Burke. In one hour and 15 minutes it seems to be a B movie. Cummings is a playboy, Ridley Crane, wished by many women, including two sisters, Katherine and Helen Latimer (Day and Muir). Katherine is more earthly bound with the two who want to fix their cars, and Helen is a blonde social butterfly with beautiful bathrobes. Ridley comes back to town and believes he's not going to be at the party, Helen decides not to attend. As the party is a family member, their mother (Burke) sends Katherine upright dress. Ridley is there and there are two connections. But Ridley is more superficial, and when she sees Helen during the dinner party, the two take the place where they left and go to the club. He gets terribly drunk and Helen refuses to drive in his car because he doesn't let him drive. After walking for a while and breaking his shoe he gets into Ridley's car as he drives. She goes through and she takes the wheel, accidentally hits the cyclist and kills. <br /> <br /> Ridley doesn't remember anything, so Helen will let him blame him for death. The woman's shoes are in her car and Katherine sees her sister in burial - plus, something Helen does, she understands that Helen is not telling the truth. Ridley is convicted and goes to jail and Helen marries a man she doesn't love and leaves for South America. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie, even though it wasn't in A-Time. Cummings plays the part that Robert Taylor would have played (this is MGM) - he is beautiful and very friendly, even if he doesn't have a dazzling look like Taylor. Laraine Day is my favorite actress, someone in the MGM constantly borrowed because they didn't know what to do with her. Why I wonder - an actor with a great face and voice, he animated a lot of movies. It is no different. Her Katherine is confident, sympathetic and totally cute. Jean Muir is a sad actor. <br /> <br /> So who was beautiful? We all know even if MGM didn't. <br /> <br /> Very recommended little pearl.
