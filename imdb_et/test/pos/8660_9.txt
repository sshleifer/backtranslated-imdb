What a great movie it was. Is it in the sky? hell? or something? I disagree with many of the comments in this movie saying that it is a hell image. It is not even clear whether the opening scene will start a movie or a setback from the end. In addition, it is not clear whether the main character is going to hell, but perhaps somewhere in between. An overview of IMDb reads that it is hell, but I disagree with the whole heart. Note that good people who commit suicide may not condemn hell ... it's just one religious belief. It's really a thinker and I have / would like it for anyone who loves this type of movie. Definitely worth it!
