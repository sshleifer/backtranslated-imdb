This film sets the standard for all rock biopsies. It achieved the durability of its leaders' energetic presentations, camera work (avoiding the "rock-video" cliches that were actually invented in the first two films of the Beatles), the close editing and the non-decisive presentation of a star like a person, not a symbol or a god (or demon). Yes, the plot has small holes and random details that are a little unnecessary, and there is always a discussion between those who are personally involved. But here's the question, as well as the much newer "I walk line" or Carpenter's famous television in Elvis, which is in the same biotope of the same era, is whether the meaning of the performer's life at the time and place is the catalyst and appreciation of fans' ideals, is clear in the statement and that is obviously so here. We come away from this movie to understand not only how Buddy Holly became a star, but why. I can't see what else I'd like from the movie.
