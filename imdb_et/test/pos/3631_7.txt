Let's be fair: there are no rules for writing a script, so I'm not saying that the movie should be something other than that. I'm just saying my opinion. OK, I really liked the script, the way things are spoken, and the characters. But I think that if the game is adapted to a silver screen, it may try to match that other media. Since this film was directed by João Falcão, the same man who directed this game is not too surprising that the film turned out to be too theatrical. It's the man's first movie because it's loud! I say there are parts in the film - like the city of Nordest, which reminds us of the "Hoje é Dia de Maria" set - which seems to be not a cinema. We're in the theater! Lines are spoken too formally, the characters move choreographically, and the brightness is clearly set for the stage. Of course, maybe it was an intention, but it's done. On stage. Some things have been done to customize the movie - for example, the beautiful "Closer". When I saw it, I didn't feel like I was watching the movie. But in general it was good to look at. It's a nice love story, sometimes funny and sad for others. My voice is 7.
