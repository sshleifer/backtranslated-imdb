Like Steven Seagal, I am also a big fan of Van Damme and I've watched most of my movies since the beginning of his acting career. <br /> <br /> On this disc, Van Damme takes on the role of Jack Robideaux, a policeman who just moved to New Orleans to New Mexico to work as a border guard. Because of Jack's past memories, Jack's task is to stop the group's Ex-Navy seals against illicit drug trafficking in the United States, which killed his daughter. <br /> <br /> Overall, I found this movie Be very good, Van Damme is a very good figure for 48 years old and can really move. Action scenes are very intense and the film even throws a couple of plot twists to guess you. Unfortunately, Van Damme does not have the same intensity as 10 years ago, regardless of Shepherd: Border Control is the third straight solid film made by Van Damme, opening up the opportunity for a larger project. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend this movie to Van Damme fan or film fan in general; Shepherd Dog: Border control is a great movie, not as good as death, but better than a hard body. Be sure to give it a try, you won't be disappointed.
