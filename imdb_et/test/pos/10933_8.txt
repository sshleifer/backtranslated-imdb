Take 8 points, probably the one that really might be more than it was. The American Indians probably stole more than killed. Who really knows? A nice slower strange action means that it has a pace and ... interesting and unique. Fortunately, there is no other point to shoot. I thought it would suck first, I ended up ... nice treasure ... good work! I hope somebody splits this movie. When the whole film comes up, you have many unique turns that are impossible to determine. The characters are human and they have the honor or not ... passion or not ... forgiveness or not. He finished the love of the White Horse, India, Sheen, even in the devil's desert. Everything is fine.
