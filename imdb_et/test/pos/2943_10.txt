I don't usually like watching movies because they are still in the theaters because of high ticket prices, but I saw a poster for some things that remain and thought, "that a young actor sees an intelligent and mysterious, not like a normal blonde teenybopper BS". So I decided to step in and watch this movie on its opening night. <br /> <br /> I must tell you that I was happily surprised. I went to this movie without expectations. I didn't know what it would be, but the raw emotion and honest teenage experiences expressed by Katie Boland were left with my decision. Alberta Watson also did a fantastic job as the role of Tamara's sick mother and I must also add that I was quite impressed by the comic style of Megan Park, such as Brother Tamara. <br /> <br /> The film was superbly directed by Gail Harvey and pulled in a kitschy 50 that keeps you warm and happy, even though the story was not so exhilarating. I also thought the film was well photographed, many beautiful pictures of the 1950s in the country, I think for weeks. <br /> <br /> This movie was unique and big. I found it to be unpredictable and although the story ends in a somewhat open way, I was still happy. Whether you are looking for fun but powerful age groups or just want to commemorate the life of the 1950s, I guarantee that this movie is for you. Even if you do not have any expectations, it is quite likely that you are most impressed. Give it one down!
