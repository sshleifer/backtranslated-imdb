Reality TV Reality? Copy of "Fast Times from Ridgemont High"? "Say Anything" predecessor, what is grittier? I can't decide, but the soundtrack * is 80's - Blondie, Journey, REO Speedwagon, Devo, Lionel Richie, and U2 - I can't believe it, they'll never throw all those genres as a teenager in today's movie. <br /> <br /> I remembered it as a teenager - mostly sex parts and not a hint of altruism. Why? In the 80s I was a horny teenager. Again, I can't just describe how much I love that Rose, Kimberly Richardson's game, is the voice of "Pepper Ann" in the 90s and she was almost 30 years old when she was in America, next to 16 - Fantastic! Full cheese, reality, fantasy and comedy - with sincere cherry.
