Shwaas is awesome! given the low budgets of the producers, they have done an excellent job. It's a must see. The little boy has done an excellent job because his eyes are subject to many emotions. Grandpa is his best. Photography is great. Technically correct and very creative. This will add a lot of emotion to the mainstream content. The film keeps u swallowed up and not be surprised if you shake it for a few days after the movie and the story. I sincerely hope they will make this final Oscar nomination <br /> <br /> Enjoy it and don't forget it
