OK .. you have to calm down! This movie is not so bad. I saw it for the first time last night and fell in love with it! I have to admit that I am never a fan of LeeLee Sobieski, but it grew in me in this movie. I think Josh Hartnett is good looking, but c'mon..Cris Chris is the most wonderful guy I think I've ever seen! He made this movie better for me. C'mon girls .. if he doesn't have a shirt and goes to get water, I know your mouth has fallen. Yes, I know in the beginning that he is a jerk, but finally he understands how he acted and learned to be a great man. If he hadn't finished ... then I'd be mad. I think a couple of lines were not needed to say, but all this was a great movie! I definitely recommend it!
