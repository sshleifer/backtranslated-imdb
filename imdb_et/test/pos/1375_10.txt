I loved this movie! Yes, it is quite cheap and I am sure there are many reviews on it. But my goodness, what much they offer in cash. I was reminded of Sam Raim's early work. Yes, it is tough, but it has good energy and fun. The actors range from some very good small parts of Scott Ironside and Shawni Paul Hasser. Is it a cult film? Well it grew to me. The first time I liked it, but during the 3rd viewing I loved it. The film is probably out of 10 out of 10, but I'll give it to the 8 short cheeks. Anyone who can pull it out 8 is worth a look. Almost want me to visit Scotland!
