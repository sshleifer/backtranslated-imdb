I have to say that. Gary Busey recorded this movie. If it wasn't for his fine talent, this film would have been sub-par. I recommend the movie, but just barely. <br /> <br /> The biggest difficulty with film is its widespread disregard for historical, geographical, and physical accuracy. For example, why is Lubbock green and hilly? How does Buddy Producer Petty Eiras? Where are daily trips to Clovis, New Mexico Studio? Why is the Nashville Racial Hate Camp considered to destroy Holly's sound? Why was Buddy's two-week treatment with Maria a complicated, taboo, racial stereotype? Why are Buddy Tile Boxes Light Than Feathers? Finally, why have crickets been a disruption to Holly's talent hurdles? <br /> <br /> With these inaccuracies, they must see a punishment for the announcement of each movie, "Buddy Holly Story." However, Busey gives a confusing image as a man whose death eventually led to the killing of music.
