I was cast on the beach at Surfer Dude. It was almost muscular because the real muscle guy was really at the end of the day. Pauly had my brother and I (skateboarding in front of the tattoo) pulling the stuff that they were living in Venice because he was still doing his MTV thing. This movie is also very good. Would it have done my top 100 if I didn't have it ........?
