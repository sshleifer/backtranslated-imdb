I really liked it. (SPOILERS?) It was a really good plot, the main woman of this movie is really kewl. <br /> <br /> Despite being the only one who died alive and his lover, it looked like Ninja Scroll. Another kick ass movie. ;) <br /> <br /> See it in Japanese with subtitles. I don't know where the idiots are to learn English, but for some reason all dubid translation techniques get F. Subtitles are more correct. <br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 7/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Replayable: 9/10
