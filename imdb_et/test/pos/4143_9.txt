I was lucky enough to be extra in this movie when I was about 13 years old in the runway scenes. My primary school drama class was invited to attend. It was a fantastic experience. <br /> <br /> Gary Busey, Charles Martin Smith and Don Stroud played music all day! As a musician, I appreciate the tireless work and commitment that these men put into their roles. These songs have to be played 20 times. In such circumstances, consistency and energy are very difficult to maintain. This is visible when you take the picture "It's a Day", but fortunately the unsuspecting audience would probably not have taken it. <br /> <br /> All day skating spending leisure time and spending time was an incredible excitement. I also had the first "date" on the film. I had to walk to the ticket cab. Woo hoo! Even if the outdated hairstyle and hot lights melt the vaseline in my hair, it was worth it. Fun things. <br /> <br /> The film is top-notch and very satisfying. Busey offers its best role and supportive cast is great. I'm glad I have participated in a big movie. I think I could have been in Corvette Summer or something. No. <br /> <br /> A funny ironic ending is that many years later I was in a Malibu video store looking at a movie in the week when this video was released. Gary Busey walked in and stood next to me. I showed her cover and beat how big she was and how I was extra and not. Pretty weird but very cool, what's worth it.
