Darling Lili is a mixture of Perfection and Magic! Stars; Julie Andrews & Rock Hudson couldn't try when they tried. It's full of all the magic that a young lady wants, and that seems to make it all happen to you. Director's shine; Blake Edwards has been shown to be his best. She had really photographed the woman she loved on the screen! <br /> <br /> The mix of each song went perfectly with the film's moment. The film was opened with Julie Andrews, who sang Whistling Away In The Dark and closed the same song with Andrews. <br /> <br /> For this top-notch movie that has made such a failure, it's a complete hit ... <br /> <br /> As it is, "Inspirational ... purely .... Inspiring!" ~ One of Andrews most memorable features in this movie!
