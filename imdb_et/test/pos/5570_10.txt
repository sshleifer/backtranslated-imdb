I have to admit that at first I was worried about Farscape. The opening segment was not very strong, and I began to worry about what came. However, when he has reached the familiar Henson territory with a funny sense of humor, unique and enduring characters and a powerful story that united the great science fiction. The story is followed by John Crichton (played by Ben Browder), a scientist who has developed a spacecraft and a theory based on an explosive. But during his first attempt, his craft meets an unknown magnetic field and moves to an unknown galaxy where he is located in the midst of fighting fugitives (Moya star ships) and peacekeepers (human defenders). . He's literally pulled into the prisoners' ship and after several turns he finds himself in prison (Ka D'argo, Luxomian warrior; Pa'U Zhaan, priest Delvia; Rygel XVI, risen ruler and Aeryn Sun, peacekeeper who reluctantly joined the crew) Excellent special effect, moderate makeup and dolls and robots that exceed Henson's perfection standard, as well as a very well written story and character-like plot, FarScape looks like a fantastically original, creative and clever series of science fiction.
