I liked this movie. I wasn't quite sure what it was before I started to look at it, but I enjoyed it. It was about a girl (Meredith Monroe) whose mother didn't want her to look like she did. He meets and loves the boy (Riley Smith), who is in the city for a charity football game. This is a good movie. I hope it gets back on or appears on the video.
