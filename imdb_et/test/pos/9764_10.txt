This movie is a sleeping place - I watched every television that was once several times, and that's the best. Amazingly molded, well-behaved and characters are well developed. Helen Morse fits perfectly with Jean Paget, under control, sharp and a bit warlike. He beats Joe Harmonist, cowboy / taciturn / "It's okay". I was sorry that the film was not in the book because there was no romantic interest between Noel Struan and Jean Paget. For those who do not know, it is a real story that English women traveled around Malaya for three years by a Japanese who did not really know what to do with them. Very few of them survived. Neville Shute talked to one of them, and this is his story. This movie deserves to be in everyone's collection who loves World War II.
