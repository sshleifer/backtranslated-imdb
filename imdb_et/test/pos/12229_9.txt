The film that is offered, showing how our everyday life is a catalyst that causes our thoughts, behaviors and emotions to be the people we are not. This story is a love story with real emotions. I credit the outstanding achievements of Malcolm Jamal Warner (Win) and Challen Cates. A movie that is definitely worth a look, a holiday trip that turns into an emotional circle. I suggest you see it.
