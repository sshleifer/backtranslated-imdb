Before watching it, I read the comments on this movie in this movie. Once you have read them, you know they are almost all negative. I really don't understand that. I admit it is too long (it takes about half an hour to speed it up). Music is often inappropriate. But Ford's and Thomas's strong performances are indeed enough to do that. As a famous movie star, I forgot that Harrison Ford was really working! This role as a man who has defined himself wrongly is remarkable. In my opinion, it is quite plausible that he wants all the details he can get to see what was real and what was fraudulent. Thomas is always wonderful and it is no exception. His initial denial that causes confusion and then inner peace is enormous. This movie is never on anyone's list, but it's not that bad. I'm glad I waited for it on video, but it's worth $ 3 or $ 4.
