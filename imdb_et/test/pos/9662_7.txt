I have to say that I didn't expect this movie to be good. Eastern cinema usually gives 90% of the films to the Communist past. But this film goes beyond Romanian cinema, worth more advertising. <br /> <br /> The actor is truly and not exaggerated, the plot is simple but complicated because it presents life in the suburb of Romania, the sound was amazed, management was good and what else to say ... <br /> > This "crash" in Eastern Europe pulled me to the moment of live film. I have even felt a wish coming out of me, a desire for adventure after you see it. <br /> <br /> Look at it! Surely you will enjoy it! <br /> <br /> 7/10
