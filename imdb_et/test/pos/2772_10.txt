I love this movie. is it more airy? what can i do to get it back in the air, because i miss this movie when this movie reappears? i love this movie so much. Does anyone know how long it has been since it was the last in Disney, it's been a very long time and I'm so sick to wait! I swear they take out all the good films and play new fools who are fake and slowed down. I miss this movie, I want a star, Kazama with Shaquille O'neil and more a bunch. where did all the good movies go? I want them back. I miss all good movies and they don't have them anymore. if anyone discovers if Susie Q or some good old Disney movie comes out, please let me know my email address is girlygirl148@aol.com girlygirl (no empty space) 148. Thank you and hope you want this movie too back. good day
