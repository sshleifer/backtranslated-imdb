Dead End Kids early films (before they were baptized "Bowery Boys") were all very fun and well-produced movies from Warner Brothers. Despite being fairly formal, they still had great writing, acting and well-kept over time. Do not throw them at the cheap Bowery Boys movies of Monogram images - despite the presence of Huntz Hall and Leo Gorcey, these films were quality-based, with several earlier underlines. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a heavy guy with John Garfield winning a light boxing championship. Unfortunately, he will be drunk shortly afterwards and blame for the murder he did not actually do. The problem is that he was so burdened that he wasn't sure he'd killed the man so he ran away and lived a hobo's life. Eventually, he meets feisty May Robson and Dead End Kids - if the lady you just know becomes her girlfriend. <br /> <br /> If the rest of the movie wasn't so, it's surprising, but it doesn't seem important because of the quality of the movie. Garfield and the kids are their best and this is a movie that would definitely appeal to everyone, but not to the most painful viewer.
