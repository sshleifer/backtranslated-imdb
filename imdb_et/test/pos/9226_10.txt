Here's what you need to remember about this movie .... This is KIDS MOVIE !!!!! I don't know about others, but I'm a child of the 80s. I was covert with Rainbow Brite. So of course I love this movie. But if you watch other Rainbow Brite movies, it's the best. But as I said, it's a children's film. You have to evaluate it as a children's film. It does not matter to the child whether the actor, animation or script is fantastic or even good. All they care about is what happens to the cases. If a good man (or girl) wins, this is a great movie. If not, it's bad. You all know what I mean. You were all children once.
