Of all 48 films by Brigitte Bardot, "Une Parisienne" is widely regarded as one of her best. What we see is special: because if the value of the plot is on its own, it will do much more than just offering a vehicle that is worth paying for BB. <br /> <br /> This movie is your real and well-developed light comedy with a good and consistent story. In the French government circles at the end of the 1950s, it was entertaining from start to finish. Offering a lot of fun twists and some strokes - everyone worked on at least three main parts, including Bardot. <br /> <br /> "Une Parisienne" (= French "Parisian resident") focuses on telling a story, not Brigitte Bardot's show. Brigitte earns the plot very well, using her talent for light comedies. <br /> <br /> If you are tired and tired of your couch on Friday night, just turn on "Une Parisienne". This movie will help you feel better.
