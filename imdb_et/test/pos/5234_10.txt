I've never expected such an old movie to be as impressive as it turned out to be in the 1930s. The scenes, storms and sludge of the western pioneers in these wagons, and the harsh plausibility of their horrendous credibility in the case of storm and mud, river crossings, Indian attacks and any kind of trial and threat. Much of the film was shot outdoors and it is truly epic on film. Participants must have experienced the same conditions that the original pioneers did, and the results are amazing. Wagons, clothes, all details look and feel right. The characters are simple but incredible, with a simple story that travels like a wagon train to your destination. John Wayne is sheer and youthful in one of his first roles as a wagon leader, and he is doing a good job as an ideal crowd of youth. He's against the admirable villain of the trio, including Ian Keith, a sliding gambler, Charles Stevens as a Mexican sidekick and Tyrone Power, a parent like a growing, bear-like trap. Power-bearded, livelier than life's portrayal is both comical and threatening. I imagine her with a bandanna, a gold-eared earring and a black-eye patch that has a parrot on her shoulder as she plastered and crumbles a variety of dangers and insults. His character can easily be transferred to a pirate ship without any difficulty at all. He almost steals the whole picture. <br /> <br /> Tully Marshall is cheerful as the witch's old boarder who is Wayne's best friend. Lovely Marguerite Churchill makes a spirited heroine whose first encounter with Wayne is a fun mix, resulting in a long run consisting of insults and embarrassment of her indignation, filiation against her. The results are quite humorous and happy to see that they will eventually come together. <br /> <br /> The terrain is amazing, the wagons cross the real prairies and they must be lowered under the cliffs. Indians, who are obviously a genuine article, and not white actors in make-up, appear as friends and enemies and are treated with dignity. Wayne's character tells a adorable group of young boys that Indians are his friends who taught him everything he knows about living in the desert. <br /> <br /> The Big Trail has a tricky story, well done by talented talents and a team. It probably seems naive for many modern viewers, but there is a quiet dignity that will never let it starve. There's a lot of deliberate humor, including the dirty mess of the pioneer, who makes the sounds of loud animals hide every time a smooth gambler Ian Keith tries to marry a beautiful hero. Her floral speeches about the plantation she claims to have have been interrupted by very realistic wonderful cats and looting parties, causing it to be seductive to the visually impaired creatures. <br /> <br /> Very recommended for both western fans and old movie lovers in general. This is a truly classic film of age.
