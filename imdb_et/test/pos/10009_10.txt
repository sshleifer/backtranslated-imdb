I loved this movie from start to finish.I'm a musician and I let drugs get into some of my things I loved (skateboarding, drawing), but my friends were always for me. , life support and my medicine.It changed my life.I can totally relate to this movie and I wish there was more I can say.This film left me unspoken to be honest.I just saw this Ifc channel.I usually hate having satellite, but it was a satellite rubbing. Ifc channel shows some really great movies and I would never have found this movie without it. I am not a big fan of international movies because I find that many do not do a great job of translating lines. I mean, the obvious language barrier just makes you believe what they're talking about, but that's not the big deal I think. I almost never see this AMAZING movie. instead went to bed. Life earlier than usual.lol.I hope you all enjoy this movi hell e and love this movie as much as i did. I wish I could write it all in the hats, but once again the rules that I think it screams, but it really would show my excitement for the film. br /> <br /> This movie broke me off!
