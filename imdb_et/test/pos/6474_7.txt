Recently, Norway traveled from Norway to Bergen and stopped in a small town in Voss, Norway, and in honor of Knute Rockne, born in Voss, a memorial. Anyone who knows Knut so far and travel guides are proud to stop their monument. This movie is the great history of this great man and his great love for Notre Dame Never knew that Knut has both great chemical and laboratory sciences, as well as chemistry taught for years and at the same time instructed the football team. Ronald Reagan played the role of George Gipp (The Gipper), an outstanding football player; Reagan had a short role but played a big supporting role in this film. Donald Crisp (father of John Callahan) was a great priest who had great faith in Knut throughout his life in Notre Dame. This is a great classic film and is seen by many generations to come. Enjoy.
