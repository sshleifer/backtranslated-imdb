This seems to be like the Czech version of Pearl Harbor. It has the same story, both men love the same woman. And add the twist, the woman is actually married, whose husband has disappeared for years. I don't think the story is too strong. The younger boy is pretty naughty, it's cute. It kept me from emotional music and stunning scenes. It also has some strong special visual effects. The best thing is that the stories of love are integrated smoothly. <br /> <br /> I think that if it were in English, it would be a big blow across the country. It is too bad that not many people are open to foreign films.
