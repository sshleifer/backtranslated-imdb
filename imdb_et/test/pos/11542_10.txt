This documentary about Bill Hicks 'life and comedy includes Hicks' Revelations and other stand-up concerts. It also includes interviews with colleagues' comedy and industry people who knew him, as well as journalists and journalists who talked about how his political comment was raw and brutal. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed it very much. I had already seen "revelations", but the comedy clips were still refreshing. This is a nice balance between comedy and documentary, which explains Hick's popularity to non-fans and please those who already know him. <br /> <br /> I rated it ten.
