"English Patient" can be rightly compared to David Lea's wipes, such as "Lawrence of Arabia" and "Bridge on the Kwai River", which have been inspired by director Anthony Minghell. The film is beautifully captured and, like "Lawrence", is located in North Africa, but during World War II. The story is complicated, but it comes from the forbidden love that occurs between married wife Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas, who is an opinion and often a difficult archaeologist. <br /> <br /> The story based on the novel by Michael Ondaatje tells Fiennes' count Laszlo de Almasy - the character of the title. The fact that his name does not fit his English language plays a key role in what happens. He's a badly burned air defense, just like the movie opens, and Hana, Juliette Binoche's military nurse, takes care of it back in Europe. What makes this story an epic is the tremendous sweeping of all over the place, and the development of time and characters beyond the lovers of the two bad respects. The film explains that true love and passion, even with frightened consequences, can make life worthwhile or worthy of death. If you are romantic romantic and appreciate the movie without standard happy endings and simple moral codes, you may find that "English patient" speaks directly to you. <br /> <br />
