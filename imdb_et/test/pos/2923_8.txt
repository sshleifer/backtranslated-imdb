The film's historians have said a lot about the ancient epic, which has been the interest of many directors since the beginning of the cinema. The pioneers of such epics, especially Biblicals, were D.W Griffith with his "all-epic mother" INTOLERANCE (1916), and Cecil B DeMille with pride in great glasses, costumes and fancy scenes. Who can forget about your TEN COMMENTS (1923, 1956) or STATE NOTE (1932)? However, there is an epic led by Michael Curtiz in the 1950s, based on Mika Waltar's "Egyptian" novel. Michael Curtiz, already known for his great classic CASABLANCA (1941), succeeds perfectly in adapting his film to the audience of this time to incorporate the most important ideas and facts from a thick novel and to restore the lifestyle of those Egyptians who lived in one of the most amazing periods of Akhnaton's reign. <br /> <br /> The first and most important fact in this movie is the psychological development of Edmund Purdom's main character. Sinuhe, who has been raised in a simple family by her parents, becomes a doctor. Throughout his life he never ceases to ask "why?" and searching for an answer. The loving love she finds in the courthouse Nefer (Bella Darvi) leads her to a financial and mental disaster. He must fix the mistakes in the work of the house of death and start doing nothing about creating his reputation. First, he thinks that the only treatment is revenge. However, in the long run, he understands that "eye eye" is not the solution. Finally, what stands in front of him in very strange conditions is the temptation to be Pharaoh. However, one moment he finds the answer to his questions that touched him throughout his life ... The story of the main character, though based on the book, is so psychologically interesting that every open minded person should consider this aspect of the film. The psychological struggle of the main character is intensified by the times when he lived, in times when the sword was probably the first to gain power by reason. <br /> <br /> Curtiz's film also retains one of the rule that all his films were captured: big and rich sets. There are mostly British actors and actors who give very nice performances. Not to mention the ancient epic, Victor Mature? This time he is not Demetrius, Hannibal or Samson, but Horemheb - fighter, lover, finally Pharaoh. Jean Simmons appears in a very delicate role of Merit, a woman who loved Sinuhe throughout her life, but it was too late for her to realize it. Peter Ustinov, probably the most famous of his excellent performance from Nero to QUO VADIS? Three years earlier, he does a good job like a friend of Kaptah, Sinuhe. Two major productions, Gene Tierney and Michael Wilding, also play the film royalties. Tierney is great for the cold, if she wants power from Baketamon, Pharaoh's sister. Wilding gives an excellent result as a "crazy" Akhnaton. When I was in Louvre, Paris, and saw Akhnaton's original stone from stone, he looked very much like the actor of the film. Bella Darvi, an actress born in Poland, is quite memorable as Nefer. And another actor who appears only in one scene, but who is hard to forget, Judith Evelyn like Taia, Pharaoh's mother. That voice, those eyes! <br /> <br /> Sets are great. The director created the most likely image of the outer temple of Aaton, which is God under the rule of the Egyptian Amenhotep IV. I also loved Pharaoh's first entrance to the scene. What a brilliant picture that will remain in memory forever !!! However, there is also one aspect that I would like to draw the attention of all interested people to the film. Egypt is similar to many aspects of other epics, but it is also a unique film. There are very few films that make such wonderful interests as in ancient times. There's mention of the iron you used in the Hippies. It is also the only movie about ancient Egypt that speaks openly about the excellent drying ability of the Egyptians. It shows a memorable way of life contrasts, especially the slave's death, for which no one cares about it, followed by announcement and consequently widespread mourning after Pharaoh's death. Finally, one of the historical facts of "Egypt" is: there were other peoples except the Jews (before Christ), where the spirit of God appeared in some person's heart. But the only difference was that it didn't stay as long as the Jews, because it had no strong base. There are so many Biblical and Christian values ​​on the scene of Akhnaton's death that you think you are watching a religious film. <br /> <br /> All things, I recommend Michael Curtiz's movie. It is a big production activity on several levels: entertainment for epic fans, admiration for great performances for cinema fans, spiritual souls of the spirit party. Finally, this is a beautiful story of the extraordinary things that happened thirteen centuries before the birth of Jesus Christ.
