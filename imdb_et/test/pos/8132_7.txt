Although I saw this movie in French, so I'm sure she lost something in translation, accents, etc., It was a great, fun movie for a lonely night in the room. - which represented exactly and positively the finding of individual sexuality, gender role and place in communities where one should belong - man, gay, city, 30-ish, etc. television that shows such a fair and positive image of the gay community. Although the fact that the gel lead ends somewhat "straight" is a bit disappointing, it is life and it happens sometimes. It's a great movie, either alone or with a date! A truly enjoyable experience.
