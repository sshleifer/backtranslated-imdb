I bought a DVD a long time ago and finally I could watch it. I really enjoyed watching this movie because you don't get the chance to see many of the more serious, high-quality Bollywood movies. Very well done and I'd say you need to pay attention to what's going on because it's easy to get lost. When you start watching a movie, do nothing else! I would recommend people to read all comments here before watching a movie ... including spoilers. Raima Sen gave her first excellent performance I've seen. Aishwarya was his best. All the performances were strong, management and cinematic ... look at it!
