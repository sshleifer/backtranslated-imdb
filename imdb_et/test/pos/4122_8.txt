Even after almost 20 years, Black Sabbath's original members have not lost anything. In this concert, they perform their best songs of their prosperity (1970-1978), including "NIB", "War Pigs" and "Paranoid". <br /> <br /> There is an invaluable rear view with interviews and retrospects on your days as the planet's hard rock band. The comments from Ozzy, Tony Iomm, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward are just as interesting and intriguing to watch as a stunning stage game. <br /> <br /> All fans of breathing and Ozzy must see.
