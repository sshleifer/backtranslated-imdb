If you had asked me how the movie was inside the movie, I would have told you that it was great! However, I left the theater with dissatisfaction. After some thought, I think the problem was the pace of the end. I feel that most of the movie was moving slowly and the ending ended very quickly. So I would say that the ending ended up frustrated with me. <br /> <br /> I thought the characters were well developed. Costner and Kutcher both played their role very well. Yes! Ashton Kutcher can act! The different relationships between the characters also seemed very real. In addition, I thought the different line lines were well developed. In general, it was a good movie and I would recommend seeing it. <br /> <br /> In summary: Good characters, big plot, poorly written / edited. Still, look at it!
