I think it was the most prominent thriller with your seat, I've seen for a long time. The film was thoroughly researched, writer Kelly Sane has not been looking for. Cast seasoned (fantastic performance all around). Omar Metwally was outstanding. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is poetic, the enchanting and general impact of music is very satisfying. <br /> <br /> Play goes to the territory where even the media is afraid to wear. This is indeed an awakening to trigger espionage and a legitimate web that is a "war on terrorism". <br /> <br /> The woman walked out of the theater and asked if this would really happen? This in itself tells of the masterful achievement of Gavin Hood.
