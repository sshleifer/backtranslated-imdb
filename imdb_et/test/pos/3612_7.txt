Here's a well-made military history, nicely shot and well-behaved. Italian and German occupation of Greece and Kefalonia is well done. John Hurt as Pelagia's father and doctor on the island are great, Nicolas Cage does a good job, Penelope Cruz does a good job of being beautiful and hitting his eyelashes at Cage. There are heroes and humor, there is drama and romance, and it's all on an idyllic island. <br /> <br /> Curiously, it is very similar, or I should say almost identical storyline with the same characters. the same series of events as the title of the same name, Louis de Bernieres. This wonderful historical novel tells the story of Pelagia, the daughter of the Iannis doctor, and their life in Cephalonia during the Second World War. The Pelagian groom, a local fisherman in Mandras, will open when the Italian army invades the false pretext of Albania to northern Greece. When the axis finally comes, a lot of help from the Germans will be placed on the island, the garrison of Italian soldiers and Captain Corelli will play a major role in keeping the occupation peaceful. As Mandras participates with partisans, Corell and his mandolin doctor and his beautiful daughter scream. Of course, it makes love a novel. But it is also a war novel, a summary of Greek history, the story of post-war Greek Communist uprising, a portrait of Mussolini's madness, and most importantly, the island's life in Cephalonia. <br /> Some of these elements will return to the movie, but in general this is an impossible book for the film. I'm glad nobody ever tried. <br /> <br /> The movie "Captain Corelli's Mandolin" is still worth it. Just make sure you read the book * after you see the movie.
