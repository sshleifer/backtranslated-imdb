Well, unfortunately, I can't help but a little disappointed after my much, much anticipated "Just Before Dawn" viewing. Jeff Lieberman is a fantastic filmmaker and he can undoubtedly do great things with a small budget, but I think I see a lot more sadistic and tough in the early 80s. But actually I think Lieberman is not to blame for this, but we are gorehounds! It is more than obvious that Lieberman was going to make his horse puller like "Deliverance" and absolutely not as "Friday 13", which immensely popularized the subgroup one year earlier. Horror and a constant sense of threat do not usually come from the demented maniac, which are on their machines, but on the truly evil and isolated forests of Oregon, where the film was shot. If the film seems slow and uneven, it is only because Lieberman takes the time to introduce the dark forests and eerie mountains in his film. We hardly see the killers personally, but there always seems to be someone who attracts behind trees or mountain lakes. With this in mind, "Just Before Dawn" becomes a very admirable horror problem, and in fact it is much better than that of our counterparts with modern blood. Almost infinite choice and poor slasherside puts Lieberman in focus on tension and character development. The plot revolves around five twenty people who travel in the Oregon forest, where one of them owns a small land. Forests are abandoned and, of course, ignore campers Roy's (George Kennedy!) Forest Ranger. Shortly thereafter, they are brutally confronted with an inbred family whose twin sons have murders. All five main characters are surprisingly pleasing and convincing! There are no irritating stereotypes that you do not feel sympathy, such as slutty girls or football players. As a result of this "natural" character, you will automatically rejoice, even if they end up becoming almost wild. High camera work gives the film a sometimes intolerable level of stress, and Brad Fiedel's cooling electronic score adds only that effect. "Just before Dawn" is a subtle part of the horror of the early 80s, if you don't want to drip your blood on your TV.
