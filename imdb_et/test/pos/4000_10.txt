Everyone gives it a fire ... <br /> <br /> This is one of the most masterpieces of the film. In the 19th century, Korea tells the story of the famous painter Ohwon, but rather depicts an anecdotal anecdote, a melodrama, or a psychological eggshell throughout his life, all of which are beautiful works of art. It does not give an interpretation of these episodes, but leaves the viewer with the paintings of Ohwon. In this way, the viewer enters the same reflection as Ohwon, and minus his talent can "feel" his inspiration for his paintings. <br /> <br /> Part of why it is so effective is the 19th century Korean and musical / artistic world that Ohwon moved in is completely masterful. Outside the paintings, there are so many great shots that we get a mirror effect, where we see a beautiful world that inspires Ohwon, Ohwon, who lives and watches this world, and his artworks reflect each other. <br /> <br /> The story is about the extreme economy. An unknown feeling has hardly ever been left or explained, it just appears quickly and has disappeared for the next appearance. Similarly, it is a piece of Mozart's art (endless and fast successive big idea) rather Beethovinian (Obsessive lingering on one great idea). It has a classic limitation, like Ohwon's paintings. There is really no music that suggests how to feel, except for some classic Korean pieces that are used very effectively in many scenes (and mostly played by movie characters). One dreamy picture, if I remember correctly, is a flock of birds jumping on the blue hills, while female singers are <br /> <br /> "This life is like a dream and only death awakens us" <br /> <br /> One of the advisory lines of a film from one of Ohwon's teachers is that "the painting lies between the strokes." The film follows this attitude, because * there is so much * that is spoken and described in the film. I've seen it twice and it was very useful in the second look. A very tiny film with a little polite explanation saw how it is Imi's 96th film. This is artistic craftsmanship. Like Ohwon's great friend and mentor, he says he describes one of his paintings: "No gear is wasted." <br /> <br /> I compare it to Andrei Rubylev with a high quality, although the style is very different. It is much easier and more direct to entertain, but in a classic form where Andrei is Gothic. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is highly recommended for almost everyone except appetite junkies. I missed both times, I felt a wonderful spiritual innovation. <br /> <br /> One of the things that led me to my life was that his mad drinking and looting suddenly began after a noble visit, telling him that "good art can only come from great knowledge and learning. "The next short scene Ohwon was very angry and next burst into drunkness because he was often left behind for the rest of the movie. I'm curious as to why the words of the nobles made him so much and drove him to a drink that dominated the rest of his life. Or was it just a coincidence?"
