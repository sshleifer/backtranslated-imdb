Anyone who has seen Ali G in the past should be well prepared with a full movie called "Ali G Indahouse" <br /> <br /> While I prefer Ali G when he interviews the rich and famous, his well-known brands. Also, wall comedy is definitely entertaining from start to finish on the big screen. <br /> <br /> A ridiculous plot, ridiculous characters and a ridiculous script that all turn this movie into a rebellion for Ali G. fans. > <br /> If you have seen him and did not like him, beware of this movie as a plague, because it is definitely the same; everyone else - see it Aiiii! 7/10
