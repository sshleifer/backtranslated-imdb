Clouzot followed Le Corbeau, where no one knew who was poisoning, so everyone was suspected of another masterpiece, Quai des Orfevres four years later, when we knew from the beginning (or we think we're doing it). Top-billed Louis Jouvet doesn't appear for forty minutes when Clouzot has created a rich music hall environment, music publishers, and more. Angela Lansbury's look-alike (Lansbury appeared in Paris in the same year) Suzy Delair appreciates that her desire to improve her party inspires her husband Bernard Blier's jealousy. is already dead. Things get seriously wrong here, his car is stolen before he leaves the room, so his pre-arranged alibi is out of the window, while he seems to be unknown, his wife admits murder to a photographer's neighbor, a lesbian beloved closet, who voluntarily returns to crime and loads out of Delair's scarf, and as long as she is there, she carefully wipes out the prints of the murderer - champagne bottle. At this point, researcher Jouvet is involved and since then it has been a case of holding the plates in the air. Clouzot's production was relatively small, but almost all of it, as Spencer Tracey said in another context, "cherce", where Le Salaire de peur and Les Diaboliques have yet to come. In short, it is mandatory for French cinematographers.
