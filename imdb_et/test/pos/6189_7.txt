Sleeper Cell is trying to swim on both sides of the pool (terrorism / patriotic Muslim Americans) and it is not very well. <br /> <br /> I had been watching this exhibition for a very long time because I felt it was too predictable, but after a year of my netflix ranking I finally moved up. <br /> <br /> The exhibition is about a secret Muslim man working in the FBI, trying to invade a terrorist group in the United States. The secret agent in the exhibition is actually a Muslim, so we see his conflict / resolution between his patriotism and his religious beliefs. Personally, I would rather have watched the drama of a Muslim-American family living in the United States, but it is doubtful whether the American television channel (cable or network) will ever bring anything that shows the flattering light of Muslims. <br /> <br /> I am not a Muslim, but I have many Muslim-American friends, and I can honestly say that none of them are terrorists and they all love America. <br /> <br /> Sleeper Cell is close to bursting Muslim stereotypes, but also focuses on worse Muslim stereotypes. In the first episode we see a "killing of honor", which is a very bad image of Islam, but in the third episode we see a very respected moderate Muslim teacher who teaches viewers that true jihad is actually a personal struggle that is not meant to incite violence against others. <br /> <br /> When the exhibition's main character was only a moderate Muslim teacher. <br /> <br /> Americans need to learn a lot about Islam, sleeping bags a little, but it is far from giving the American audience what it really knows. <br /> <br /> The performance of this show is great and drama is extremely engaging. If only they had shown Islam in America without terror, it would have been the first rate.
