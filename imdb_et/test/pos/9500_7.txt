Don't change your husband's Cecil B. DeMille's small marriage comedy. On the other hand, his first picture of the star Gloria Swanson, probably the greatest actor of the quiet era, is a film that made her a star. <br /> <br /> Although the old DeMille formula began to change, and his films became verbal and less pure. With this expressive performer, Swanson, we restore this silent storytelling style. His character is very little but transmits volumes through fine gestures and facial expressions? a specific talent to see disobedience. In real life, Swanson himself ended his catastrophic marriage with Wallace Beery, and it is possible that it led to convincing performance. <br /> <br /> As the best complement to your leading ladies' talents, DeMille uses a particularly strong framing and close-ups. Does he use cinematographic techniques to show an actor? often do Swanson's long close-ups take time at major moments? and also visually explain the story. For example, when we introduce the character of Toodles, it is shown three times in the mirror of the reflection plate. His character disappears to become an important end. This thrilling first hitting her will help us remember who she was. Later, the anniversary dinner, Swanson and her future husband number two, Lew Cody is framed in one shot, while Elliot Dexter is isolated in her frame. Also? and is it a sign of the overall complexity of the cinema in general? Are There Many Reactions? for example, the bishop's unfamiliar gaze when Cody makes his intentions with the dolls in the form of wedding. <br /> <br /> Unlike DeMille's visual narrative method, his partner Jeanie Macpherson was increasingly verbally writing. As I have pointed out in several other comments, Macpherson can create a strong and dramatic story, but, as with DeMille, he tended to mark his subjects somewhat pretentious and terrible. And so we get those very long quasi-philosophical title cards about the pitfalls of the marriage life, which, if they improve the story at all, are just because they are unintentionally funny. For example, only Jeanie Macpherson can come out, such as "Fate sometimes a Christmas boy". Fortunately, though, in this picture these titles are mostly scenes, not to break them up. <br /> <br /> Although the pictures he made during this time tended to be small in size, it seemed that DeMille looked like his taste for the outstanding. You will see that it is hoped for excuses, like some razzmatazzs, like Swanson's small fantasy scenes that are showered with "joy, wealth and love". Only in the early twenties after the unofficial embargo on historical images was lifted, can he get out of the spectacular spectacle. <br /> <br /> All in all, do not change your man is a fairly decent silent picture of DeMille, although frankly, it is only Gloria Swanson who is raising it above average. However, it is curious that this is allegedly a comedy, and Swanson was at least partially cast in the background of Mack Sennett's slapstick factory. He hated comedy, and here is a dramatic rather than comic performance. Then there is the idea that the only straightforward drama he did with DeMille, Man and Woman, was the strongest of their collaboration.
