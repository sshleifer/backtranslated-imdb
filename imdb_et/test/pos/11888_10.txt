Some martial arts purists think comedy was the worst thing that could have happened to the old school kung-fu flick; and it is true that the introduction of comedy into the genre signaled the end of the Hong Kong film "kari-socky". The fact, however, is that it is only so long that physical abilities can be exercised, but everyone is bored. And this is really the reason why the split sock died and how Hong Kong's "New Wave" action film was born: producers, actors, directors all missed out for ninety minutes. <br /> <br /> Given that Liu Chia Liang is a professional director with a significant number of films in her CV, this movie has to be seen as just one kung-fu comedy. Rather, it is a comic film of the martial arts genre and actually one of the best ever made. <br /> <br /> What Liu has done with this movie is really a pleasant surprise: he has taken the martial arts - a plot and built it around with a Hollywood style musical line! Fill with singing and dancing episodes! At the time of making this film, some filmmakers and film fans began to realize that martial arts cinematographic performance (which actually comes from the acrobatics in Chinese opera) is more dancing than dancing. (I'll direct this link until most Americans understand what they really need to look for in a martial arts film - well-choreographed body movements, using the plot of action film as a pretext for their results.) In any case, quite clearly, Liu Chia Liang made the link and decided that explores it near its borders. as often as possible when they do so). The film, set at the beginning of the 19th and early 20th centuries, allows Liu to explore the nature of China's Western and Modernization, which made a great contribution to the awareness of modern China. Thus, the film also has significant historical imports. <br /> <br /> Also, fans of Stephen Chow's recent Kung Fu Hustle should watch this movie carefully, as Chow clearly learned about it before he made his movie. br /> <br /> Very fun and well-made film. Oh, yeah, and kung fu is really, really good. <br /> <br /> The purists do not recognize this, but this is probably the best film by director Liu.
