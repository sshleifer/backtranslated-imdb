In the 1978 adaptation, all were potentially components of a wonderful film. It is based on Charles Kingsley's absolutely charming book. It has truly talented productions like James Mason, Bernard Cribbons and David Tomblinson, not to mention David Jason and Jon Pertwee. Also, Lionel Jeffries, the wonderful leader of the classics, such as the Children of Railways and the amazing Mr Blunden, and although the film is mostly good, it was a little disappointing. I had no problem with the performance, especially with Mason and Tomblinson as Grimes and Sir John Harriet, and Tommy Pender and Samantha Gates are believing as Tom and Ellie. The voice is also praiseworthy, especially Jon Pertwee, which in turn expresses charming signs. I also liked random music, which is both haunting and beautiful, and the script was quite faithful and generally well written, especially at the beginning. The characters, especially the Water Babies, are very charming and the villains are at the same time outraged and funny, I loved the part that Tom and his friends helped to escape the Water Baby, seeing that the electric ewe-shark was very funny. I say, however, that the film does not look like a date, especially animation sequences, the live actions were not as bad as you forgive quite dark camera work. The animation of the characters was quite flat and the backgrounds were sometimes tiny, although there were some pleasant moments, such as the Krakow scene and of course the first meeting with Water Babies. I also had confusing feelings about the songs, the song of the Water Babies was beautiful, but I found the first song to be forgotten when Tom got under the water. Hi-Cockallorum is an example of a song that is like a marmi, you love it or hate it. Personally, I don't know what to do with this song, it was fun at the beginning, but if it's headed, it might be annoying. As much as I like Lionel Jeffries and his films, there was just a miracle and magic he usually did in his direction. All in all, this is definitely not a terrible movie, but it could have been more artistic. 7/10 Bethany Cox.
