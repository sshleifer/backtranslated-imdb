Forget everything you've ever read from Mallachi Brothers' direct video "Snakes is a Train", especially if it was a negative review. This movie is so much more fun than the movie it probably hangs: "Snakes on the plane." Frankly, I am surprised that more people have not raped this low-budget asylum application. Instead, most of the surveys that are being read have nothing to say or be critical of, except for the usual silly cattle mindset, as the actor was amateur, did not work numerically with advertising and the whole thing was a waste of time. Of course, it does not help that the title is an example of the obvious cracking of this film. In fact, I felt "Snakes on a Train" crossed "snakes on an airplane" for several reasons. <br /> <br /> First of all, manufacturers used real true snakes for the last fifteen minutes when they replaced one. a giant fake head or computer generated a super-giant snake that consumed the entire Amtrak train. How many films will the train ferment? As a result, "Snakes is a Train" is the first high-definition film. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it uses somewhat harsh effects from a low budget movie. A woman who loves baby snakes - real - was fantastic! His special effects, which were later torn down by the forearm, were visually appealing! You can also see a small white girl eating a snake. She was as cute as she could be, no more than 10 years old or out there, and she died yelling like a nasty ol√© giant mister snake head swallows. Not only endangered children, but children too! This is precisely the kind of graphic material you don't find in 99% of all theatrical publications in Hollywood. Of course, he was not eaten by a real snake, but it is a subversive thought that counts. Third, it is one of those cursed of those films where Alma (Julia Ruiz, "This Guy"), a female headmaster - not a hero - has a passion for her parents because she has not married a man they suggested. As a result, she is full of stomachs, hurts a lot of radiator fluid, and then the baby's snake slips. Imagine Medusa, mythical characters with hair stomachs, only on their stomach. His psycho-shaman-type boy collects all the snakes coming out of him because they move on the train to L.A to see his relative who can put all the snakes back on him and return to his normal. Talk about the shot nature that fills the abdominal preparation procedure. Prepare yourself a lot of mucus, blood and gore. Fourth, there were only about twenty passengers on the train, not hundreds. However, it seemed that Mallachi Brothers filmed a true, real train of an average medium horror with real snakes, and they played the train's running on the tracks. <br /> <br /> Fifth, the snakes slip in the first hour, quietly penetrating the train before they are strange and all attack. In other words, it's intercourse, intercourse, intercourse, before people begin to kill snake bites. <br /> <br /> For the last five minutes, when a snake grows over a runaway train and swallows it, "Snakes is Train" is a twisted, wonderful and way out. It doesn't have too much of a Hollywood movie. It is a fantasy of unhappy Spanish women who have fallen victim to their feminist, social attitude. <br /> <br /> In total, you have a fantastic type; Heroes snaking around the train and at the end I have a surprising giant snake. By the way, they get on board the train because a number of other Mexicans have bribed train staff and the Mexicans think the girl is so cute that they let her and her boy for free. <br /> <br /> I think it's better than "Snakes is a Plane" if you want a harsh, little, independently produced horror movie.
