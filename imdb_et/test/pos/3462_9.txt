as a "physically challenged" person (God, how do I hate this phrase), I just happened to have a cable where there was nothing else to look at - it was a fantastic movie in general. Yes, I was a little disappointed when I found out that neither actor is forbidden, and yes, I was a little disappointed that more movies were not filmed from the "real" perspective of disabled people (can you imagine what it is) as always be the highest a person in the room and then live the rest of his life, not only considering the asses and bikes of other people, always waiting for the idiot to stop reading the newspaper with the only disabled crowd that lasts all others are rude physical expulsions while waiting?). and driving with him was absolutely me! there, literally. but the movie was true that the thing - although I've never lived in a home or married residence, was a lot of times during the film where I found myself nodding and saying to myself "yes it's true .... it happened to me ... "What I was impressed with is that some of the comments made by this board revealed the fact that the film made their lives a little different and a little more understandable than the life of a silent minor - do not ask more than a movie that it makes you think and look at life differently, so only because of this, the movies were tremendously successful. There should be a need to watch every child in a youth school. <br /> <br /> pretty much for every person who is seriously physically disabled, independence is one of our daily lives or not most importantly, for those who felt that the film was "cloned", try to live our life for a day - you see that the film was "cliched" because ..... this is a true field The ewes that the participants were facing only cut what happens to us every day - when we are happy, we experience the same emotional and personal growth that the three characters (including the girl) did. every day is a barrier to overcoming us - it's just that our lives don't involve swelling, dramatic music if it's not on our iPod .... lol!
