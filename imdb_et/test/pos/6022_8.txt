If you want to see what could be classified as a "stage" version of GYPSY, this is a movie for you. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy the lists on GYPSY MERMAN, you will really enjoy this MIDLER as a Gypsy mother, ROSE. I think Midler has Merman's volume, vibrato and gifts. <br /> <br /> While listening to music updates, it is not often the day that I get this tingling sensation that makes hair on my neck slip, but Bette Midler will definitely show her talents in this movie - see how you like apples ... .. <br /> <br /> I know you don't like it, but for me, Mrs Midler is the final "Gypsy".
