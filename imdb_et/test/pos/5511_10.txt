I didn't think this movie was bad. Of course the detective sucks what he did, and he usually happened to Capt. Howdy randomly, but he got this job. Captain Howdy himself was pretty scary. The make-up artist did a great job. I really liked Dee's all dressed up. I laughed as hard as I saw it. Personally, I don't see how anyone can sit through a mess like Texas Chainsaw Massacre and call it a great movie and then look at Strangeland, which is more annoying because a lot of it could actually happen if the internet is so popular and called bad. Personally, I think the Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a crust. Probably one of those stupid movies I've ever seen. I enjoyed Strangeland. It was a very disturbing film, because almost all of this really happens.
