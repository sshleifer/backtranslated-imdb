Having known and loved this book because I was eleven years old, I was scared to see it appear in the movie - what if they had made this terrible mess? If I don't have to worry at all. Everyone was very well cast and the actor was terrible, the story was very good, except for the strange addition of the scene to the prison, which didn't add anything to me at all. But this is really the most beautiful love story and I'm so glad I made this video so I can watch it again and again. My only hand is - why didn't they give Kester a green vest that made him such a pleasant person? Such a simple thing when they went all out of trouble. If you have a chance, look, it's great.
