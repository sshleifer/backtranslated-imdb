What a surprise. A copy of the classic classic "The Nutty Professor", which is just zero. Funny guy Tim Thomerson (who steals the show as Blinkin Robin Hood-Men In Tights) is completely fun like anal retentive Dr. Jekyll and sex madness Hyde. <br /> <br /> One funny scene is when Dr. Lanyon (Mark Blankfield) tries to get Jekyll in his daughter's bed and says: <br /> <br /> "How do you dare my innocent daughter." <br /> <br /> Jekyll replies, "but sir, I'm going forward with the operation." <br /> <br /> Lanyon is back, "Oh, your brain out!"
