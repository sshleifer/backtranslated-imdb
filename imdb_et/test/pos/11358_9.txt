Excellent and charming. Justin Henry is beautiful as the blissful and naughty Howard Kaylan, the lead singer on The Ten Turtles's biggest hit strip. True magic is the Royale Watkins procedure with the academic award. A performance that completely captures the mysterious and yet ground Jimi Hendrix. Many movies, incredibly so, do not find a special snapshot in life and time. I would like to see it at any home video retail point without any problems. What's the matter? <br /> <br /> Thanks to Eddie. A worthy addition to the history of the psychedelic sixties. A firm eye for the mind.
