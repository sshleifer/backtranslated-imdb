I don't like these anime movies (eg, Pokemon, Dragonball Z, Naruto), but I think Zatch Bell is different. Zatch Bell is more exciting, holds better characters and doesn't focus as much on a gun or Mamodo as far as the episodes I've seen, like the episodes "Big Brother Kanchome", "Zatch vs Kiyo" .Zatch Bell really focuses on Strange Zatchi, The Smart Kiyo, The Clueless Suzy's Life. and WeIrD Ponygon.Zatch Bell is probably my Fav Cartoon now, but I encourage others to look at 1 episode of this, you will probably like it! <br /> <br /> -Robbie H.
