I've been a Rachel fan since the beginning of the 30MM in the Food Network, so I've seen that it has grown over the years. The moment I saw him communicate with Oprah, I predicted that this show would happen because I saw Oprah with him and for a good reason: he comes over very natural and wants to laugh, which is very interesting. The set is appealing, and there are some fresh ideas (I love lazy Susan that the audience is sitting). There is just enough of the celebrity segment, and it stays away from controversy and debate (enough for daily television). The exhibition is a slightly exciting escape and he has not left his strength (cooking), which is very good planning. I know there are people who hate him and hate him; it's OK, you can't like everyone. And somehow, I think Rachael knows and accepts it. So just twist the channel; I don't think he would remember.
