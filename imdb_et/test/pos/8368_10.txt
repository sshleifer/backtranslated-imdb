I was born in Beijing in China and moved to the United States at the age of 9. Since then I was at home in Beijing and loved it every time. One of the many things I love in Beijing is the people and the atmosphere they bring to the city. "You hao hao hao shuo" (which translates more precisely "if you have something to say, say it nicely") gently and truly captures Beijing's feeling. I think you should have lived and understood Beijing and its people to get the most out of this movie, even though you can enjoy it, regardless of it. <br /> <br />> The story is not complicated, deliberate. and exciting. I leave it open by itself and don't tell you too much, except for some comments. Every detail, from pictures, decorations, streets and restaurants on the walls, is at home. (Zhang Yimou most likely shot everything "on the ground") But more importantly - characters - our "hero", girl, affectionate, but unfortunate "laptop man" and nightclub owner are both over Beijing and love differently. Their conversations really capture the character of each character. The story that is mostly due to situations and conversation (except for the bright bafoonery to the end) is interesting and always interesting. <br /> <br />> I'm 21 years old now. My parents and I love this movie. We are always so amazed at Zhang Yimou's ability to turn ordinary people into plausible screen signs and everyday life for extraordinary situations. <br /> <br /> "Keep cool" - different. fun. meaningful.
