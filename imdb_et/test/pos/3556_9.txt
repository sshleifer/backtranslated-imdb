I almost didn't see Hi-De-Hi! I think it was supposed to be the title that put me down. These days, The Radio Times' Welsh language publications were only used to print certain titles of exhibitions without providing information about what they were actually. "Hi-De-Hi!" advised me of a bad quiz show organized by Leslie Crowther or a worse US import. But I managed to get a later episode and I was surprised that it was written by Jimmy Perry and David Croft. <br /> <br /> Just like the father's army and it wasn't a half-hot mother, Perry relied on this personal experience, in this case her time at the Butlin holiday camp. Before going through cheap air travel in the 1960s, these bearings in the British coastal areas have aroused entertainment for working-class families and serve millions to their owners. <br /> <br /> (Interestingly, I did one of those camps in the 80s as a cook - Barry Island, South Wales - for all the known and known reasons of "Shag Land"! <br /> > Set in the late 50s, this university academician, Jeffrey Fairbrother (Simon Cadell), started working as a poorly-equipped Maplin entertainment manager, including a lively comedy Ted Bovis (Paul Shane), his connective Spike (Jeffrey Holland), unhappy Punch and Judy man Mr.Partridge (Leslie Dwyer), snobby dancers Barry (Barry Howard) and Yvonne Stuart-Hargreaves) Diane Holland) and unforgettable Gladys Pugh (Ruth Madoc) who liked Fairbrother in every way. Bubbly Su Pollard stole the exhibition as cleaner Peggy Ollerenshaw, whose management was to be "Yellowcoat" (all the important employees wore them). Many sexy girls also captured these coats, especially Nikki Kelly 'Sylvia' and statueque Rikki Howard 'Betty'. We never saw owner Joe Maplin. He sent non-grammatical signs to his staff that poor Jeffrey was forced to read aloud. "Hi-De-Hi!" there was a greeting of the campers, usually met with an equal 'Ho-De-Ho!' <br /> <br /> One fan was Mr Sir Fred Pontin, who told Perry and Croft that he recognized most of the real life. <br /> <br /> I found Bovis always the most convincing as well as the most tragic, like Archie Rice, was a comedian whose great break never came, reducing the jerky gags to the drunken audience's entertainment. He took advantage of his position to give some perks, and in one memorable episode, Fairbrother's patience rose and he sounded like "Lies, Ted! All wrong!". <br /> <br /> Like any other perry / croft series, the cast was excellent, especially Cadell and Shane. Ruth Madoc's Prissy 'Gladys' got my nerves (don't know Anne Robinson hates Welsh!), But Leslie Dwyer's misanthropic "Mr.Partridge" and Felix Bowness "Jockey" Fred Qulley "more than compensated. <br /> <br / > The visual gag that everyone remembers is drunk Mr.Partridge, which makes the pantomime ride on a real beach. Looking at the bottle of whiskey in his hand, he decides to stick with it and instead throws the banana he had eaten! <br /> < br /> Due to its crazy blend of '50s nostalgia and rodent gags', Hi-De'Hi was a big hit for BBC-1 in the 1980s, resulting in Butlins and Pontins, which went downhill when Cadell left the theater I never took his replacement, Squadron Leader Clive Dempster (David Griffin). Worse, Leslie Dwyer's death kidnapped one of its best characters. Kenneth Connor was brought to replace Uncle Sammy. <br /> <br /> Sometimes setting the time period caused problems In one episode, Sylvia and Betty Peggy had to dive to rescue the pool, which for some reason was a shark. During this period, misleading costumes were wrong. Still, they looked great, so who's complaining? In another, Ted sang Tom Jones hit "Delilah" campers. It was not prepared (by Les Reed and Barry Mason) until 1968. <br /> <br /> Maplins closed his doors in 1988 and the last shot was Peggy (now Yellowcoat) alone in the camp jumping and shouting (what else?) "Hi-De-Hi!". <br /> <br /> I don't appreciate it as much as Perry and Croft's other shows, but its popularity is undeniable. This was probably one of the last British sitcome, which caused enormous public affection, mainly because it contained pleasant signs in a recognizable environment. Good night campers!
