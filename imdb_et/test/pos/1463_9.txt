After the heights of darkness, it was never conceivable that Holness and Adobye could create something as good as garth marengi. But I think a human being is just as good an exhibition (in good episodes) as in the dark. I can't claim that 2 episodes really aren't that good, but others 4 will definitely pay for it. if I had to choose 2 big episodes, go to the formula4 leader Steve Pising (pronounced Pissing) and big Garth Mareng. The somewhat understood program is a real plus because Dean Learner does a lot inside jokes, but even if you didn't see a lot of Dean ids to recommend it because some of the nails he starts with are genius. His argument with Def Lepord over their name. All in all, there is an excellent exhibition that just touches on the perfect signs because a few less funny episodes.
