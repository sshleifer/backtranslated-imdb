This movie is just cute. It's funny as hell and as old as the hills. The actor is great and it is exciting to see post-war Britain and how we behave these days. It seems to have been St. The predecessor of Trinians films (considering the connection between Alastair Sim and Margaret Rutherford - there is also a very young George Cole, who appeared in many of St. Trinians' films), but I do not understand the community. It was recently shown in BBC4 after St. The story of Trinian's creator Ronald Searle, but I was left out of life to give up this movie. Anyway, a great movie on its own and something that should be kept all the time!
