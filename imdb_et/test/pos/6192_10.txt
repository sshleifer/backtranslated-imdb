The problem with this series is that it is too real. I watch it on Amazon "Unbox" and I just finished episode 2, I hate, absolutely hate, Fark, cell leader. I don't remember any television series that has such an emotional effect. Remember the tag of old tag files "Keep yourself from your movie"? Well I find myself remembering repeatedly that his "only TV". But of course it's not just a TV? The possibility that such a cell, as depicted herein, works in the United States is certainly within the credibility range. This gives this program the authenticity of this witch. And that's why I hate it so much.
