The RKS after GHAYAL's success started working on this film, which was comedy The film was about 3 years old and was finally released in 1994, but didn't work for some reason. DAMINI (93) released the movie and made it well <br /> <br /> The movie is crazy comic movie like most Priyadarshan movies, but it's funny and well handled The film has the right plot, unlike today's movies, and it laughs at most characters, be it Crime master gogo (Shakti Kapoor), Paresh Rawal, and others <br /> <br /> Film laughs all this running time, though it is too shocking and redundant, but it's one of the most fun movies <br /> <br /> Direction of RKS is very good Music is good <br /> <br /> Actress steals actress Aamir and his most entertaining performance, it was his first challenge. Salman does well but looks to Amir for amateurs, but does a good job and chemistry Charisma is annoying and sounds like a child Raveena is enough Paresh Rawal is too funny in both groups, Shakti Kapoor is having fun in her upper work Shehzad Khan (dubbed Ajit) is very good and also Viju Khote is a funny holiday.
