Don't let the movie go wild with different reviews to prevent you. You love it or hate it according to your taste. However, if for some other reason "Greystoke" does not see the heart thrill with the excitement of a great actor when he breathes his role in his life. Ralph Richardson was not a great actor when he was doing well with Shakespeare; rather, he must be remembered for the sensitive treatment of each character he portrays. He was never indifferent to his responsibility as an actor. His reading of the Sixth Lord of Greystoke, his last performance, is all that loves theater.
