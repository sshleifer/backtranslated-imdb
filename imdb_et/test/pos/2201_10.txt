I have a copy of this movie and I have always loved it. Here, however, I comment on seeing the PBS presentation of Sweeney Todd concert this week. This production was performed by the San Francisco Opera and celebrated by George Hearn and Patti LuPone. In the early 80's, Hearn replaced Len Cariou as Sweeney (Cariou won Tony for his performance). I saw Hearn and Angela Lansbury (who also won Tony's performance when Mrs Lovett) made Sweeney on a large scale. They have to have seen the film in the show. To date, the most moving moment I ever remember in theater is when Hearn sang "These are my friends." ("These are my friends, see how they shine." "My hand is ready again!") <br /> <br /> Hearn's result in San Francisco's opera production convinced me he hasn't lost anything for nearly twenty years I saw her for the first time in Broadway and later in the movie. What a talent! She is sympathetic, funny and scary - all at once; and he can sing, boy can sing. All this reminded me that the film is terrible. Highly recommended. Ten out of ten.
