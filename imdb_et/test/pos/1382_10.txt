I was given the opportunity to see it today in a friend's house and the impression it had on such a small budget. Not that it still bothered me because I love low budget sci-fi like Dr Who, Blake 7 and Dark Star. Hell, even Outland was not a big budget issue, so if money helps, more money is spent than throwing money. <br /> <br /> The story is easy at first, with the mercenary group being paid out of space to send the prisoner. Their ship is being attacked and they are forced to land on the nearest planet. They then discover that the detainee has done this, he is a stone cold, which is just the beginning of these problems. <br /> <br /> Impacts, with the exception of arms struggles, are minimalist and overwhelm the film. Computer effects sometimes look somewhat vague, but serve their purpose well and add a story by giving the process a futuristic feeling. Movies such as I, Robot could have benefited from this approach, rather than being largely stylish and replacing the special effects of the plot, like all too many Hollywood offers. , it is tightly written and shot, and the hour and ten minutes do not exceed its greeting. The characters don't get out much, but then they didn't do it in Predator as well. Mike Mitchell, a great man, is in a good position for Arnie and is a good combination of brains and muscles. <br /> <br /> Some people may be angry if there is no explanation but I like it. Unlike many movies and examples that leave things inexplicable, it's not so hidden that you can't handle it at all, and I would like to see a sequel where the nature of aliens is investigated. br /> <br /> A creepy little movie about an entrepreneurial team that has been made cheap but fun to go for an hour. If that's what they can do on the shoe, I'd like to see what they're doing for a little more money and I hope the film industry and talentless armchair critics won't first let go of all creativity. <Br /> <br /> Recommended.
