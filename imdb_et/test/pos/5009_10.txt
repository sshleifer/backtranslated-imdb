I say I remember where and when you saw this example, because I believe that if Fox gives a talk show, Spike will be able to step up with Conan in a few years time, as, like Conan, he is incredibly funny and seems just be grateful for your show More fun bits Spike has so far been for Idiot's Paparatz and Comedy Stoners and if you are not high and get the CFS it says about you. <br /> <br /> In summary, this exhibition is more fun in 25 minutes than an hour, so the hope that the Talk Show will get the attention it deserves, like an extra half hour, more money and a band.
