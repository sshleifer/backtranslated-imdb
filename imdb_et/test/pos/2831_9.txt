"Only Valiant" qualifies as a delicious western. This Gregory Peck Cavalry and Indians oater is a solemn suicide mission with no sense of humor. The veteran leader Gordon Douglas has a dirty, harrowing outdoor epic that has considerable pressure on heavy boys; even Lon Chaney, Jr., perfectly records a powerful Arab soldier. Apparently, "Colorado Territory" screenwriter Edmund H. North & "Place in the Sun" Harry Brown filmed his film "Tense novel by Western filmmaker Charles Marquis Warren" about heavy cavalry who interrupted all escape routes that have to prevent murderous red skins destruction against devastating white settlers. North and Brown are mostly in the last minute of the Warren novel - when our heroes seem to be unable to survive, it is also a native! This century-old story develops an effective claustrophobic sense in the second half of the action. Douglas and the company take sets binding to the studio and make them round the clock. The crisp black-and-white photography of the Going My Way operator, Lionel Linden, imitates the marvelous look of the West, which emphasizes its tension and atmosphere. Actor Michael Ansara, who later played the main cable in "The Great Seven Weapons", is extremely effective in the small role as the hated Indian leader Tucs. <br /> <br /> "Valiant Only" opens up a voice narration by Army Scout Joe Harmony. "This is my stamping land. I am an army cries. If my work were cut off for a long time for me. Behind this passage is the whole" Pache nation. (There is a graph on the territory with Flinthead. Mountains that run across the screen with a poor passage.) They came out of the lap, killing all the sights. Then we built Fort Fort Invincible, which combined the move, like a cap in a bottle. was a little for a while, but "Paches is pretty smart. One day the bottle blew the plum." We are shown that the burning residues of Fort Invincible are dead with a man attached to the wall of the tables and a stuck in the belly. Captain Richard Lance (Gregory Peck, "12 O'Clock High") and his men boiled the horse and caught Tucsos (Michael Ansara) and Joe Harmony (Jeff Corey's "True Grit") wants to shoot him on the spot. Harmony points out that Tucs has "started all this business." Captain Lance intervenes, "The army won't take, Joe." Predictably, Harmony is amazing in this perspective. "He's not a common injection. He's as close to God as he can. If you shoot him now, things will calm down. Without the mixing of Tucs, the rest of the Indians will make sense, as fast as you take him in life, all in Pache territory that comes after him. We have three years to stop it. "Just as predictably, Captain Lance Tucsus refuses and Lance's decision to take things back in India works. <br /> <br /> Colonel Drum (Union Station ") surprises Lance when she tells her she should have fired Tucs. As it is, they have to get a second job at Tucs. Everything between soldiers and Joe Harmony knows that taking Tucose to Fort Grant is about to die. Meanwhile, we introduce Captain Eversham, daughter of Cathy Eversham (Barbara Payton, "Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye") and young Lieutenant William Holloway (Gig Young "They are shooting horses, don't they?") and they are part of a big narrative complication You see, both Lance and Holloway want to get married to Cathy, it is clear that Cathy wants Lance, Colonel Drum refuses to take Lance to Tucs Fort Grant because Drum can't release Lance. v at some point on the mission and everything is shocked. Lance has never changed the order. In addition, Lance saw Cathy and Holloway kissing publicly, and everyone thought Lance had been out of Holloway's envy. Indeed, one officer notes that the rewriting of orders is possible as a rewriting of the Bible. It is expected that Tucs will flee and the surviving soldiers and harmony will bring back dead Holloway. <br /> <br /> Although Drum expects to receive 400 soldiers every day, Harmony Lance says Tucs is attacking. Tucs has seen the fort and knows their lack of strength. Lance requires 6 or 7 men who have chosen to be a man of Fort Invincible and prevent Tucsian war party. The bottlenecks in the western forests are held by the Indians by force; Instead, they have to come once. Lance believes that her men can reduce them until the relief comes. Drum gives him permission and Lance chooses the worst men. All of them hate him and want to kill him deliberately. <br /> <br /> "Only Valiant" is a new breed of post-war Western world. This is not the West of John Ford's cavalry. Indeed, Lance's own men want to kill him, and this requires troops' attitude during the Vietnam War, when they split up their officers. Lance bears all the things except the few who know about the circumstances that led to a change of responsibility for Holloway's details. Black and white photography enhances its western land. "Valiant only" forms the last degree of the West to the last minute. It's known that Peck hated this movie, but it's not a Technicolor notebook. If anything, "Only Valiant" lives in its Warner Brothers origin. It's small, but important, and it's filthy with dramas and unpleasant signs, almost "Dirty Dozen" western.
