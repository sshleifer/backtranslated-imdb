It is a deep and touching work on the creation of art, one that is unique to humanity and cannot be produced by nature, the cost of genius, and the search for transcendence, and ultimately the family, that is, everything. I was very moved from the family discussion Nathaniel had with her sisters about her father's shortcomings because it was placed in a beautiful home that seemed to radiate the heat created by Lou. And while Esther seems so cold in his discussion that Lou can't make money, you can understand how he has to be the counterweight of his impulses at many points in his life. Nathaniel did a great job of showing how all Lou's people fit and ended and got so much of their work as their genius. Yes, or even especially our failures make us who we are. And of course there are buildings. I was only known by Lou Kahn's name and did not combine his name with his work, they are evidence of mercy. Perhaps one day, we will have a building where we all fit, and it will definitely resemble a Lou Kahn building, or a non-built temple in Jerusalem. Maybe it's salvation
