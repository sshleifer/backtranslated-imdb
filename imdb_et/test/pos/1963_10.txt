I saw this movie a second time. I saw it for the first time in the mid-1990s as a Vanguard Video selection. It has retained its power. <br /> <br /> There are many aspects of interest. One of them is a real story. Two are two interesting participants: Keanu Reeves and Crispin Glover. And for three, Dennis Hopper is one of his better social malformations / psychotic character roles. <br /> <br /> Film is also a study of how people operate under different conditions. You have symbols in one, family, group of peers, school, general settings of society, etc. The story is a good indication of how a person works for each setting. <br /> <br /> I want to find the details of the actual murder to compare with the film. I saw a short sign that it was in California and that several schoolmates were taken to see the body. <br /> <br /> It's a good choice for renting a rainy night video. Get ready to feel at the end.
