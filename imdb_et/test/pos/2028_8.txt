WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> Rock Star is one of the specific rock movies I've ever seen. The original idea of ​​the script focuses on the young singer of the 80s, leading one of the most famous rock band ensembles of that time. He has not only played his music but also lives his idol life. When his friends cast him out in the zone of honor, some originality is looking for a fate to make a good move for him and recruits an idol band singer. The dream was born? Well, almost. Starting with the famous rock scene, including the 80's rock scene of drug and sex life, she has to confront her supporting girlfriend's problems and eventually she has to answer the questions of creativity and say in the band's music. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie, one of the reasons being that it is the first time a hard metal rock game life and music has been shown in a realistic way. The fans of the music genre will satisfy the soundtrack. The general idea is original and the questions about how the artist lives his life and creates his art are reasonable and balanced. Mark Wahlberg is better than most of the other floppies I have seen lately, and Jennifer Aniston fits into a nice-girl-who-know-life-role. The problem is the end, which is quite common and may be disappointing. The main character looks how big and famous the band has found their creative path. But in the irony, the music he plays in the club is the worst in the movie! <br /> <br /> 8/10 on my personal scale. It is worth noting - assume that exposure to high-dose metal. If you don't like such music, you can avoid this movie.
