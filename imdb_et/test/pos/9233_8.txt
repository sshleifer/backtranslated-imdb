I'm not sure if the TV series is just where the comments should be pulled, but it's on television where The Lone Ranger really gave me the name. I don't even refer to the original radio broadcasts of this masked rider on the plains, though Iam pointing to a small boy , about 9 or 10 years old, I saw a movie, "Lone Ranger" and never forget it. I remember I was on the line or we were going to Paramount Theater - the theater was in the theater area when I remember correctly. It was just over, going west to the west, with a ball falling on New Year's Eve - Of course, if nobody knows, New York City.High Ãœle Street had the time and maybe even today big ads advertise what It was at that moment when I looked up and was never more impressed when I was watching this billboard e Lone Ranger over the roofing - It was great - It made an impression and was never forgotten. This day we went to see Lone Ranger This was the story of how Lone Ranger was born. Rangers drove to one of its fallen heroes and the ensuing rebirth. It was this movie that we learn that Lone Ranger will not kill, but hurt that the law would be a judge. This way of thinking is so worthwhile that we may be good at learning something history This is where we find out that Tonto discovers the fallen Ranger and seeing the symbol of a boyfriend-friendship that Lone Ranger created years ago when his younger person came to aide a damaged person in Tonto gave Tonto his loyal a friend, his thanks to the symbol that was now part of Tonto's recognized necklace. Toronto said, "You are Kemosabe." Lone Ranger said, "Kemo-tea, it's familiar? Then Tonto says the story of" t rusty spy "(meaning Kemosabe) I think Lone Ranger is one of the real heroes of the silver screen and one of the biggest heroes of television. Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels, who were very honored, tried to live there according to the legend of Lone Ranger. Maybe there could be an inspiring story about Lone Ranger and his faithful companion Tonto.I myself was very pleased with the ability to find and buy DVDs, that I stayed all Saturday morning and watched many episodes now available.Long Live The Lone Ranger and his faithful companion Tonto-Hi-Ho Silver
