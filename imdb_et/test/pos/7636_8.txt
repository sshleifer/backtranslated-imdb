It is true that this is not a realistic story, but romantic comedy is not a genre I look at as realism. What matters is that the characters are pleasant and sexy, if necessary. Shalom is beautiful and relaxed and Jake Weber is beautiful and kind. They have enough chemistry to believe in the region of sexual attraction. I'd like to see either of them in another movie. And yes, the clown is also pretty cute.
