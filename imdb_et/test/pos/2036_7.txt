ROCK STAR / (2001) *** (out of four) <br /> <br /> Blake in French: <br /> <br /> "Rock Star" is a story that nobody gets famous, just for that to understand living, his dream is not as he imagined. We've seen all of this before (in better movies), but this human story is brutally pulling out the rock and the role of the world in a brilliantly honest and understandable way. This gives a recommendation for the visualization of the atmosphere. "Crazy / Beautiful" director John Stockwell script depicting the hard core universe with memorable images - it doesn't explain what it is, it shows us. <br /> <br /> "Rock Star" originally titled "Metal God" stands for Mark Wahlberg Chris "Izzy" Cole, a Pittsburgh office supplies vendor who dreams of becoming Bobby Beers, the fiery lead singer Steel Metal. Although Chris is already singing his tribute to a rock band called Blood Pollution, he requires that instead of writing his own songs, he only performs the Steel Dragon and just as they perform. His group irritates Chris's obsession and gives him a start. <br /> <br /> It will destroy Chris, as well as his supportive parents and loyal girlfriend, Emily (TV from Jennifer Aniston). He then receives a phone call. This is the Steel Dragon band. They've seen Chris tapes and want him to replace the recently released singer. At the moment, Chris is suddenly launching the stardom-world into the world's biggest rock fan up to the biggest rock star. Unfortunately, it's not as satisfactory as he expected. <br /> <br /> The true story inspired the Rock Star concept. Indeed, the Ohio equipment vendor, Tim "Ripper" Owens, began to replace Rob Halford, the lead singer of the Jewish priest, after he first sang for the honor zone. The rest of the film is probably a fiction, although most of what happens must represent the experience of many other bands. The film describes various rock stars. Exploring the dangers of tourism, personality differences, drug abuse and violence, opportunities for communication, sexual freedom, dishonesty, and extreme actions by producers to be enjoyable and popular with fans. <br /> <br /> I have seen all Mark Wahlberg's films and this is the first one who has gained my affection. Former singer / model Wahlberg has made films like "Fear", "Boogie Nights" "Three Kings", and recently Tim Burton had no remake of "Apeside Planet". I start to admire the younger actress more and more. Although he has not performed in many successful films, he has taken many opportunities and made various roles. "Rock Star" is his best movie so far. I cannot think of many actors who could have convincingly portrayed Chris Cole's struggles and aspirations. Wahlberg really does "Rock Star" stone. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Aniston also lights up the screen. He creates Chris with a chemical-like relationship that provokes audience participation. It's tragic what happens to their relationship. We care a lot about these characters. <br /> <br /> During the movie concert scenes, director Stephen Herek (who also led the "Holy Man" and "101 Dalmatian" live version) creates an atmosphere. It captures scenes with intense urgency and raw, unmistakable energy. Musical numbers offer the best, most engaging scenes for the film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Herek cannot maintain energy and affection. With three quarters of a character, he loses sparkle because the film becomes boring and unpleasant. I understand where the story has to go in order to portray the negative side of fame, but this film loses everything it used to be for it. "Almost famous", in the much better movie rock and role, is a certain interest and life even in the most sad scenes. Here it seems that filmmakers are losing their passion. <br /> <br /> The message comes a little too late and the story is sudden. The film becomes a moral story that wants to give us a nice place. The filmmakers can all stop, appear on the screen and say, "Now the audience, the story of morality is ??" We understand the topic, but it's too fast. The personal discovery of Chris must be gradual. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, it's all about the last 25 minutes of the movie, barely enough to destroy a whole eighty-five minute reasonably good feature. "Rock Star" is not a great movie - check out "Almost Famous" if you want a remarkable movie of rock and roll-but, but Marky Mark, it's a turning point in your career. <br /> <br />
