What I think is remarkable about this terrible movie is that Altman, the crazy and wild guy he is, took the novel WHAT WAS THE PARK and Sandy Dennis's character was originally a man in the book. He was a mentally abandoned isolated gay man who looked out of his apartment window when he noticed a hustler. It is strange that Altman fans are unaware of how wise he was to exchange the main character sex; thereby avoiding gay erotic taboos gay life in the 60s and actually making Dennis reclusive type of madness work even better when taking over. If you see the movie again, it is obvious how weird Altman mind works ...
