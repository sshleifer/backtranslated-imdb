The fact that there is so much noise is ironic, because the whole program was designed to emphasize how the media treats "taboo" topics such as pedophilia. newsletter set, suits, crafty presenters, scenes that shouted for things you see behind them, meaningless cgi graphs and statistics, the whole thing was satire, a very funny satire. how c-list celebrity wants to say absolutely nothing when their representative tells them it's good for their career ("there is no evidence of this, but that's a scientific fact"). It may be difficult to look at (milly dowler and cambridgeshire girls, as well as 9/11), but satire is expected to be challenging and we should not be afraid to stand out against striking intimidation and the media described. just because it's a delicate thing. How this show could not win any TV awards for provoking this intelligence, observation, courage, behavior and thinking is disgraceful, but if you look that it shows you, not a little surprising.
