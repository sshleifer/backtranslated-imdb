I'm Maharashtrian, a teenager who lives in the 21st century, and obviously I'm not much of Bollywood, not to mention Marathi's movies. However, when I looked at Shwaas, I was left with a unique feeling that only a highly effective film can produce. <br /> <br /> It is true that, like most Indian films, the film has a true and complete effect only when viewed in its original language. Many of the emotions and meanings of the film are embedded in Marath's dialogues, which cannot be tried hard in English. <br /> <br /> Shwaas examines the relationship between grandparent and child in a tricky detail. And it makes this strong bond complete justice. Dialogues like "mazha parsha pan laakhat ek aahe" (My parsha is also one million) improve emotions. Anyone who has been closely following the relationship between grandparents and the child is able to communicate with the situation depicted in the film. <br /> <br /> It is generally worth checking out. This is a film that has left me deeply affected. I strongly recommend it to everyone!
