For many years, I thought I was the only person on the planet who had seen TEMPEST and I was so glad to know that I wasn't the only person who discovered this sleeping place somewhere in my movie transmission. Quietly following the Shakespeare game, TEMPEST follows the architect (John Cassavettes, one of his best performances), getting bored with his work and frustrated marriage (in real life with his wife Gene Rowlads) who decides to let it go. Hell in a rat race and live on the island with her daughter (Molly Ringwald, her film debut) and a new girlfriend Aretha (luminous Susan Sarandon). Even if Paul Mazursky is considered a director, Cassavettes is in the hands of this film ... long scenes that have been filmed without cutting, an improvisational sense of dialogue ..., a self-assertive storytelling style, this is definitely his exhibition from the beginning to the end, and if you don't not a fan of your work, the film looks a lot long and boring, but if you're a fan, there are benefits. Cassavette is surrounded by first-class performance ... his scenes with Rowlands are intense and his surprising chemistry with Sarandon is a sharp contradiction to his scenes with Rowlands. Ringwald shines his film debut and there is a scene-steal performance late on Raul Julia like Kalibanos, Cassavettes' servant island. Julia stops the show in one scene, dancing with sheep, accompanied by Liza Minnell's "New York, New York". This film is sad and tragic and funny and intense. Yes, it is a bit long and scattered and it works a little differently to be different (at the end of the movie there is even a curtain call), but it never leaves attention to those who like something a little difference in filming.
