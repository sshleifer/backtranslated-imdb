I rented this movie without knowing what to expect, but WHOA was my treat! <br /> <br /> For anyone who, like me, was waiting for a good movie that combined horror and sci fi, it's time to rejoice, because waiting is finally over. Writing, Showing, Filming, and Leadership - All the Upper Limits. I hate to admit it, but I actually called from one point (when Dracula spoke to the offender). Really emotional roller-digger from start to finish. The ship's corridors provided the perfect spooky device for this story and the actors could really get their fear in their lives. And Coolio as a vampire .... very nice! <br /> <br /> And believe me .... the big part of the movie was ... the end is over! I know this film will get a lot of flack on this site for some reason, but I know nobody else saw the ending coming. Brilliant!
