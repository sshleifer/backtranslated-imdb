After a couple of years of searching for Humphrey Bogart's "Two Worlds", it unexpectedly appeared as a TCM offer under "One Fatal Hour", the first national film from 1936. Bogey's character is Sherry Scott, the man who runs WUBC, a radio station whose program lineup loses listeners. Owner Bertram Reynolds (Robert Middlemass) is a pathetic leader who calls the shot at the station, but hides behind his decisions when they drop off from Scott. Reynolds has the idea of ​​reviving a twenty-year-old murder case and offering it for fifteen chapters for a radio show. Scott increases Dr. Martin Leavenworth's (Harry Hayden) help to write the game and submit it to the air. which is not clear. But Gloria Pembroke is married and now lives as Martha Carstairs (Helen MacKellar), married to a successful banker (Henry O'Neill) and their daughter Edith (Linda Perry) is married (not the same day) when the radio plays Gloria Pembroke's identity exposure). Faced with the devastating effects of this revelation, Martha and Jim Carstairs will start a crusade to stop the program. At the same time, Edith's future laws will react by not requiring marriage. <br /> <br /> Without exposing the final result, the movie takes a devastating blow to the viewer. Edith Carstairs faces radio station principals, inspiring Scott and shining Reynolds. However, when he accepts his share of the blame for the outcome, Scott partially removes his work by giving up his secretary and grabbing him from the office, repeatedly recognizing him for his conscience. With a steep finish, the film leaves one inconvenience and unresolved, like any movie that doesn't have a happy ending. <br /> <br /> Humphrey Bogart gets about a dozen films under his belt to get here with intriguing results. Without supporters of the name, Bogey races up and down the radio stations as if it were his own. Characterizing a little bit of his character, he expresses his surprise, surpassing his hands in front of his bowed head, a year and a half before the effect we see in "Casablanca". For Bogart fans, it's a real treat with an unexpected nuance.
