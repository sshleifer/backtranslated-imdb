Ponyo At The Cliff is a spectacular vision with beautiful watercolors, vaguely remembering a trailer that I did not find impressive, I was surprised at how beautiful and detailed it was. This film was washed over me for purity. <br /> <br /> In the middle, there is a young boy who comes into contact with a sea creature and his relationship with a movie. Miyazaki is a champion in creating memorable shapes as well as for young people who interact incredibly with their little axes. <br /> <br /> There are some parts that didn't sit well with me. It would be an understatement to say that music in a certain scene "resembles" the riding of the Whiters, it is a disgrace because it is an expensive film that cannot afford the freedoms, and it otherwise undermines a truly wonderful scene. Antagonist and his backdrop have never been interested in me, but I think that it served more background than anything else. <br /> <br /> Anyway, great movie. It seems to me that the boat trip scenario with all its images and sea animals. Clean and magical. And yes, a handrawn work of art is intimate then computer animated, I'm really pumped into Princes and Frog now.
