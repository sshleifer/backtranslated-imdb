We bought a DVD "Walking with dinosaurs" and have been almost ecstatic about what's very well done. <br /> <br /> Many DVDs today offer minimal ... this feature itself and possibly another language (which doesn't help the viewer at all, but makes it easier for companies to see DVDs in multiple markets). <br /> <br /> Not so for WWD. There are so many great add-ons and well-thought-out vignettes that even watching the * navigation menu * is interesting. The intros of each chapter of the DVD "The Making Of" DVD are ridiculous funny. Sound and video quality is terrible. And, of course, the story and the content ... what else could a dinosaur friend ask? <br /> <br /> I watched most of the TDC versions (as Avery Brooks said) and then looked about half of the DVD (Kenneth Branaugh told me). As far as I can say, the broadcast version slipped in most of the American slang narration (ie, T. Rex's mating, Branugh says, "The woman is tiring of men" and Brooks says, "The honeymoon is over) and cut off some of the closest dolls. version just because it is more complete. <br /> <br /> Generally, great value and excellent production are many for the BBC and its gem team.
