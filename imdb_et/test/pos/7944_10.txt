In 1242, two sides of Russia invaded: the Mongolian orientation and the European side, the German knights of the Germans of the Holy Roman Empire. The city of Novgorod is the last free city in Russia. In order to organize the protection of the Novgorod and Russian lands, Prince Alexander Nevsky, who had been imprisoned by Sweden during the previous battle, is calling for it. His successful strategy loses the Germans, after a great battle frozen on the lake. This film was made in 1938 because Germany-Russia was in danger during World War II. The idea was to make propaganda to Russia. However, it is a huge, wonderful, stunning powerful masterpiece. It is an amazing fight against frozen lake. The current generation is very accustomed to special effects, such as "Lord of the Rings" in the trilogy, and perhaps do not understand how fantastic this black-and-white fight is. If the viewer can forget the ideology and watch it as an art, he is finally surprised by such a masterpiece. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Alexander Nevsky
