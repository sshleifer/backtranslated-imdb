Don't look at this movie while waiting for Jane Austen's meaninglessness, crisp dialogue or smart social commentary. This time, the space in the Northanger Monastery has been very sensually renewed! <br /> <br /> In this version, Catherine's erotic dreams are not just foolish fantasies, but a connection to the adult sexuality world that she simply associates with her daily adventure. On the day she is very prime and terrible, and her dwarf Henry treats her extremely politely. But if his own sexual nature awakens, his dreams will shift gently from gentle to gentle to steam! At the beginning of the story, Catherine's vision of sex is based entirely on the Gothic novels she strikes in bed. It is both heart-warming, sexy and provocative to see how his dreamy image of beautiful Henry "dissolves" into a blissful dream of destroying and destroying romantic bad guys! At the same time, the morning is nervous and touching to cut him back to bed - Catherine sleeps calmly, so an innocent person does not think what's going on in this pretty little head! Later, after calling Henry Castle, Catherine sees a family argument and understands its meaning completely. Jumping into bed covers herself with a bed cover and lies fiercely, her striking eyes being the only visible sign that she is attentive. Gradually, these pretty blue eyes and brackets slipped when he got into a warmed-up dream of another innocent desire. This time Catherine dreams of being in Elizabethan, waiting for the "bandit!" It is quite clear that he is more excited when he is afraid that bandits will suffer. He is all excited with excitement and expectations! But after he was fired, we are back in the daylight, where the maid strikes him so that he can get into his room before coming to his sleep. It is worth noting that the awakening of Catherine's heavy eye in the morning light is a peculiar sensual symbol of how passionate her dreams are! Ultimately, Catherine's stern and unimaginable lover Henry shares the nature of her fantasies and gives her an honest lecture. Interestingly, the direct collapse of Catherine as a tear symbolizes not the return but the advancement of adult relationships. In the next scene he burned his Gothic romance and threw himself into shame and sniffed into bed. Importantly, this turning point is also marked by Catherine's deep sleep - except that this time there are no dreams to believe in passion. Catherine is probably mature enough to be ready. <br /> <br /> Although Katherine Schlesinger has beautiful blue eyes and lively expression and all her performances are charming, it has to be said that outside of the warming up sequences this film adaptation is exceptionally boring. I give her only 9 stars because it can only be truly romantic at the level of dreams. <br /> <br /> If you want to read a book about a truly strong young hero who overcomes true darkness and danger in a real Gothic environment, I recommend Elizabeth Marie Pope's PERILOUS GARD.
