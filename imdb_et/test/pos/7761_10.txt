Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu is a highly appreciated anime in almost every web page review. So I really wanted to know why, and I was disappointed. strange world. Very well drawn, perfectly animated world, that is. this is not. I can't really say what it is, really. although I have not finished seeing Haruhi Suzumiya, it is actually very high in my personal set. I fell in love with this eye at first glance, and I assure you that at least you are indifferent to this irresistible charm. Trust me, I'm not going around, giving 10 to every thing I look at.
