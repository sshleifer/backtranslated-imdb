It is not bad, but it may be a better load, it also seems to follow the main diet of the drama of crimes. You have Sandra Bullock as a cop who has a hard time working with you, you have a new partner. There's a closed case, but a policeman who still works, and there are so many corney lines you want to shout in the movie. <br /> <br /> However, if you look behind the neck elements, there is a good movie hidden. It is thrilling and the basic plans worked for me. It is worth renting, but maybe not buying.
