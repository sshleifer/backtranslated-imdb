This film was set, filmed, and premiered in Oxford, Miss., The home of W. Faulkner's 1948 book. Most of the attachments were local. I've been to Oxford and it has changed a lot. This movie contains Sheriff Will Geer, later on in blacklist. Later years, HUAC's targets were social drama writers and actors such as this film and grapes. I don't remember if the young actress played by Mallison (Claude Jarman Jr) did something after the television series Centennial (1978), but he was terrible in this early film. And don't miss Elizabeth Patterson, who later played at Little Women.
