The exhibition begins with a boat. Desmond was me. Then they went to save Walt. And to lock things that the button presses is a big joke, while Desmond discovered he was the one who dropped the plane. Eco tries to open the door Jhon locked him, and Charlie helped him find the bomb. Sayid's and Jack's plan is that Sasyid must find others first and see who and what others. And find out if there are armed and weapons. <br /> <br /> Micheal takes the trap of Jack, Swayer, Kate and Hugo. And they're stuck. <br /> <br /> After the show, more questions answered, but what makes the show big. And can't wait until the 3rd season
