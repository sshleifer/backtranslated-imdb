Ok, let this road first: Lifeforce is a garbage in Life Cinema. As a bit of cheesy entertainment SF buffs, it's a lot of merit. If you like watching these old black and white SF B movies - gigantic mutated spiders / fears or strangers who are wandering in the desert - you can really get out of Lifeforce. <br /> <br /> Bad things: The story has little meaning and the actor is pretty poor. Good things: special effects are half-decent; it has a distinctly different British central story (set to London), which gives the majority of SF movies different feelings; and he has a well-blessed Mathilda May (amusing "Space Girl") who strikes a tough nude. <br /> <br /> In short, it's fun. <br /> <br /> I've seen it one and a half times, and every time it arrives on TV, I'll take some time to watch it - it is partly related to naked Mr May, but it is also a bit of a discomfort and foolish SF.
