Now, Momma's throwing train was not a great comedy, but it's a fun load and makes you laugh. The title may seem a bit strange, but the whole movie is not literally about it, although it is something that is just as bad. <br /> <br /> Danny De Vito wants to kill her praising mother and go on some casual and funny events. The assumption is pretty funny and the things Billy Crystal and Danny De Vito got into were great. Some scenes didn't seem to me to fit, but it didn't make it a bad movie. <br /> <br /> What it is, crazy comet, it pulls it out well and should be seen once just to say you saw it.
