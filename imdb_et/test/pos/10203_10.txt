Here's another one from the west of the 1940s I look at when it is from TCM or FMC, because although it may be historically faulty, it's very fun and well-acted, plus it's Randolph Scott, my favorite actor, the second only for Gary Cooper-Well, OK, behind COOP, Charlton Heston and Gregory Peck. But the film itself, for me anyway, is reasonably historically accurate and, as I said earlier, worked well and "flows" very well - I bet I have seen it 50 or 60 times and enjoy every viewing more than before. I have it on tape from TCM, but I would buy it in minutes if it ever appeared on a DVD. Look at it if you don't - I guarantee you like it!
