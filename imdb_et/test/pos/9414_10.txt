I use "Princess Raccoon" (to give the movie a rather exact English title) as a humorous litmus test by friends. It leaves them frustrated and frustrated - as it explicitly made many other comments on this site - or the result is doubling laughter, surprisingly large rails and occasional admiration. <br /> <br /> Laughter is the perfect blend of contemporary movie parodies. Targets include Japanese and Western classical drama forms, from Kabuk to later Shakespeare and Spanish Renaissance-Christian fantasy; a naive gap between contemporary American and European music, witnessed by a number of random tapas and rape songs and some very funny banal lyrics, all choreographed with a loving "amateur club"; Japanese anime and samurai live-action clich√©s; Buddhist ritual; and the surplus sweetness of the Vienna operetta. I didn't laugh so much on this type of movie because Ken Russell's outrageous musical deconstruction "Boyfriend". <br /> <br /> Smiles come from the Japanese legend's wise textic decline. a traditional 5-action structure, reminiscent of the 17th century champion Chikamatsu. As in his work, narration has progressed in a mix of song, recurring, high-level poetry and low comedy - here's the peasant's incompetent ninja, ostrich potty, under the illusion that he is the human shadow of the tanuki raccoon. It's all about hanging out and even more remarkably, the viewer's emotions can be captured through the companions of cultural events. <br /> <br /> Really "Princess Raccoon" carries her pan-European culture with charming lightness, and this is where amazement comes in. Visually - like Russell's masterpiece - the film is a colorful anxiety, the digitized backgrounds of which are classic Japanese images from screens and prints, over costumes and stage sets, mixed with some breathtaking real-time action on summer and seashore. You love it or shine it, but there is no point in the cheese being critical; and "Princess Raccoon" is first and foremost a funny joke, as well as the affection of our contemporary cultural spirit, both east and west. Bravo!
