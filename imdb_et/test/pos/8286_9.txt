"The Chipmunk Adventure" is one of the biggest animated films of the 1980s. Alvin and Chipmunks have always been interested in me because they really were a rock-roll for me. Neither of them has bad features. Alvin is really a star and has a cool look. Theodore is lovable sensitive. Then Simon (my personal favorite), a smart, who is often a party pooper. I also like a lot of Chipette. There is Brittany, who, like Alvin, is always the one who is trying to be so popular. Then Eleanor, like Theodore, is sweet, sensitive and loves food. Janette is the only Chipette who is not very similar to her colleague; she is very naive and really clumsy. <br /> <br /> In Chipmunks' first full-length movie, David goes to Seville for a business trip to Europe and leaves with Miss Miller when he's gone. When playing the arcade game, Alvin loses against Bretagne and then says that if he has the money, he would be real in Bretagne all over the world. A man not known to the child, a man named Klaus Furschtien, and his sister Claudia, who have tried in a hidden way to offer diamond sales around the world in exchange for cash, listened to this conversation and said they would be allowed to race around $ 100,000 worldwide. Alvin and Brittany accept it and go to the competition. <br /> <br /> This adventurous movie has many great songs. "Off to see the world" made for a song that fits the movie. Then "My Favorite Songs" is one of "Lucky Lucky". "My Mom" ​​is the most likely song in the movie, but it always makes me cry. "Wooly Bully" is the only cover used in the film (the rest were completely original). Then, of course, there are "Rock and Roll Boys and Girls", which I think must be one of the greatest music numbers in film history. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie very often until my recorded tape died. However, I watch the movie. It's actually a fun movie for people who go for a first time in a foreign country. This will give you an idea of ​​what to expect from world travel. Definitely one of my childhood films and one that I would recommend for 80's fans and fans of Alvin & Chipmunks.
