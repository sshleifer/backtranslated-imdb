I remember not seeing the movie in the theater. I recently found a copy of VHS and it remained in my memory. Although obviously not a big budget movie, the actors are pretty reliable and the landscapes, places and costumes are very well done. I just want Mammoths to have been more in the picture, but if you see them, they are well done (remember that SFX was made without computers these days, some poor devils had to really do all that hair and fake) real elephants!) ... the same effect was used on elephants "Quest for Fire". Better than the average adventure movie and the chance to star, Rod Cameron plays something other than a cowboy, which he did well over the years.
