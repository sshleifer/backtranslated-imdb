After seeing the film, I have no choice but to write a review in the hope that there will be others, like me, who have blown away the rocket-supported ninja action and white hot sexual titration, the dominance of Ninja III. /> <br /> We all know that Sho Kosugi rocks. This is given, but how is Jordan Bennett's ultra macho interpretation of his character as a police officer "Billy Secord"? Bravo Mr. Bennett, bravo. You prove it early, trying to tempt Christie (which was perfectly played by one of Miss Lucinda Dickey of Breakin's fame) that you are not afraid of your handicraft possibilities. I was particularly pleased how you did not feel the need to step in and try to help him, because 4 traps are trying to rape him outside of his gym. You could definitely have helped, but standing there and seeing that he knew he was the boss. Secord wears pants in this regard. I also liked how Mr. Bennett is not afraid to take his shirt repeatedly, or to wear a female-beating tank, despite his gorillas like shoulders and back. Back and shoulders are hot and Secord knows it. And what about Lucinda Dickey? All I can say is "KABOOM" - I see the explosion of a sex bomb ready. He has all the right moves as both a bully and a martial arts quiz. Behind Dickey and Bennett is chemistry to mark this movie. You think he hates him because he's a kind of cheesy jerk, but not my friends. The magnetism of the animals is too strong to resist and they bind like crazy glue. Sho Kasug is not as prominent as you think, though the main character that is good for me, because everything I wanted was more Bennett and Dickey. It looks like he's been wearing a lot of eye pictures that were nice to see. Special Effects? Wow. That's all I can say. I'm not giving up, but let's say it doesn't disappoint. I love Ninja III: dominance and can only hope there is Ninja 4. I will give her 5 out of 5 stars. to dissapoint.
