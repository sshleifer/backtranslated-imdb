I liked this movie. If others want to give it an average of about 5.0 / 10, their choice is. I would give it a 10/10. The performance of Sutherland as a private eye is absolutely fantastic. The story is amazing, human, exciting, intelligent. The dialogue is good. The story may not be perfect, but still - the film's mood is good enough to compensate for it. Moreover, the end is incredibly cool and their jig-saw puzzle comes back together. So I liked it. I also thought that the female leader of the actor was very good. I am not a big fan of detective films, but it was also very good because it does nothing about supernatural conventions.
