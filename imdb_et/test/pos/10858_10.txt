I think Andrew Davies did an amazing job of having an excellent book emulating the pace and style of the Victorian novel and making it a moving and fun movie. I am glad that I read (twice) a book that is usually for me. I know that the novel and the film must be viewed as a different media and evaluated accordingly. However, it is often difficult to read the original material after the film gives the best parts. <br /> <br /> I know Davies is a very good adapter, but I want manufacturers to have chosen women to write a scenario. Davies, as he admits in the commentary accompanying the film on the DVD, was particularly keen to emphasize more scatological bits in the book. I certainly liked them on a movie like a book. But Davies missed half a dozen moments that have been so embarrassingly, painfully tender that he could have added if his sensitivity were feminine. <br /> <br /> I would also accept the first symbol of his book on the use of rose. <br /> <br /> Since the scenario was drawn with Davies, denouement was inevitable and appropriate. But I really think that author Waters' last dash for the symbol was much more interesting. And I preferred how the novel came to Nan, as Davies chose. <br /> <br /> One quick comment from four participants who introduce their primary roles. They are all superbly talented - perhaps with the exception of singing and dancing, and moreover, their physical presence is just as much as seeing the spirit in the reading of the novel before seeing the film. I thought they were all great. <br /> <br /> I recommend that all lesbians and everyone who loves good fiction add BOTH book and DVD to TIPPING VELVET on their bookshelves.
