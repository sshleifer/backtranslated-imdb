One of my favorite West and one of John Ford's best in my opinion. There are no major stars, but Ben Johnson mostly looks like everything he looks like, and here he rarely gets the title character. His arrival is Ward Bond, a Mormon parent who brings his people to the West. The stocks of John Ford's characteristic players, including Harry Carey, Jr., Jane Darwell, Russell Simpson, and Hank Worden, offer plenty of support, as well as the unsuccessful silent James Arness, a member of Clegg's clan that has joined the wagon train. The Mormon trail to Utah was one of the most challenging and demanding companies ever taken. We cannot really feel it, but we see the challenges that had to be overcome by the pioneers in the west; river rides, dry, waterless deserts, indian and similar meetings by pioneers' sons. The Mormons indeed dug the passage with the sections and shovels as depicted in the film. My main regret is that it was not painted, but I believe there is a color version. By the way, those horrible rocks that appear in different scenes are called Fisher towers, located near Moab. Highly recommended viewing.
