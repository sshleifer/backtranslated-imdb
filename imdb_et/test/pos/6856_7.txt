For me, "Anatomie" is definitely one of the best films I've seen. I don't think "Anatomie" was meant to be a horror film, but a film that questions the ethics of science. If you keep this in mind, it becomes a really good movie. The only annoying bit was the scary copy of the English version. How can you expect any non-German person to listen to these unbearable German accent for two hours? Let English speakers speak or use subtitles!
