"Joe" is one of those films where, although you think it can go smoothly, you will like it ... I can't come by analogy. This not only showed that America's long-standing idea of ​​unity was controversial, but also different aspects of our society. Melissa Compton (Susan Sarandon) is the ultimate flowered child, while her father Bill (Dennis Patrick) is a pure commentary. One day Bill accidentally killed Melissa's boy. Immediately afterwards, Bill Joe Curran (Peter Boyle), an ultra-right, rabidist racist workforce. As a result, they connect two and more hippies, whom Bill finds uncomfortable and Joe hates directly. But in the end, everyone has died of serious consequences. <br /> <br /> True, some parts of the movie are a bit dated, but it's good for two sides of America during the Vietnam War. Be sure that anything that is likely to disappear would remain.
