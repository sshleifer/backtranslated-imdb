You have recently seen the last episode 32 (although the site says there are only 30 episodes) and I have to comment on the fact that this series was really great and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys crimes / police. All 32 allegedly were based on facts at the end of convictions, which have sometimes been sharp, well-functioning, plausible and daring to say, fun series. The fact that the Danish authorities decided to dissolve the unit was almost unbelievable because they did their job so well and at least they could never "get their husband" in the series! That's sure for me 10/10.
