A ghost story in a typical Turkish high school with a nice sound and visual effect. Taylan biraderler (taylan brothers) made his first shots on television a few years ago, as far as I know. It was Turkey's X-Files, they had very nice stories, but they had no visual effects. This time it seems they had what they needed and used them well. This movie makes you laugh that it is sure, and it can also be frightening. It has a nice plot and some young, bright actors. If you are a secondary school student in Turkey, you will find so many things about you. There are many clues in the film about this story and the end, some of you realize at the moment, some understand the offspring, the dialogues were written very cleverly. So they make the film one of the best Turk films made in recent years. Don't forget, this movie is the first of its kind in the Turkish film industry.
