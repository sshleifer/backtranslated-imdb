The only way to truly understand and relate the characters of this movie is to experience situations that you yourself have. For many people, this film is almost cloudy, a kind of snapshot of one weekend in our lives. (I've done about 85 percent of the things in this movie and seen the other 15 percent, usually all the same weekend.) For me and others I know it's nice that this movie looks back because there are some pictures of the people we remember and At night, which is patches and blurry, this film is for our generations "Studio 54", a piece that adds to our scrapbooks to look back and smile. I personally am glad these days are in the past, but it's nice to watch this movie and say, "I remember when ........." Thank you to Justin for making this biography one weekend.
