(It's changed for space) <br /> <br /> Chan-wook Park's new movie is a complex movie that is not easy to classify. Namely, the horror film, centered on the vampire, actually has elements of comedy, theology, melodrama, cultural invasion (and an analogy to the intrusion of that body), romance and a few other things. It's a movie that has almost too much of a mind. The film takes its own things and mixes them with classical European literature, in this case Emile Zola "Thérèse Raquin". It is a strange mixture that is not always a gel but still has unbelievable power. It's almost 24 hours after I saw the movie at Lincoln Center (directed by the director after the film's discussion) and I find my cage ever running. It is not so much what is happening, it is cumbersome, all the more so because of its wide-ranging story and its themes reverberating many bells. to help humanity do a voluntary medical experiment to find treatment for a terrible disease. He infects with the disease he eventually dies and dies, but because of vampire blood transfusion (without explaining it) he actually survives. The king returns to the hospital, where he was employed by the sick, as a miracle worker. Unfortunately, not everything is fine. The priest finds that he needs blood to survive. She also finds that she has all the problems with the vampire and that she can't go out during the day. Things become even more complicated when she gets her childhood friend and her family again. The priest, some of his animal's passions, woke up with his friend's husband. From there, everything goes sideways. <br /> <br /> An ever-changing film, this is a story that spins through different genres because it speaks a very human story of a person who thinks his life has radically changed to a casual event and finds he is no longer the one who he thought he was. This is a movie that you have to end up with, because the film is evolving forever. There is also a film that has many ways of thinking and themes that are being played in many ways. <br /> <br /> The film has enough moves that could, and people probably write, film reviews. <br /> <br /> Two of the strongest parts of the movie are its vampire elements, and the romance story of this romance is great. There is something about how it sets out the basic rules and the nature of "misery" that makes it so perfect that it pulls out the old vampire ideas. Last night, sitting in the theater, I discovered how impressed it was. I think the fact that he played more or less straight is what is the trembling of the earth. Here is a vampire who just wants a normal life. This contradicts what happens later, it turns out that the existence of hunting does not really work. It's not in the dark world of Twilight or Lost Boys, rather than anything else. Personally, I think the movie will make the playground cool from the idea or dream of being more realistic and realistic. (The order in which power strikes is just cool) Romance is also perfectly handled. Of course, sex scenes are steamed and well done, but this is another thing, appearance, conversation, gestures outside of sex that makes it special. I love the look, the silent watches when the forbidden couple look at each other hungry and cannot act, the disappointment and the betrayal of the possible perfection of both the actual and the suspect and the mad passion. This is one of the biggest ever screens. It deeply captures the passion and emotion of passionate love (and lust). If you've ever loved me deeply, I think you'll find some of your hearing on the screen, I know I did. The statement "I wanted to spend with you forever" is sad. This is a statement of intent and depth of emotions. The tragic romance breaks your heart. <br /> <br /> I don't lie to you or say the movie is perfect and great. It is not as good as the pieces and almost all of them are big (especially the actors I have been unfairly unsuccessful) that the whole is not always the same. Different genres, thematic elements, and tones are from time to time against each other. I often thought where the film went. I hung there, though the film seemed to be deliberately misleading. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie a lot. I loved the pieces more than the film as a whole. It has tensioned my head because I saw it, and I think it will do it for several more days. Similar or love is irrelevant because it is a movie that really should be seen because it is so much that it gives you enough material to think and talk for a while later. One of the biggest and most perfect films of the year.
