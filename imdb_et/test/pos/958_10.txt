Big Fat Liar is the best movie ever! It's funny and cool. Jason Shepherd (Frankie Muniz) proves that he did not lie and goes to Los Angeles to get his paper from Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti). With your friend Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) to mess your life because Marty doesn't call Jason's father and says he wrote this paper! But all this is good and is good for watching the movie!
