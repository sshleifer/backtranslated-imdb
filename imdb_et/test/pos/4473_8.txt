The film's relationship between a man and a leopard, which resembles a very "English patient", even under a scene similar to the character of Ralph Fiennes carries the desert-rock of his lover's body. "The passion for the desert" carries the main character of the leopard body over the desert-rock, but in the opposite direction (calculated decision or unconscious contrast?). Historically, the very short story of Balzac, the film is not perfect, but cures no less. The final blow me haunts in weeks. (8/10)
