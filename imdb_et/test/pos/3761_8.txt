"Pearl Harbor, friend." This movie is brilliant! Of course, it does not flow exactly like a multi-million dollar comedy, but the jokes that are constantly thrown are incredible. I am the one who goes to stupidity, like "Dumb and Dumber", "Airplane" and "Wet Hot American Summer", and I have to say it is easily there. Movies no longer write such random comedy anymore. Too many jokes in this is so surprising to the viewer that it is fairly amazing that he knows no more and praises this slapstick masterpiece! When you look at it, you can easily find more than 20 quotes that you will find in the descendants ... and after looking again you will find even more!
