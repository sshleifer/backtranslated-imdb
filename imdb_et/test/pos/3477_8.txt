In Dublin, the abducted rebel Rory O'Shea (James McAvoy) moves to Carrigmore's home for disabled people, which affects the lives of the people. Roy is able to understand the incomprehensible speech of Michael Connolly (Steven Robertson), which remained in the shelter of his outstanding father as a result of his cerebral palsy, and they become close friends. Rory persuades Michael to move from Carrigmore to an apartment in Dublin and hire Siobhan (Romola Garai) to help them. Living with Rory, Michael faces a new world, finding friendship, love and freedom, and learning to survive. <br /> <br /> "Inside I'm Dancing" is a wonderful story of friendship and freedom in a very beautiful story. The actions of Steven Robertson and James McAvoy are fantastic and I do not understand how these Oscar nominees are so great performances. Romola Garai is also top-notch and very beautiful and sexy. The scenario touches, never bright and without redemption, and Damien O'Donnell's exact direction is very sensitive. Unfortunately, the Brazilian title DVD is disgracefully ridiculous, giving the impression of this excellent film. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Os Melhores Dias de Nossas Vidas" ("The Best Years of Our Life")
