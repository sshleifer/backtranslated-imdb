I enjoyed Squire Trelane's jerk around this episode team, but after some time the whole thing just seemed too long. Of course, histrionics was funny for a while and the end was a pretty good way to put the whole thing together. I think the problem was that I enjoyed seeing Trelane when she was cruel and fun, fun seemed to disappear when Trelane became honest and disgusting. Tell the mood of the killer - going from an unpleasant but friendly host who understands Kirki's death! However, the episode was pleasant and worth my time. For complicated trekking this is a must-it, for others it's just a grinder's move.
