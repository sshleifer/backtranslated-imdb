This is one of the best queues and a very good movie, even if there were mistakes, but I enjoyed it. This time Charles is not only against one or two carts, but with their entire army. Death Wish 3 has many great scenes and I enjoyed it every second. Director Michael Winner knows how to run a good feature film and a Jimmy page that offers music where manufacturers Golan and Globus are still doing this and Charles Bronson is still working for Paul Kersey. This film also saw Michael trying to end the Death Wish series and I can't blame him and I love the Gun that Charles uses. Death Wish 3 is one of 1985's great movies and doesn't get better. <br /> <br /> I'll give it 9/10
