"Mood in Love" is the allegory of loneliness and longing. Here's a movie without sex or even a kiss - and this is undoubtedly one of the sexiest and certainly the most thoughtful and psychological romance I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Talking about the story of two people who live randomly in the same apartment and are away from each other. The film, like "Random Hearts", means how two people come together between their two lovers. It is only after they have received the news that they take the time to think about the consequences of things and the feelings of each other that they are simply broken - and whether two people are ready to fall in love. /> <br /> What is terrible for the film is director Wong Kar-Wai, who presents the way of solving each character's loneliness. Maggie Cheung's character shows her repeatedly in the assembly: she leaves work, goes home, looks at her neighbors to succeed, directs the noodle shop, leaves the noodle shop and captures her attractive age limit by Tony Leung. It's clever, if not subtle and aware of the technique of loneliness. Because it's when you are alone when you find yourself in the loop. This movie worked for me because I can identify with this feeling.
