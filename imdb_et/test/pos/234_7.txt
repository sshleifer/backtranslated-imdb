Although I'm not crazy about musical acts, COVER GIRL is a delight for classical film fans and especially for Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly fans. The film can be dated according to today's standards, and the story and songs may not be special, but the musical number is stunning and the film comes with amazing light. In addition, the film is a good introduction to fans of Rita Hayworth ... she is just a breathtaking glow in Technicolor. <br /> <br /> Despite Jerome Kerni's collaboration with the film, his music is far from being so special or memorable. his songs are in SWING TIME (1936), but the songs are good for the movie. Dancing is not good, especially with Gene Kelly's solo number and my favorite music number "Alter-Ego Dance". Funny Phil Silvers almost steals the film as Kelly's partner. Otto Kruger, Eve Arden and Edward Brophy give good results in their dramatic supporters. And here Rita plays a sweet, charming girl; a role that is far from his femme fatale babes in films like BLOOD AND SAND (1941). <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a delightful film that you should watch even if you are not musical. But the music of the movie could have been more memorable when only the songs of the movie were written by singers Irving Berlin or Cole Porter during my favorite period. But it is a glorious Technicolor cinema and an imaginative dance that is the actual treatment of film production. <br /> <br /> While I was watching Rita Hayworth, I did my things, I don't think I've ever seen a more beautiful or graceful redhead dance on display because I saw Moira Shearer Michael Powell's masterpiece THE RED SHOES (1948). Just look at Ritat COVER at GIRL and love her.
