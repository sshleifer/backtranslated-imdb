Exactly how the director John Madden and Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz played the role of an Italian official and Greek villager in an honorable story: "Captain Correl's Mandolin", just escapes me! Witness: an insecure, inconsistent Cage accent that is terrible, unsatisfactory, with Cruz - more cast than spoiled by Latino Johnny Dep in "Blow" - basically repetitive performance in the shadow of the Greek sister ... Ay, it was painful. But there were savings for grace. <br /> <br /> The story itself is exciting and tragic and Cage has the musical ability (to redeem it!). Next, Oscar Callibre introduced John Hurt (Cruz's father, villager), Irene Papase, villagers, as well as Christian Bale (son of Papas) in the village's freedom fighters. Go far offset by the inconvenience (especially in the beginning) of Cruz and Cage. The latter two seem to grow as their film progresses into their respective roles, but the concealment of teeth at the beginning. In the end, the landscape itself and photography could collect a technical prize that offers pleasant confusion when they are most needed. <br /> <br /> John Hurt already has two Oscar nominees and one third; I hope he will achieve this as his presentation as the doctor makes it worth watching the movie. The real test of a supporting actor / actress is whether the film is not the same, without the person concerned, and in that case it would not be ... even close. <br /> <br /> The value of entertainment, but the above plus factors that help to raise the bar. See if you haven't done that. Rating = 3.5 stars out of 5.
