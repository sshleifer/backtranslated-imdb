Based on the memories of Gypsy Rose Lee, who painted her mother's more sensitive picture as her sister, the "Baby" actor in June, in her autobiography "Early Havoc", on which "They shoot horses, are they not?" Was loosely based. I saw Ethyl Merman in the original Broadway production of a gypsy, and he was great as "Mama Rose", but definitely more "Merman" than Rose. I was disappointed with Rosalind Russell's portrayal of the 1962 film version. Otherwise, a great actor, Russell was very wood for Merman. By contrast, Bette Midler was better and more credible than Merman and I would recommend her as final.
