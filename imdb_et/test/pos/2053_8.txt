Excellent Christmas Story "Susie Homemaker's Moving Theme finds her inner Amazon". No, I'm serious! Geena Davis's amnesia begins to heal when she knocks on her head. From this familiar beginning we are moving in an unexpected direction. Good tempo, good action, fun story, lots of explosions and chaos.
