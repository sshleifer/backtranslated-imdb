"Ray" Ray Dir Taylor Hackford Cast-Jamie Foxx, Kerry Washington, Regina King, Clifton Powell, Curtis Armstrong, and Sharon Warren. Written by Taylor Hackford and James L. White. Rating- *** <br /> <br /> "Go on the Jack and don't come back again, no more, no more, MORE!" Who would have thought that this immortal line, which has almost become a mantra for improving broken relationships in popular culture, was created to beat lovers! Ray Charles was a genius. And if there was one thing he knew, breathed and lived; it was music. So in a lifetime involving acute poverty, there was a desperate struggle with darkness, guilt, drugs, and painful things; Ray still found moments when inspiration hit him somewhere and the words and notes took shape to form an immediate eternal classic! <br /> <br /> There are a number of lives that deserve to be transformed into a silver screen. Ray Charles's life was one of them. It's almost a shock to find out that this project didn't support studio until it was ready! And this support was likely to come after the initial screening, where Jamie Foxx's performance was praised and predicted when it was sure of the Oscar winner, with a leaning voice. Jamie Foxx as Ray almost convinces us that it is really Ray Charles who acts on the screen and not as an actor! Foxx strives to grasp all the realities of Ray Charles from all the ignorant smiles, not to the disability, but to the curved walk of a man dancing through his demons. Ray was a complicated man. He never demanded compassion and rarely showed it. A smart businessman ensured his success at all costs, sometimes with the loss of his loved ones. He never apologized for his film management and always said he loved his family, which we are convinced. She liked sex; it was so easy! But below is Ray, which was afraid of darkness. Imagine the fear of darkness from darkness! His fear was due to his guilt. Ray was convinced that he was the cause of his brother's death, and his whole life was spent trying to redeem himself. Ray was a medieval man who blended the gospel with jazz, who was the 50th famous blasphemy practice. But his intentions were not inciting. He was just the only way he knew God! <br /> <br /> It is hard to capture such an eventful life as Ray, and this is perhaps the place where the film fails. We've never been allowed Ray's close to people. We only know him as much as we can see him. His relationship, especially with Margie Hendricks (Regina King), is not examined in detail. And the script hardly bothers Della Bea (Kerry Washington), Ray's woman, all of whom she knew, was a stone next to her. And the biggest mess is just a rush, almost a steep climax. Just as the director suddenly realized he was in stock and called to pack! Nonetheless, Ray is definitely recommended for the flawless results of Jamie Foxx and the powerful stars ensemble. Songs and ages create a sense of nostalgia and we truly feel that the film has been made sincerely. <br /> <br /> Abhishek Bandekar <br /> <br /> <br/> Note: Ray is called the six-year category of this year's Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor (Jamie Foxx). br /> <br /> Rating- *** <br /> <br /> * Poor ** Average *** Good **** Very Good ***** Excellent <br /> <br /> 19 February 2005
