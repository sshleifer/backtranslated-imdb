Another decent offer from Vince Gilligan's pencil. <br /> <br /> Pre- "Malcolm in the Center" Bryan Cranston plays Patrick Crump, a robbed man who finally hijacks Mulder through a gun and drives at high speed west. It has something to do with his strong head (and potentially deadly burning - his wife just experienced it) and the pressure seems to be relieved when you move to the left coast. Only Mulder could be related to this son and associate with his captain before the night. In the meantime, Scully seems to have solved the case with Mr Crump's possible remedy and meets with them in the ocean. Check it out to see if our Dynamic Duo can be attached to the Pacific and somehow improve Mr Crump's big problem.
