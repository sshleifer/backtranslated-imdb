Man, I had doubts. I love Kathy Bates, but I thought how good it was, I had never heard of it ...! You know, this was one of those things, we gave it "20 minutes and we'll turn it off when it sucks" and we were locked. This is a very charming and fun movie. It's peculiar, you know? I think you have a singer, a murderer (and a believer), you have a farce, then Kathy Bates in all of your exemplary glories, Rupert Everett finally has his real potential, Dan Ackroyd and the dwarf that make you laugh out loud. I'm saying you are laughing / crying. Maybe I had a strange week, but I think this movie is fried on green tomatoes. If you don't like this movie, maybe you don't like it, but I think it was a great movie. I went out and bought a DVD.
