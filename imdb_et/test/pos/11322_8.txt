Well this movie was definitely in line with the present times. There is no happy ending, super heroes or miracles. Just an underground fiction that stimulates our thoughts towards terrorism and what it is. Kudos to Percival and Mickery for a great scenario and great direction. Such films are necessary to make us aware of what is there. If all peace-loving men and women apparently reported suspicious activities, then I believe that terrorism cannot develop. This film showed how difficult these terrorists are to push down even with good intelligence. Although the film is a bit of propaganda against Islam (using a Muslim police officer as the main character), I believe it was quite realistic. The bomb attack was supposed to be a shock. As a very smart tool for humiliation and resentment of people who had been subjected to such attacks, they showed the full nudity of women when they were contaminated after the attack. It didn't take me a long time to realize that it was supposed to be even more in the viewer, which I thought we didn't control everything in such a situation. Although it took place in London, where the usual high-level British act, it publishes any part of the world. Big movies don't have to be uneven epic productions, and this movie is very worth watching.
