I personally love this movie in the middle of the Halloween series. I've found it after watching it with many friends that you enjoy it completely or find it completely unbearable. Personally, I've been watching it tens of times, and it never gets old. The film has a great backdrop and finally explains many different things. This is a pretty short movie that is just 90 minutes shy, but it is definitely an exciting journey. <br /> <br /> The look in this movie looks pretty brutal, but the actor is still like walking, stalking and killing. There are a lot of clean little screen shots in the background with Micheal, which adds more horrible elements to the film.
