And so the most gracious skunk was born to the grace of the silver screen. Although the plot has been abused by a cat that is like a skunk and involuntarily attracts Pepe Le Pew (called here Henry), Pepe definitely steals the show. There is no doubt that Chuck Jones realized that at this Mephitis family's end of love it was something special that he needed to be a star of his own, and so put him four years later on Pepe's "odd-imperial causes", creating a firm PLP lasting So, although "Odor-Able Kitty" may be the owner of the place, I will try to imagine it for the first time in 1945. Would anyone have thought that this supportive character would soon be Bugs, Daffy, Porky and the rest? Whether someone did it, Pepe is still one of today's most enjoyable characters. C'est l'amour!
