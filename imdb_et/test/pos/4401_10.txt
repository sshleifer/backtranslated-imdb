I've gone out before the Coen movie and I don't know how to feel it. Its two best examples are Big Lebowski and Fargo. Lebowski was so ridiculously original and so full of strange humor that I had to love him. On the other hand, the flying people and the bowling balls of the murderer, which simply did not seem to be inappropriate for the forms of the film. But I liked the movie and still had a copy of it. Fargo made me hit with hysteria, sometimes I wasn't sure why I laughed so hard that it cried to me, but I was still. There were many seemingly strange signs in Fargo, but in the case of further investigation, they were really people who talked about real situations. That's why the shovel (or the bones) was so funny when he told a police officer about some funny man on the other night at the bar. And that's why the theater laughed when he says some funny clouds are coming. (I also own a copy of this movie). and maybe a bit off the wall. But if you look at some of the same characters that look quite enthusiastic, you will always find that it is strangely true. This is what is quite an exceptional O-brother, where are you? It's a movie that's there. I mean, it's not even in the same ball pool as a traditional movie. I watched the Shaft movie last summer and I said Shaft was a okay movie I've seen a thousand times before. But you can't say that you can't definitely talk about Coen Brother's movie. <br /> <br /> This movie contains everything from prison driving, curved southern politicians, musicals, references I can only guess historical figures, river bank baptism, bank robberies, animal violence, religious fanatics, FAQs, lynx mobiles, and so on. There are obviously many references to Homer's Odyssey, but I don't know it because I never read or even knew about Homer's Odyssey. It seems that every other newspaper reviewer is fully aware of this and thinks that this cynicism and the quality of its bad qualities make it much better. Well, who comes to the guy who knows nothing about it, I can tell you that it's still a fun movie. There were times when, as usual for Coen's movie, I wasn't sure why I was entertaining or laughing, but I was. <br /> <br /> This is a road picture where three men travel along the way to find the hidden treasure that Clooney says he is hidden from his two other cells. He must take them, because they were also linked to him when they had the chance to escape. <br /> <br /> I like all the main actors in the movie and many of them are Coen Cronies. Goodman was good to see again. It was nice to see Hunter and especially Turturro, who seem to be in every place in Coen's movie. It's too bad they didn't find a place for Steve Buscem, but it's a different story. But back to Clooney. Man is just charisma. He is also one of the hell actors and here he is not as eager as the others, but he even has his own peculiarities. His work here is quite fantastic and I hope it shows that he is capable of playing any character. <br /> <br /> Now, after this movie is praised, I'll say it. I didn't enjoy the movie at the beginning. I found it to be quite annoying and a bit boring. There were too many ideas here and did not take enough care of the use they were worth. But then the film started to grow on me. It took a while, but it grew to me. I don't think this is their best movie, but it's still good and I'm giving it 8.5. But the reason I recommend this movie is just one reason. <br /> <br /> Every day you can watch the paper and watch movies that play and say to yourself, saw it, saw it, oh, I saw it last year, the same thing as this movie and it's the same movie. Most movies have been reused in some form. Not Coen movies. They have not been recycled and they do not know it. That's enough reason to see something they put out. My books read a lot of originality. Coens are original and good. And it's not common in today's cinema. Enjoy them when they're allowed to make movies. Because you don't get a vision in many movies, so if you do, enjoy it!
