The theme of the ultimate sick children is difficult and sad, but The Cure successfully represents the idea that it does not have to be all deadly and dark and, if anything, the children must have hope and joy in their lives if they are to find peace before the end. It is also a film with remarkable friendships and innocence. <br /> <br /> The film looks at Erik, who is a distant youngster with his mother, moving to a new area where, next to them, is the 11-year-old Dexter, who contracted AIDS through blood transfusion. After his initial fears and ignorance of AIDS, Erik is relieved by Dexter, and their almost fraternal friendship sees that they are starting a trip to Mississippi, where they have heard of a New Orleans doctor who claims to have found a cure for the disease. br /> <br /> Brad Renfro and Joseph Mazzello's young talent who play Erik and Dexter respectively are exceptional. Brad was able to depict the heavier edge of Erik without including a subtle child's innocence, but Joseph depicts the sensitivity of Dexter, but injects the right amount of boy's enthusiasm and zeal to emphasize that his illness does not mean he is still a child, who wants to run and play like any other 11 year old boy. The couple's relationships create a feeling in the audience that these are two boys who are really close and carry the movie well. Annabella Sciorra also offers touching work such as Dexter's mother Linda, who adores her son and delights her with this new friendship with Erik and finally becomes a substitute for another boy. <br /> <br /> Set for a great soundtrack, "The Cure" is a very bittersweet film that fits flawlessly into a boyfriend's friendship that lives unevenly in the midst of prejudice and terminal illness without using sapphire or unnecessary saccharin sweet scenes. A very interesting reflection in the film is that adults have a problem with Dexter's AIDS status, while children, even "bully", will come to receive it as if they were others. It is also very important how, despite the nature of Erik Street, he is more naÃ¯ve than he wants to treat Dexter, while the younger boy is in the haunting sense that he knows his destiny, but is moving away from his best friend's enthusiasm for treating his friend's enthusiasm. > I recommend "The Cure" because it is rarely a movie that is sad and exhilarating at the same time.
