I think a person would be advised to read or read (I am in favor of reading) "twelfth night" before he sees "he is a man". The film is for its own benefit, but comparing them and looking for fun makes it more fun. Others were inspired by Shakespeare. I think he's giving a thumb. <br /> <br /> Harld Bloom said in "Shakespeare, Human Invention" that most "Twelfth Night" people should be locked. Malvolio, a person based on Malcolm, is without reason. By contrast, people of "His Man" are reasonable. For example, Duke Orsino is much more than the Duke of Orsino. He also shows that a person can have feelings without homelessness. He shows a lot of self-control. <br /> <br /> This is a teen comedy (clean) so it has no edges of darkness. For example, Olivia has mourned the death of her brother. In the film, he is dumped. <br /> <br /> If you like Sir Andrew and Sir Toby, they don't have the same attention in the movie. <br /> <br /> The jokes are quite often fast. Hairdresser Paul's surname is given once. This is Antonio. Many people who have read the game say that Antonio loves a man more than just friendship. In those days, deep love for men was observed. Some see this sexual aspect - homosexuality was illegal. <br /> <br /> The only line played in the game is where Duke Orsino quotes the coach during his grandiose socco game. In the game, Malvolio, Maria quotes.
