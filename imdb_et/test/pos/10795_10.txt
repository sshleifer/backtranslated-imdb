I've seen it a couple of times and it is fully glued every time. It is very tense and intense. It is boring to describe it, but it's amazing. This is a movie where you can't miss anything, but when you soak it, it will stay with you long after its end. Now think about it, I don't even know what Stone is trying to see. Just Alan Green's story? I do not belive. It was a glimpse of ignorance, stupidity, self-absorption, and a boy who just lost his grip. Maybe he had more grip than listeners. I didn't like Barry, but it still seemed for some reason worried about him. I was confused why I couldn't get out of my mind at the end of the movie. I wish I could see it from Olive Stone.
