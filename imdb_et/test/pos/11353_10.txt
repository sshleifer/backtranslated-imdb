I was advised to see this movie as the best love story ever spoken. And when I'm a big fan of love, I bought tickets and sat in the theater. After 90 minutes, I left the theater only with the song of disappointment and theme as the only positive thing in the movie. I was boldly telling myself that two people could love each other, but I am afraid they will never act. I just couldn't pass the language barrier and the culture barrier. The second time I came in ... was in a different mood, no more expectation ... and I had more patience, a relaxed mind to "see" the movie ... and as soon as I opened my eyes I discovered a movie of love ... beauty. I went beyond the language and love story and saw the actor (not even for a moment when I ever felt like they were acting!) And cinematography. The first time I heard the definition of a movie, I was told that it should be a perfectly balanced (chain of) photos and that is a description for the film. Almost every shot is behind the idea and combined with music ... and light effects ... is only a masterpiece! And the masterpiece is just something you have to have in the movie collection.
