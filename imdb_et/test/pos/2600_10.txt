Rabbit Fire (1951) "Rabbit Trilogy", Rabbit Seasoning (1952) and Duck! Hare! Duck! (1953) Chuck Jones-Michael Malta should be considered a comic high watermark. Although they are rarely mentioned in the history of animation with the "biggest" or "most important" cartoons, they are definitely FUNNIEST cartoons I've ever seen. Michael Maltese never got credit for the Jones, Freleng or Avery leaders, but it's his dialogue and situations that make Warner Bros.'s cartoons and especially the three that have ever been made.
