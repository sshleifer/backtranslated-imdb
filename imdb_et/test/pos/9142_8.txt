I already gave my comment on this movie called BruceV3. Now, under BruceV13, I want to add something! Now, after a long time, I've seen many heroic blood donations! But not many come close to the action shown in John Woo's films! That's why I think it is strange after these years that "Chinese White" can't be worth the credit! No matter what version you have seen! Action is the upper limit! Landscape, Town Town, Amsterdam, is very unique. You get the impression that this is a big area. But living in Amsterdam, I know it's just a small part of the red light area with lots of Chinese shops and restaurants! But because they shot the movie, it really looks like a big and important territory where people don't know they're rushing (Chinese mafia)! In addition to "Chinese White", there is a powerful gangster drama with good actors! For that, I have to give Russell Wong credit! Too bad that we don't see much of it lately because it has many options! Must see a movie!
