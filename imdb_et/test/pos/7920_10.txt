This is only commented on because Serge Prokofiev (1891-1953) may not first know how strong this score is and how in fact these are majestic. is less than a witness to one of the most beautiful and moving results in the entire musical literature through the song. The score accompanying this film has a special place in the world and can be as true on the internet as anywhere. Composers' own website, which is by its estate, gives such a score considering extra care because this score really deserves. This is a song about Alexander Nevsky. Yes, it happened on the Neva River in the Neva River with wide water. There we killed our enemies who fight against men, choosing fighting men, the Swedish army. How we fought, how we directed them! Ah! s against the firing of war! In our struggle, our blood was free to our great land, our native Russian land. Hey! When broadaxe turned as an open street, there was a lane next to those lines where spears ran! Swedes like ears that have grown on desert soil. We will never produce Russian-speaking land. Those who march with Russia will be killed! Rise to weapons, Come to weapons, You Russians, Battle, Fight against Death, Rise, People Free and Brave, Defend Our Right Homeland! People, Russian people, for home, Russian soil! In our great Russia-Russia, there is no enemy. Rise to arms, rise, mother tongue in Russia! led by Russia.v enemies destroy Russian fields (here we ask to live forever with the following verses) e) titled "Field of the Dead" - I'm going over the snow covered area, I'm flying over the dead area. I'm looking for brave warriors, my fianc√©e, my pristine youth. wild saber, there is one impaled by the arrow.The blood of these wounds fell like rain in our native soil, in our Russian fields.He who fell to Russia's noble death is blest my kiss with his dead eyes, and to him, the brave boy who survived, I I am a real husband and a loving friend.I am not married to a beautiful man, a reputation for charm and beauty quickly fade and die. I'm a married man who is brave, let you listen to this, brave warriors! (now, when it was signed with Nevskys in Pskov) During the big campaign, Russia went to war. Russia was hosted by hostile troops. There is no enemy to live in our homeland. Celebrate and sing, mother tongue in Russia! In our homeland, enemies must not live. Death! In Russia, we have no enemy in our homeland, Russia. Celebrate and sing, Mother tongue in Russia! All Russia came to triumph for celebration. Attention and rejoice, Russian Mother! - It should be noted that Prokofiev was somewhat under pressure from Stalin that if you want to do it, it will do a good job. This musical result was very much welcomed by Stalin. I have the obvious beauty of how we love this world, and Nevsky speaks of heroes whose God attributes God's participation in this love. Really beautiful and bright story of Alexander Nevsky.
