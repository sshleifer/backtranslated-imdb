I always loved this movie. Music, story and action. I especially love opening and closing a movie. Music remained with me over the years. WWI airplane battles were great and comedy is typical of Blake Edwards. Slaptick is his final result. Julie's singing is amazing and keeps me glued to the screen. Sets and scenes are wonderful. The characters are tempting. I loved the scene with wounded soldiers and Julie singing to them. I wish she sang with me in Vietnam. I also enjoyed old cars and WWI music. I was glad when the DVD arrived. Now I can get dark in the dark, looking at it again and again.
