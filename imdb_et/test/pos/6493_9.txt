This is Marc Recha's fourth full-length feature film. Third "les mans buides" - Very hands-on - I promised myself not to cut my vein anymore. But this time the plot is completely different - a tribute to Ramon Barnil (Sabadell 1940 - Reus 2001), a Catalan journalist. The trailer's visual images are stunning - a sun-bathing river - and the promise that Marc himself would be in front of the camera with his twin brother - not both professional actors - convinced me last six weeks after it was released. Give up on this very unusual road / river movie. Learn almost anything about Ramon Barnils, but his worst legacy: his constant struggle against Amnesia about what we Catalans forgot. "La batalla de l'Ebre" - the Ebro battleship in wikipedia - never disappeared, but twice, because after 40 years of silence and 25 years of half-hearted democracy, no one has done much to remember its legal side. Spanish Civil War and its fighters. This film is about individuals who travel in the same places with very little conscience in what was there 70 years ago. This movie is about the landscape.
