This film is a brilliant retelling of Shakespeare's classical love story with "kinky sex, body piercing and breaking". It follows the same spirit as all other Troma films [except Combat Shock ... This sucker was frustrating], but it's not just for Troma fans. Anyone who appreciates small visuals and a fun script will definitely fall in love with this movie. it knows its foolish movie and pulls it out of humor. The actor is also surprisingly good, and you can just feel the pain of Sammy Capulet trying to put his brain back on his head. Willis Fiasco, Supernova and The Meatmen are also four stars. This movie should be viewed by everyone because it remains true to the original story, still packed with Troma brand gore / sex humor.
