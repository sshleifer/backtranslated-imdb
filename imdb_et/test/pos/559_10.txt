I saw this movie last night in HBO and don't expect to grab it - I usually sleep when I watch HBO. But it happened and you did. This is a tragic documentary (2002 Oscar winner) on the murder of elderly female tourists in Jacksonville, Florida, and the subsequent investigation, arrest and trial of a 15-year-old boy. <br /> <br /> Look at this movie today to see how we have progressed as a society. This film was the most valuable Oscar - you are moving to tears.
