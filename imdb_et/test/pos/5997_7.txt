This version of Gulliver's stories is definitely odd. Production adds the story of the return to Gulliver's wife and son (it has become famous). With one view, incredibly long and sometimes not paying attention to the whole, but odd pictures and diverse casts will keep you in the eye. Mary Steenburgen does the most work. Danson looks a bit out of his American accent. The whole thing about asylum is often terribly disturbing, but it is still interesting and keeps Gulliver's rides well. Danson's character really seems crazy ... he should have worked to make him a little more credible to everyone. The past is also causing confusion. Anyone else thinks that Yahoos is the toughest thing on the television screen (or for it)? Confusing, sometimes boring, but still highlighting some good acting, general wonderful visual effects and some enjoyable parts. NBC's First Of The Many Films By Robert Halm, Sr. See it for yourself to decide how it goes for you, but I'll give it * * * 1/2 (out of 5 stars).
