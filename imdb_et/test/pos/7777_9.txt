It's a shame that this movie hasn't played more in theaters. It is a rich, textured love story with unbelievable, overly human characters who are too busy playing games and protecting their hearts to recognize the real thing when they experience it. One of the most pleasing aspects of this film is that it is located in Chicago, among hip, artistic, literary, and middle-class African people who speak poetry, music, and literature. The other is his hardness, Larenz Tate - and if you're a half fan, you have to watch this movie! His poignant evil and vulnerability are perfect for Darius. Nia Long also shines with Nina, who wants to tell Darius that she loves her, but is afraid to break the "rules". A great movie to watch with your gold on the couch.
