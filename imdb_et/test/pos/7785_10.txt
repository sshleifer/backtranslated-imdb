In my opinion, the film can best be judged by the number of best scenes. There are probably at least 80-90 scenes in the whole movie, which someone probably thinks is "the best". <br /> <br /> This movie is a masterpiece. Period. I know many who have called it before, probably because it was bombed in the box. But I think every generation can be related to this movie and it is good to laugh out. <br /> <br /> I am personally glad that Mahmood is part of the movie. His role is not "muscular", but it is good to see that he is part of the most fun Hindi movie ever.
