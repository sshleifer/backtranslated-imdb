This movie was surprising how good it was! The plot is extraordinary and exemplary. First I thought it wasn't so big because of the summary, but after the first five or ten minutes of the film, it hit me that I was dead wrong. I literally punished this movie about four or five times and nevertheless I had to see the same scenes over and over again about 30 times in one week! No, song scenes were not as fantastic as they might have been, but the plot is what really gets you. American or Asain, I would recommend it to anyone - and I have now. I guarantee that after you see it, you'll get the best of it and its plot. Hope you feel the same and write a rave review!
