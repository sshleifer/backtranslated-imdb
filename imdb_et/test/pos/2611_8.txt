Assy McGee is an uncontrolled, hard-nosed detective based on countless examples of police dramas from the late 20th century. Here is that Assy is literally a walking butt. <br /> <br /> The inexpensive, low-eyed facade of the exhibition will not let your smart and hidden satire. This does not mean that Assy does not have fun jokes, but that little use is made of toilet humor to urge you to consistently laugh, not fierce and eye-rolled. The program's title sequence demonstrates smart, subtle humor. In the queue, there is a copy of the city's 70's police-related photos. In one photo, a police cruiser is shown, and the "camera" zooms in on the owner of the front number plate that is free. The nonsensical zoom-satirizes the creation of a typical 70-80s police frame and by the way makes me always ridiculous. <br /> <br /> All typical characters are: disgruntled police chief who can't control Assy; a loyal minority partner acting as Assy's negligence foil; Regular policemen who blame Assy's resources ... everything is counted and everyone is a typical satire of police drama. <br /> <br /> The voice that comes mainly from Larry Murphy is nothing more than remarkable. Assy's voice - breathing and a bit drunk drunk - is so smart and unique that it is alongside all times like Stewie Griffin (Family Guy) and Homer Simpson (Simpsons). Although the voice is empty, the dictation is somehow clear and easy to understand. This is a nice change from other adult swim program voices that often require an understanding of closed captions. <br /> <br /> In addition to fantastic production and voice performance, the script is also fun. The directness of Assy's innocence guides most of the humor, especially when communicating with citizens outside the police. <br /> <br /> If you have access to adult swimming comedies, Assy McGee is definitely remarkable. The time of each episode is only 8-9 minutes, so you really have little loss.
