This horror film is definitely one of the best I've ever seen in my life and why. The style is really good, it has a lot of deeds and great horror sequences. The actors are not very good, but there is not so bad, but Kane is definitely the best actor, but he was always a good actor. like Kane like Jacob Goodnight, Christina Vidal as Christine, Michael j. Pagan like Tye, Samantha Noble like Kira, etc. I also just need to warn you that the kill scenes are very disturbing, but they are very creative, but just make it better and you can't have a horror movie without blood and gore. it looks very realistic. So I'm sure you won't be disappointed if you don't see any evil because it's really a good movie. So make sure you rent or buy that is not evil because it is just so big. <br /> <br /> Overall score: ********** ********* * <br /> <br /> ***** *****
