Just saw this movie 2 days ago. A very interesting look at people and our world through the wine world. I have no particular interest in wine and I found it very enlightening. The director gave me the impression that he has the ability to show people how they are. If he reveals many things that are under the surface, he will not be able to stop and leave it to the viewer. He shows people (and dogs) a lot of compassion and compassion, and lets people tell their story and at the same time reveals what they don't want. <br /> <br /> The film shows where our world is going, what its benefits are and the great price we pay. It is a film of love and love for wine to make it big, personal and global, character and formula. <br /> <br /> The real stars of the people are older wine producers who have a disappointed look in the world and themselves. <br /> <br /> It takes time to move and edit high-speed cameras, but it's worth it. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
