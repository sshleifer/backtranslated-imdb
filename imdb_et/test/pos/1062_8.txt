Considering the role-playing games in the 1940s (Casper Gutman, Signior Ferrari, Mr. Peters, Jerome K. Arbutny, Ex-Superintendent Grodman, Count Fosco, Titus Semple), many of his fans surprise that Sidney Greenstreet originally named himself in West End and Broadway comedies . Usually he was such a general offender or serious public actor that his comic talents were ignored. In fact, he made four comedies (one of his poor images with his stupid partner, Peter Lorre, who was looking out of the fire). His best film compilation in comedy was probably the magazine publisher Alexander Yardley's "Christmas in Connecticut" (although his autocratic, half-crazy soup "The Hucksters" is another one). Despite some problems with the scenario, it is a good film and is usually revived at Christmas. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck) writes in the column "American Housekeeping" in Yardley, where she gives household tips and cooking recipes. He is Martha Steward's 1945 version, except that Mrs. Steward is a cook and a homeowner and she can try and test what she supports. Stanwyck can't. Her cooking recipes are her friend Felix (S.Z. Sakall), gourmet chef and restaurant. The house he describes as his home (Connecticut Farmhouse) belongs to his informal boy architect John Sloan (Reginald Gardiner). Gardiner really does not mind Stanwyck getting married, but he is not fully prepared to consider the final commitment to him. <br /> <br /> When the movie starts, the American gets hit by the Nazis. This is Jefferson Jones (Dennis Morgan), a sailor. Before he is saved, he spends two weeks in the raft. Recognizing the value of the public, Greenstreet decides to give Morgan a desire for a true old-fashioned Christmas in Connecticut. He basically tells Stanwyck that he will attract Morgan and himself on his farm during the holidays. Stanwyck cannot explain that the representation of his own columns (along with his ability to lift up the flip-flops and raise his baby with his wife) is wrong - if he can dismiss him, as does his immediate superior Dudley Beecham (Robert Shayne). At the time of depression, he accepts Gardiner's marriage proposal, and then Gardiner finds that his home in Connecticut has become Stanwycki and his "child" "real" home. <br /> <br /> Of course, aside from the curious takeover of Greenstreet's intervention, Stanwyck and Morgan find that they fall in love (much to the Gardiner's outrage - he actually expects Stanwyck to marry him). The complication results in a complication that lies on the wrong piles and when the neighbors 'children succeed in the neighbors' children before Greenstreet begins to wonder if he is missing something. But it's comedy so everything works well. Even Greenstreet, at the end, has amused all the madness - his marked cheerful chortle that reflects the change of Santa Clause. It's not a classic comedy, certainly not big, but more fun that the season would be worth watching in December.
