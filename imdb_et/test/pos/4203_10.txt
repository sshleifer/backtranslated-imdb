As a fan of old Warner brothers gangster films, I had to check it out on the 2nd best movie adventure class DVD, which also had one of my favorite films - Antarctic Scott on it. It was made in 1939 a good year for many Warner brothers movies, it boasts a big cast, John Garfield , Claude Rains, Ann Sheridan and the Dead Children who would later be known as Bowery Boys monogram pictures. well boxer (Garfield) gets into a murder that he did not take and that has run and has been forced by a harsh New York detective (Claude Rains) who arrives at a pretty woman-led fruit picking place (Gloria Dickson) and dead children (Huntzi Hall, Leo Gorcey, Benard Punsley, Billy Halop, Bobby Jordan, Gabreil Dell) returns later with a boxing match, but tries to keep a low profile. It was headed by the famous director Busby Berkley, who led timeless classics like 42nd Street, 1933 Gold Players and 35, Leg Parade and many others. I'd like to call platinum on DVD / video to put out a lot of good budget DVDs like adventure classics (see my Scott Antarctica look) giving me 10 of 10 great movies. sick it is to note that I've only seen 2 John Garfield movies, one and one body and soul.i thought he was a very good actor.
