The recent "Purgatory Flats" shown on the cable is a small film that packs a lot. Harris Done directs style. Mr. Done and Diane Fine play a good thriller. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen a movie, you might want to stop reading. <br /> <br /> Film is a story about a young LA doctor who made a mistake and lives to pay for it. When he is released from prison, he wants to hide in a small town where he feels he is forgotten. Bad choice! What Thomas Reed finds in Purgatory apartments is hell in the desert. Immediately after finishing his work as a bar, Thomas meets a pretty young woman, Sunny, who is obviously to be left with someone. A young doctor has been called to assist Sunny's boyfriend Randy, who has been kidnapped by a drug dealer. <br /> <br /> We introduce the Randy family. His uncle Dean seems to be fine, but his brother Owen is an open cannon. Every household person is connected to more than one nubile Sunny. <br /> <br /> Performances are good. Vincent Ventresca is Thomas, a man who should have gone to his L.A practice instead of making a small detour to the city. Alexandra Holden is Sunny, a young woman with a huge ambition to escape from her surroundings. Kevin Alejandro, Gregg Henry, Brian Austin are good men in the Mecklin family. Nicholas Turturro is also a good dealer of drugs. The film shows the director's promise, who decides on it on the basis of a tightly designed film.
