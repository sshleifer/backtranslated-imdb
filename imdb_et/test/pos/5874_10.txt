What can be said about any Wilder movie, except those that are the most human and realistic stories of people, and what's leading them, the mistakes they worship. Billy created pictures like paintings that stand forever and reflect the human condition. He paints good and bad in all of us. He also paints with love. I can't imagine anyone having the biggest movie list without Wilder's movie. They last because they are true. I first saw this movie on television in the 1960s when I was a kid, and I had to leave the room because I felt the tears that were torturing me and was embarrassing. Now I'm an old man and I still feel tears, but don't leave the room. I knew and loved these people and grew around them. Billy kept them in this film not in the "greatest generation", but in the most realistic way that preserved the power of the human spirit.
