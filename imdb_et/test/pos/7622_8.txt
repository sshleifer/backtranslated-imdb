This movie is good. They seem to have used Tyrannosaurus Rex like a blown balloon like Godzilla, maybe back in 60-70 days, the scientist hasn't got enough information. of all kinds of dinosaurs. Back in those days, the scientist is still a dinosaur, so I think this film was based on the Tyrannosaurus Rex movements back in the 60s and 70s. There's even a part where the giant stone triggered by the tyrannosaurus Rex damages the Tyrannosaurus Rex and it had been knocking for some time. Finally, Tyrannosaurus Rex went back to look for food. There is something wrong in the film, like a rifle, how one gun can kill a Tyrannosaurus Rex if it can be 1000-5000 stronger than us. When this movie begins to make a remake, I suggest doing it good and exciting because watching an old movie seems to be happy if it is new.
