If I appreciate the film maybe a little high, you can blame this sentiment. This is one of the first movies I remember and love completely. I saw it in California in the late 1970s. I was already a "The Muppet Show" big fan of television, so I was primed for the movie and the film was not disappointed. Basically, it takes the entire Muppet's exhibition to the absurd ethos and transports it from vaudeville on the road. Kermit, the frog, has tried to become famous; not because he wants to take champagne baths and ride in a private jet, but because he wants to "make millions of people happy". Of course. <br /> <br /> Along his way, he will make all his beloved muppet friends, the most fond of Fonzie Bear, with whom he will meet at the adjacent bar where he stands. They sing "Movin 'Right Along", a song that has always been a pleasant melody and fascination for friendship and shared discovery. He also meets enough Hollywood movie stars to perform Stanley Kramer's film, including comedy lanterns such as Richard Pryor, Steve Martin, Edgar Bergen, Milton Berle and Mel Brooks. Particularly Brooks is a bit bored, and you have the feeling that Henson could have cut some of them if he was not afraid of insulting the stars. Anyway, like this kind of movie on this journey, the first meeting he meets is Dom DeLuise. "Children" movie. The Hollywood dream seems to be crumbling about them when a real rainbow strikes Hollywood in its authentic joy and mystery. I'm sure it was supposed to be related to some of Jim Henson's own personal or spiritual experience. <br /> <br /> This is the best movie with Muppets long shooting. If you or someone else wondered why Muppets were so popular in the 1970s, given that the poor have been in the last few decades, then I think this film is at least well-aged to provide a clue.
