RED CIRCLE (Jean-Pierre Melville - France / Italy 1970). <br /> <br /> It can be the coolest movie ever made in the literal sense. The men here will never lose control and never show their emotions. There are no dramatic outbreaks in this movie. Everything is cool all the time. It is an abstract dream world where men live with their own code, a gangster code whose external surface values ​​are visibly absent. In this masterfully filmed, haggard saga, Melville deals with an American crime thriller in its dark and despised style, yet fashionably produced with a $ 10 million budget and four largest French letters. Alain Delon, as the main burglar, Yves Montand as an alcoholic ex-policeman, the Italian star Gian-Maria Volonté escaped as a criminal and André Bourvil, an atypical role as a cynical police leader. <br /> <br /> Melville was described by LE CERCLE ROUGE as his last film and is indeed a masterly styled policeman. He also claimed that he wanted to film in color and succeeded in many ways. The two main effects of this film were John Huston's "ASPHALT JUNGLE" 1950 and Jules Dassini's RIFIFI (1955). But unlike those films where we learn a lot about the background of individual gang members, all of their little needs and concerns that motivate them, explaining that they are not just the types of merciless underworld, but ordinary people who deal with everyday worries and Melville tells us almost anything about their criminals. Why was Corey (Alain Delon) in prison? Why was his associate Vogel (Jean-Marie Volonté) first arrested? Or why did the former police player, Jansen (Yves Montand), stay out of power, was it his alcoholism? We never learn the motives behind our actions and never know what drives these men. Women are even more in their earlier films than "emotional" relationships between men only. They don't even look like a personal life. Melville is still a very terrifying world, which is a kind of emotional twilight zone, and although it is not as abstract as its earlier LE SAMOURAI (1967). Melville's favorite actor, Alain Delon, is perfect and almost out of the box, if you can imagine it. <br /> <br /> Melville deliberately takes over 140 minutes to tell the story, but its slow pace and length seem to be the perfect way to show the destructive world in which these men live. Nothing is ever in place in Melville's movies, and here's no different, every little detail that seems to be very important to the story. Although LE SAMOURAI remains my favorite music, even where the biggest movies have ever been made, it is the best. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 10/10
