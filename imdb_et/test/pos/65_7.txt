I'm an avid fan of Julie Andrews and I was watching it for the first time on the DVD - the Cut Director. I was very surprised that it was rated G. How did they get the bedroom scenes, seduction story, two strip bullying and war / shooting / blood G-class? Weird. I would appreciate this PG-13. <br /> <br /> Other than enjoying the movie in depth. It was a beautiful exhibition of Andrew's voice and talents. Operation was great. The story was a bit weak, leaving gaps that could have been filled by good dialogue. For me, there were too many "not talking, just walking" scenes ... I would have liked to see the relationship between Julie and Rock so that intense love would be more credible.
