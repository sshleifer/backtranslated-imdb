This game is a cartoon graphic, not a lot of violence and really a short level - then why do people say it is so brilliant?!? Because it always keeps your attention, it fascinates you and refuses to let go! Try the lessons to try and find this damn flight detector, try to work out how to enter the room without the guards, and so on. The levels are short only if you know what to do - until you spend hours trying to find out where to find the answers, where to find the helicopters and so on! And you have fun when you do it! Worth Renting!
