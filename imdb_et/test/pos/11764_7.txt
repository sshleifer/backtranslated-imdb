After seeing the trailer, it was an easy decision not to see the movie. I mean, I don't care about stupid "stoner comedies". I am sure it was also an easy choice for many people to get together, smoke in a bowl and go to the flick for Simpson's boy and a boy called "Billy Bob". It should have been a good time, but the movie is not that funny - too bad someone had to go high. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I found out that the trailer was misleading after it had already left the theaters, so I had to wait for the video. I really enjoyed it. Nice location, quality production and great results all over cast. Looking back, the plot reversal was not unexpected, but I didn't find it cumbersome because the assumption was so interesting. So why was this absorbing drama marketed as a comedy? Did something happen to the manufacturer, leaving the associated producers to market themselves?
