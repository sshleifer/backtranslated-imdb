This is an absolutely correct and faithful customization. It can be argued that the real mystery here is not one of Christie's best, but what makes Hollow special is the characterization and I found the actors here, more or less exclusive, in their parts perfect. It is difficult to distinguish between performances in such a uniform election, but I have to say that Sarah Miles is just as perfect as Lucy Angkatell. Particularly extraordinary is that he not only delivers Lucy's punctuality, tact, and lovable qualities, but also succeeds in drawing the underlying truth that, in fact, Lucy isn't really that nice! Megan Dodds is also very good at Henrietta and Claire Price, which is very influential for Gerda. John Christow is really a rather unlikely character, but Jonathan Cake can still see us see what his women see. <br /> <br /> As I said, the script follows the story quite faithfully. The only amazing thing I found was that the relationship between Midge and Edward really came out somewhere and I believe that some of this must reach the floor of the cutting room! Others, however, are a secondary story and the primary story is very well done. The whole thing also looks beautiful, truly perfect English autumn. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful movie in every respect and worth.
