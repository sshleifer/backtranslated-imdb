I saw it on Newport Beach on the second day. The movie is really extraordinary. The people I was with, loved it. Funny, terrible and wonderful actress. I'm tired of tried and true Hollywood novels who may be involved? David Krumholtz (Max) is very amazing as a confident and true lover of the highly screwed Grace (Natasha Lyonne, who is also great). When Max falls on Grace, we believe it. Why? Because love at first glance is insane and we deal with two lost and perhaps not so mad souls. Also noteworthy is Giullmo Diaz as Hector and Rosanna Arquette as sexual / sexy neurotic, both Max and Grace roommates before they start their journey to Sheboygen, WI and find themselves. Don't miss it, it's something special! P.S. The music led by Kevin Hearn (celebrity of Bare Naked Ladies) is also very cool.
