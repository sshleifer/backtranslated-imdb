GOLDEN DOOR (NUOVOMONDO) is the best film of this year for this viewer. It is a masterpiece of concept, writing, leadership, behavior and cinematography. More importantly, this radiantly beautiful film is a very necessary reflective mirror for us to look at the history of alien immigration in America at a time when mentioning the word "borders" is a political protector. Writer / director Emanuele Crialese has given us not only a deeply moving story, but also viewers to look back at every history of our origin: except for the natives, we all entered the foreigners "at some point in our history and it is humble to watch this movie with that fact <br /> <br /> In the second half of the century, the film opens in Sicily with the widow of Salvatore Mancuso (Vincenzo Amato), and his brother Angelo (Francesco Casisa) climbs on a rocky hill to show his mark on the cross to ask whether they Mancuso deaf mental son Pietro (Filippo Pucillo) runs to the top of the hill with postcards he has found with American pictures (money grows on trees, fruits and vegetables that are larger than people, etc.) , and Salvatore accepts it as a sign that she should take her family to America. that her mother Fortunatat (Aurora Quattrocchi) and her sister Rita (Federica De Cola) and Rosa (Isabella Ragonese) travel, she sells her only property (two donkeys, a goat and a rabbit) and a boat man organizes her trip, giving family shoes, suitable clothes and instructions on how to travel at sea borders as third-class passengers. As the Mancuso family prepares to board, they are asked to take a photo, and if they are painted behind the kit, the Englishman Lucy / Luce (Charlotte Gainsbourg) walks on the photo as if he were part of this family of a family. Lucy can't take a boat to America without an unaccompanied man. <br /> <br /> The journey begins and Luce gently identifies the Mancuso family, finally confirming their safe passage, making Salvatore a marriage to her marriage "not for love when they arrive in America. Many third-class passengers live with violent storm and poor living conditions , binding and ultimately arriving in Ellis Iceland, believing that their dream of America has been fulfilled, but everyone has to undergo rigorous physical tests, disclaimers, and even a intelligence test to determine if they can enter America: officials know that America does not want genetically worse people The man must choose every woman to marry Ellis in Iceland before their admission.Mancuso family unity until the somewhat surprising end is closing the story. <br /> <br /> Few of us understand the strict rules and harsh treatment of immigrants (or at least stand in the century) in Ellis Iceland and when we have chosen this information by diving GOLDEN DOOR introduces immigrant struggles not only to our hearts, but also to the challenges of our current immigration law. But all the political issues are out of the question, GOLDEN DOOR is first and foremost a tremendous beauty, fine photography, deep feelings and a very sensationally written and directed story. This is a film that deserves widespread distribution, a film that must be visible to everyone. Highly recommended. Grady Harp
