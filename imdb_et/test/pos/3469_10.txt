Until I saw this movie, "life beautiful" was a favorite movie all the time. This movie is everything that should be a great movie. A great script, insurmountable action and direction that does not approach sentimentality that it tempts or leaves without the emotional influence it requires. This film contains a taste that could not be obtained from Hollywood and which has no claim from France. A beautiful movie that is higher than the caliber I've been waiting for when I see the handmade movie logo. I don't have to go into the details because the previous posts include everything that this film has to see on the planet.
