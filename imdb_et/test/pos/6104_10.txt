The main point of the film, IMO, is that Joanna's whole life has been just a series of facades. The film opens when it dies its gray roots secretly and hides the used set in an empty tissue box. Strangely enough, he hides it from his HUSBAND. If she has to hide everyday things from her beloved person, she may be betrayed to hide even greater things from other people in her life. <br /> <br /> When Joanna hits Cory by mistake, she leaves the scene to call the police. By the time he returns, there is the police and the ambulance, as well as the people in his community, noting, "What kind of person will hit the child, will he leave?" He is respected in his community, he makes a decision about what he had done. But he never thought how difficult it would be to keep his facades ... <br /> <br /> Great movie - I've seen it a lot of times!
