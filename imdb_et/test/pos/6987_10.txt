I saw "In Pitch Black" t.v. and so I had to see it. I have to say I was very impressive. <br /> <br /> Not only has David Twohy's style improved when he wrote "Critters 2", this film brought my attention to Vin Diesel. Of course he was there in "In Pitch Black," but here he was wild, scary and intense. In the 1980s, Schwarzenegger has not seen such charisma. <br /> <br /> The story is simple enough, but it's the character that makes this movie interesting. Then there were women leaders. Unexpected. Dark humor helps the film move, the effects are not big, but when Riddick fights against the alien ... all my complaints blew out. <br /> <br /> Diesel hasn't done much of this movie that I would care about, but I look forward to progress.
