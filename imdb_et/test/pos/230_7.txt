In short, the story is thin and you can see the end of a mile, but Gene Kelly, Rita Hayworth, and the impossible young Phil Silvers keep the movie all the time and occasionally raise that air. Some of the songs are terrible clunkers ("Poor John" is a train wreck), but most of them are very fun and the Hayworth scene, which performs Kelly's rival absurdly large line, must have believed. Another cure is the perfect faux-NYC kit in the best Hollywood tradition. <br /> <br /> Another attraction, if you think of such things as sightseeing, is a ridiculously terrible male "race" for women. At this time (at least in the movies), the permeable and transparent imitation of male magic oil is here in the most beautiful form. Some men are like a cartoon. <br /> <br /> One little disappointment is Eve Arden, which has such a small role that she has little to do. I can imagine that there are many potential comic interactions between him and Silver - the forgotten opportunity.
