I saw the film at Brooklyn International Film Festival (World Premiere). <br /> <br /> The haunting, intimate portrait of loneliness and the consequences of its growth and darkening. <br /> <br /> The action of two drivers (Jessica Bohl & Richard Brundage) is excellent and makes one wish that you have come across these characters before they were so damaged. <br /> <br /> Reminded me of the Atomic Theme Egoyan (Exotica) and Raymond Carver (where I call). <br /> <br /> Soundtrack (Tywanna Jo Baskette, Crooked Fingers) is great and strengthens the film's moments without paying attention. /> <br /> We highly recommend the movie and soundtrack.
