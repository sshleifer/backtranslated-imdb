I didn't know much about this movie, but I found out that Kane was a wrestler who wasn't very exciting to me, but hey, I liked "Santa Claus" and that it was a wrestler, so hell. The story begins with a very strange and promising story, but after a while it won't change much more than your usual teen terrorist, though the settings helped some. A number of criminals young people are being rounded up and taken to an old hotel, formerly a luxury palace, but is now a garbage dump to clean it for making homeless shelters. The driver is a prosthetic-free man who is the veteran of the opening of this film, where he faces this great gaze that had just killed his partner and blinded him with another woman. Teenagers, all in punk smart-asses, are naturally inconsistent with doing real work, but they are part of some unique collaboration program, yes, what a great idea, of course. Does anyone suspect that there is someone in there that, in his own small sense, saves money for taxpayers in that country. Of course, this is the guy who loves collecting eyeballs and he's got a big collection. There is not much that horror fans have not seen before, but there are some brutal scenes and enough brains to satisfy the hard wind fan. The location of the old hotel also creates a perfect place to slip, and there are few sub-stories, such as finding safe money and searching for babes, as this team of co-workers is evenly matched. Most teenagers are also worthy of killing, so it works well. Not big but much better than Silent Hill, or if Stranger speaks and maybe better than some other mess I didn't see. 7 out of 10
