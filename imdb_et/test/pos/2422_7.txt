I was 19 years old when I first saw it in a movie theater. I have a special memory from a different end. Not completely different, but significantly. I just watched a movie last night and I was wrong, so I think the following can't be called a spoiler because it never happened. Finally, what I remember was that the boy was completely naked in the house, Frances Austen found him quite easily, and after he stepped down, he slowly sank to his knees and went off the camera. Only his face was inside the frame, and it was quite obvious that he promised to happen, even though he was against his will. But nothing like this was shown in the movie. Sandy Dennis was 32 years old when he made this movie, Michael Burns was 22. In the film, he complains to his sister that Frances is too big a sex. Yes? Well, then go with your guy to bed and give it over. WTF?
