I have wanted to see this movie for a very long time. Finally, I just bought it from E-Bay because it is so hard to find the state. But the wait was ... somewhat worth it. <br /> <br /> I can't say the movie was great. And I can't say the movie was fun. But it was good and has some pretty funny points. This movie is just beautiful next to the frames. And the whole cast, especially Brenda Blethyn (someone I never saw before, unfortunately) was great. <br /> <br /> Finally, it is a good romantic comedy and I suggest you check it out if you just died in the family. <br /> <br /> If anything, the last chapter is worth the money. >. <
