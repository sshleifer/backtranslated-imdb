"Gypsy" is probably the greatest musician ever written, so it's too bad that his film version was such a disappointment. To do this, we have made it again, which, if it is not flawless, is an enjoyable and well-made music customization. The script is absolutely accurate, all the songs involved, and the performance is close to the original Jerome Robbins. Bette Midler is Rose's choice, her song and personality Merman-esquire, and her exemplary excellent. Peter Reigert is a good Herby, if not a big singer, and Cynthia Gibb is a direct, natural Louise. In fact, the 1989 recovery could have inspired Tyne Daly to get a better idea than just because the "gypsy" on the stage is just more exciting, but this movie is an excellent music interpreter.
