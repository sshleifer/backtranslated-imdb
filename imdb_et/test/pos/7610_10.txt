I thought this movie was really fantastic! One of Drew's best. I am also a fan of Michael Vartan, so I thought he was so hot in this movie. Why all bad reviews. I'd like to watch this movie over and over once I get it. I also loved the end. This movie has clearly seen my face! I was also surprised that there were James Franco and Jessica Alba. I love both of them so I also emphasized this movie. Finally, when Drew makes a big comment on the truth, it really talked about what happens in high school. Again, the movie was amazing. Defiantly 10/10. I hope this comment was very useful for IMDb readers.
