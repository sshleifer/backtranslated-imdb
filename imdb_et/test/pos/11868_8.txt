One night, the barkeeper Randy (Matt Dillon) saves Liv Joy (joyful boyfriend from Utah, Andrew Dice Clay). He takes Jewel home. But Utah is coming back and wants Randy to open safe Mc Cool. Suddenly shot - Utah dead. Then ... ... I'll stop right here. It's like "wild things". I found such an interesting fact that the plot (written by Stan Seidel, his first and last job - he died in July last year ...) was reported from three perspectives - three men who fall for Jewel. Each of them sees him from different eyes - like John Goodman as a detective who loves him lovingly because he has remembered his dead wife ... <br /> <br /> No wonder the boys fall to him! Liv Tyler - he's a real jewel. He made the big screen bright! He played his role as a 40-year-old thriller. Sweet - but at the same time he was a cool vamp who walks over the body and uses men for his needs. And of course, Michael Douglas. How do I forget her? Mr. Burmeister, Bingo's killer - he was pretty cool! <br /> <br /> But for the last 10 minutes, my taste was a little too much, it weakened the atmosphere. This part started when Paul Reiser (like Carl's relative Carl) put on Jewel's leather dress. The "YMCA" -ong didn't match so much ... ... but "One Night in Mc Cool" is a pretty COOL movie noir parody! <br /> <br />
