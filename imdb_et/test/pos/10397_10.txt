I saw the film for the first time a few years ago and was impressed completely and completely, but its sensuality. This is one of the most touching movies I've ever seen, although it may seem a bit pretentious and artificial - too much beautiful if you want. Anyway, one thing is for sure - the camera man has done a great job - every picture deserves a movie break and a separate art event that is comparable to Chirico or Bernard Buffet paintings. <br /> <br /> Music is the story for a perfect background, especially the U2 between the first and second novels on the beach. As for pain, I cannot be objective, because I like Sophie Marceau and Jean Renaue very much and can't add more to the praise of others. <br /> <br /> But the fact that many people (critics and those who are more sophisticated in filmmaking have criticized the film for the second time with a more critical eye. There is no doubt that the device is great and casting is proud. But it's not enough to create a complete and unified film The second novel (if Sophie Marceau tells her story about Malcovic is somehow superficial and doesn't talk much about the motivation of the people involved - was it just shooting a beautiful and sensual scene with naked Marceau or what?). something and even the voice of MalcoviÄ‡'s husky can't relate it to the headline. <br /> <br /> Other stories are justifiable and are really beautiful, creating many of the logic contained in them. The feeling of humid air and fine fog, spread by the first "Ferrera" scene, can literally be felt through the screen. a master of ions and semi-colors. My favorite novel is the last one - the most romantic, deepest and most meaningful - I think it's the most Antonion-like in the whole movie - almost a parable. The overall positive impression of the film is probably mainly due to the last shot from somewhere in the small Italian cities of Ghotic, with narrow streets and curved sidewalks, fountains with drinking water and monumental cathedrals ... It was laconic, but really touching. <br /> <br /> I hope my impressions and comments about the film, but chaotic, would motivate someone to spend the evening watching it (it works better for a home theater that has someone caring for you than at the cinema). Enjoy. <br /> <br /> I ask your grace for imperfect English and possible mistakes
