"Quai des Orfevres", led by brilliant Henri-Georges Clouzot, is a movie that is a treasure because it is one of the best exhibitors of French filmmaking in the postwar years. M. Clouzot, adjusting the Steeman novel, "Longtime Defense", shows his genius how he sets the story and how he connects all the characters in this deeply satisfying film, as DBDumonte has outlined in this forum, shows how influential Cluzot was and how much next generations of French filmmakers owe the captain, especially Claude Chabrol. <br /> <br /> Armand Thirard's crisp black-and-white cinematography has been superbly transferred to the Criterion DVD we recently reviewed. While working with Clouzot, Thirard makes darker shades and shadows on most of the key scenes. In France, the music of light music and operettas, Francis Lopez's music works well in the context of the film, as it was in the world of music buildings and nightclubs. <br /> <br /> Louis Jouvet, considered a police detective, is perfect in this regard. It was one of his best screen shows for an actor who was a French theater. Jouvet understood well the mechanics of setting up his police inspector, who is wiser and can deeply explore the souls of his suspects and ultimately steal the exhibition from others. The unfair commentary on this page compares Jouvet's inspector with TV detective Peter Falki Columbo. To be honest, there is no respect for Mr Falki, it is like comparing a big champagne with a good house wine. <br /> <br /> Bernard Blier is perfect as a jealous man. Blier had a face that could be associated with a man consumed by the passion his wife Jenny Lamour woke up. Martineau is vulnerable and does not act rationally; he has a slight doubt because he has done everything wrong when he finds that he has not committed a crime in the middle, but all the evidence points to the contrary. <br /> <br /> Another big sign of the movie is Dora, a photographer. It is clear how he interacts with Jenny where his real interest is. Simone Renant is tragically tempting when she is a worrying woman and makes a huge contribution to the film. Suzy Delair, who plays Jenie, is tempting as a singer who suddenly jumps into embarrassment to fame and attracts men like Brignon, an old lecher. <br /> <br /> The film is one of the best Clouzot, a special career led by him, and one that lives forever, as the way he assembled all the elements.
