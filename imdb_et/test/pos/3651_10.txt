Sit back and let Director Bharatbalal lead us into visual and sensual minds and spirit of India. When was the last time you said you really enjoyed the movie? This film is pace and keeps us moving in directions that can only exist in India. If you didn't want to visit India before this movie definitely wants to visit it now. This movie has dance girls, chase and mafioso involved. But it has a lot more. Thank you, Bharatbala, for bringing us into this pleasant and wonderful story. I loved the end. We women do not want the illusions of life, we want reality. P.S. I was Carolyn's friend at the Sonoma Film Festival and I met you briefly. Good luck with your distribution efforts and I'm talking about the storm from the movie.
