Ah, classic comedy. In the movie where the brain got together, the two-minute scene, where Bruce Campbell partially beats himself, reminds me of how simple movies and ideas can grab you and wrap you around the film. <br /> <br /> For years and years, Bruce Campbell knows what movies we want him out of. We want to see wonderful movies like Bubba Ho Tep. We want to see camel roles in Sam Raim's films and we want to see 'Man with a screaming brain'. The headline alone is known to be limited to the fact that a completely silly type of film, such as the Army of Darkness, is only stupid and with fewer monsters. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a movie is simple. Bruce sees the doctor. The doctor has a new idea. Bruce gets bad things from her doctor. Randomly, this is what the doctor wanted to show him. Hilarity arises. <br /> <br /> Adding Ted Raim as a strange Russian guy and a girlfriend, Dr. Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov of Stacy Keach, is the film. Stop funny. Never a scary point. <br /> <br /> If you like stupid Bruce Campbell, you like it. Then why would you watch it if you didn't like Bruce Campbell?
