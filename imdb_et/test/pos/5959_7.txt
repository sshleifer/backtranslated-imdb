Just saw the movie, it's really pretty good. Trailers were impressed by one of Dujardin's one-man-show-show (Ã  la _Brice de Nice_) or expensive, stupid French comedy. Surprisingly, it is not. The secret agent OSS 117 is stupid, but at least he knows it, although I've always found that James Bond was stupid but acted like a smart ass. The dialogue is funny, with lots of linguistic humor that could be expected from a French movie instead of a British. Women and music are beautiful. A refreshing trip to the past, when the bad guys were former Nazis or Soviet brothers, cars were shiny and in France there were colonies!
