The film was great except for some Esposito scenes. I liked how this series brought each detective together, and packed some drawings that had never been solved within the series (thanks to NBC ...). It was nice to see Pembleton and Bayliss with their most human and basic people. Braugher and Secor did a great job, but as usual they are ignored. It is painful to see that it was the end of killing. Memories, tapes and rumors on CourtTV are not just the same as watching it every Friday. But the film did its job and did it very well, presenting a large dwelling after Al's retirement and the family relations that existed between the unit. I enjoyed it a lot.
