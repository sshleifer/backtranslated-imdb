"Third Person" is STOLEN IDENTITY's hidden black-and-white photography, which is the ex-star of the 40's of Turhan Bey, the 40's. This is a professionally filmed story of jealousy that brings about murder when the famous pianist (FRANCIS LEDERER) becomes overwhelmed by his wife (JOAN CAMDEN) and plans to soon run a scheme to murder a man with whom he has a business. /> <br /> The taxi driver (DONALD BUKA) gives the woman's lover a lift to the hotel as she steps out of the moment to chat with the dug worker. Lederer uses the drill sounds to dampen the ball, which he drives on the vehicle's head from the back of the car. When Buka returns to his cab, he finds a dead man on the passenger seat. <br /> <br /> Enroute will report the murder to the police, change his mind and decide to change his identity with a dead person with an American passport, which means that Buka can return to his ambition in the United States. The stolen identity image gets thicker when a man's girlfriend (Lederer's wife) appears in front of the hotel to blame Buka for embodying a dead man. <br /> <br /> This is a kind of plot that the film's visitors have probably seen countless times, but here's a great workout with a lot of tense scenes when Buka and Lederer's husband are planning on running from the authorities to the final confrontation with the murderer and with the police. <br /> <br /> It is extremely absorbent, well-made and has an interest in all the great atmosphere of photography in Vienna, which reminds you of the majority of visitors to the "Third Man" movie. <br /> <br /> It's worth checking out.
