Of course, the Simpsons started a special Christmas "Simpsons Roasting Fire", with basic drawings and no laughing jokes, but this episode is probably the first to laugh out loud and here the show is better and better. This episode focuses on Bart, who in this episode changes Martin's test and gets to the highly talented schools, which refers to Bart that he improves his friendship with his father and loses all his companions. The episode is very humorous and shows the biggest show ever to come out. The general fans of the exhibition love this episode because it characterizes the letters exactly as they changed 20 years later. So look at this episode in the 1st season pack and enjoy the Simpsons early, doing what he was supposed to do. I appreciate this episode of 73%.
