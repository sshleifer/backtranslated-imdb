Most people don't know this movie is there. Fox, who paid the judge to do it, has kept it in the pan for quite some time and then he didn't spend anything to promote it. I think many people thought it was one of the summer movies rinsed at the end of the summer. Well, I'm here to say it's a funny and frightening look for a future that's not that hard to believe. In principle, the judge gives the impression that the fool has a widespread tint. Then these fools get stupid, spending all the time watching their TV and having sex that produces more stupid people. For 2,500 people who today have average intelligence, there seems to be a genius that speaks of "all dirty". Really, it's really hard to believe. Oh, this future is painfully funny and ridiculously stupid, but still plausible. Luke Wilson is great when he drives a military guy, trying to get back hopelessly for a more comfortable time. If this story gets its cult status, it has a number of funny liners like "can we get her family type of her" and "hey man, I'm here!" It's a funny movie and a pretty sharp social comment on American society, which seems to be happy with feelings of comfort and stupidity, and I guarantee you will buy it on a DVD the first day when it comes out and we look over it and more.
