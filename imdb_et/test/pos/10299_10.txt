This is an amazing film: a romantic thriller with a twisted but perfectly designed and devastating symmetrical plot, which is a great repetitive visual motif. All this is beautifully filmed: women, apartments; but more amazing is the devastating side-up of images, almost every scene has another echo. It is a story that is spoken in light, in many, almost parallel. Every time I watch it, it delights me. <br /> <br /> The actor is also great. Romane Bohringer is a stunning woman in a nervous breakdown: everything that changes her mood. Vincent Cassel has a very different role to play in La Haine; but no less excellent: identical and meaningful. And Monica Bellucci - ah !, Monica Bellucci, just to say, she's playing (is?) The world's most complete woman. There's one small scene about three-quarters of the way where he doesn't do anything more than a smile; yet at that moment more than an hour says about Hollywood spam. <br /> <br /> This movie cannot be made fairly, without mentioning at least a surprising, sequential climax: sad, shocking, ironic and subtle. But when one moment strikes the shine of this work, it is the beginning of this fabulous disclaimer, the prospect of which is the whole story for us all the time. However, when the moment arrives, it is handled so gently, so briefly, so insecure that it makes you contempt in contemplation. Only a fabulous trust leader would dare to subdue this important point. But trust is justified. Cinema is not much better.
