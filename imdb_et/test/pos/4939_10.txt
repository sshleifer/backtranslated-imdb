BONJOUR, MONSIEUR SHLOMI is just a great movie! Writer / director Shemi Zarhin has created a story that is different from others and put it on such consistently subtle actors that it remains a mystery to me that this film has not become a favorite of the audience in the world. It is smart, emotional, favorable and warm, entertaining, and in all categories is a winner.Shlomi (Oshri Cohen, in a remarkably undervalued performance) is a 16-year-old boy who takes care of his very uncertain family: his mother (Esti Zakheim) is about as striking as he has ever thought and is constantly bad because his wife is deceiving him and because he is in double shift to support his hard father (Ariek) in Elias, who is Shlom's grandfather, is a bright, funny, smart, loving old man who cares deeply for Shlomi); married sister Ziva (Rotem Abuhab), who regularly returns to the house because she has been with her husband constantly, who does not help her to care for her two children; his brother Sasi (Assi Cohen), whose life is a strong electric guitar, braggadocio female conquests and mother's favorite son. Mix this mixture and the result is the last troublesome family unit. Shlomi bakes them with gourmet dishes, shops, cleans the house, runs, baths and takes care of this grandfather and generally leads to a life in which he receives the family who sees him as a "retard". because of the absence of a school dedicated to family care and lack of concentration. Serendipitously, his mathematics teacher Begin (Nisso Keavia) marks his natural mathematical gene in a thrown test and, with the help of the director (Yigal Nair), encourages him to experiment and discover that he is a genius (? With dyslexia?) And arrange for him to try a Haifa special school. Shlom's mother does not listen to it, but fights Shomi's disabled father (Albert Iluz) and confronted with a teacher and director who finally agree to school testing. Meanwhile, Shlomi is discovering a girl whose age is Rona (Aya Koren), who has moved to a side house and gradually becomes a physical and intellectual relationship. Always in the background is Shlom's grandfather's support and when Grandpa dies, Shlomi goes on to live his life for himself, realize his gifts, find his happiness. The way the family can handle it is the tip of the film and it is not necessary to expose the message in order to lose its power. The film is beautifully captured, the musical result is creative and the end result is the exaltation of the human spirit. Recommended at every level. English subtitles in Hebrew.
