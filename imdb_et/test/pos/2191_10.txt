I saw this version about ten years ago and I've been looking for it. I recently found an original version of VHS and bought it for $ 125.00. Sounds crazy, but if you, like me, think it's one of the best Broadway music stages you've ever prepared, you don't even think twice. <br /> <br /> Why, it's just a bit overpaying for a Broadway ticket today. I hope they will publish it quickly in DVD format. It's a piece of musical theater that screams to see everyone!
