Let me just say - I love the genre of fear as far as I can see every single person I can get independently (except for the really low-quality b-movie horrors I could do) and lately the great horrors of the East have become a big fan. Little did I know that the Korean horror would be the top of my list if I beat heavy trucks like the Japanese Ring (or American Ring) or even high-quality US films like the sixth mind and others, and the widely recognized Hong Kong horror 'The Eye' . <br /> <br /> In the past, "Ring" had stood as my favorite fear, but it seems to me that I prefer "The Story of Two Sisters" - the story is an extraordinary and fairly open interpretation that allows repetitive views, although it is likely that you only want to watch it again because the movie is so masterfully taken off ... the story is probably one of the best genres. The action is also poured over the overflow, and the intimidation, when they come, has the potential to ring you like something I have inside the circle - I found myself glued to the screen at points that couldn't take my eyes off. I am still glad that it did not come to haunt me again that Sadako / Samara made a ring - after all these feelings are uncomfortable and the story of two sisters leaves you with an uncomfortable feeling, but what hopefully won't leave you asleep but leave you are happy that you have seen something very special. But do not forget .. if you do not understand the plot after the first viewing, then repeated viewing is more than recommended. Personally, I did not get that time because it was late that I slipped the scenes of DVDs, several times until I had a good summary in my head and after looking at the network, it seemed that the Wisdom saw it very widely for the agreed interpretation. And satisfaction with finding such a solution is wonderful. <br /> <br /> All in all, a masterfully crafted horror that is unlikely to produce the same "level" remake (which Dreamworks bought) just because Korean content and everyone is advised to catch it in theaters or DVDs when they get .. your best you can. Unfortunately, it is not possible to speak without spoilers because of this type of film, so it would be best to do what I did - look at it without knowing anything except for his "two sister story"! And be prepared for something that probably hasn't been matched for a while.
