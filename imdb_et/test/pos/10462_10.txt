it is one of the best films I've ever seen .... tough terrain ... isolation ... for people with ignorant big races who hide behind their faith ... as a backdrop for some verbal literacy and sophistication ... acting completely natural ... but for me it is the "food" that the best is the actual choice and preparation of the holidays. I have spent time in Paris and know the kitchen well ... whether the cafe's Angels really exist or not I do not know, but I know similar institutions and the baby menu and wine selection are authentic ... and of course ends, which, despite the fact that the perfect meal being their own friendliness, this is the only end they could be. 10 out of 10 movies and should be seen by anyone with enough brain and taste to understand
