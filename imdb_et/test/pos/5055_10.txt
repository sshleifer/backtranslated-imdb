"Passionate Labyrinth" - with the possible exception "Matador" - is Almodovar's best film. It shows its unique personality at its best and the least censored before it started to go into the mainstream. Almodovar is almost the only contemporary director who can approach the wonderful brand of Preston Sturges. It is pointless to try and explain what the film is about, the real point is Almodovar's readiness and ability to take his situations to the outer limits of peace of mind and sometimes to credibility and taste.
