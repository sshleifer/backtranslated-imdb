Man, I think people have forgotten watching the movie. Everyone thinks they are critics. They comment on things that the average filmmaker doesn't even know or think about. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the movie. That was what I expected, so it wasn't disappointed. Steven gets bad oilseed rape to put his views on his movies, but that's also a reason to look. Even more funny is that people who complain about their films say that it is the worst and that we should not watch his films, however, watch his films. Everything so they can comment on how bad they are. Who is dummy? If you don't like his work, don't look at it. Then you don't have to take yourself to this allegedly painful event. <br /> <br /> Stop watching movies with other movies and watch the movie individually and enjoy the movies again.
