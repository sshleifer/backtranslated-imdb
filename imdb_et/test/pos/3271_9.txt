"Two Hands" is a good addition to Australia's movie catalog. <br /> <br /> It is a fact that Australians have evolved from real life, surreal life, comedy, tragedy and love. <Br>> <br /> Heath Ledger is basically good than a naive man. He wants to get him to the local "Big" Man Pando (Bryan Brown). But when he sets the first fortune on the dark road to crime, he meets Alex (Rose Byrne). Here's the reason for the mistake to change his life unexpectedly. After Pando was wrong, accidentally very bad things would happen very quickly and if not to another world, it would have been a short sad film. Yes, Jimmy is learning some lessons in life and no one can get in one way or another, but at the end it is a feeling. Although the story is a legitimate subject, it is not glorified and helps to show how destructive crime can be in normal life. <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger is at the same time Jimmy, innocent and skillful. Rose is hypnotic because Alex and Bryan are wonderful as usual. It is a small group of characters that is plausible and I found myself good for the good boys who take care of them and for the outrageous. <br /> <br /> This DVD is usually in cheap aisles, so I would recommend adding it to your DVD collection. it would be money well spent. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
