Great horror movie. Too harsh and very scary. Thing is a remake of John Carpenter, but please do not let this movie down. It's just great. At the beginning of the film, the alien spacecraft is a hurtling half a century before the human race exploded, releasing the film's title in amazing bright white and blue, marking 'SEE'. One of the best opening credit horror movies ever. <br /> <br /> The actors in the twelve human science teams have seen joy and their positioning in Antartica is a visually impressive DVD on the widescreen. It must be very good in the cinema. Unfortunately, it doesn't see it on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell is great as Macready, a helicopter pilot who reluctantly becomes the leader of men trying to fight the deadly monster that has invaded their base. All the participants in it are very good and create terrible paranoia and tensions that have infected this thing. My favorite scene in the whole movie must be when Macready is testing everyone who is still alive for the infection, it is tense, scary and finally remarkable. I love it because it's also funny. <br /> <br /> Special attention should be paid to Rob Bottin's truly amazing effect and to shape the alien's changing shapes. If he didn't get the Oscars for the best visual effects, he would have to exhaust him. It is also debatable whether it is John Carpenter's greatest film ... surely a terrifying masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Wait for the cold winter night. Take the Budweiser in the refrigerator. Sit and watch The Thing, a horror masterpiece of flame throwing heroes fighting the shape of changing towers and mucus. <br /> <br /> Ten Ten.
