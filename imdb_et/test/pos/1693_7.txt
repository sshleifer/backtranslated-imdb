In addition to the amazingly beautiful women in the film, and all the prison prisoners are too fat, this film speaks of post-war chaos. <br /> <br /> Beautiful photography and powerful nation expressing Polish national character. <br /> <br /> It is very slow at points, but the pace is so different from American and Western European films, which is quite refreshing. <br /> <br /> Both leading players are doing a great job. On the DVD version, you will see interviews with the main players and the team, and the leading actor Stanislawa Celinska has received about 50 pounds and lost all its beauty. But in 1970 he was amazing.
