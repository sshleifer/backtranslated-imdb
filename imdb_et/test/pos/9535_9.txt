It brings back so many childhood memories. (I'm not old, I'm 19) It's a brill. Trains, old house, fallen runner, really frightening landslide (that's even when you're 6), drama when kids can stop the train, or is it an accident? This is undoubtedly a children's film, but it does not provide children with any blood / guts / guns, etc. And that is Bernard Cribbins, who's cool. 8/10
