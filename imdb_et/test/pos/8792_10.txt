I just adore this movie! I love all the characters and I can watch it again. <br /> <br /> And again ... and I use the soundtrack again and again. <br /> <br /> Although I have seen it about two years after it was made and I <br /> <br /> never had a youngster like Jip and the company I get <br /> <br /> understand them and I love their stories. And if anyone thinks this movie is crap, I disagree and I say it's <br /> <br /> full of positive energy and friendship and love ... and full of young people! <br /> <br /> The weekend has landed ... enjoy it!
