The Brass Eye TV series by Chris Morris had always caused many complaints from both the audience and the people involved. But something he has done has not been able to produce more. 2001 Brass Eye Special. Before the Jerry Springer Opera overwhelmed, Brass Eye Special held the biggest complaints about any TV program. <br /> <br /> A huge number of complaints made by the public in brass eyes Special was incredible! Many complaints were made by people who have not even followed the program! The topic that the program dealt with changed many heads, but the message was widely interpreted. The message was even lost to some who enjoyed the program. It was not an example of mocking pedophilia. The exhibition was only a presentation of the media and its theme. Morris is and always is a media satir. The idea that the program "makes fun" of pedophiles and abused children is completely ridiculous! Morris never tries to do anything like that. He simply draws our attention to the overwhelming and often stupid media that surrounds the subject. <br /> <br /> Morris shows how many of his "Brass Eye" characters, such as Ted Maul and others, show how much media every little thing strikes on what they create and build, and the result is just as funny , if not more fun than anything Morris has done before. Using her tried and tested formula, Morris can trick many gullible celebrities into believing they're working on a serious documentary. In reality, they look just like they are. Slows down. <br /> <br /> To sum up, it must be seen that the Brass Eye Special is credible. And with one opening line, Morris succeeds in collecting the entire media situation, as it was in 2001: "Welcome to Paedo-Gedden!"
