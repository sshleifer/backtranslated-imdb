This is the latest trilogy film, released by excellent Turkish director Nuri Bilge Ceylan, whose latest film, Mayis Sikintisi, who was very Cehovia, appeared at prestigious film festivals. Unlike its earlier films, "Uzaki" is a story in Istanbul, one of the most populous cities in the world. But in the Ceylan movie, we see only traces of this great crowd. Rather, he decides to focus on two characters, one photographer and one of his relatives coming from his small village to find work on transatlantic ships. A photographer who understands that he has also immigrated to the city seems to be inhabited in urban life, not just in material terms. In her relationship with her relative we see her as caring and tolerant first, but if she could not find a job, she will disturb our suburban nature to share her private space with someone whose date of departure becomes unclear. I do not reveal the tactics he developed to pull his relatives out of their lives in order to avoid damaging your viewing pleasure, but it is enough to say that Ceylan shows us the tactics we get in the routines of suburban life; "tactics" to keep your private space, "tactics" not to interact with other people, "tactics" to prevent our relationships from reaching a complex nature (because of our own experience, we believe it is complex enough). br /> <br /> The Ceylan film represents a clear picture of what a person is getting into today's (or postmodern) city boundaries, depicting two characters differently. But he does not understand any of the two symbols for doing this, but uses the power of cinema to emphasize this difference. For example, when we look for new opportunities, we always see open space from the village. Even inside the house, he prefers the balcony of his favorite room. On the other hand, we always see the photographer in enclosed spaces and generally at home. Although there are more than 10 million people and many adventures, many interesting things to discover (or are there?), Prefer to sit at home, watch TV, etc. His home is like his temple, a sort of holy place. <br /> <br /> Anyone who lives in a big city and is aware of the experience he is living in finds something that belongs to Usa. If you like this movie, I'm sure you like Ceylan's other two films, Mayis Sikintisi (May Clouds) and Kasaba (City). Go and find them!
