I gave this nine letters to just ten, because I don't agree with pornography so much. Pornography has a useful purpose in society (it cannot be said that I can always think of one), but obviously it does not make a personal view. I thought this movie was pretty funny. I didn't buy this movie because it was pornography, I bought it because I am one of the "Alice" obsessionists looking at something "Alice in Wonderland". my almost every version of the DVD, so it was an obvious choice to finish my DVD collection with it. I have to admit that I was scared beyond my expectations and the whole thing would have been very offensive if it wasn't so funny. besides, the music is really good and I like music. <br /> <br /> Not everyone can make good nudie music. anyone who has seen the "First Nudie Musical" knows what was a stink bomb. Given the low budget of Bill Osco, "Alice" is quite remarkable as music (it's better than some expensive budgets made by musicals). . I usually follow the full version of the shock shock XXX and some of these scenes are scandals (scandals because we're talking about Lewis Carroll). I found myself very uncomfortable and embarrassed when Alice (Kristine DeBell) starts masturbating. it made me feel like a voyeur. and "free" lesbian scenes with "Alice" and kitty cats were a bit too heavy. <br /> <br /> The film still has all the sense of humor. is a particularly funny moment during the Queen's Orgy, when one of the actors comes up and says, "To whom do I need F --- K to get out of this movie?" Funny. <br /> <br /> I am not sure I buy all the sex that is good for you to get your brain out of philosophy here, but sex is human, and nothing breaks me. I really feel it, but I couldn't say it) some people think everything should be sex. I do not know. Jeez, just show a sense of responsibility and decoration. this movie definitely appreciates points with sex thinking, but I will not reject your happiness the next time someone pulls out. I mean, we're dealing with children's literature here.
