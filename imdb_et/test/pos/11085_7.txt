My father has previously worked with DIA in top secret information and he mentioned this movie to me. When I was a child, I would always ask her what would happen if she gave secrets and suggested this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie actually puts 2, almost completely different FRIENDs! confused they never knew what the outcome would be. The snowman, Daulton, really broke me, because the film depicted him as just some of the drug driving forces who didn't know what he was claiming, and the film seemed to be the worst. Bull, Chris is just a man who wanted to express his feelings to the US government very radically. <br /> <br /> For film lovers it's black !!!
