What can I say about Kramer and Kramer? On the surface it is quite simple, but it deals with emotions that are bigger than life itself. It offers many fantastic moments, it makes you laugh, it makes you cry. You know the symbol and you care about them. Many movies fail, Kramer v. Kramer is successful. When you look at Kramer vs. Kramer, it will take some time for most other films to work with plastic and nonsense. The actors seem to know their roles well and the characters live on the screen. There is beautiful chemistry between them. I think the best results of the movie are young Justin Henry. She is different from all the other kids I have ever seen. He's amazingly natural. <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep also has some neurotic beauty. And Dustin Hoffman offers the best results for his career! The story is very well written. It's simple, but at the same time complicated. The concept is a simple part, the related feelings are a complex part of it. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie yet, you are definitely missing! Check it out now!
