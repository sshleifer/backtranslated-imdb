'' Wallace & Gromit, which has gone from attack '' is the same type of animation and 'Chicken run' of the same donors, but now it is another story: Wallace, an inventor who loves cheese and his cheeky Gromit, who always helps Wallace solves his problems, trying to keep the rabbits away from all vegetables, because their town has an annual Giant Vegetable Competition. But if Wallace tries to make her invention so that the rabbits are out of the vegetables, the one who is cursed is she. Before watching the movie, I didn't know these two characters were already there and famous. I loved Gromit and I think he's one of the coolest dogs I've already seen. <br /> <br /> aka "Wallace & Gromit - Batalha dos Vegetais" - Brazil
