Van damme has made some great films over the years, and it hits ten of my books. From the establishment of Mexico to the battle of five stars, this film is amazing. The film is about border guards who protect the territory that is the border of Mexico. Ex navy seals smuggling drugs from Mexico to the United States (USA), Van damme and Scott Atkins give stunts to both the cop and the villain. Although this film was not as good as before the death, but it still gave rise to action, act and movie five stars. I always look for these b-class action films and they are getting better. Keep them in the future van damme. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you liked movies - Until death, hard body and second command.
