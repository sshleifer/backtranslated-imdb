OK, other observers are pretty much covered by the main points of this great little legacy, that is, the story started in the life of Buster Keaton's quiet classic "7 Chances". Comedy or acting in any genre as much as simply interprets the scene and the lines that someone else has written and done before it is completely original. Here we have Stooges, who essentially make the material that someone else wrote and performed, but still a low budget, a movie in a short time, they are doing things well. Regardless of what they say in their films, the real "stooge-philes" know that they have a lot of lines and directions. They took their job as seriously as the surgeon did a great job. Emil Sitka's own words during the boys' documentary. Here, what seems to be their usual anarchy, something as simple as marriage, is actually organized chaos. Each line is perfectly timed associated with physical activity. How many comedies today are such that may require such mastery? The most obvious is the Seinfeld team, but no one else I've seen during the last 35 years while watching TV. Critics are always "pooh pooh" The Stooges or Laurel & Hardy and others, but then again ... who ever remember the names of the critic or what they said? Just look, laugh and enjoy!
