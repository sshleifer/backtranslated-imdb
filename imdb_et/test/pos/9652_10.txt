This is the best French film of the year! I saw it twice and I found it perfectly both times. I didn't think it would be boring, though it's very long (3 hours). I'm seventeen, so I probably didn't get the May 1968 events that marked an extremely important move in French history, but it's not really important because I really enjoyed the movie. In fact, it is quite universal: the ages of my parents can identify characters and so people get my age. Garrel seems to be perfectly understandable to young people, their thinking and the complications of love, and the disappearance of illusions regarding the possibility of changing the world. Perhaps because the character played by Louis Garrel (his son) is actually meant to represent Philippe Garrel himself. Anyway, a great movie, there's nothing to do (must be honest on this issue), but so strong feelings that you can't be indifferent to it. If you are looking for a relaxing Sunday-evening movie, don't waste your time, you will be disappointed. But if you like cinema, you like Les Amants RÃ©guliers, who is the enchanting film of Nouvelle Vague's artists from the 50s and 60s.
