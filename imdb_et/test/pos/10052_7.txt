Dashing Errol Flynn brings his usual fantasy for drama in this historically flawed but fun movie about George Armstrong Custer's life. Dirty Jovial Flynn's essay on Custer from his day at West Point as a reckless, stubborn cadet through the years of extraordinarily generous and partisan history interpretation of the Civil War, and finally as a non-paralyzed Indian striker who has apologized for Custer's victim as a crackdown on government officials and mail merchants and protests against plain Indians unfair treatment. Olivia de Havilland, Flyn's compassion for many other films, as devoted, adorable Libby Bacon, and Anthony Quinn look like the fierce Sioux leader Crazy Horse. The movie battle scenes are great. The battles of the Civil War are short and are shown as a number of vignettes, in which the Custer, apparently supported by only a few soldiers, grabs the Confederate army first. Custer's last struggle against the Indians is a spectacular vision, a wild clash between red men and white, with a quarter not determined by a combination of military power between designated combatants. High Steer, Cinematography, Pain and Great Music Max Steiner makes this movie a Hollywood classic.
