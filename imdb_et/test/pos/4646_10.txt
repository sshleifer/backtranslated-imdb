This film characterizes both the beginning of the eighties and FUN !! I remember watching this movie in HBO when I was little, and that was my favorite movie. Since it was a while ago, no one I ever met. Then my roommate started seeing it and it was her favorite, they started printing again! Fortunately, I now have a copy !! If anyone wants to see the biggest (cheesy) scavenger wolf, which was probably the original thoughts of the frats, this is the film !!! (Watcher - must have serious love for 80's type of movies!)
