Naked City: JWAB does a good job of balancing his two A-B tracks, although I'm not all that loves multiple plot movies. Scott Glen and Courtney B. Vance put a double screen. But I'm not sure what kind of message a movie will send when two flat-footed girls get free of charge from the scots, big thefts and the top, to win a free flight home (no less in first class) - at least from the point of view of their clothing. Gee, I think the blue quiet wall is still thinking! <br /> <br /> Rating: 8
