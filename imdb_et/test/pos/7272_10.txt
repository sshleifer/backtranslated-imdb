Wow! I chose it from the rental shelf because I loved Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller 'Trainspotting'. This is a phenomenal film; it has action, romance, intercourse, intrigue and mind. If I didn't laugh, I was at my place. This is definitely a movie I would recommend to people who recognize smart dialogue and a fresh perspective of the 18th century. This movie has everything that keeps me happy!
