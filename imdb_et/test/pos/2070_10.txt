1. I have seen the Branaghs Hamlet: Branagh is too old, often speaks with a high voice (unwantedly funny!) - not convincing Hamlet and the qualities of his directors - poor! (See also something about Branagh - the funny parts of the dialogues are usually cut off if there is no talk about the mistakes of the directors dialogue cuts!) 2. I have seen Hamlet 2000: I think the scenario is an interesting idea - but such bad actors - all 3. Orson Welles Hamlet is fine - but this BBC Hamlet is the best! Derec Jacobi is convincing - it seems a bit crazy - very suitable! and Patric Stewart - Wonderful and Claire Bloom is a very attractive queen. You believe the participants they say - I think this is the best compliment.
