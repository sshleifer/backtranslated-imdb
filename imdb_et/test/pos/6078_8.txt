In World War II, there is only poorly burned amnesia in the African desert, known only as an "English patient", and transported to Italy, where he joins a medical convoy and others in an abandoned monastery. Among them are Hana (Juliette Binoche), a Canadian nurse whose lovers generally correspond to unpleasant ends; Kip (Naveen Andrews) and Hardy (Kevin Whately), two explosives experts looking for a bomb monastery; and David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), Canada's lucky soldier who knows the English patient's identity and has a score that can be resolved. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> Laszo Almasy (Ralph Fiennes), a Hungarian researcher who at the end of the 30s coincides with British cartographers, including Geoffrey Clifton (Colin Firth) and his wife Katharine (Kristen Scott -Thomas) while mapping North Africa. After Clifton leaves them in government business, Katharine and Clifton fall in love with each other in the desert, which naturally results in less than a happy ending. <br /> <br /> If a person can forget the illogical parts of a log line (for example, why a patient found in Africa is sent to the front of the Italian war?), you can rate the 'English patient' as a setback in the 60s by David Lea's intelligent, layered and sweeping epics. Much more than the "Titanic" or other epic novels late, this film "Doctor Zhivago" and "Gone With the Wind" is an epic love story placed with a huge historical background. You should not wait for a war movie, although there are some striking scenes of violence (if all are too short) that look more like romantic parts than usual (Caravaggio's interrogation by a sadistic SS officer (Jurgen Prochnow)) in particular.) <Br / > <br /> The film is very vague about pretty much everything. The central question of the film is: How far are you ready to go to love? Since the critics of the film have quickly pointed out, Almasy's surface is far from pleasant - he has a married woman and puts his country out, giving the Germans maps and intelligence, causing death of his friend Madox (Julian Wadham) and Caravaggio, and actually killing a British soldier who is in custody in one place. The fact that Almasy is comprehensible in many ways is such a point - he is in love with Katharine and sees the world narrowly in his love, that loyalty to the state (or something else in this matter) is secondary; as Almasy says, he hates ownership. Two are dealing with a rather bold love relationship (shooting thousands of people at a Christmas party) and it is clear that Katharine is more of a mysterious, fascinating Almasy than a relatively boring Geoffrey. <br /> <br /> The 1944 subspace is somewhat shaky and seems superfluous; Gypsy and Hannah's romance is never completely believable and I feel the film could have been done without it. But these sequences add an interesting texture to the film about the mystery and complexity, so I'm not complaining too much. <br /> <br /> As mentioned above in the epic, the film can transmit time and space to simple devices such as crowd scenes, strategically positioned posters and military presence. We do not have to say that Cairo is 1938, but it is useful to know. The direction of Anthony Minghella and the cinematography of John Seale's desert are all proud; sand dunes, sand forms, and ghostly caves of the desert remain in the beautiful detail. The result of Gabriel Yared is haunting and atmospheric. <br /> <br /> Operation is generally strong. Fiennes gives a very mysterious, mysterious, complex and haunting character. The difference between the 1938 and the 1944 Almasys is remarkable; one exciting and somewhat carefree, the other haunted and reflects. Kirsten Scott Thomas is effective as an adventurous female spectator Katharine and Colin Firth gives his best performances to Geoffrey, who understands early that he is not competing for exciting Almasy. Willem Dafoe does a beautiful job, such as Caravaggio, a powerful and cool thief-turned spy. Jurgen Prochnow gives "Jose Lawrence" reminiscent of Jose Ferrer (and similar character): very short, but more memorable than some of the main characters. Some of the 1944 actors are remarkable: Juliette Binochette is nothing special, while Naveen Andrews is good but unnoticeable. Kevin Whately, like Kipi's malicious partner, does what a rather small role can do. <br /> <br /> "English Patient" is not a perfect movie in any way, but for being attacked by a lot of film about the ongoing public is not at all deserved. Perhaps this is an example of how the film's sensitivity has changed since the time of Lean and Kubrik, or maybe people were expecting a simple understanding. A complex that is guilty, superbly targeted and captured, "English Patient" is a great modern epic. <br /> <br /> 8/10
