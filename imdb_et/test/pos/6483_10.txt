I think it's a kind of movie you love or hate, and I'm not really typical to go to the movie. My mother rented a "mullhuland DR" the second evening and I went almost out of the room, ha. But I love this movie. Saved this tape and watched it a lot. Finally, I was able to add VHS to my collection. I've been watching it several times and copied poems at one point. I even tried to prepare my high school drama class for one scene. He had said that we could do any scene we wanted, and just cut off the bad words. He refused to allow it. If it could distract my drama teacher so much that it must be good :) Honestly he didn't meet me for the same reason. <br /> <br /> I liked it to work very genuinely and honestly. It wasn't clean and polished, but it was better. It was a real life, how somebody would really behave and show emotions, not how Hollywood does. It worked particularly well when playing Rex. <br /> <br /> The story was original. Not only do the characters pull their world, but also the way. Not your typical person walks with the city center children and saves them at all with a knowledge film. Just caring and friendship make things a little better. <br /> <br /> The only thing is that even in the 80s there were more weapons of violence and less simple things like throwing rocks, but that little innocence wasn't damaged by the film. <br /> <br /> I think it must be visible. You love it or hate it, but either, it affects and makes a good movie that you remember and talk about later.
