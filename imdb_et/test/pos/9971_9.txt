I just saw it at the Toronto International Film Festival in the beautiful Elgin Theater. A beautiful atmosphere, this is a very challenging game and the last, but no less important, was played by Al Pacino's bravery, which was perfectly balanced with the equal strength of Jeremy Irons. <br /> <br /> The film carefully examines topics of love and loyalty, justice and justice, and passion vs. reason. Some may protest that the content is anti-Semitic in nature, but they should take into account the historical context of the story and its delicate and nuanced way of speaking about it. <br /> <br /> 9/10
