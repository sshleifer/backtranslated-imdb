Falcon and snowman are based on real story. Christopher Boyce and Andrew Daulton Lee (titles), played by Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn, received their own code names from the KGB. Why? Boyce was an avid traitor and Lee was a coke head. The film is based on a real story. It is based on a book of the same name. Another reviewer asked what was their motivation? It's not disappointing. It's not ideology. (Excuse my bad grammar), but I'll do it here. What was it if it wasn't disappointment or ideology? In short, greed. At the time of Boyce-Lee, money became a great motivation, not an ideology. Don't believe me? Then look at the Walker Family Spy Ring, which was broken in the late 80s. The three spies in the 70s and 80s suffered the worst damage to the security of our country. John Walker, who started his career in the 60s, Christopher Boyce and Andrew Daulton Lee. All three sold thirty pieces of silver out of that country. If you don't know this phrase, I suggest you read the Bible.
