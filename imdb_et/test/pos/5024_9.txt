John Travolta fun racing, but a very delightful performance creates this very funny comedy. His interpretation of the archangel is damp, feminine, overweight, ladies. And it certainly has a pleasant effect on the women she meets on a trip to Chicago. John Hurt is very small, who is the chief editor of Bob Hoskins, the owner of the Chicago tabloid. Angie MacDowell plays an important role as she played her role in "The Fourth Wedding and Funeral". Maureen Stapleton is a hero. His comment, "Michael is not stupid," is just one of many memorable moments. Bob Hoskins is the only leading speaker who can't connect, a little behind the wall. Mostly, you are there to see how Michael takes the bull, the messengers and the lady dancers in a western-style restaurant and fully demonstrate that he is a complete free soul. This is a memorable comedy that is worth more than one viewing.
