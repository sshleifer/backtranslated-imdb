Just 30 years later I saw Baby Blue Marine again. I still have a pleasant and romantic movie that is catching the time that has been lost forever. The innocence and purity of this long film has long been lost. Action is above average and Richard Gere's short look is shocked by the shocked hero of the Raider Marine war, who is very interested in any film or Gere fan. Jan-Micheal Vincent is his prime minister and looks and acts like an "all-American" boy. The recent Bruno Kirby (who was a bill for B.Kirbyna, Jr.) has a muscular role in "Pop," a peace-loving, Marine Corp refuses to dream of returning to his wife. If you are looking for sex, drugs or rock, this is not the movie for you. If you are looking for action and adventure, the same applies. However, if you want to take the time out of innocence, honor, romance and love in America, Baby Blue Marine is a movie for you.
