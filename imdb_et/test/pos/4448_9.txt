Just Lucio Fulc's most captured movie, "Don't Torture Duckling" is very well-known for its nervous theme, harsh images and strong style. Terror is a small Italian village because young boys start murdering, mixing confused and determined authorities and a dedicated detective in the mystery. Was it a horrible hermit? Spastic Voodoo Witch? One of the whores? Rich girl? Someone else? Unlike most of the fans' frequent representation of the violent content of the film - I find it much more plot-based; contains only one real memorable bloodshed (chains and tables). Under no circumstances will this damage the positive attribute of the film. Fulci proves to be perfectly capable of dying of one darkness and disruptive giallo descent, black magic and, of course, a nice full knocker ... Although I am particularly fond of Fulci's "Lizard in a Woman's Leather" and "New York Ripper", "Don't Torture Duckling" dominates a giallo genre as a moody and weighty murder mystery!
