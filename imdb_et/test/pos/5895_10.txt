Thirty years before THE DEER HUNTER, this film, a great meditation of the consequences of the war for the American family, both from war heroes and their wives. A truly ironic title, OUR BEST YEARS is something, but because these times are lost in pictures and everything that is left is uncertain for the people involved. </p> For Myrna Loy, the best years of our lives focus more on male stories. Al Stephenson (Fredric March) comes back to a household that has changed unchanged when his sons have grown, although he finds support from his wife Milly (Myrna Loy). Fred Derry, when he returns, does not find a decent job, despite being a war veteran and being trapped in a marriage that he does not want Marie, a happy-happy girl who wants more life and hates her more and more. Homer Parrish, on the other hand, has bigger problems due to his loss of hands in war and knows the whole world - including his beloved girl and his family - he thinks he is a freak of nature. <br /> <br /> The film, which lasts almost three hours, never looks long and pulled out. There are so many emotions that occur even in the small moments that the plot winds up; Nothing seems to be wasted or put on the screen because it hasn't been changed. Not an effective ring is not wrong, though they are Dana Andrews as Fred Derry, Harold Russell as Homer Parrishi and Virginia Mayo Marie Derryna. Even then, every character in the film has the moment and the right time to talk about all the pain and suffering that had not been seen in American films so far (including those made during World War I that did not get into such topics). Although there is never any public violence, all three male leaders face in haunting expressions where planes now live, ready to become junk (and therefore unforgettable) in cynicism. The shop owners, who could not bother with those shell-shocked men who had seen the battle or even worse, work to think what it was all about. This is a film in which JULI'S FOUR ARE CREATED AND RECEIVED is a debt. At a time when American warfare escaped, it was a necessity when the end of the Second World War was still fresh, it is imperative to make a fairer film.
