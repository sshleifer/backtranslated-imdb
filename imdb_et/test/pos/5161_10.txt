No plot. There are no central signs. No moving cameras or close-ups. In fact, this film does not follow any of the usual narrative methods used by mainstream film. But Roy Andersson's Du Levande is a remarkable piece of film. This is a touching look at the human psyche. <br /> <br /> Roy Andersson, composed of several vignettes, gives us an intimate insight into what makes us all human. Perfectly framed in static frames, Roy adds perfectly, but peculiar music, where he introduces us to a number of characters when they do their daily existence. Some people who are tragic, other fun, have taken a Nordic journey like no other. <br /> <br /> This is a trip to small things that make us human. Instead of telling the story or visual techniques, everything is minimized, so our only focus is on the characters. It focuses on the insignificant points of our lives that make us who we are; our dreams, our despair. It is simply through this simple observation that we can accept who we are. <br /> <br /> The faded colors and the deadly pale makeup of the symbols seem only to emphasize their individual stories and remind us that unlike them, we are all alive. In this film, there is no happy ending or light at the end of the tunnel, but you live in the cinema with a sense of life. More accessible than his previous film, the second floor songs, Du Levande, are truly inspiring cinema.
