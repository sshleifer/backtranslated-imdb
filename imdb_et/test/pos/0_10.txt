I went and saw this movie last night after some of my friends were against it. I testify that I didn't want to see it because of what I knew about Ashton Kutcher, he could only do comedy. I was wrong. Kutcher played the character of Jake Fischer very well and Kevin Costner played such a professional with Ben Randall. The sign of a good movie is that it can play with our emotions. That did exactly that. The whole theater (which was sold out) was found laughing in the first half of the film and on the other side it was put to tears. On leaving the theater, I saw not only many women in tears, but also many adult men trying desperately not to let anyone see them cry. This movie was great, and I suggest you see it before the judge.
