As a huge hard-pressed Monkey Island fan, I fugured it to be terrible as Ron Gilbert didn't. The boy was surprised! Although it is still not as good as the first two, it has a comedy that I wanted. I was a little nervous with the new graphics, the new SCUMM engine and just the fact that it was on the CD. But it all came together and it was interesting to finally hear the voices of your favorite characters. I was particularly pleased that SWORD FIGHTING had come back. And the whole story of finding a great unreasonable circle was simply incredible. Go ahead and try this two CD adventures. And now we can rejoice because Monkey Island 4: The escape from the aphid is coming soon! This autumn!
