As a former Highland Rugby (HR) player, I feel I can answer some of the questions and the confusion. I think I am also able to provide some insight into the club and back from the northwest. Oh, and it's going to be a long post, I can already say. <br /> <br /> First of all, people who have said that the film doesn't have real rugby are a valid point. The film is full of bad deeds, people in the wrong place and much more. If you want to know what a real rugby game is, you won't get the best idea of ​​this movie. But the thing is that something that does not actually sit and watch the highlighting reel or jumps into the game itself is not satisfactory. It's Hollywood, not ESPN! Really, how many sports movies do you really feel like in the game? Not much I've seen. I think it is important to remember that the film is much more than rugby than the rugby players. <br /> <br /> Next, Haka is very much a part of Highland Rugby. It's not something they just threw into the movie. Frankly, I don't know how the tradition started, but Highland imitates all black in many ways. It is also based on all black. The film did not do a good job to explain the origin of Haka, and frankly, I do not believe it is right. But I can tell you that each team member knows exactly where it comes from and what it means. As for China (?), Who said that only Maori can meet Haka, I would recommend that they look at all black and say whether they think they are all Maori. Believe it or not, Utah has a very large Polynesian community and a good part of them and play rugby for local teams. I, part of Hawaii. If possible, Haka manages the Maori. The team does not do this because they think they are Maori, they do it because of a problem in the film. The concept of unity and "those who have gone before" is a great part of human culture, and the message behind Haka for all those who know it will support these values. This is a chant led by a leader who thought he was dying (also Mate), and those around him support him that he lives (also Ora) and lifts him up. If it is appropriate to make a bunch of white boys, it is not for me to say, but it is the ideology behind it and why it is done. "Kia Kaha" is also a well-used team motto, even if it was difficult for participants to say. <br /> <br /> I would also like to remind people who questioned Highland's rugby gameplay that you did not watch Highland play in this movie. Many of the annexes were former players from Highland and other teams, but the main characters were all players. Believe it or not, Highland is really pretty good at what they do and quite well in the international community. Some years give better teams than others (this is what you expect from any sports team), but you don't have a high record of HR victory, just fine. One year after graduation (1998), Highland was one of the 12 teams called the Zimbabwe World Rugby Championship. The teams were picked up around the world and represented the best high school rugby talents at that time. Highland probably didn't win the first place (New Zealand did), but they managed to win the third place in the tournament. And while American rugby may never reach the level that New Zealand or South Africa has given, then the third is not something in the world to hang with your head. Highland also has a tradition on New Zealand tours every few years, and usually it will win more than losses. <br /> <br /> Most of the characters in this movie are based on real people and real stories. I watched this movie with my brothers who also played between Highland and our four, and we were pretty sure we could identify every major character of ALMOST. Nobody knew White Rasta. Of course, since it was not a documentary, Hollywood took some liberties, but the truth tells you not as much as you think. The film was actually quite accurate, showing every two and a half hours of daily activity, as well as mandatory personal running and weight training. Sometimes it really happened until you threw up. It also showed a service and other team activities (such as a chuck-a-rama buffet) that were a very big part of team-building. <br /> <br /> And finally the movie, in my (probably very biased) opinion, was a pretty good movie. And I think this is because I looked at it as an inspiring sports movie. I didn't think it would be a pure rugby movie or an academy's award winning drama. It was just a resurrecting film of a rugby team with a good dose of jokes, morals, encouragement, and fun. I hope I dealt with some of the problems people have had with the film, and I hope you can enjoy it now. <br /> <br /> Kia Kaha
