As I watched "Wirey Spindle", I couldn't laugh at what was happening on the screen. Wirey has played a lot of boys and females, but I was confused about why H.S. acted as an actor with Wirey. was 10 years old. Then the actress changed her age to 20 to play Wirey when she was higher in the HS ... but no matter what I thought it was funny.
