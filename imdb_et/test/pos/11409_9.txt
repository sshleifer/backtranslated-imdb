I recently had a birthday party with five other girls of all ages (eleven). All of us thought it would be a harmless little movie, for example Jaws decided to rent it with Rat Race. (We looked at Rat Race after a stranger called to relieve our fear.) We put the movie at 11 am at night and put together sleeping bags that hide most of its covers. I screamed five times, which is unusual for me because I'm afraid of movies but didn't scare enough to actually scream. <br /> <br /> All of us were scared to even leave the bedroom because we were all positive to Stalker (Jenkins when we called him for some reason), we get us. I played an average trick; one was all who passed the race of the rats, I hid under my sleeping bag and said quietly and humbly "DO YOU NEED YOU?" They all cut like nuts and were so scared. All in all, I would appreciate this movie 9. The only thing I didn't like was that 1. There were too many false alarms when Jill thought Stalker was there and 2. The kids didn't wake up all the time until Jenkins kidnapped them and they hid them in the closet where they all shouted like children. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a thriller. But one thing: I'm not up to 9:00.
