As soon as I saw the ad on the magazine "Changi", I knew I loved it. It captured the spirit of ANZAC fantastically - you would die if you had no companions with you. The characters of "Changi" were strong, and everyone gave a story and the Japanese soldiers were not criticized, but they were portrayed as ordinary soldiers who did what they thought was right, as the Austrians did. The direction, the scenario, the action and the setup were done perfectly, with a clear and easy-to-follow plot. Humor was the key to the survival of soldiers, and it was nice to see that there is actually some sort of humor in the mini-war-related series that is usually hard to do without insulting people. What I've read about the Changi soldiers in the Changi PoW camp is a very realistic approach to three and a half years of Australian, British, New Zealand, American, and Dutch men. I recommend this to anyone, whether you are interested in war or not. 10/10.
