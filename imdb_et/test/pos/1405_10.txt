WEST POINT arrives at a dangerous, self-centered army cadet with a dangerous intelligent attitude to the corps. <br /> <br /> William Haines seems to be in his tailor-made state of mind in this extremely enjoyable respect & SÃµprus. Haines in the first half of the movie, up to her normal Silly Billy behavior, should have been hiding her in the normal circumstances. However, the latter half becomes very serious, leading to Haines' moral redemption and giving him an excellent opportunity to give his exhibitions. If WEST POINT does not reach Haines 'previous TELL IT MARINES (1926) caliber, it is undoubtedly due to Haines' lack of Lon Chaney's charisma and quality cup. However, this army army is very effective entertainment and should be valued at its own value. <br /> <br /> Joan Crawford will appear for Haines' love by playing a virgin daughter at a local inn. Joan is pretty and beautiful and especially bright in his first scenes as he meets Haines on the Hudson River ferry and has his usual immature antics. Haines & Crawford made five quiet feature films together and were huge friends for life. He had a much higher fame during this period and gave him many clues to Hollywood. By the beginning of the 1930s, he was a superstar who, in 1932, moved out of his Pattern when he turned his career into interior design. <br /> <br /> Little William Bakewell is actually a molded plaid who idols Haines; their relationship is actually more sensitive than Haines & Crawford. <br /> <br /> The film was made in full cooperation with the War Department. Broad academic filmmaking at the Academy is an enormous contributor to the airspace of production that MGM has given to excellent production values. <br /> <br /> WEST POINT has recently been restored and David Davidson has produced a new exciting result.
