As I said this year, this swordfish review (written by Skip Woods by this film writer / director / producer) is a good movie. It is very high up in my criminals list between Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels, Pulp Fiction and Snatch. In principle, I think this movie is what Reservoir Dogs was for many people - a cult classic - although I would prefer to compare it with Pulp Fiction. I mean, I never liked Tarantino's first effort, but I'm sure this hell loved it as much as I like Pulp Fiction because it's just all the classic needs. Great story and good actors. OK, the budget may not be as big as, for example, Godzilla, which is the Mars mission's avengers, but it is certain that the hell of these films (and many others) will be hit by hell. <br /> <br /> This movie is one man named Casey (Thomas Jane) who has taken up a wife in Houston. Unexpectedly, his old friend arrives, breaking his life, revealing his secrets and making his day a living hell (and bloody). <br /> <br /> The film is very original and quite bloody / sexually toned. So I can assure you, on the basis of the first and last quality, that if you like this movie, you will also like swordfish, which of course has a much larger budget and more famous faces than this, but it is just as good (though not as bloody and not as sexually as tinted). I saw this movie the second time last night and enjoyed it (again). I mean, all the characters and actors are good, though I have to give very big credits to Thomas Jane and Paulina Porizkova, who were the best actors (and who had the best characters). I must also thank Skip Woods for this imagination and originality. Brutal, Sexual, Offensive ??? Maybe, but sure to have a pleasant and exciting ride to the end. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
