It's a small budget, well-run little pearl. Alice, a small town in the Massachusetts teenager who is fed up with her existence, is on the way to her mother who drags burgers and her own work as a super market. He sets off for Florida and stays with his wealthier high school friend who is a newcomer to Miami. After he suspiciously collapses his car and loses all his money, he reaches the retired couple in RV, who also travels to Florida. Judith Ivy and Bill Raymond's perfectly played couple are too hospitable and it turns out prostitute and her pimp. Slowly, Alice pulls the truck to a standstill, as the RV curves along the road in Florida's general direction. Through a recurring setback, we learn a little more about Alice and her desire to leave Milford. We also see a couple in a new light, and their life and the choices made by the couple and Alice seem quite reliable. A great and well-made movie you mean when it's over.
