I found this movie in the Australian hotel room at 3.00. My brother and I were surfing the canal and we only see young Russel Crow. But not the phone that kicked Russell Crowe, we were in the states and almost love. This film, to my surprise, was amazingly creative and fun. It marks inconvenient teenagers who have fun stories about strange sexual experiences, including slippery salesman, prostitutes, and an unusual sexy mother. If you have succeeded in this movie, I would recommend that you take it. I have to say that this movie was amazingly entertaining and thank Australia for fine people ...
