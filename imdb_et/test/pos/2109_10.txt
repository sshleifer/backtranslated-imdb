Undoubtedly, GRAND CHAMPION has the most impressive "AAA" level letters and musicians who have ever gathered for a fun "G" family adventure. It's a BLACK BUY for every video collection! Director BARRY TUBB combines "GRAND CHAMPION" with the cow's rodeo / 4H competition drama, with a touching and funny story tough challenges. Joey Lauren Adams gives his usual strong result as a good-willed mother, but the star of the show is 12-year-old EMMA ROBERTS, whose camera presence is glowing as her famous aunt JULIA. You can expect a lot from this young Roberts-protégé because it is already in its new, hit Nickelodeon series "UNFABULOUS".
