It was very energetic and well played. I saw it back in 98 and my friends and I'm still kidding for it. Every time I look, it's always as funny as the first one. I also love how everyone can interact with it in a particular way. I look forward to seeing more of John's own scripts and productions. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I can't find it for sale anywhere and I've been looking for a lot. If someone knows a website or an online store to guide me, I would appreciate it if I also look for other live shows. Please send me a message if any of you have any information about it. Thank you.
