After years of finalizing the Led Zeppelin video game, the fans will finally be rewarded with what is undoubtedly the biggest concert video ever! This video contains much better than the "Song Remains the same", which contains a decade of performances of at least five different places. It also includes rare interviews and TV shows. The sound quality is amazing considering the source material used. And the video quality is even more impressive. This is ABSOLUTE BLACK for every Led Zeppelin fan.
