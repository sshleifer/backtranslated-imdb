My sister, father and I are really D&D and one night we were browsing Netflix, who was looking for a movie when it came. We thought we would try it and I ended up almost laughing. Writing and acting on this movie is so amazing! Funny characters, great communication and fun moments kept us stitching all the time. I love this movie! It may not be as meaningful for those who don't know about Dungeons & Dragons, but it is still a good movie. This only shows that the films do not require an astronomical budget, and that big namesplayers / actors must be successful. Check it out if you want good and clean comedy.
