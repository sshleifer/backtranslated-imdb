The remarkable film La Antena by Argentine director Esteban Sapiri succeeds in reviving the silent film genre and the thrilling deterrent story. This device is a city that is effortless in front of television, its people do not take a speech, except for a single and mysterious screen, which is simply known as voice. To confirm his power, the TV game, Mr. TV, and the mad scientist Dr. Y a wonderfully puzzled duo to rob voice and turn your unique talent to its former end. The young family and the anonymous, blind voice of The Voice must stop this evil scheme. The result is a story that is sometimes amazing but never less than enchanting. <br /> <br /> This is a silent film that carries a lot of its effects on the sleeve; obvious references to silent film enthusiasts, such as George Melies and Fritz Lang, are evident to anyone who has been working on their work. But there are subtle references and symbolism behind such respects. I especially like the fact that Mr TV and his henchman are driving in typical 1930s gangster cars that come from a decade when a quiet film time died and a very different industry started to appear. <br /> <br /> La Antena digs clich√© plot equipment and overall theater action for so many silent films, though very conscious and humorous. This is La Antena's amazing visual style, which really distinguishes it from the movies it respects. From the hypnotic TV logo to the intimidating mountain range, this film is an amazing visual ingenuity that is the Studio Ghibli animation rival? and all this using real actors and handmade kits. <br /> <br /> Moreover, while style is often deliberate and theatrical, it is still an unpleasant, provocative and emotional image. The use of religious symbols throughout La Antenna provides an additional response to the struggle between the TV empire and the diminishing power of words. At the same time, many of the most powerful images are original, including the hypnotic vortex of televisions and the spooky TV food factory. <br /> <br /> I do not want to stop this review with sour notes, but I feel that the subtitles push the English release of La Antena. Preliminary Spanish subtitles are accustomed to a very big effect with many words on the screen. But the English subtitles associated with the initial dialogue are depressingly incomplete, with omissions and mistakes at times, which leave the viewer alone. However, La Antena is a striking cinema; a visually breathtaking experience that shows great energy and humor, telling a powerful warning story.
