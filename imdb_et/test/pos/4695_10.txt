To quote Jason Connery and Mark Ryan from one of the many DVD comments, it was enough that the funny logo over the HTV logo made me jump, whatever I did to glue my face for the screen for an hour. The individual stories included in the series were excellent and the character development was great. Robin from Loxley goes through a very convincing journey over the two series that he will appear, although his departure from the program was unplanned. Marian also develops her relationship very well with her two sons. <br /> <br /> After years of losing TV, I met him again with Sky 1 in the mid-nineties, and I was still impressed that the series seemed even better than I remembered. It's not a children's TV show, it's about sorcery, treason, rebellion, and injustice. And it can do this without showing too much blood. I remember that you only see a little red things in the pilot film (DVD episodes 1 and 2). The DVDs are large, with a wealth of additional features, including only the 3rd Series Cast Comments (Jason Connery Robin) and Team Comments for Series 1 and 2. The picture quality is very good and the remixed and remastered surround sound is amazing. The idea of ​​freedom is important, freedom prevails. Nothing is forgotten. Nothing has ever been forgotten.
