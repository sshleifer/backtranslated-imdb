I've read "Anne Frank: Diary of Young Girls" when I was in high school and found myself completely in my story and also in my life on Broadway Game Secret Annexes. But I am a little puzzled about how people have seen their diary and him as a person, seeing him as a small holiday, or having a message of hope in the world. I don't think it was the original purpose of his diary. He wrote it mainly for himself, though he did some rigorous rewriting before the secret riders were betrayed, intending to publish it one day. <br /> <br /> But I never saw him as a saint or a messenger of hope, but a very talented writer who is able to publish his thoughts very well and fun in the diary. There is no doubt that he was a very interesting writer and had an exceptional talent, expressing himself completely in words. You really knew her well through her diary. But the importance of his diary is that it is a testament and an important historical document proving that the Holocaust took place. <br /> <br /> It also brought the tragedy of the Holocaust closer to home, losing someone so that we could, so young ... put the word on the familiar face and personality, literally ripped from his young life to his and other Holocaust murdered passengers. This is a systematic accusation by the Nazis, systematically murdering over 6 million Jews, and should not be forgotten. <br /> <br /> But I am sad that his diary is as misunderstood as anything else. When I hope for hope, I have the Bible ... the first most popular reading literature in the world. God's words in the Bible are eternal ... but Anne's diary is, in exceptional circumstances, a diary for young girls and that's it. He is not someone to be worshiped or idolatrous, for he was a regular girl with many mistakes, who had an incredible talent as a writer and who died at the age of 15 from typhus at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. He was a victim of the Holocaust and, as this otherwise excellent documentary has so vividly acknowledged, he was Hitler's most famous victim. <br /> <br /> In addition, Anne Frank's story ... is also the story of her family members and friends, and the Holocaust survivors were tempting, lively and powerful. I especially liked the Miep Gies testimony and I wonder that he is strong and alive today. Hannah Goslar's testimony was also very interesting. And I liked hearing from Otto Frank. But I also agree that the dark-haired young girl's moving picture and familiar big eyes were especially memorable. <br /> <br /> Another thing about the Holocaust, which I disagree with the documentary ... is that I don't think it was just a matter of discrimination, but rather a deeper and deeper one, and that was just a pure evil thing . Pure evil. Nothing but pure evil. <br /> <br /> Anne Frank and the Holocaust are an excellent documentary that should be monitored.
