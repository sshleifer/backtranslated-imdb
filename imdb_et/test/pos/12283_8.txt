This is a nice project that is not outlined in the title. A good presentation by Nadia Dajani, which restores Grace's role. I follow what is happening in New York with Mike and Grace. He leaves, but he wants to contact him. This project is his way of contacting him. <br /> <br /> I saw it in the IFC. I've heard that it also appears on DVD. I like the trend of more independent projects. This is an example of a good project. <br /> <br /> I hope he finds it. <br /> <br /> Look and enjoy it. <br /> <br /> KirbyEF
