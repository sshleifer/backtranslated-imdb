For fans of Chris Farley, this is probably his best film. David Spade plays the perfect cynical, sarcastic yin on Farley's "Baby Huey". Farley achieves a comic gene stroke in his monologues, such as "Suppose you drive along the way with your family ...", "Jo-Jo Idiot's circus boy with a real new pet" (his possible sale)) "Speech or" Glue-sniffing Guardian Fairy Guard Sales. The delicate moments of the film are sharply contrasting with the Shenanigans of Farley and Spade. Even after several views, it is still fun to see Farley pour everything he had. "Richard, what am I happy about?!?!"
