Aaah ... thing. <br /> <br /> To see a horror movie that not only every thirty-year-old character, but clearly unfavorable, makes a refreshing change and reminds me of the distant times when participants were chosen for their talent and ability to play realistic characters, not their teenagers a call to the cover of the magazine. And Carpenter chooses a production designer and an operator who can actually create realistic environments, not over-style parodies. And there is no tricky "twist" or celebrity fame or flat pseudo-romantic sub-platform. <br /> <br /> And I really leave myself the physical effects I have set; with all those 20-year-olds who are trying out mad new ideas with blood and latex and early animation. For 5 years between 1979 and 1984, we saw Alien, Elephant Man, Poltergeist, The Howling, American Werewolf, The Thing, The Wolves Company, Nightmare Elm Street ... what the horror effects of the era! And don't let me start the death of the matt paint. Matte's work in this film is beautiful and seamless. <br /> <br /> What do we have now? Third prize, CGI, former music video directors and professional stylists that make even "sharp" horror movies like shiny MTV videos. <br /> <br /> Now I'm going to Netflix 'The Howling.
