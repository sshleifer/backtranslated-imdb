I'm not sure how it might have been better, so I gave it to 10. It was great - the main woman was so hot - the cabbage that played Darwyn was a laughable, meaningful character that showed the internal instability she was suffering (the driver's death is one example) perfectly. The story was plausible and the length of the series was almost right (ie I lost my love, but will it ever end?). Britina I mean Yanks as a gung ho. LAPD was advised to arrest him, but other agencies were positively portrayed. My main idea about such programs (and also great 24) is - can this happen? Does this happen? Is this happening now? Maybe probably. <br /> <br /> I hope they will make another series, but after reading some of the previous comments, it doesn't look like it. <br /> <br /> To sum up - if you haven't seen make sure you do it.
