The plot is predictable. In other films this has been done several times. You have competing summer camps: rich kids vs. sub-competitors who compete for the "horrors" of typical camp competitions, while kids and consoles continue worship, sex and "good times!" "Are you ready for the summer?" Meatballs are the first (and best) summer camp movie that offers a good feeling. As others have posted, this citizen is not Kane, but this type of film is not intended. The film works on Bill Murray's superb comic timings and classic linings. His scenes with a tent where he tries to raise the child's self-esteem are very good. Bill's lining on the entire film is very funny. <br /> <br /> I like this movie not dirty or explicit like many other "teenagers in camp". Throughout the film, there is somewhat mild sexual innocence and perhaps one or two words. But meatballs are a type of teenage movie that really fits the younger people. It's rated PG. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you have to see a few times to get all the fun! When Bill Murray is on the screen or doing one of his classic "PA Announcements", it will be dragged onto the film. Bill seems to be carrying all the film itself. But he does it so well that when you see the cuts, you realize it's a movie that made him a star! The focus of this review is to avoid ALL Meatball movie queues. They are terribly bad.
