I'm totally disgusted to not sell this movie. Anyone who loves this movie should send an email to Disney and increase its demand. Finally, they must then sell it. I buy copies for everyone I know. Everything and all the good work done in this movie and I have not understood why Disney hasn't rented this movie to DVD or VHS stores. At least I haven't seen any copies. This is a bad movie and should be seen by everyone. The children of the new generation do not see it and I think they should do it. It should at least be put back into the duct. This movie does not deserve a cheap download. It deserves a real thing. I will now send them by email. This movie is on DVD.
