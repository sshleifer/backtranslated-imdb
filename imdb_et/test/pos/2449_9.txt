I feel privileged to have seen this movie accidentally. In fact, I ran this film at random. I made one night at Showtime for one movie, overnight and this movie came later. So I sat down and watched it, and the boy was blowing me. Action is absolutely excellent. Kathy Bates ... who has been my favorite actress Misery and Fried Green Tomatoes has provided amazing performance as a dominant mother who is desperately trying to keep her old school values ​​(religion, family) at risk of transferring her family. Martin Sheen is great as a "harsh" patriarch who doesn't really control anything in his life or family. One thing I really loved about this movie is how he says what happens when the heroes come home. It shows the real damage that our soldiers will be doing after they fight for a meaningless war for political and financial gain. This movie just blew me off and I feel blessed to have accidentally recorded and seen this movie. It's black-visible to anyone who wants a real drama, it's not too melodramatic and preaching, but pulls your hearts like no other
