It's a passionate film. The passion he represents is largely misguided, even for the leading person. But it hides the incredible power of this film: it shows us that what we believe is contaminated, and can even lead us to do things that are destructive - to ourselves or to others. What's more, those who are trying to escape the passion (looking at the medicine they visit in the studio) also threaten their own destruction. <br /> <br /> The world needs to hear the message of this movie more often.
