The concept of marital fidelity depicted in the film today seems outdated, but it is precisely the observance of this protagonist that the whole story is so tragically tragic. It is this concept that enriches them and allows them to stand out when they refer to their respective spouses, "not like them". <br /> <br /> Like Tony Leung in the movie, love just happens. There is no need for a rational explanation of how this happens, but simply. Despite the fact that they did not want to reach the level of their spouses, it happened. Fidelity, social morals and timing all agreed on this relationship coming. Just falling in love is far from enough. <br /> <br /> I had a misfortune to sit next to a young couple (still in the university chat groups they shared with me throughout the film and who wasn't at all happy). pain of lost love and lost opportunities). Their serious inability to digest subtleness and deeper emotional emotions made me realize how many such films and other Wong Kar Wei's work are being wasted on the local audience.
