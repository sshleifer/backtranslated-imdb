Charles Bronson is back to his most famous role. In my opinion, this is the best film of the series and my favorite film. This film does not take itself seriously because the filmmakers knew that all the necessary social commentary was in the first film. Golan and Globus made this film for Bronson fans, not for critics, and it works. DW3 was unfairly criticized as "trash" and "tired entry in a worn-out series." These statements would be true if the film had been taken seriously or the statement spread but it was not. If you take it as it is, then DW3 is just fun and busy, with Charlie with the redheads we all want. The action is stagnant, the atmosphere is great, and the film is just the best Bronson has ever done. You can say that the Cannon group, who is penniless, has spent a lot of money on it. It is believed that Bronson thought this film was too violent and that was why the winner did not lead any of the following records. I understand his concerns, but as always with queues, you need to push the envelope even further to pass the previous record. In any case, this film was no longer violent than any other film made during that time. What makes the DW3 series the best and my favorite movie (not the best, just my favorite) is action, Charlie's presence, memorable villains and the ability to get the audience to jump in the band. The first film can be the most technically well done, but it's the most fun. Once upon a time, Charlie actually has some smart features (though he doesn't say much) and a half-interesting story, photography, action, and direction to bring him back. Charlie has never been more intense or surprising than that. Yes, it is exploitative, maybe it promotes stereotypes and maybe it's the same story as before, but Bronson's movies always and always stand to protect a common person and give their audience what they want to see. Many argue that the DW series manipulates their audience, my answer is that the films do not manipulate us, the fans are the ones who are responsible. We demand that Bronson deserve the effort and, in turn, Winner and Co. And for those who still want to put it down, remember some things. DW3 was the # 1 movie in America when it came out and was one of the favorites of millions of people watching videos and television because they realize that not all movies need to be epic, but they just have to be fun. ********** / 10 You don't get better.
