When the whim genre owes much to Walter Huston, he is also grateful to Jules Dassin, the man who was ahead of him and who suffered a lot from his black list when Edward Dmytryk accused him of being a communist. The end of his American career would have meant the end of Mr Dassini, but moving to Europe proved he was bigger than the same people who contributed to his Hollywood death. <br /> <br /> "Rififi" is an elegant film where all the right elements come together thanks to Mr. Dassini's vision. He decided to adjust Auguste Le Breton's novel, because he saw the opportunity to turn it into a locker movie that became a snap. Jules Dassin was insecure in Paris when he discovered a city that was going to be the backdrop for his movie. Bad weather paid to Mr Dassin because the streets were always wet and they didn't need to be done to show them. <br /> <br /> When we first meet with Tony, he plays cards. Tony seems to be in bad health; she coughs all the time and sweats a lot. After losing all his money, he's going to see Joot, a Swede who talks to him about the opportunity to rob Maupin & Webb, in the tony section of Paris. They go through the idea through Mario, who recommends Cesar, Milanese, a safe cracker for experts. <br /> <br /> Tony, who recently left prison, learns that Mado, his former lover, is now with Grutter, a. nightclub owner. Instead of sneaking into love instead of love, everything he knows, disdain and the meeting ends badly and he throws him out of his place. Grutter has no love for Tony, who is his natural enemy in connection with Madoga. <br /> <br /> When the day comes, the gang will be able to reach the apartment building, located on the second floor, above the jewelery shop, but the owner is alive. Everything goes well and the gang goes out with jewelry. Cesar, Milanese, a typical female man, takes a souvenir circle, which in turn gives Grutter a nightclub. This tactical mistake is a spark that removes the thought of the idea well. <br /> <br /> Jean Servais did a great Tony. He showed a tired man who made the last robbery. Carl Mohner, Robert Manuel and director Jules Dassin are seen as Jo, Mario and Cesarina, the quartet's jewelery. Marie Sabouret plays Madot. Marcel Lupovici plays the Grutter with weak intensity. Robert Hussein, who later directs films, gives the impression of his Remi, one of the Grutter's men. <br /> <br /> The best feature of the movie is Philippe Agostin's great camera work, which took the atmosphere of Paris and the places where all these criminals operate. Georges Auric's music plays well with the film's action. Jules Dassin was in the range of his films he directed, and unfortunately this is our loss, because this man was a genius, which was proved mainly by "The Naked City", "Night and the City" and "Rifif".
