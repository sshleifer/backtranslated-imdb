During the weekend I watched Tipp the Velvet and if I have to score 100 from this movie, I have to give it to 100. I am a true believer in true love, and this film brought me many different ways and actors matched parts without heaven. But I have to say that the end was not so big that I didn't see the spark in Nancys's eyes when he ever saw Flo's eyes when his eyes sparked every time he looked at Kitty, but Kitty had to be in the room or Nancy and Nancy worshiped this spark. Kitty told Nancy that she didn't find her and that she was looking for her but couldn't find her. Kitty was ready to give everything to get Nancy back. Kitty saw pain in Kitty's eyes. I believe Nancy should have allowed Kitty to see that your love is true and strong and that she will not let her get that easy. You have to do the second part and get the two together, but you must not let someone else perform what he needs to be a real Kitty and Nancy or it will never work. My mother once told me that true love is not just real. I'm not stupid, I know we all have a real love where we all expect, and I believe in my life that Nancy's true love is just Kitty and Kitty's true love is just Nancy. Come play the game in the right way, the only way. Let Nancy's eyes shine again ... Kitty lost everything by losing Nancy. And Kitty isn't the only guilty. I'm gay himself and it's gay is not easy! WAKE UP!!! In 1889 I didn't want to be gay, Kitty lost deep and in 1889 maybe it was right to be a married man. Even if you love a woman. Kitty needed Nancy to need her. I myself remember how deeply I loved this girl and I let her get away because I thought I was doing something wrong and I went back to my former boyfriend. I thought I was doing the right thing, but I know I lost her and I'll pay for the rest of the day because, like Kitty, I couldn't find her. I heard he was married to a US man. I even heard that he would win him. I think we will eventually lose both. Give the two girls another chance that life can be very lonely if you are not true to you and your loved one. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Kristen Ann
