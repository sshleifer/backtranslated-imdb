Life is crazy. You're crazy, I'm crazy, we're all crazy. We're all a little Minnie and a bit of Moskowitz. Sometimes it seems reasonable to be sensible ... but then what might you lose? <br /> <br /> You have to be you. You don't have to park your cars and scream halfway at people, but you can't hide behind a mirror (or dark sunglasses) and pretend and act like everything is fine. And sometimes you have to be careful about the wind, because why else are you alive? <br /> <br /> I'm not going to appreciate this love of Cassavets compared to other movies because they're all 100% unique works and everyone's individual expression and investigation of our lives. In this sense, they are all great and the comparisons are unpleasant. Certainly this film has one crazy, sometimes crazy, but ultimately wonderful and liberating quality that all of his films are - you never know what happens, and you never know what the characters think, do or feel next. Also do the characters do not want to do it themselves and do we really want to live elsewhere? Unlike Moskowitz, you can do a great job and take money out of your IRA, but still live your feelings, minds, and life experiences in the adventurer's life. Yes, we can do it in both ways, as shown by Cassavetes. Thanks to God, someone did.
