This delightful, well-written film is based on a New York performance with the same title, where Sir Aubrey (Sir Charles Aubrey Smith, 1944, knocked out) started the role of the film. Here, in 1931, we see him in the very early age of his "talks" and his characteristic role in the renaissance of his activities, which he makes to his death in 1948 after the last performance of small women, which is related to an older British aristocrat who is looking for his illegal children and introducing them to them, having taken them to his manor in England. <br /> <br /> Marion Davies plays with her daughter-in-law and is a training force for her. He is all loving, impatient, low, enchanting, wise and compassionate at the same time, creating an indelible and appealing character that remains in the memory well. The 26-year-old Ray Milland is a small but prominent role already in seven other pictures, just in the movie for just over two years. <br /> <br /> The film should of course be enjoyed by a production representative of the 1931 Hollywood factory. flawless. But this is a delightful joy from the first scene to the last.
