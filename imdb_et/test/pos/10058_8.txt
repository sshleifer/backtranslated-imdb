When I see a movie, I usually look for entertainment. But, of course, when I know what genre to move, I'm looking for what he's going to do. For example, when it comes to a deep movie, I hope the film tends to throw my thoughts into my mind and make me think what he says. But who is this girl? There is no deep film. However, it is fun. This is a creepy film that is a joy to watch. The film has hardly a boring moment and there are many humorous parts. I looked at it younger. Cast is always entertaining as usual. I had a little drunk on Griffin Dunne, although he wasn't a typical male at that time. Haviland Morris also has stars. And here is the later Austrian actress Bibi Besch! Overall pleasure!
