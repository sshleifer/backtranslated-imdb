Is this the perfect movie? No. It is a strange adaptation of a sci-fi book and includes vampires from the cosmos, bare beauty and the effectiveness of the British army. <br /> <br /> When I first saw this movie, I was pretty young and all I could remember was that there was a sense of awe for the movie and for Mathilda May. In fact, if it wasn't for this great lady who would be naked for the whole movie, I wouldn't have appreciated it so much, but considering her magnificent size, I will now be voting on it! <br /> <br /> Happy me reminded me of the movie and watched it again. Imagine the lost Ark or Poltergeist special effects radiators that swelled a fairly decent sci-fi story, but are completely above the top scores. I still enjoyed the movie enormously (just like Mathilda May), but it was a mix of nostalgia compared to today's movie films and really wanted more than it ended. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: If you are a sci-fi fan, you must not leave this movie. Oh, and did I mention Mathilda Mayi young, beautiful and naked?
