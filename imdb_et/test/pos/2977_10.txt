I was drawn to the "Friends" very young and still famous Elton John, whom I saw in the nearby Houston. I had no idea what kind of emotions and effects the film did. Recently, I returned the movie with a song called "Seasons" by Heart, and I found Elton John's "Friends" song, I thought it was the same song ... it's been 35 years. In any case, the flood of "Friends" emotions came back like an old photo of your first true love. I have more to remind you how the movie hit me as the real details of production, plot, etc., so give me a pretty bad overview. I remember a couple of special friends on that day to see the movie and them as they were. I'm both anxious and nervous to find a copy and see it now. So many movies that I found so important (ie "Graduate" "Easy Rider") now seem just foolish and I don't want it to fall into the same category. But I find it and if it turns out to be foolish, at least I can make my wife big ... no ... a natural soundtrack. When we met, we went through the "Last Tango in Paris". The young people I work with (I am 56) respect my opinions, but it is difficult to explain the feelings of the sixties and the films and songs that reflect the strong feelings that seem to be a bit out of date. I can't figure out if the aging process is movies ... or me. "Friends" is a very special, sensitive and wonderful film. This brings back many special feelings that I am sure of. Anyway, rent or buy a copy ... Indies wasn't close to a strong genre that they are today.
