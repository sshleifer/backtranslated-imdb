If you go to the cinema for entertainment, entertainment and entertainment, don't look at this movie. <br /> <br /> If you go to the cinema to appreciate the depths of the human class, the real people, to explore the personality traits when you go to the cinema to swallow great photography, be sure to put this movie on your list, preferably in the first place. Experience is profoundly rewarding, causing diverse thoughts about the meaning of life itself to an intelligent viewer. With Mar Adentro, Alejandro Amenábar has surpassed the best he has done so far, and even redeemed some of his earlier films that made a bit of Hollywood targeting. This is not the case with the musical visual poem: Hollywood will never get anywhere near its deadly inspired human and humane story. <br /> <br /> Under no circumstances should anyone interpret Mar Adentro. as an euthanasia apology; this story, based on the real life of the Galician fisherman Ramón Sampedro, is the heart of life and love, to achieve human compassion, to understand emotions. Sampedro was a telling and intelligent man who, after a diving accident on the rocks of the Galician coast, was sentenced to bed in the next 27 years. "Condenado a vivir" (2001) (TV) was the first version of this man's life that I already commented on. However, Amenábar has managed to portray this man in a way that is equally pronounced and intelligent with his persistent mysterious smile and witty sense of humor. <br /> <br /> Javier Bardem rose to the scene, facing the challenge - with a galicia accent that gives electrifying, convincing and appealing performance so that the actor and fisherman are joined to the screen by the same person. There is indeed a chance to let your cap down and move the "chapeau" softly. Bardem is headed by his great pain, especially Belén Rueda, Lola Dueñas, Mabel Rivera, Celso Bugallo (Los Lunes al Sol), and Clara Segura, Galicia and Catalan, who bring a significant part. <br /> <br /> Amenábar produces great dialogues because these six spins alone or in groups with excellent chemistry, thus showing that this young Chilean-born Spanish director is an artist who knows what he is and how to get his results; his global concept of film includes his own music mixed with Beethoven's and Puccini's pieces for the Sampedro record player. <br /> <br /> While watching "Mar Adentro", I found myself a couple of times compared to him and this movie by Stephen Daldry and his masterpiece "Hours" (qv). I refer to how the dialogues work smoothly and passionately, and that each scene has a cautious timing. <br /> <br /> Javier Aguirresarobe photography is great as usual. As I mentioned elsewhere in IMDb, he has not just filmed events and scenes - he even captures feelings and the atmosphere of the moment, shines in the eye, in the light and in the shadows unobtrusively, so his work behind the camera is another story at once. Excellent artist. <br /> <br /> Mar Adentro is the second in Spanish film art that has been produced here for five or six of the best in the last 25 years. This film is located next to cinematography such as "El Sur" (qv), "Los Santos Inocentes" (qv), "El Abuelo" (qv), "La Lengua de las Mariposas" (qv), "Las Ratas" (qv) , 'A Los Que Aman' (qv), and I think I have to add 'Te Doy Mis Ojos' (qv). <br /> <br /> A wonderfully organized story about a real man and those who loved him around his bedding: not to be missed.
