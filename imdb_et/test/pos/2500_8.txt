This movie was a romantic comedy of a sick sweet cutesy, just a movie I usually don't like, but it was just lovely enough to interest me. It was very funny at one point (probably why I liked it) and then just as serious. In addition, it was Ellen, and I've always had a soft spot for her. <br /> <br /> Basically, the bookstore owner Helen (Kate Capshaw) finds an old love letter. sofas in his shop. He thinks it's for him and goes crazy, trying to figure out who sent it. She's out of the world, so she pulls her to the loop. In the end, almost all the people involved will find this letter and they will all get mixed signals that will make some really funny moments. enjoy it and recommend it very much.
