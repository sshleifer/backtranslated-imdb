Like some people I know, I came to Stingers late; until 2000. Three years later, I haven't missed an episode. The exhibition is really so good and has maintained its integrity for a better word, unlike, for example, "blue heliers". The crime is a matter; personal life is there, but only ratified if it affects the investigation! When Gary Sweet was introduced, some fans seemed to be concerned, but he was really well-installed, which didn't surprise me. Gary could be measured in a series similar to any British or US actor. Sinks change from time to time, but every change brings something new and fresh. Undoubtedly, Australia's best teams are behind the scenes that "Stingers" continues to be a top-notch drama series.
