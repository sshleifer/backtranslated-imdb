After years of renting, I waited for another clich√© thriller with many typical elements and themes to be shown in many of these types of films. After a few minutes I was hooked and found myself in the film world. It's a movie like BUFFALO '66 that sucks you and takes you to the paranoia style and feeling. This is a film that really pulls it out by stunning. One thing I particularly appreciated was how the film depicted its symbols. The film is not as simple and clear as it can be in the plot summary. These are the characters you really care about and fascinate, including characters who should be bad guys. Indeed, there are no good guys or bad guys in this movie. All characters are flawed in a way that is realistic and incredibly real. There are not many movies that can perform this task as flawlessly as this movie, but it is definitely the film style I like and I want to see more about movies today. At the beginning of the 1950s, this kind of criminal movie was quite small, but it has never been so exciting and unique! As for the errors, I usually have very small grips. The film itself is not exactly original. But I doubt most people expect it to be original. The film's editing style can also be irritating to some people because it tends to be a video camera type. Although it didn't bother me and it felt like adding to the atmosphere, I'm sure most of the viewers aren't so fascinated and maybe they find it freed at all. Despite minor mistakes, it is still one of the most underrated films of the 2000s. It's so refreshing to get lucky and watch an unfamiliar movie that turns out to be good. This movie seems to be a direct video release, although this movie is much better. If it had been placed in theaters, it would not have won any awards and would not see much, but it would be much more appreciated than today. Recognizing that this film deserves. TOUGH LUCK is an amazing, entertaining and twisted neo-noir thriller with a real sense of class and style that is equal to enough material to make the average movie carrier more than just happy.
