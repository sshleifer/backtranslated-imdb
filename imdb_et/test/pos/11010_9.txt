The SF assumption is not unique (although it was quite backward), but the focus is completely different from other artificial reality films. Particularly in the first part, it is a complex criminal image that uses the SF assumption to talk about an unusual crime where a forced detective tries to solve a mystery that is hampered by obstructing lost characters and assisting witnesses. be helpful. Instead of an unreliable narrator, we have an unreliable world. <br /> <br /> In the second part, we follow the main character's struggle for peace of mind, and it becomes more of a psychological examination of the character in an extreme situation. He knows that his existence is something other than electrical impulses, how he deals with that knowledge? She knows that there is a world that is more real than her, but she is trapped in an artificial world where no one understands her. The problem of how to think of something important to the world that no one else knows or wants to believe is very real that many of us can identify with. For me, this film's hopelessness carries a very harsh and artificial atmosphere that also supports the true artificialness of the film world. <br /> <br /> Other than the "Matrix" or "Thirteenth Floor" this is a little worried about creating a sense of respect for your artificial reality plot, it focuses on psychological aspects. Philosophy is only interesting so far that certain philosophical concepts are important in shaping and changing the nature of the world. <br /> <br /> Supposedly it is longer than it must be (which is not a problem if you're as fascinated as I was) and part 2 is working on a pretty low steam.
