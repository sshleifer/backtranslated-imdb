How good is this movie? Probably good enough that they plan to do it in 2011. Jean-Pierre Melville, who gave us Le doulos and The Good Thief, wrote and directed this film. <br /> <br /> The film is almost silent. These are men in a few words, preferring to let their actions speak for them. They live by the code that governs each movement. <br /> <br /> There are some great actors in this movie - Alain Delon (The Leopard), Yves Montand (Jean de Florette, Let's Make Love) and Gian Maria Volonte (El Indio's a few dollars and a few dollars more). The film does not shine them; they are along the ride that Melville offers them. Melville makes a movie; they do it better. <br /> <br /> You see Melville's work in ocean movies, but they just get that idea. Can't do it like he did. Great loss in the 70s, but his work remains our joy.
