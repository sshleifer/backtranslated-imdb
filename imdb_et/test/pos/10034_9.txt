It is true that "They died with their boots" give a very fixed view of the life and career of George Armstrong Custer (Errol Flynn), but remarkable, especially in the battle of a small horn. Because it is not the case that the 1941 film, in a favorable light, attempts to portray both the American American Cavalry and the Chief Horse, the leader of the American Indians. I am almost tempted to say that "Little Big Man" with its unskilled Custer attitude seems to be unbalanced in comparison. Additionally, shouldn't the title be misled? it is not just a movie of a small horn battle, it is a movie that shows an unreliable West Point cadet, a famous hero of civil war, an Indian fighter, and last but not least, a man. /> <br /> The film begins with Custer's time at the West Point Military Academy, where his reluctance and inconsistent behavior cause frequent mishaps. During a punitive military exercise, he will meet his future wife, Elizabeth Bacon (Olivia de Havilland), who, like Custer himself, comes from Michigan to Monroe. Custer intends to bring him to court, but the outbreak of civil war calls him. Custer's legendary bravery is shown in the order of the battle events, the largest of which is dedicated to linking him with the legendary South Cavalry Jeb Stuart during the Gettysburg Battle. During her vacation, she travels to Monroe and Elizabeth, who promises her marriage. Right after the war, Custer and Elizabeth Bacon are married. <br /> <br /> At the end of the Civil War, Custer is downgraded, doesn't get a real command, and has to go through a slow promotion process. a small, professional American army. When he starts drinking, his wife intervenes with former Prime Minister Winfield Scott. Custer is given the command of the US 7th Cavalry, which he trains as an elite unit. Neither Custer nor Crazy Horse want a battle, but greedy businessmen and corrupt politicians decide to build a train across India, clearly violating previous agreements. Custer expressly recognizes Crazy Horse's justice but goes to battle to fulfill his duties as a soldier, revealing a conspiracy of financial interests in a letter he writes on the eve of battle. <br /> <br /> "They're dead with these boots," although short in terms of historical accuracy, they are as good in the 1940s as war films and Western countries: both Custer and Hull Horse are played by big actors, neither Indians nor Southern Confederations nor attack. The beautiful Livvy de Havilland scenes are simply charming. The only minus, and that's why I can't fill this picture 10, the decline of racism in depicting African-American servants; Elizabeth's servant Callie is a stereotypical, overweight, good-natured, superstitious black mammoth. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting that the film does not find the error either with Custer or Crazy Horse, but with railway-greedy companies pushing Washington politicians with semi-criminal methods, breaking the guarantees they had given to the Indians. Just a few years later, it would be assumed that American entrepreneurs could even think of doing something remotely questioned, probably a hint that the filmmakers were communist supporters. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, "they died with these boots", ignoring the fact that Custer's overly aggressive tactics, often limited by fools, is of paramount importance to his attitude to Stuart, and does not mention that little horn battle is not necessary. Nevertheless, his companions saw Custer as a war hero and had some remarkable opportunities to bring out Brandy Station in battles, Gettysburg, Trevilian Station and others, although his weapons were not as decisive for civil war as "they died with Sugar Beetle" suggests. <br /> <br /> In any case, "They Died With Their Boots" is a well-made warfare featuring western elements, three outstanding performers (Flynn, Quinn and de Havilland). ), and offers a positive view of Native Americans, as well as negative big money that would not be seen in major Hollywood productions for decades. It deserves 10 if it is not racist minstrelization of African Americans.
