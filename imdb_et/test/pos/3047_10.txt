This movie initiated my theory of book-based films: instead of following the "You've Read The Book, Watch The Movie," if you are looking for a good book, try what movie you want. it's 10 times better. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time in Eugene's downtown theater and liked it so much that I missed it again. It's a perfect merger with one of my favorite music by Jon Voight's inspiring talents, which became my favorite book "The Water Is Wide" by Pat Conroy. <br /> <br /> I am not thinking about the film's philosophy and the irony of life. Two small warnings: <br /> <br /> (1) Video is seriously affected by pan-and-scan and deserves a letterbox version. (2) The title should be restored to the title of the book, referring to one of the most touching, mysterious written songs
