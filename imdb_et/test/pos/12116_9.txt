It was a great anime. It is true that the animation is old, but it is still worth looking at and it has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was a bit long. <br /> <br /> The Japanese film star Hiroyuki Sanada, who played Ujio's Last Samurai, played the main character of Jiro and was directed by Rintaro, who made Galaxy Express 999 and Metropolis. <br /> <br /> Anime is a good animation for the old anime, interesting characters like the main villain Tenkai and Ando Shouzan, and of course not forget the beautiful musical results of the movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is worth watching for anime fans, animation in general, action and Samurai / Ninja clips. In spite of the low level of the movie that the film did not see to watch it. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this movie.
