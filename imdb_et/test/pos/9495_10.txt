I loved this movie. It manages to do the symbolism (well, most of them) about the problems associated with these relationships. <br /> <br /> Gloria Swanson, like Leila, is married to a spouse who hardly notices her presence (although she notices her absence). The film shows very well why she has been tired of being married and why she is receptive to despair without being selfish or demanding. Leila's reaction times at the dinner table, while her diligent husband (again until dinner) eats salted scallops and pulls the bride and groom's dolls out of their plate, are perfect. > <br /> The exhibition is stolen and stolen by Elliott Dexter, like Jila, Leila's reckless wife. After losing Leila to another man, Jim literally cleans up his actions by shaving his mustache, working out the medieval loss and ordering. Jimi has several, lonely and thoughtful breads at home, including a powerful scene when he finds one of his old dresses in the closet. The film gives the audience the advantage of transforming Jimi with Leila. It's not just the outer that is more attractive; we know much more about what a person really is, and we see how he is completely different from Leila's second wife, Schuyler (Lew Cody). Dexter looks like before and after Jimi, who, after discovering the true character of Schuyler, has decided to win Leila. The most momentous moment of the film comes when Jim and Leila discover that they are standing under the brochure, and Jim talks about what he has lost. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth a look.
