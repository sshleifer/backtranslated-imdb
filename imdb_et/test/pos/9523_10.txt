For all of us American Deneuve fans, this little pearl is a bit difficult. Fortunately, I found myself in such short bits as I saw on youtube.com that I was ready to go any length. I found it on ebay.com, ordered it directly from France and changed my laptop to play Region 2 DVDs. Let me tell you that it was worth it. Warning - No subtitles for NO (luckily Pathe shouldn't release it on DVD, Koch Lorber should have - they're good at subtitles). I'm not talking French. I can express syllable here and there, order a drink and not. It is said that this film was terrible anyway. I could not fully understand the supposed humor or funny dialogue. Looking at Deneuve and his cohort was enough for me. I understood what was going on without dialogue. It really says something about the film if it is not in the language of people who speak it. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is great. London is divine as a smoking son. The beloved lesbian mother. And of course, what can I say about our dear Mademoiselle Deneuve. He's unique. These eyes, it's a smile. I could watch her movies all day. She really goes beyond beauty. People always say he's proud. Yes, he is. But he's also very talented. I believed him every second. Her conversation with chocolate and vanilla in London is too sweet. His character is even on the street arrested for 15 years of smoking. DO NOT AVOID! Fly to France and buy it when you need it. Great. 10
