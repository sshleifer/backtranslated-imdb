One of the best-known less well-known horror films in the 1970s. It's sharp, exciting, frightening, surreal here and there, and in moments that are even very wise, which can't be said about many movies. I cannot see the somewhat symbolic and metaphoric points of the seventies and the era of making this film. The scriptwriter has obviously given some good old "encrypted" scenes during cooking. The creative work done by the creative director is entertaining and thought-provoking. A simple but effective end that shows how these things are treated correctly, who gets it. <br /> <br /> Excellent casting was mostly unknown to me, except LQ Jones, who was a moody but funny sheriff and Strother Martin. city ​​doctor. Martin, it is not surprising that the movie always steals. With this voice and skill, he is one of the greatest films I still have. What is an actor! <br /> <br /> So this is a bit of a mystery to me about why this movie hasn't been much appreciated. I think it would be worth almost equal on the occult horror canon with Rosemary's Baby and The Exorc. One loving movie!
