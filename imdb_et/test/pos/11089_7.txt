Director John Schlesinger's intense and frantic film speaks of the true story of Christopher Boyce and Andrew Daulton Lee, two young men who sold US government secrets to the Soviet Union in the early 1970s. <br /> <br /> Timothy Hutton plays Christopher Boyce very competently. He is a young man who is very disappointed with CIA's submissive activities in the alliance in Australia. Sean Penn, as a doped-up drug working with Andrew Daulton Lee, is great. <br /> <br /> Schlesinger's competent and professional direction, along with some very good deeds, makes The Falcon and Snowman a spy thriller not to be missed. <br /> <br /> Tuesday, February 4, 1992 - Video
