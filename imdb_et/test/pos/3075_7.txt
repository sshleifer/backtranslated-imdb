May contain spoiler. <br /> <br /> It's just a good movie. A lot of good stupid things to laugh at. But don't look at the TV version, they cut a lot out. Dom Deluise is quite awesome than the Mafia Don who is hired to kill Robin. All I can say about her ten minutes: it's a long journey from Jersey. You also need to love them by checking the script to make sure Robin gets another picture. Also: Fox of the 12th Century. <br /> <br /> All the bad things? Rappers at the beginning and end seem rather outdated. The songs were pretty flat. Once upon a time of watching this movie, I could sometimes think again if they could have had another joke, or 2. <br /> <br /> still enjoy it. Comedy fans must watch.
