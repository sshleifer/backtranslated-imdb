In Nordestin, in the middle of the environment in Pernambucos, Antônio (Gustavo Falcão) is the youngest son of his mother who had been crying for five years. He is in love with Karina (Mariana Ximenes), a seventeen-year-old teenager who dreams of seeing the world and becoming an actor. Antônio promises to bring Karina to the world in Nordestina, and once in Rio de Janeiro, she participates in sensational television and promises to travel fifty years in the future or die for love with the dead machine she had invented. Fifty years later, Antônio (Paulo Autran) tries to correct his journey wrong. <br /> <br /> A Máquina is one of the best Brazilian movies I've recently seen. A refreshing and original story is a poetic and magical love frame that certainly dreams of the most skeptical and toughest viewer in a unique romance. The direction is great; the scenario is awesome; cinematography and colors are great; The Paulo Autran and Mariana Ximenes-led exhibition by Gustavo Falcão is a fantastic, wonderful line; there are some beautiful Brazilian songs on the soundtrack that bring out Geraldo Azevedo and Rento Rocha "Dia Branco". When this movie is broadcast abroad, pull me up and rent it or buy a DVD because I bet you love the story that takes you to tears. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Máquina ?? O Combustível é o Cupid" ("Machine? Fuel is Love")
