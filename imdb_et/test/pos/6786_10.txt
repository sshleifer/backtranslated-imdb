I just wanted to say I was watching National Velvet on TV, now is February 2006 and I checked the date details, etc. Surprisingly, it was done in 1944 and Rooney was 24 years old, while Liz Taylor was only a 12-year-old Full English actress she is. <br /> <br /> Right of Some American Contributors: There are no Irish villages in England. Ireland is a completely different country and has nothing to do with the English countryside. The scenes shown are allegedly taken on the southern coast of England between Brighton and Arundel (Sussex County). Unfortunately, there is no such scene right now. Like many other places, roads and buildings are built on mountains and beaches. <br /> <br /> So, please, all of your lovely Americans, never mix Ireland with England! we take this as a big exception. As confused with Texas Coney Island.
