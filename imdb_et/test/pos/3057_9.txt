Unfortunately, I haven't seen this full version of the movie. I saw the 87-minute version twice in the 1950s. Even more gently guided than what is with Julien Duvivier, this is a strangely unusual piece full of Andreiew's superb atmospheric lines, over and over wiping tracking frames. Andr√© Thomas is beautifully illuminated, Black Jack is nothing if not familiar. Strengthening this imaginative visual style is a script that allows lists of our favorite actors, including Agnes Moorehead and Marcel Dalio, somewhat odd, full blood testimonials. George Sanders gives a polished object, while an eccentric millionaire (who turns out to be a racket competitor) plays Agnes Moorehead perfectly. Patricia Roc has also understood her role best. The film was made in Spain in 1949.
