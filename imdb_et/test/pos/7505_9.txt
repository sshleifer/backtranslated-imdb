Being retired on a medical / health field who is never tired of seeing this movie. Paddy Chayefsky was a friend of my college teacher and visited him in 1958 at several times. His ability to write has been tried over time and the "hospital" is as fresh as in 1971. week and still something new. So many supporting cast members went to bigger and better roles on television and in film. George Scott did just a few comedies, but his timing and battery are as good as Jackie Gleason & Steve Msrtin. In my book, spiritual humor prevails rather than physical / sloppy. And still a family movie that has only one word of four stars throughout the movie
