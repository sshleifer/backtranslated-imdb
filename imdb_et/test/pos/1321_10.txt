Movies are something you see on Saturday night and forget about Sunday morning. Images are works of art that will stay with you forever. Mishima belongs to the last category. This is something that should win the Academy Awards, a brilliant visual film that is both depressing and exaggerating. Instead of taking a direct look at Yukio Mishima's life, director Paul Schrader interweaves the adaptation of his three creatures to his past and the last day on Earth. Emperor. If not, he will do the end of a ritual suicide that will hit you like tons of bricks. The three short-term adaptations allow you to explore what drove him into it and to present it in an experimental way that turns them into filmed stage games. Ken Ogata is great as Mishima. Despite his eccentricity, he is very sympathetic, a man who is dying for his convictions and doing it. It makes the end that is much more devastating and the sense of loss more meaningful. The three story adaptations, the Golden Pavilion Temple, the Kyoko House, and the escaped horses are the last, most powerful and emotional. It is also the story that best suits Mishima's mood in his recent years and illustrates what really led him to the events of November 1970. Not since 2001, the film's score has been such a perfect compliment to its visuals. Paul Schrader compiled one of the most beautiful films of the 1980s or some other decade. Keep your clothes ready, because the end will be a tear to you. Mishima: In the four chapters of life, you are reminded that sometimes the film can be an artistic form, and art is great.
