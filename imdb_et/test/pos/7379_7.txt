It was an interesting study of both the sexuality of the society and the "blind interests" of man. <br /> <br /> Although I can't say that she was a strong character, she was the wrong choice for this part, in my opinion - she was a rich boy who was looking for a escape life. He was actually a rebel and never fully mature for his wife, lawyer (Rickman). It is obvious that he married him for his money and covers his sexual desires that are taboo. Rickman played his part on the road, flirting with a young man and very fine homosexuality. The young man was gay! When he made Marilyn a personality that should have told her everything. He was also completely cast. He's a hustler written all over him. <br /> <br /> I wasn't mad because I knew what was coming. Overall, Rickman's performance was great, Friday was good, Walker was okay, but I had doubts. For a gay-themed movie, it was average, but not blatant at least. It's worth checking out if you don't have "Truly Crazy" spin.
