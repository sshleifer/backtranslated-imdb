Okay. You saw the movie and I saw the movie. True? If not, there are lots of plot summaries and there is no reason to waste time on any kind of weak trials to create another. <br /> <br /> The most stunning aspect of the film is undoubtedly the performance of two young men and a young lady. Their emotional honesty was as convincing as not seen in recent months. I found that I laughed, cried, and wrinkled with them, and that says a lot, because I'm often called jade and cynical jerk. <br /> <br /> As you might expect, this is a story with clich√©s. and I think it's a picture of the Achilles' heel. It's the story we've all seen before; we all know how it ends when they introduce Rory. Although you do not know the exact mechanics, you know that it is a transformative friendship, a bittersweet romance, and a gut. If it wasn't for strong casting and control, this movie wouldn't be more than a complex, which is eighty percent of the Hallmark Channel schedule.
