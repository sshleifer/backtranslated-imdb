It reaches everyone who drives them in the black desert, with thoughts and feelings. A brutal but beautiful world explored through sharp layers of memories and sound and score. The landscape develops its personality in parallel with the inner geographies of all three characters, when their stories have emerged. The majesty of lost love, unknown fear and emptiness through the openness of this destruction. Three false souls are struggling to find such a negative space. Drama is convincing. James Franco and his co-stars give good performances. Naive schoolboy, suicidal blonde, obsolete auto thief - all approaching unexpected twists. Together they create a portrait of an explosive, broken love that involuntarily comes into contact with the most difficult forms of illness and illusion - the darkness of human emotions.
