I've read all of Jane Austen's novels in good time every year, every year, because I was 9 years old and got my collections on the birthday of Modern Library. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie for my romance and music, which remained ghostly in my head. It was, of course, an interpretation, not Emma or mind and sensitivity, but something quite different and something Catherine herself wanted. And oh that lucky Henry would love it! It was Catherine's imagination, Henry, and she is a romantic hero, whom she read in her novels, and promised to us by practical Jane Austen, who at first says that unlikely Catherine is indeed one. I don't know if Jane was completely satirical in her novel. Maybe he can also imagine such Henry. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen the film for years, at least a decade. But I have missed that time.
