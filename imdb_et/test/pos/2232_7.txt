Tener's this on the Turner Classic just because it was a precursor and it seemed interesting. When I looked at the look, I noticed that "criticism" gave him one and a half stars on a four-star scale. I started to look terrible - even old movies can be bad movies - but I started to get a quick story and Mary Astor's performance because the business brain is easy for the salesman's success. Not really a big movie - too predictable - but definitely better than advertised. And I would have liked to see Ricardo Cortez more than a man who appreciates Mary but does not give up her rich woman. I would advise you to look at it in order to understand Astor and what long way we are, baby.
