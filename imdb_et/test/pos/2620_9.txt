This Charmed episode changed everything! The exhibition ends in the third season and the whole hell is open in this episode. Charmed brings to the manor Innocent named Dr. Griffiths, which protects him from Shax, The Sources assassin. When Shax attacks, he explodes the tornado and then shells his demon skin. He explodes Prue threw a wall that strikes her and kills her virtually. Then Piper explodes to the left of the wall. Phoebe comes from the attic and says that before the Shax killer destroys the incoming doctor. But being under one power, she just wounds her. Leo comes to heal other sisters and Prue wants to find Shax and destroy her real. Meanwhile, Phoebe is in the underworld who is trying to find Cole. When Prue and Piper go to the street to find a demon, the demon finds them. After their battle, witches realize that the camera is trying everything! When they return to the mansion, trying to fight the media and after they won Shax, the wizard Piper is gone. Prue uses her telecine to move out of people so she gets to the hospital. But they get late and Piper dies. And just as Prue starts shooting, the time comes for them to bring Dr Griffiths to the mansion. The effort blows in and breaks Prue and Piper. But Phoebe is still in the underworld, so Shax kills the doctor and explodes out of the mansion. When Leo finally comes, he can't heal Prue. Prue is dead and so is the power of the Three. To date. Personally. this episode was sad. Prue was imprisoned by all of them. I would love my telecine power. I really don't think Phoebe should go underground, because if he didn't, Shax Prue wouldn't kill him. But Paige brings back three kinds of strength and I'm happy with the success of the play
