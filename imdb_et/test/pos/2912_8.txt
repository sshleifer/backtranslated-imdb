If this movie gets right, it will really be right. And if it goes wrong ... I'd say the complete 3/4 movie is great. I can even isolate a bad bit. It's all about romance. Everything you need to know about it is said in the first five minutes, but it is shrinking at about the age of 30. I would recommend skipping this section. It does nothing but explain his exile. It should have been a small plot that quickly displaces itself. Fortunately, the period is about 0-30 to 1: 00-2: 19 (end) great. <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot of great performances and just as terrible. . Like everything else in this movie, the actor is either perfect or terrible. Peter Ustinov is a narrow one-eyed slave at Kaptah. This is one of his best productions, with his role in Spartacus. Victor Mature as an ambitious Horemheb is also perfect. Again, one of his best roles. Jean Simmons is wasted because our hero John Carradine loves perfect love as a philosophical intimidator; and Michael Wilding is great as Akhnaton, an idealistic Pharaoh who tries to bring peace and monotheism to Egypt only to see that he is falling apart because of his unwillingness to fight. Now bad. Edmund Purdom, when Sinuhe has unfortunately failed. It is twice as unfortunate as it is the main character. The whole movie comes up around him. He actually does pretty good as a disappointed refugee and wise man. This is due to its very limited scope. He seems to be unable to pass on his words. This is especially evident with love scenes that are uncomfortable. He spends the film on an old man of the last half, a performance where he is decent enough. He has a perfect voice for character. The less Bella Darvi was told about Nefer, the fraudulent Babylonian woman, the better. <br /> <br /> Costumes and kits are great. This is the only movie I know of trying to portray life in Egypt that was not overshadowed by Jews or Romans. The film takes place in the 14th century B.C. that is before Exodus. The only monothe is Pharaoh Akhenaten and his followers. With religious zeal, there is just as strong an element that can be found in most epics, but it is done differently and it only appears at the end. An interesting note: if Akhenaten is followed by a spiritual Horemheb, the film skips the most famous pharaoh: Tutankhamen. It would seem that the strange thing that could be done with this name would increase film awareness. <br /> <br /> Warning: This is an 1950 epic film. If you don't like this type of thing, don't expect it to be different. It's different, but it's still epic. I appreciate this movie and appreciate what he did and what he was trying to do. This is a movie that should be better remembered than it is.
