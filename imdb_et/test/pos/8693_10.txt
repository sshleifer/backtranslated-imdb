This is an extraordinary film. It's part of the comedy, part of the drama, part of the arbitration. The dialogue is subtle. Most of the actors and actors were very famous for their time and good reason. You probably know someone, even if you don't usually watch older movies. They are also everybody in their talent role. <br /> <br /> Another change in user comments is that two people, not one, are reported to be killed in an accident. Perhaps the two misfortunes reflect what the writer considers important in life. The film is too interesting to worry about who it is until it happens. <br /> <br /> The story is before its time, but it does not lose the quality of the older movie. It took time and effort to refine the camera's view and soundtrack, which is forgotten by modern filmmakers.
