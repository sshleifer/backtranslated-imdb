Epic early film, directed by D.W. Griffith. Mae Marsh, her little sister and their dogs are orphaned - they have to live with their uncle. With his trainer, the young couple Lillian Gish and Robert Harron are celebrating the birth of their first child. The coach arrives at Elderbush Gluch. The Marsh uncle tells him he can't keep the dogs and they're out. Indians are nearby; and, Indians love to eat dog meat (no jokes?). These Indians are hungry! Lionel Barrymore is delighted by Mrs Marsh, who wants to help her recover her retreated dogs. The rescue of puppies saves the Indian language, resulting in a "Cowboys vs Indians" confrontation. but reliable Griffith performers start playing their hands and the story is too natural. Many Griffith elements are in place - some good and some bad. "Elderbush Gluch's Battle" foresees a later epic "birth of a nation". <br /> <br /> ******* Battle of Elderbush Gulch (3/28/14) D.W. Griffith ~ Mae Marsh, Robert Harron, Lillian Gish
