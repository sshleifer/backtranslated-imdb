A very moving and thought-provoking film that raises issues of mental health, terminal illness and euthanasia. Sound too heavy? It is a bit, but it is dealt with realistically straightforward when it comes to the changes that the family has to deal with. This is a positive story of life and responsibility that is not amazing with the subject. <br /> <br /> Afterlife is nowadays a beautifully crafted and designed film that deals with modern issues. It is a distinctive, amazing film with strong casting and some very good performances. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is not a movie that always works well in the cash register.
