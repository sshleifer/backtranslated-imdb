"When I die, it bursts me. And if they don't, what's the difference? Who's fucking fucking?" Thus, this philosophy (or the lack of a lack) is one and all of this in less than the classic but still fun Sergio Leone's "dollar trilogy" spinoff. <br /> <br /> In the home screen, three obviously evil armed forces are flying to the western city and threatening intimidating scary all-perverse people who hide in their homes. A remarkable observer observes that each of these three has a striking resemblance to Leone 'For A Little Dollars More. Eastwood's ponchos are one man, one in Lee Van Cleef's black suit, and one seems to be like Gian Marie Volonte's indio. But this movie doesn't touch them. In the past, they travel to the city if someone is even cooler than they are, a mysterious gray hunter, just known as a Stranger. <br /> <br /> No. this is a completely different story. <br /> <br /> Obviously copying Leone's good, bad and foolish, three gunmen are fighting for hidden treasure again. Again, there is a bounty hunter and a Mexican bandit. The Stranger (George Hilton) is a supercharged wage hunter who wants to dress people as a priest. He's got the reward from Monetero (Gilbert Roland). But if the Monetero gang steals three hundred thousand gold coins, Stranger goes aside from his usual job line. <br /> <br /> To round the trio, Edd Byrne is a corrupt manager at Clayton. He also wants money for himself. But after the money is hidden, the only person who knows where he gets. Now the only hiding place is the only medallion that shows the family branch. The game is too treasured before anyone else does it. And every gun can play. <br /> <br /> With abundant weapons, fists, and double crosses, this action takes these three for the ultimate hanging, triple drawing for the hidden treasure area. Bad and ugly - but twisted. <br /> <br /> This movie is, of course, not as good as Leone's movies, but ultimately, who's fucking fucking? This movie is fun - 60s nihilism, spaghetti in Western style. There are no rules, no permanent loyalty, no right or wrong - just treasure and whatever it is. And while the film is not classic, it's definitely the end. Hey, maybe we can all come together with a hundred thousand pieces. <br /> <br /> If you like spaghetti western, check it out. It's fast, furious and worthwhile.
