This movie is amazing, although it is not perfect according to Hollywood standards, it includes a gentle look at the wide gap between rich and poor, black and white, which is true in many parts of the world. It deals with the public with pups, while giving real images of social problems. Children are beautiful, paying special attention to a young man playing Siphot. Indeed, the friendships that are being developed are true, everyone can be associated with the choice of their youth. The influence of adults is interesting - it seems to have been taken from real life experiences because there are many conversations and interactions, as the child would remember. I highly recommend this movie.
