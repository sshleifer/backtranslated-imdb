Chucky is back, but this time he's not scary (much), but he's funny! <br /> <br /> If Chucky is alive (doll, of course), bringing back his old trailer garbage to a girlfriend, Tiffany, he will kill him right away and make him sleep. Tiffany and Chucky are now two high school graduates - an epek !! <br /> <br /> Don't miss this movie - it's a lot of fun. It's frightening, funny, weird, crazy and stupid all in one! <br /> <br /> My Rating: 9/10.
