I watch this movie at the beginning of every summer and it doesn't stop me anymore. Here, the jokes are packed into every dialogue that gives you more than a few Simpson episodes. Some jokes fall on the plane or just make a small blow, but others leave you rolling and then there are those who stick to your brain ... "The audience is now deaf." <br /> <br /> The video knows it's a video and does nothing else. It's easy to sit down and let the humor bombing begin. A good combination of slapstick, pop culture and language-in-cheek comedy ensures that something is for everyone. When I first saw this video, I was in sixth grade and I have to admit that it is still fun to start college. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie to watch in the summer, much like you could watch "It's a wonderful life" at Christmas or "Ten Commandments" for Easter / Passover. More than that, it's just funny as hell.
