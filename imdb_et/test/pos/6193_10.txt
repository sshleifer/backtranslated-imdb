amazing real drama, there is still no drama that has frightened me, like, for example, characters are not your typical Islamic terrorist, you have a blond, hairy, blue-eyed man who is as stupid as he sees, he is a transformed Muslim . A well-respected businessman who pretends to be a Jew and a Frenchman who has become Islam but has clearly taken the word of the Quran to a whole new level. The plot hero is Darwyn, a secret FBI agent who has invaded the terrorist cell and has to do all terrible divine things to prevent him from discovering. The first episode is small to follow. Although it is Islamic terrorists, drama is a unique opportunity to point out that not all Muslims are extremists comforting people fighting racism, given that half of terrorist groups are Islamic transformers, it makes you think they may be who is afraid. The coolest drama I've ever seen. The reason for this is why you never know who your friends, your spouse or your neighbors really are. Terrorists can be everyone, anywhere, anytime.
