I enjoyed it. There you go, I told you again. I even bought this movie on DVD and enjoyed it a few times. Call me old-fashioned, but I prefer movies like Die Hard 4 that hold the box and get critical recognition just because you have an old man who saves America. Van Damme is moving well for his age (47 I think), giving kicks a resemblance to Kickboxer. If you like old school activities and explosions, this is the movie to watch. This is one of Van Damme's best works. <br /> <br /> The Van Damme and Steven Seagal films are published in a theater where I live, so I never miss the chance to watch the stars of our old schools on the big screen.
