Lush Cinematography, Beautifully Written and Edited, by John Boorman's Beyond Rangoon is a must-see for anyone interested in world politics and a personal transformation arc. It intertwines a personal and political story that still haunts me, opening my eyes to the frequency. The story is captivating, and the inner and outer travel takes place in a careful and delicate manner, both in cinema and in the story. I watched this movie at least six times and it's really controllable. This is especially important today, given the world events. Check it out, you won't regret it! BTW, NetFlix doesn't do it yet, but you can ask them to do it.
