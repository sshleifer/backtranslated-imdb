Here is a much less well-known 50's sci-fi with a slightly different twist. Atomic scientists who have been abducted and kept for the redemption of the Father's mysteries. <br /> <br /> This is a tightly rolled atomic sci-fi thriller that has great product values ​​and is above average, even a boy. The atomic city actually has a movie feeling, unlike the other 50 sci-fi of that time that came out more like a TV show episode. <br /> <br /> The atomic city was also actually assigned for the Academic Award for the best scenario - how many of the 50 sci-fi can be awarded to the candidate? <br /> <br /> Great pace, close direction and some great locations in "real" Los Alam city New Mexico makes it a worthwhile yacht. The collections in circulation are higher than average transfer values, which makes Atomic Man with an excellent double function! <br /> <br /> Recommended.
