This is still a simple episode ad after all the 11th season episodes (except Imaginationland's trilogy) that smiled the most, definitely my favorite for the 11th season. A toy store is a child with Tourette syndrome and a new idea comes to Cartman. You can imagine that Cartmanil is now Tourette's syndrome and it's great because when Kyle learns about it, he's like "he's fake." Cartman is definitely under fire, saying what he wants for teachers, principal, anyone. On the other hand, we have Kyle, who is currently intolerant, basically saying that Cartman was forged to meet with Tourette's syndrome to let him see that Tourette's syndrome is real and is great because Kyle is similar. maybe someone is disappointed to get the Tourette fun, in short Kyle couldn't explain that Cartman was fake. Probably this is the favorite scene of this episode when Cartman is with Kyle's family, but immediately after this scene another child burst that Cartman is just counterfeit, the child with Tourette's toy shop, Cartman basically told this kid: "No not "t Tourette's fantastic." But saying what he wants and is for everyone is a brave boy for Cartman at first, his general plan: keeping national television to say something he wants ("people call it a great TV, they give apparently me Emmy "- fantastic, this episode uses the word" s *** "26 times and is definitely not all. South Park won Emmy like a month or so before the episode aired. But here's the twist, Cartman basically removed all the wall walls , he says everything without thinking, so we hear from Cartman that he is damp at his night, now Cartman is not fun and he is like "I can't check what I'm saying" a person with him is like "well, of course, you can't control what you say, you have a Tourette" so Cartman is like "my tourette has got worse before I just kindly missed things that the Jews are sheep and things, but now it is really bad. Since Chris Hansen and Predator, there are things that really happened to the pervers here with more perverts, Kyle and Thomas were behind to stop Cartman, Kyle ends with Cartman rescuer! Fantastic! <br /> <br /> TSA VOICE CONCERN Over South Park October 3 Episode <br /> <br /> On Wednesday, October 3, the Comedy Central cable network incites animated series "South Park", one of the young characters, Cartman , get Tourette's syndrome. Given the nature of this program, we hope that it is offensive and unknown to people in TS and that we collect a number of speeches and emails from our members and the TS community. <br /> <br /> We have already taken some of the advantages of strikes, such as the Comedy Central's atmosphere to present our public service announcement (comedian Richard Lewis) during or after the exhibition. In addition, when an episode appears and we can see exactly how TS is depicted, we can respond to the specific problems and problems we have with the display writers. <br /> <br /> "We are actually surprised that the creators were so long to use TS as a comedy feed in this program because no disability, illness, or controversial topic has any limits on them," said TSA President, Judit Ungar. <br /> <br /> "We always see TS (good and bad) images as an opportunity for awareness and education, and showing that size and popularity is certainly no exception and gives TSA the opportunity to spread factual information about the disorder," said Tracy Colletti - Flynn, Head of Public Relations and Communications at TSA. <br /> <br /> We will make an official statement on this site with the TSA response to the program after the exhibitions appear. <br /> <br /> TSA RESPONDS to "South Park" episode > <br /> Unfortunately, as has been the case with too many media outlets for Tourette's Syndrome (TS), South Park's season opening ("Le Petit Tourette," 10-3-07 ") is a more persistent myth that most TS's affected languages ​​are inadvertently wrong languages. In fact, 85-90% of TS people do not experience this tragically socially stigmatizing symptom (medically named copolalia). For viewers who have not experienced the symptoms of this neurological disorder, could not be misleading to take the message to be clearer? if you cursed, you don't have a TS. <br /> <br /> Despite our preheating, we admit that the episode was surprisingly well researched. Despite the fact that for the attentive viewer the coprollals have been highly emphasized, a surprising amount of accurate information was available. The scripted contribution of the parents, neurologist, peers, and "TS child support group" therapy was all smart devices for communicating these facts to the public. "Undoubtedly, this South Park episode has increased national awareness of TS. Nevertheless, we are very concerned that schoolchildren with TS are mocking and even being bullied by unknown peers who have seen the program," said TSA Judit, President of Hungary. "We understand that the satirical parodies of writers have not saved any groups for more than ten years, be they celebrities, disabled or political persons. The fact that TS was a popular TV show proves that the public is so much more obviously this increased awareness, what we're too hard to do is to be a double-edged sword from time to time. <br /> <br /> Before inciting, TSA contacted program managers and we'll contact them again, maybe we will be able to make it a positive awareness-raising opportunity.
