LIFEFORCE was one of Cannon's biggest flops. It mostly got bad comments and did nothing to help director Tobe Hooper's career after Spielberg / POLTERGEIST conflict. All this is regrettable because LIFEFORCE is really a great movie. It's extremely entertaining, moving at a fast pace, and includes some ultra-high-end trends, productions, shows, and special effects that ever explode across the screen! It must be strange on paper: Manufacturers of THE DELTA FORCE, Screenwriter of ALIEN, The Director of The Timeline MASSACRE, TIFFANY'S BREAKFAST Composer, STAR WARS Special Effect Wizards ... Viewers weren't ready for this demented workout in strange ways. <br /> <br /> What else do you want? We have an alien spaceship full of giant bats! We have a sexy, nude room vampire that sucks the souls of people! We have explosive bodies! We have zombies! We have possession! We have a S&M interrogation! We got the whole London city fire! This is Dracula, who will meet with Council NIGHT, WHEN THE EXPOSURE AND TROUBLESHOOTING MEETS ATTENTION. This is probably one of the most horrible horror / sci-fi / comedy / action / disaster / erotic / apocalyptic epic that has ever been fired, that is, there are others. <br /> <br /> Try to chemically change this movie. Maybe you understand. Really f *** ed experience and one of the most underestimated films by director Tobe Hooper. Maybe one day he finds his audience.
