What can I say about a movie that hasn't been told hundreds of times before? It's American classic. It has created dozens of imitators. Or none. Midnight Madness is kind. From the ridiculous opening assembly / music to Bonaventure HOtel I was hooked. Leon made us all feel so young and worried. One question, however, is how does he have these two hot whores with him all the time? And what was the time / money for this event? The upper limit is cast. David Naughton is the best here. His tight yellow shirt is annoying. His little brother Michael J Fox (in his first star) is a real brat. The yellow team also has Naughton's love of interest and dork, and a mandatory black guy in a fisherman's hat. Michael J Fox is doing bad things like trying and stealing a cup of beer at Pabst Blue Ribbon Brewery and riding a flintstone bath. The Lappish team gives us the most comedy. What exactly is this team's blonde? Will he introduce the flounder? Or Meli? Or grain? Yes, the Mexican gentleman's name is grain. The other man in the Flounder team has the best features of the film, I don't want them here. The meat machine team is a bunch of drunk. My personal favorite is the armpit. But the quiet black man is also great. The other two teams have 4 nerds and 4 lesbians (two of them are 450 pounds twice). <br /> <br /> You know what's going on from the beginning. But that doesn't matter. This is the best of my 80s genre. Don't try it, BUY. and buy it now.
