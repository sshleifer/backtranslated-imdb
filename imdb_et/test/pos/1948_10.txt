This film is so in the 1980s, and that's what I like so much. It does an excellent job of conveying this odd decade of feeling. The reality is that the Russian kernels could wipe you at any time. Reagan at the White House tells everyone that things were great, while more and more social programs were cut. Young people fell out, but not as much as their parents were in the 1960s. Young people were still in school, they just smoked so many hands that their feelings were all dead. Nothing did them, not even the death of one of their classmates in the hands of one of their friends. How weird to understand that the murder was wrong, but you are not sure why. Watching characters is a fascinating and very sick talk of a society with the offender. Glover is great, Keanu is great, Hopper is incredible. One of the most memorable films I've ever seen.
