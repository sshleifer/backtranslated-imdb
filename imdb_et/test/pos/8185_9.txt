Chen Kaige gives us an excellent atmosphere. Yes, it is a "periodic piece", but the artistic use of Chen's image makes it more. Actors often act as players using the stylized dick, postures and facial expressions of the Beijing Opera. All participants in the scene play "back wall" even when they turn to each other. They are like the spirits of the past that give a story of forceful clarity to those who are in the present. Together with Jing ke ci qin wang, which is closely related to scales and crafted cinematography indoors and out, is a stunning story spoken of with great respect for its idiot, which is astounding.
