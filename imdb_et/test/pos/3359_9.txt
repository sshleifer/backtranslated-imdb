25 sitcom had a big screen spin-off. Most of them came in the 1970s. Here is a list of all: Have you earned, Blackadder, bless this house, bottom, Fathers Army, Father's Dear Father, Ada's Love, George and Mildred, Gentlemen's Love, Love Your Neighbor, Lover, Man About House, Nearest and Dearest , Do not forget the quality Feel the width of the buses (3), please sir, porridge, rising wet, steptoe and son (2), this is your funeral, until death with us (2), Up Pomeii (3), Whack-o, anything happened to probable females and apocalypse. <br /> <br /> So was my all-time favorite sitcom army army's big screen spin. What the movie focused on was when men were registered. This showed difficulties in getting single and weapons. It was a big summary of the Dads Army's first series. At the end of the film, they catch some German spies in the church. He was dressed as a changing server and had bayons with them and won the Germans. The best bit of the movie was when they showed a HG lecture and a German lecture at the same time: German: headquarters by telephone, could you get 10,000 bombs, (CUT TO HOME GUARD) GODFREY: Mrs Mainwaring on the phone, can you get 1 / 2l Brussel germs. <br /> <br /> It was probably the second best sitcom spin off movie that was only beaten by Till Death (1969). It would have been better if it had already been created at the beginning of the movie, it was halfway through the war. Although this is still a great movie, it is good for the family.
