The game was made in 1996, but it's still good. The graphics are not so hot and the actors are not oscar-worthy, but the plot is twisted, devilish and very enjoyable. The dark story is tempting from the first film and continues throughout the game. We played several people for a number of reasons: 1) Use all our thoughts together. 2) Not so afraid. <br /> <br /> Play this game and you will not regret it, just do not try to find the trembling engine.
