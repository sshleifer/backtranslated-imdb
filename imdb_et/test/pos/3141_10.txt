WAGONMASTER is still one of the more poetic narrative films. I love this movie, but I suggest seeing some of John Ford's other western countries before I look at it. The first time I saw it, I was 18 years old and I didn't see too many other Westerners, and I hated it. I thought it was very boring. I was expecting something to happen. It took several years to love this picture. First of all, I fell in love with western - traditions, symbols, landscapes, ways of talking, etc. - and it made me realize when I saw the WAGONMASTER again, that there is a lot going on. <br /> <br /> I was just a more experienced mover in this sense and I had learned to evaluate visual narration and listen to what each picture tells me. WAGONMASTER is a very visual film that is one of the directors working for his career. <br /> <br /> Film is a lifestyle, and its theme is more emotional and interior than other Ford Westerns. In fact, it is not as accurate as saying that it has much less external action than other Westerners. (Other western countries have external activities and inner emotions.) This puts their Mormon pioneers in the natural context quite beautifully. There are many animals and children - not to any surface, narrative, but to illustrate this idea. Therefore, a film can be called a poem. It almost does not concern the surface story (which hardly exists), but also the emotional idea, and it gets this idea through composition, editing, sound and music. In fact, it can be argued that it is a form of cleaner film making, because the pictures express the emotional idea of ​​the film directly, rather than first serving the "story". and let it exist under its own conditions, not under the conditions of other western countries or other films.
