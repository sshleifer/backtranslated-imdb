I don't know why all the critics say it was a bad movie, this is one of my favorite films of all time. Tommy (Chris Farley) and Richard (David Spade) are a great game. Tommy is a fool who spent seven years in college, finally passing D +. Richard is a clever child who was hated by everyone at school. How can you not laugh when two of them sing "Carpeters" Superstar passionately and suddenly a hood appears? All this is a great movie, I recommend it.
