OK, why are you complaining about this movie? It's fiction. Deal with it. If you want to see a biography, check it out. This is the original, fictional version of the Wisconsin case. People who are obsessed complain about it because they make all other factual anomalies. Sad but true. I think Kane Hodder, who named the movie, was a great idea. I thought it wasn't so good at first, I'm honest. But it just made it even worse. If you like Kane Hodder, Ed Gein or real events, I think it's a good movie. But if you're obsessed (like some other people) away from the movie and all the others.
