"L'Ossessa" (published in English for many titles and most of all, is definitely "Eerie midnight horror show") is one of the best Italian "Exorcist" attacks. You should have a sense of humor to evaluate this movie. At the same time, "L'Ossessa" is buggy (but naive), pathetic and sometimes even moving. Ananila (Stella Carnacina), an art student, goes to the old church to see the shape, restore. It is the wooden form of Christ, the demonic Christ, perhaps it has already been defeated or countered by evil, or the planning of blind deeds. The face is shown by infinite torment. The figure comes from the 15th century. Danila is impressed by the mastery shown by the sculptor - it looks almost alive! He lives with his parents. His mother Luisa (Lucretia Love) lives an inseparable life and does not care too much for them to perform. His father Mario (Chris Avram) is watching everything with nervous eyes. <br /> <br /> The wooden shape will soon take shape (Ivan Rassimov) and will hold Danila in the flesh and mental sense. Amazing scene! Poor Danila now suffers from hell torments. <br /> <br /> Danila (lovely Stella Carnacina) was destroyed, corrupted, possessed by the devil, and now following her commandments, she tries to attract others. Didn't she imitate her sliding mother Luisa (Lucretia Love), who is very happy when her lover whispers her with roses? Stylish and touching is such a ridiculous scene when Stella Carnacina runs desperately through a small Italian town on narrow streets (fuck, remember?), Which cried her heart. Luigi Pistilli is a very good exorcist. His performance is as usual, intense. Exorcism scenes (especially the last battle) are very, very amateurish, but it only increases fun (and / or emotion?), If you really have a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> Stella Carnacina is beautiful and looks fresh and innocent, and this is a factor that adds to your joy when she is naked, but I think the film could have explored her more natural beauty. Lucretia Love is a very good companion (her naked scene with roses ... :). <br /> <br /> The other Italian exorcists I would like to recommend to you are: <br /> <br /> Malabimba (very sloppy and released uncut and digitally restored) <br /> <br /> Evil Eye (Malocchio) - "The Exorcist" was "Evil Eye", but the main source of inspiration for other films. as an example, "Rosemary's Baby" should also be considered. "Evil Eye" is completely up. Not so buggy, but with many Italian and Spanish actors. You hit the whole movie. The film is ridiculous, the story doesn't make sense, but if you see it in the right mood, you may feel moved! - A devilish sect, possession, murders, despair, love, exploration and beautiful women everywhere. Natural Ride! <br /> <br /> If you liked "Evil Eye", see also "Ring of Darkness" (Un'Ombra nell'ombra). This movie can be found in an alternative market. Look for this title in IMDb. There are good comments on this. <br /> <br /> P.S. - "L'Ossessa" has many different faces. It is exploitative, but it can also be serious and moving. It is cheap, cheesy ... sleazy (but not so much) and it is based on a "moral" message. This strange brewing can sometimes be very funny. We all already know that "L'Ossessa" has an "exorcist" rip-off, why can't we see it on our own terms? Yes, Mario Gariazzo was trying to make a quick tow, but he was best able to get the budget of worship. The story is well said that the film is atmospheric and in general the actors are dedicated to their roles. Watch the movie with open mind and discover two or three new things.
