Don't ask me why I love this movie so much ... Maybe it was in my life when I wanted to desperate, maybe it's an amazing monster effect, maybe because I enjoyed the novel "Cabal", but this is probably because I love Clive Barker. I think it's fair to warn you about the movie and the novel doesn't have a real solution, and like me, you're probably at the end of the WTF. At least two sequences were planned in the plan, but never the reason was that some of the reasons for the film were floped. The studio significantly reduced the cut of the film by a good 30-minute minute and worked on this HORRIBLE. The ads showed that it looks just like one cheap slip, which mainly shows the character of "Button face / Mask" Decker. It's a movie of monsters! Fantasy! From the place called Midian! This is a story where monsters are good guys. There's really something like that! It's not a movie for anyone I think, but it's one of Clive's many great works. Sit back and be ready to take Midian to where the monsters are.
