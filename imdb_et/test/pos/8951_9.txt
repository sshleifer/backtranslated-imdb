A very lovely story between Brenda Blethyn and Alfred Molina. The whole story is very strange and funny. The entrepreneur (A. Molina) loves a married woman (B.Blethyn). They try to fake their death for their spouse and village. The scenario of strange situations begins. As good as STORAGE AND LONG TERM DEVINE.
