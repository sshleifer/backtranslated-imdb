The plot is somewhat original and all the actors did their job pretty well. There are also many comics. Some things don't make much sense (eg the first "chase" scene, why shouldn't the hero hide somewhere and wait until the baddies leave?). The Russians speak Russian without accent, but the cars are extremely strange when the models reach the age of 50 and thus it seems to be outdated in a few ways. In general, if you like thrillers, you probably like it.
