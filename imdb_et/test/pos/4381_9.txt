It started strange, in the middle it was strange and the ending was strange, but it really liked it. Homer's Odyessy's modern version, but it's really irrelevant. Interesting story and pain. Clooney was great and I commend him for taking on such a changing role - unlike what he has done or is doing again. Lots of surprises - why isn't Holly Hunter anymore. Do something different today and watch this really different and unexpected shake.
