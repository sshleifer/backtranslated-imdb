For some time I have not seen Van Damme slip, pleasantly surprised, he's still older, looking older, but tougher than Sly gets stronger with age. It's a good flick and prompted me to watch all the Van Damme movies I missed in the last ten years. I'd like to see a good director who put a big screen on Van Damme with a good plot. Van Damme still has moves to amaze the audience, the last movie that Van Damme was watching was Legionnaire, it was a good flick. In addition, I looked at Van Damme's early battle history, also to my surprise, that I realized he was the real thing, a very successful winner in his younger years.
