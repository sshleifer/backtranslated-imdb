Anyone looking for a "Law and Order" or "CSI" episode should look elsewhere, because the most basic elements of police or forensic work were completely ignored in this case. <br /> <br /> Murder and all the police made the 15-year-old boy out of the street and took him the only witness - a 65-year-old man - and say it is the man who did it? Of course, the old man thought the child behind the police car should be guilty. do not forget that he saw nothing like a real killer and was dressed completely differently. She must be shrunk, changed her age by 5-10 years and changed her clothes. <br /> <br /> Police didn't make any effort - and they admitted it! There was no evidence of forensics, no other witnesses, and they beat out 15-year-old dismissal. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing about this impressive look at the criminal justice system is that it happened immediately in Jacksonville, Florida. Let everyone now talk about "southern justice."
