I recently stumbled upon this show when the ABC family had a marathon all day before the 2nd premiere of the season. I remember seeing previews for the show in 2007, and I thought it would be short-lived and not very well written because it was in ABC Family. <br /> <br /> Never doubt that the ABC family show is! This exhibition surprised me in the best possible way. The exhibition is well written, the story is realistic, funny and enjoyable. I was expecting a lot of relationship-related speeches, something like "this man dated the girl who shot me for this child ..." But this show is nothing more than that! The characters are tempting and you really feel the connection between them. There are a lot of chemistry between the actors and they can really feel like your things are right before your eyes. <br /> <br /> Do not doubt this stage, it is truly enjoyable to watch. . and fork;)
