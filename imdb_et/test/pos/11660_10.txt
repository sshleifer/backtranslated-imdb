One of the best. Direction, photography, exciting and dramatic history, great soundtrack and most importantly Susan Sarandon and Sean Penni, the best and undervalued credibility of the "under 40-year-old" actor. When you see this movie, I think someone who would have no doubt about giving another person a death, despite the ugly things he could have done?
