Although both this film and the signature have shown that many critics have not respected, both are above average. Roy Scheider does a great job with his best type; a harsh and courageous policeman who works hard to do it, regardless of desktop managers and politicians who should support him rather than hinder him. (He played the role of the city as a police captain on the jaws. Not nearly as tough, but the same "to get a job despite the politicians" and the gutsy approach. wannabee and nerd to fight the huge shark, not gutsy, then tell me what is ...). <br /> <br /> Tony Lo Bianco is good as a surprisingly complicated villain; most crooks are actually of some depth and complexity. This is one of those films that will improve with repeated views. In general, this includes the atmosphere of parts of NY City: sharp, insatiable, often dangerous, but full of energy. The story is free, dense and exquisite; it will work without any remote elements. It may not be the greatest ever, but it is an exceptionally good movie. <br /> <br /> Everyone has an opinion about the movement of cars. The mine is that it is already there with Mustang vs Dodge charger, which is Bullittis. The Pontiac Ventura / Chevy Nova was similar to the Mustang because it was a compact car frame fitted with a tight suspension and a powerful small block V8 inserted between the engine. but with the appropriate suspension modifications, they made cars with affordable performance that were able to handle both roads and tracks. Beating these GM V8s, as they are, is the music enthusiast's ear. I've heard this chase that was criticized for imitating Bullitt's pursuit. The truth is that they are two of Bill Hickman, the same man, who choreographed and drove to French Connection chase. In addition to managing most car scenes, he created a whore, malicious presence, and a good match with Richard Lynch as a cold evil killer. <br /> <br /> Yes, chasing is often seen with "realism flaws", such as using three different NY roads to represent Parkway, ending driving in an 18-lane car ride, and a wonderful timing that allows all pedestrians to harm. This is next to the point. Let's face it: film machines are "unreal" in nature. In Bullitt, The French Connection and The Seven Ups, Bill Hickman and Phillip D'Anton again made much more realistic and therefore more exciting than flying, rolling, explosive vehicle fantasies that are so common in recent films.
