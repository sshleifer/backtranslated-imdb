This is a finely designed film with moving sequences, humor and the best love story. Anthony Quinn is perfectly cast and after seeing several of his films, it must be one of Zorba's best performances. With the film, you can really wonder if it was filmed in Romania, which is probably not the case. He certainly tells the Romanians in his native language about his authentic landscapes, costumes and lifestyles. IMDb says it is actually in France and Yugoslavia, hmmm. The story is convincing, so you want to watch the whole movie to see if you forgot something. It called me to investigate to find out if it was a truth-based film, but it is a disappointment for this novel film, seemingly fiction. It seems a bit far removed that has happened to be real, but never knows .... One of the problems with this movie is that it doesn't look like Romanian actors, and it's a movie from Romania. There are probably many Romanians at first, but maybe not, it's filmed elsewhere. The author of the book was Romanian, at least all of which was good and dandy - a masterpiece of cinema in general.
