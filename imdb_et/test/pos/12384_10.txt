Seriously, I really can't get people here. I mean, <br /> <br /> the idea of ​​a killer snowman causing a tropical island paradise is quite absurd. The good news is that the producers understood it and made it into the veil of the darkness army of the comedy. <br /> <br /> Especially on the other side of the movie, when a small killer of snowballs attacked, I laughed at my ass. For example, put one of the small slips into a blender (a la Gremlins 1) and mix it. After that, he breaks back to the snowball and hits with a loud voice "It was fun!". <br /> <br /> Bottom line - incredible movie, rent it.
