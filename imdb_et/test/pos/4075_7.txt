I don't understand why so many people didn't like this movie. Robert De Niro was on his game, giving his place to such a aplomb, and believing it was his daily behavior. Indeed, it seemed that the film took many of the conventions of the film of friends during the fun of the concept, it goes without saying that the film was really funny. From a police dog, this film is that Eddie Murphy hasn't hurt my fucking, this movie is a real keeper. Rene Russo also perfectly balanced the rest, defining his role, so that it does not interfere with the relationship between De Niro and Murphy.
