Best of all - and that's pretty good - about Black Castle is that it is a black-and-white, forty-five Gothic grabber that contains the madness of murder that was somehow made in 1952. The star is seemingly British actor Richard Greene, a capable leading man who reminds me of Roger Moore's earlier version. The offender is a crazy story played by Stephen McNally, who does a reliable job, unless he is called to laugh manialy. Shading over the shadows is a long-standing Boris Karloff, who may or may not be rescuing our hero. <br /> <br /> It is in the mid 18th century in Austria and Sir Ronald Burton (Greene) has decided to find out what happened to two close friends. They disappeared into a deep forest in the Black Forest near a castle belonging to Karl von Bruno (McNally). It seems that Sir Ronald and his friends have been important in defeating von Bruno's brutal plan in Africa three years earlier, which were related to slavery and ivory. The count was not only due to failure, but its face grace and black patch now bears to cover the destroyed eye. von Bruno promised revenge and he seems to have been partially successful. So under the wrong name, Sir Ronald organizes a hunting invitation from the Count, and we go through the Dark Road and the Castle of the Worship Wolves. It is a large stone turrets and corridors, shady stairs, large fireplaces ... and creepy passages that lead to a cone cave, torture chamber and a large slit full of crocodiles. It is also filled by the county's cute, blonde, sensitive husband Elga (Paula Corday, who is sometimes counted as Rita Cordayna) and the county's two close friends, played by the two participants we know from the fifties, who specialize in mystery John Hoyt and Michael Ansara. There's a dangerous leopard wolf, forbidden kisses, looting servants, wooden signs that tend to cool in the wind and poison the cup. At the very least, Dr. Meissen (Karloff) is a special vial full of medicine that so slowly delivers the body functions that death seems to have occurred. The danger is that ... when a person wakes up ten hours later, he hopes that he has not already been caught in his coffin. Surprisingly, the black castle moves happily for all the clich√©s. The film takes itself seriously, but it is competent enough to keep our interests even when we finish with a smile when we look. It's even soothing to realize that the most dangerous games are strong gulls. When Burton understands how crazy von Bruno is, he becomes even more confident to bring von Bruno's accounts. And of course he has fallen for Elga. von Bruno, tempted again by revenge and power and ability, is a man who loves hunting and has been killed by killing. Hollywood's second creative rule has always been: "If you steal, steal the best." This is the first creative rule, of course: "If you steal, you steal from the best and then made it cost." Black Castle is a nice bite of the Austrian Braunschweiger.
