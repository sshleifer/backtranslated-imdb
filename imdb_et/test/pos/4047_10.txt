This is probably one of my favorite films. It tells the story of Gerda (Chelsea Hobbs), who lost her mother very young, so her father bought it. He falls in love with the bell clock. But on his birthday, there will be a hotel called Snow Queen (Bridget Fonda), whose father owns and kidnaps Kai. Then Gurda goes to Kai and follows her four seasons to save her. It has excellent special effects and the story fits very well and is easy to follow. I think it's a great movie for the whole family. I looked at it every time it was, because it has come out and is never tired of it, so I've given it 10!
