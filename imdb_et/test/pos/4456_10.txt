If you are one of those people who thinks Lucio Fulci is all about gore, guts, and zombies, you have to look at it (and also "Psychological"). Although the film contains some violent violent scenes and a worrying topic, this is not the main thing here. It is a truly impressive, story-and-character-causing mystery that can be a director's masterpiece. Here he proves that he is a true craftsman, creating a memorable, disturbing but amazingly beautiful masterpiece, full of creepy Catholic shapes and interesting social comments. It also has a great performance, including a great Barbara Bouch, as well as Tomas Millan (Beatrice Cenci) and Irene Pappas with a small but important role. Still a Brazilian actress Florinda Bolkan (who also looked at Fulci's bizarre "Lizard in Woman's Skin"), who steals the scene in the role of Maya, giving an excellent idea of ​​her superstition-led woman, and her brutal murder scene is particularly heartbeat. The second star of the film is a filmmaker from Sergio D'Ofiz, who, together with the melancholic Morricone esquire score with Riz Ortolan, helps bring "a lonely Italian village in the dark secret" to life. I have to admit that the rubber head that hits the stones has pulled me down, but it is still a definite Italian horror - moving, sad and finally provocative brilliant work. 10/10 for me. If you liked it, I recommend looking at Alfred Sole's "Alice, Sweet Alice" because they are somewhat similar and both are underestimated gems.
