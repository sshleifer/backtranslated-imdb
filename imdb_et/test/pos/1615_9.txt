Brett Piper is once again making a very good movie that the so-called film experts throw into the trash. this is a small budget but a fun and leading lady is very sexy. I would like to see more of Irene Joseph. Good viewing fun. I bought a DVD and enjoyed it. Special effects are stop motion animation and much better than the computer-generated crap they call today. I always enjoy Brett Piper movies and if you liked it, I recommend Bite Me, Screaming Dead and anything else he's done. I look forward to seeing more of my work and more to Mrs. Joseph. I just don't understand why this woman hasn't been in the movies anymore because her acting is great.
