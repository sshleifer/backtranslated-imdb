Stalingrad is an amazing film that has worked well and focused and approached the ground on various aspects of warfare and its policy. Together with Das Boot, this is one of the best war films (with Finnish "Vinterkriget" ("Winter War", in my opinion)). It depicts some German soldiers who fought --- and died --- in and around Stalingrad during World War II. There are no great heroes who did not have an emotional blur but a fear of war every day. The mood of the movie is similar to that of "Das Boot" and it should give you some tips on what to expect. So, if you enjoy realistic, non-Hollywood military movies: Rent it, buy it, make sure you see it! Finally, a movie buffer note: For some previous reviewer information, I just want to add that "Stalingrad" is not headed by Wolfgang Petersen (who made "Das Boot")!
