When I first saw Satan's brotherhood, I was 12 years old, in a small town in downtown Washington, where he played before the Tales crypts we left early because my sisters were already scared of Satan's brotherhood. All in all, I thought it was a pretty good movie. The start was good, we just sat down and this tank made it to the station wagon. <br /> <br /> What hit with the film was the landscape around the city where it was filmed, just as it was around Chelan WA where I saw the movie especially when they drove to the town of Hillsboro, the location of the movie in a small town SW in New Mexico. I've always liked LQ Jones and Strother Martin and Charles Bateman, who was another show at Get Smart. I gave movie 7 and later, when I started to see Tales crypt, I thought Satan's brotherhood was better.
