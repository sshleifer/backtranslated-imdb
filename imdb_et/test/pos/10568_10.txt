Chemistry between Sally Hawkins and Elaine Cassidy was incredible. They were thoroughly convincing in their roles and really like it. Imelda Staunton played brilliant Mrs. Sucksby perfectly. Despite being a dirty opportunist, she managed to express her compassion somehow. Rupert Evans played a mute ball gentleman with pure charm and snark. He was a scene responder. The story itself was very unique, as well as the way it was said. Victorian England, with two lesbian guides, was intriguing and delightful. There were some fantastic and unexpected turns that really kept the audience alive. The wonderful and wonderful story made this movie great.
