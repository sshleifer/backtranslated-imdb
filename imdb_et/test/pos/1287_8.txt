I just stopped tracking and I thought it was great. I rated it out of 10 out of 10. I plan to look at it again with the director's commentary and then again in chronological order. Here are some similarities; this film was probably a Memento plan. Even in some parts of the music, the music is very similar. <br /> <br /> Filming a movie in black and white gives him a mysterious feeling. Story and dialogue are really good. The performance of the actors is plausible. <br /> <br /> Christopher Nolan made this movie with a very low budget. I look forward to your next release of Insomnia, a great budget movie with your favorite actor Al Pacino.
