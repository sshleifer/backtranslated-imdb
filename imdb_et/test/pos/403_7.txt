Another nice entry in the Crime Doctor series [# 4/10], where weathering is almost noirish black-and-white photography and some great Spanish American backgrounds and kits. And more wall outlines! <br /> <br /> A man who looks like a crazy murderer of his first two women is found in a dead room after a dramatic dinner. The offender is on the ground (seemingly a guest) to instantly and graciously declare it to be a murderer, and so we have a rather strange number of people complaining to each other because one of them did it. Was it the freak brother of the first woman, the third woman and the rich widow Hilary Brooke, the dance brother and sister-vampires, the intense young man, the eccentric locker Lloyd Corrigan, borrowing from Boston Blackie, indispensable butler or odds - Jerome Cowan? Police inspector Emory Parnell had cut off her work, but Warner Baxter, like Ordway, was as secret as ever. One of the fates listed in the IMDb is false: Ordway says, "In the middle of the whole" and Cowan's replies "He didn't miss this time" when the murder room breaks down. Favorite Bit: Baxter and Cowan who go to the nightclub through club sandwiches and beer to change their interrupted dinner party; Scene where Braga repos is seemingly rumbled. It seems that the plot sometimes bends somewhat and the way it was explained was perhaps more worthy of the Monogram, but leaving that air when supernatural does nothing! <br /> <br /> Well see if you like the genre, you don't have to be disappointed if you don't like the genre.
