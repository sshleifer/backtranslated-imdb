I took part in the ex-ante check of this film to be unsure of what to expect from Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher; both have given less memorable performances and films. Although the underlying general story is somewhat familiar, this film was great. Both Costner and Kutcher performed powerful performances that played very well with each other. Both played incredibly human shortcomings and strengths of their respective symbols; The scene when Costner stood with Kutcher for personal reasons why Kutcher joined the Coast Guard rescue was the most unforgettable emotional moment in the film. The "specific" story was in itself an education that depicts personal sacrifice and demanding physical training that the elite Coast Guard rescuers must undergo in their sole work and responsibility ... to save lives at sea. The special effects of the rescue scenes were extremely realistic and "powerful" ... I have not seen such angry seas from the "Perfect Storm". Co-star Clancy Brown (HBO's "Carnivale" - great to see him again) played the Coast Guard in Kodia, the captain of the Alaska base, in a strong and convincing role as a leader who had the prerequisites and necessary ice water in the veins. The film perfectly and finally gives long-term exposure and respect to the coast guard; Finally, he listened to the audience.
