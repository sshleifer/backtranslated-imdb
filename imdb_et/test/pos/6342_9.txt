At first sight of this mini ... I was a little disappointed that Tommy Lee Jones and Anjelica Huston did not come back to pain. Both John Voight and Barbara Hershey were commendable jobs, replacing the very important signs of this legendary epic Western legend. <br /> <br /> Cherokee Jack Jackson (Haysbert) played a very good bad and Louis Gossett Jr., as always, was formally skilled with his great actors. <br /> <br /> It seemed alive in many scenes, including one of the best, where the cruel shooting killed by Ranger Walker made me feel like I'm in the movie. Back to Lonesome Dove, I was almost the first in the series. The following 2 follow James Garner's calling because it just didn't do it for me. And this Lorena marries a peacock? How the hell did it? It was a complete incompatibility of the signs. The first 2 of the series made an epic story, the next 2 were not of the same quality. <br /> <br /> Now that the first 2 could re-edit Dolby Digital and an anamorphic presentation, it could be where they should have been like today's movies.
