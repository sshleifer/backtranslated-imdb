Almost four years after the beginning of the war in Iraq and we are in greater gloom than ever before. That's right, so all those flags that threaten to be so sure that the American way is right and powerful are pursuing their tails, aren't they? You're taking it. This movie said so from the start. It's kind of filthy, how many movies, or should I say the filmmaker knew what was coming. It's almost like a happiness and hearing that will happen in the future. It was a thought when I felt the hair on the back of my neck when GW said "the main combat operations are over" when a visually broken RV is being carried under the American flag that is sailing in the back. You have to see it to understand what I mean, but even if you are apolitical or even if you are pre-war, this film has some effect on you because it's inside history.
