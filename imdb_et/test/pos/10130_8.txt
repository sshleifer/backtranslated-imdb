"Radio" is a beautiful film based on the real story of the mentally challenged James Robert Kennedy, the nickname "Radio" and the football coach T.L. Hanna High School, Harold Jones. Cuban Gooding, Jr. is a great radio! I never pretend to see her in a serious report, especially because most of the movies I watch with her are comedies. Ed Harris is great as Harold Jones, but this actor is great, so it's not new. James Robert Kennedy, a mentally challenged young man, always walked to T.L. Hanna high school without anyone disturbing and almost not noticing. One day, when a football ball is thrown close to him, he decides to stay with the ball, one of the best players in the football team, against Johnny Cash's impatience and the most unpleasant boys. One day, Cash James decides to punish him, strikes him against other football players and even go so far as to tie him. <br /> <br /> When coach Jones discovers a terrible act, he remains angry and punishes the whole team on the day to help James, who gets the nickname "Radio" because of his passion for radio in general. <br /> <br /> The film shows how the radio becomes an adept assistant, helping the team train despite the difficulties of the players and even respecting most of the people living in the small town. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a real and beautiful story. It has a life lesson that shows us how one can change, not what we call "normal." Radio is a big heart and can't hate anyone, and that's what we should all apply in our daily lives.
