I saw this movie as a child and fell in love with it. It has a sweet sensitive story. Something about the baby can be understood. I loved as much as the child I had to find for my daughter. This is definitely a movie I watch with kids. It reminds me a lot of story about Disney's nature, like Pete's dragon and Mary Poppins. Both live and cartoon, but because of this assumption. It is also a good story to show children that when they say the truth, they can trust and listen to them. I think all the kids should see and enjoy it. This is a break from the bad taste of violent films, so many children watch these days. It has all the charming features, so many of today's movies don't.
