Glenn Close is back with Sarah Plain and Tall, a woman who keeps the family in good and bad times. The actress is great - Christopher Walken (unusually not horrible) when her husband again offers top-notch performance. It is good to see that young Christopher Bell has grown up; too bad we don't see much of Anna (Lexi Randall, also a couple of years older), but the new addition to the Witting family (played by Emily Osment) was very welcome. And finally, Jack Palance, like the long lost Witting Patriarch, is as good as ever.
