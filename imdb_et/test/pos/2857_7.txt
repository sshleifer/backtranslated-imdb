As Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) secretly monitors her tyrannical wife Del (Aaron Eckhart), murdered by revenge victims Charlie and Wesley (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), her heartfelt reality is completely transformed into her favorite soap fantasy world opera. In a situation of total denial and fraud, Betty flees both physically and mentally to his dissatisfaction with the life of a small town to look for "Dr. David Ravell" (Greg Kinnear), a beautiful and loving hero "A Love for Love", a soap opera hospitalized and produced in Los Angeles. Betty, immune to reality, arrives at L.A and becomes a "sister Betty" when she tries to belong to her dream lover's hospital. In the meantime, angry Charlie and Wesley are talking about the Betty, making sure he is a dangerous witness who also knows their compromising relationships with Delhi. <br /> <br /> Nurse Betty creates comedy and mid-term review, contradicting the extreme innocence of her main character and the optimism of apparent hypocrisy and surrounding violence. Certainly, defining the difficult life of the protagonist, Sister Betty justifies her tendency to deviate from reality. So, by commenting on the popularity of soap opera in the film, Nurse Betty also makes a comment on the widespread dependence on television and its celebrities. In addition, Sister Betty becomes effective in manipulating the mental state of her protagonist, especially in scenes where she cannot distinguish between "Dr. David Ravell", a character and George McCord (Greg Kinnear) who plays with him. Betty's inability to recognize George as an actor leads to funny misunderstandings that emphasize his misleading state. Nonetheless, Sister Betty suffers from difficult testimonials through which narration develops. For example, when Charlie and Wesley are consistently portrayed as a comic couple, the cruelty of these acts undermines any recognition or acceptance that the viewer may have experienced first. Likewise, although the original scenes create Deli desperate, he overcomes the humiliation and violence perpetrated by his murderers against all the humiliation and violence he caused to his wife Betty. Charlie undergoes uncomfortable transformations as he develops an obsession with Betty; an obsession that brings feelings of noble love and ultimately destroys him. Consequently, since the role of characters in victims lacks consistency, the processes of victimization seem random and irrelevant. All in all, Sister Betty's weakness - if anything that makes temporary - weakens her signs and contaminates her plot. <br /> <br />
