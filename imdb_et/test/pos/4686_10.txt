The biggest compliment to other IMDb commentators who asked themselves why this series wasn't stuck at a time that lasted much longer than many others in the 80s. <br /> <br /> It is not true that the series should have been worse. <br /> <br /> At the end of this comment I will have some thoughts on other movie realizations: Robin Hood Legend Experiments. First of all, Robert Addie (Gisburne), you are among us all, you live forever. <br /> <br /> Nothing is as fun as two, if you want, three of this season. a completely unique series. At the same time, accepting absolutely new and revolutionary conclusions from Terry Jones' history documentation about Egypt, Greece, Rome, Constantinople, Gothic and Barbarians, and Medieval and Crusade (... yes, THE Monthy Python- Terry Jones): <br /> <br /> If you have seen these bright and funny Jones-Docs, you can better understand all the historical backgrounds of Carpenter, the Sherwood Robin writer. watch John Carpenter's brother, who made "The Thing", their third brother doing music), which aims to tell us. <br /> <br /> "Dick Turpin", "Catweazle" and the first two season writer "Robin of Sherwood", called "Kip" Carpenter, is my film director. It is better than everyone else who criticizes this "series" (which I don't see) for its "sword and sorcery" element or "defect" (taken from Sherwood's Webring Robin) or who has other non-fundamental criticism and there was a lot of it right now. <br /> <br /> Because you get to know this "Robin of Sherwood", it's hard for you. You will be the first in the third season. Not only that: I did it myself, and I took the first two seasons into my deep heart - WISHING that Robin's actor Praed left this series because he had tremendous success after the series, he was probably offered a better paid role in an absolutely ridiculous Canadian series "Jules Verne's New Adeventures" - The title already shows the emptiness of the whole project. The frog went for the money, not for the fame, not for his gang and relatives, I mean: as actors. <br /> <br /> Actors who personally represent "truly", our current and legendary Robin Legend faces and characters. The potential of this series could and should have been much more prosperous without the niveau of the downgrading of the content and the historical message, and the rebelliousness of the current political problems. <br /> <br /> Again, it's obligatory to say: The main role was forced by the decision of the Praed fool to leave Robin in Sherwood's fabulous remake series of Verne Tales and made a great story for filming. However, it is in some ways a disaster. <br /> <br /> Anyway: if it is known and your father advertises perhaps Connery but the young Connery is NOT all "chase Praed away", "as I first thought, then the third season can be absolutely enjoyed. here is that the script was no longer written by Superman Kip Carpenter, so we no longer have this critical and free-thinking historical background like "Elsdon's Witch" or "King's Stupid", two episodes of the first series A) Funny, B) Historical Education and C) worked great. === <br /> <br /> "Don't trust the lion!" <br /> <br /> Unlike many other characters who wanted him dead for his power, Richard Lionheart, as shown in RoS- and as in real history, it was a greater authority than John or others, but used it only for his evil and French war against Normandy, he killed and killed many more than tens of thousands of Christians, Muslims and Jewish "holy" in the Crusades and his soldiers even s Ovad children who they died from hunger or poverty. Moreover, after Saracens (Muslims) hit the Crusade, Britain was pushed out for a ransom, 100,000 points (at that time, in the 11th century, comparable to about 30 billion - 30'000,000,000 dollars at its present value), to get back safely and then he visited England a month ago to return to Normandy (France, where Norman's invaders first went) for a Crusade (one learns to be in the episode "The King's Stupid"). For this new crusade, probably for revenge, Richard Lionheart once again "empties the country" (quoted from Clive Mantle's mouth when he considers Robin even critical of the king). Robin criticizes the unnatural decision of Richard in this warfare, telling himself about Richard, saying to him, "The poor gave everything to let you go, how do you ask for more?" - Richard: "... Give me your courage and strength, not your words!" Later, privately, Richard Robin ordered the murder ... <br /> <br /> Thus, the crusaders were "barbarians". <br /> <br /> PS: Already when I looked at 91, I got Kostner upset because after my studies I found at school that Richard was not as good as Sean Connery at the end of his "Prince of Them" appearance . Well, as Terry Jones would have said: It is wrong, deceptive wrong! "Sean plays a humorist and charismatic, and his son does a better job than" Robin of Sherwood's third season ". <br /> Again: Praid is still to my knowledge who was out of Sherwood in the Verne series, someone with no brain, remembers or wants to remember.
