This movie gives golf a high mark, it worked well and well. Giving you an overview of the history that some non-sports events enjoy. The historical factor alone gives it a high rating, the Brookline golf course was really well done. I'm in the northeast and have seen Brookline as a fan and someone who loves the game. The film did well at all levels. Take 5 stars. Action was great, Disney has a big film winner bag. If for some other reason, watch a movie to give hope and encouragement to young people who may not see hope in their lives. I would tell you that the device, while in the late 1800s and early 1900s, is very realistic. Costumes and dialects were also branded. A call outside and beyond the golf club. V Must see fans as well as fans.
