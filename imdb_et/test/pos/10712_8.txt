Although it was a low budget movie and clearly at the last minute, it has a certain charm that is difficult to refine. I think this is a screenwriter - Grant Morris (see Dead Dog) who, despite the twisted plot line, injected a fantastic layer of humor that is very inadequate in many modern boxing halls. Be sure to have a laughfest on Sunday afternoon. The real one-to-one and very skeptical film didn't inspire me very much, but blamed a little hope for a flame of love. Not my armelife, as much as my lover of a little mad neighbor, letting his hamster sleep in bed with him. He can find someone.
