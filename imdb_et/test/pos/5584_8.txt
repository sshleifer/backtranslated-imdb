I saw this movie as a child and I miss it again. has it been preserved? I'm fully downgraded in the 1980s. I am sure there are many who do not feel that these films should be preserved. It is so regrettable that after the disappearance, the lost pearl has been discovered. Nowadays, young people do not understand the hallucinative quality and the impact of early youth vision on their lives can be later in life. This film, the "blue lagoon", affected me. How many of us have wanted to find ourselves in a place removed from the fears and chaos of today's world. It was an idyllic story of a shop and a girl on a tropical island. there are problems to be sure, but in the end they will fall in love with the child. Life should be so simple and beautiful.
