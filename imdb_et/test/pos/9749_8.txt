My friend gives me these three big boxes. "They are Flash Gordon series lasers," he says. "I have some gigantic coasters," I say. But not so. This series is rock. (But I had almost everything I knew to find a native laser disc player). <br /> <br /> There's really little about this series. , shark-men, country-men, and I think you're calling mongo-men. Sets and costumes combine Greek, Roman, Oriental, Egyptian and even Armor like English knights. Awesome costumes. And part of it was a rebellion. These terrible tights, which are worn by Zarkov in short pants, have not been described. And the boys in the furnace scene seem to be wearing boxers. <br /> <br /> It is also funny how they called octopus octos, orangutan orangapoid and tiger tiger. There's even a dragon (a creature like Godzilla that threatens Flash a couple of times before killing). <br /> <br /> Do you like the invisible man? It's closed. You like swords, wrestling (both animals and men), fist fighting? Lots of taste. We have an underwater city, a city of heaven, a city on top of a mountain and tons of secret passages and caves. <br /> <br /> Hokey Effects? Large sums. The City of Heaven is supported in radio ovens, which are like old-time steamboats. Rocketships is a "power source" for fireworks and has constant setbacks and / or noise. Many wires are visible, keeping things up (like food when Flash was invisible and of course rocketship). There are clouds in space, but when looking at Mongo, they are not on earth. The "giant" lizards appear briefly. The struggle with marine creatures is alleged to threaten Flash & co. on the way to the shark-underwater city. Dr Zarkov's "gadgets" broke me. And they seem to be the same, no matter what lab he is (he worked at Ming's lab and Vultan's). <br /> <br /> And yes, we have romance. Everyone wants Dale; Ming, Vultan, Flash. But at least one person wanted Princess Aura (Prince Baron) just not the person she would have preferred. In fact, many sub-plots seem to be associated with the part of Princess Aura to try to win the Flash. <br /> <br /> The man I think the characters are awesome. This fat, a horse laughing, King Vultan was fun. How he led these wings was pure art. And Ming! What can I say about Ming? He was perfect. They would have had him for the Starwars emperor. There must be my favorite character in this series. Princess Aura was too small a character. And he pulled it out nicely. I think he's a better actor than Dale Arden. Even a surprising high priest played a special role. Zarkov was a good but not the strongest character --- and he always stood in the background of Dale's fight. Now we're getting Flash: Flash was, of course, a strong point, a leader, a hero --- and he did it well. Crabbe is a good actress and this role fits her perfectly. <br /> <br /> After watching it, I think I know where George Lucas became the main idea of ​​Starwars. Look at it, you see what I mean. <br /> <br /> If you've ever considered viewing an old series (or any series), it should be your first choice. The only reason I didn't give it is 10, because a couple of songs that could have easily fixed is how gigantic lizards seemed to be there, and a couple of weak characters (king of shark-men and king of lion-men).
