'Apocalypse Now Redux', Francis Ford Coppola's warlord is probably the most beautiful war movie I've ever seen. Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is a Vietnamese soldier headed to lead a very dangerous and highly classified mission to Cambodia to end the position of colleague Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a highly regarded and highly respected military. The army has seemingly gone crazy and corrupted, setting its small society and helping the culture-minded soldiers. Sending a river to Cambodia is a handful of naval men, and along the way they get together a lot of interesting people (especially Robert Duvalli Kilgore, a tiny colonel with a few screws open) and some terrible situations. <br /> <br /> Apocalypse is a less historical warfare than a philosophical and psychological study. This is more than a "full metal jacket" as a "plateau". "Apocalypse" has a working time of more than three hours, but the film is so wonderful and convincing that when the movie came to an end, I was surprised at the time I actually passed. Beautiful cinema has definitely been the best thing for me. After seeing the film, I am convinced that Coppola is one of the masters of light and photography in film history. The "godfather" films were all hidden in almost sepia tone, and the shadows created a baroque composition. "Apocalypse" is the incredible use of natural light, shadows, especially in Brando and Sheen-related scenes, become almost alive, they are so wide-ranging and effective. Another proud scene was Cpt. Willard and Jay Hicks (Frederic Forrest) were in the jungle looking for a mango and met with a tiger. The vast foliage of the surrounding foliage (leaving as large as the house) made the characters almost floral, but the painting of the scene was incredible. Although everything else was almost silent gray, the leaves were incredibly lively green, which was particularly striking. Another very small positive moment in the film was a great scene where Duvall and the helicopters carrying the company attacked a small village while playing Wagner. It could have been extremely dramatic for the scene, but Coppola makes it the real part of the song, where Duvall mentions that he likes to play it when they approach, "scare them". <br /> <br /> The Apocalypse Presentations are first-rate Much has been done about the amount of money that Brando has earned for the film and the size of the problem, but for a relatively short period of time he showed a great result on the screen. Sheen is absolutely outstanding - this is the first time I really saw him in the movie? "Apocalypse now" is a movie that is so widespread today in pop culture (most know several choices of film, "I love the smell of napalm in the morning and elsewhere", but I knew little enough that there had been surprises there I haven't seen the original paragraph in the "Apocalypse now", so I can't compare this newer paragraph, but it's a movie that I should definitely experience. br /> - Dear
