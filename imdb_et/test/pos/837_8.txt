After completing the Zero Woman series, I was expecting a female prisoner of the Scorpion series; both are based on Tooru Shinohara comics. Unfortunately, I couldn't see them in order because it is the third in the series. <br /> <br /> It starts great when Scorpion (Meiko Kaji) escapes from the police. Detective Kondo (Mikio Narita) managed to get hold of the cuff, but he continued to interrupt his hand and go. If it isn't bad enough, the dog will dig up and see it before finding the street before finding the street. <br /> <br /> Scorpion can also go back to prison if life is not an outdoor picnic. First, the local Yakuza Tanida (v) threatens to put him back if he doesn't; and then the leader of the gang comes when he is released from Tanida. But they won't keep him for a long time before he flees and looks for revenge. <br /> <br /> They will soon fall like flies. Some certainly wore it with the sleeves of the garments that had so big shawls that they went up to the shoulder. Mrs (Reisen Lee) turns to kill her. <br /> <br /> Police are coming to their last kill and trap sewer. He's there for a week and police officers find that a friend (Yayoi Watanabe) has been supplying food. (The story of O Yuki (Watanabe) and his brother is a sub-block that is very interesting, but only next to the movie.) They try to burn him, but it's Scorpion and has some unfinished work. <Br /> <br /> Not the usual mix of sex and violence, it's a slow story that is beautiful.
