Not too much top's classic "top weapon" or "independence day" when it comes to fighter jet excitement. Yes, from the top of the film is a truly fictional example of how everyone can save, but it's cool because it violates all the traditional rules. The child does what he wants to do, how he wants to do it. <br /> <br /> I can't really love my fingers on this movie, but others I know about the movie do the same. I think it's basically a lot of fun, but maybe a little too unrealistic to buy. <br /> <br /> Again, despite this, I loved it, the people I know saw it, loved it so it's definitely worth seeing its decisions about it. So I thought Top Gun was one of the best fighter pilot films and I like this movie as much as no more than Top Gun. Don't miss out, see this, a really inspiring movie.
