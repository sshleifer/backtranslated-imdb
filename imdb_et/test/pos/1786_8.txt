One year after her triumphant first, "My name is Barbra", Barbra Streisand grouped her production team to produce CBS special TV. The first broadcast in March 1966 follows a similar form to its predecessor - three segments, the first two with unique concepts. The first one takes place at the Philadelphia Art Museum's lesson halls, where they are dressed as a periodical servant, rides the gallery and gets a piece of art through the song. Streisand expresses various influences from "Minute Wals" comedy and "Non C'est Rien" melodrama to Modigliani's "Gotta Move" racing style. . My favorite moment in a special time is when she turns into Queen Nefert's dead ring, singing Roger's and Hart's "Where or When" haunted rendition. <br /> <br /> Opening with another comic monologue, full of foolish sequiturs, this time in French, is the second segment back to the studio, where there is a brightly colored circus where he interacts with animals, including his beloved Poodle Sadie. He finds in the appropriate context "Sam, you made the pants too long" with penguins and compares his profile with "We are so much in common". Like the first special, the program ends with a riveting solo concert, where he sings some chestnuts, "Any place where I have my hat at home", "Where am I going?" and "Getting Started Here, Starting Now" between them. It also includes a short introduction he filmed in 1986, ironically dressed in whitish when a special first appeared in VHS. The juxtaposition of locale and song is even more effective than his first special and 23-year-old Streisand is in top form.
