Muppet film is a classic classic. I remember the opening scene with the Gender and the Kermit Cityscape, starting with (in my opinion) the most loved songs in song history. At that moment my mother sang with Kermit. <br /> <br /> Watching this title as a young adult makes me smile. I can still sing with my heart's desire. Like many Muppet films, adults are jokes that I find still funny. My all-time favorite line is actually this movie, this is the last line my green, goggle eyed hero tells about "Life is like a movie, write your end". That's what I'm going to do! Thank you, Jim Henson.
