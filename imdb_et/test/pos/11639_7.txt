MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE may not be his most ridiculous film, one of Charley Chase's more satisfying farce comedies, twenty minutes of smart sight, beautiful choreographic physical comedy, and amusing pain (of course with a title card) all based on unpleasant and wildly unreliable assumptions. We're telling you it's a "homeless story - a woman with a face that would stop the clock - and her husband's face that would start again." Soon we will meet head-to-head Charley Moose and his wife Vivien, who has a huge nose. But there is no point in discussing plausibility when our plot depends on such an unbelievable series of interconnected coincidences, ie, first, that Charley would have had his excess corrected the same day his wife fixed the nose, and secondly that each spouse would prevent their corresponding cosmetic operations is secret from others and, thirdly, that after they collide with one another, Charley and Vivien do not recognize each other. It looks like a little stretching, isn't it? Several stretches are more similar. It is clear that we are here in the farce world and we just have to roll with foolish plots, as long as you can relax and forget that you will probably enjoy this short. <br /> <br /> MUSIC AT THE SAME TIME MOOSE will start peacefully when the story of different complications has been created, but the things that Charley and Vivien have "met" and made a date to participate with the Charley dentist's home. They are all hurrying at home excitingly, entering separately and not knowing each other's presence. (Mr. and Mrs. Moose would otherwise look quite wealthy as they live in a luxury hotel-sized mansion). This is the result of a beautifully timed sequence that resembles somewhat of Buster Keaton's "NAVIGATOR", in which the husband and wife look at the house without ever meeting. And when they arrive at the party, comedy pulls a really big move, because Charley is forced to dance with gawky wallflower Gale Henry. Henry, an invaluable player of his own right, who played a lot of short comedies from 1914, is fun as a dance partner who brings great strength to his dance but little grace. In this order, there is also an elegant cinematic art when the camera is put down to show us only the shoes of Charley, Gale, Vivien and Vivien's dance partners, but we can accurately track what happens between the principles by looking at their feet. Unfortunately, Charley and Vivien are attacked by the parties they attend, and from there on, complications multiply when they manage to get in and out of the police network. When Charley realizes that she has just tried to step out with another man, she decides to take her every lesson. . . of course forgetting, of course, that he was trying to do the same thing. The last minutes of this movie offer some of Chase's most funny physical comedies, limited by the punchline's good vision. MUSIC AT THE SAME TIME MOOSE leaves the viewer with a warm glow and is certainly the most entertaining comedy produced by the fruitful, unfortunately underestimated Charley Chase.
