The film, directed by Alfred Hitchcock, was made perfectly. It starts with three families, a doctor (James Stewart), his wife (Doris Day), who is a former director, and their young son, I think, is about 10 years old traveling to Morrocos for leisure. On the bus, attack the French government agent and they're too nice for him. He was killed in the market after he found what information he was looking for. He wants to pass on this information to someone so he goes to the only person he knows a little bit, James Stewart. Antagonists kidnap their little boy and say if he says something the agent told him, his son is being killed. Stewart has to go to London because it's his son and where the expertise the agent told him would be. The film is very tense. There are many turns (typical Hitchcock film). It's also the right amount of comics. In addition, he won the Oscar Doris Day for "Que sara, sara". This movie is very good. It is hard to find this problem. I would definitely recommend it to all Hitchcock fans and all fans. I just give this movie "A-" just because it's a little predictable.
