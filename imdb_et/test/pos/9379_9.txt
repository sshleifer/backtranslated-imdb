Edward Dmytryki Crossfire is an exceptional and organically engaging, extraordinary temporary thriller, an unlikely "message" film that uses the look and equipment of a noir cycle. their anxiety, hanging in bars. Three of them arrive at a stranger apartment, where Robert Ryan, drunk and warrior, kills his master (Sam Levene) because he happens to be a Jew. Police Detective Robert Young is investigating Robert Mitchum, who has been assigned to Ryan's clothing. Doubt falls on the other three (George Cooper) who is missing. Ryan strikes his third friend (Steve Brodie) to secure his silence before Young closes. Ryan, of course, makes his prototype Angry White Male (and hilt), while Mitchum plays with his distinctive warning sign (but his role is not central); Young people may never be better. Gloria Grahame gives her first perfect transfer of smart, vulnerable trampolines and Paul Kelly haunts her life as a grueling home, staying in a small, peripheral role that she makes memorable. Politically-linked Dmytryk may perhaps inevitably succumb to sermonization, but it is quite limited to the Young's reminder of how his Irish grandfather died in the hands of the Bigotis a century earlier (hence chronological limitation). At least he did not try to explain why Ryan hates Jews (and ...). <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, Crossfire will survive even greater changes that are related to it - the novel based on it (Richard Brooks 'The Brick Foxhole') was engaged in a gay-bashing murder. But homosexuality in 1947 was still alongside Pale. The Holocaust news, however, began to emerge from European ashes, so Hollywood was boldly recording his protest against anti-Semitism (studios are always quaked for insulting a potential ticket vendor). Although the transition from homophobia to anti-Semitism is generally taking place, the specificity is not so smooth. The victim is lonely, the drunken young soldier calling him back home seems strange, though (or especially) is a girlfriend. This raises the question of whether this scenario was involuntarily left to the discrete tip of the original engines that caused the murder of Ryan.
