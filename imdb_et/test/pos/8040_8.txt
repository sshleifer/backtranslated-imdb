It worked! Director Christian Duguay created a very smart action / spy thriller. Performers were Donald Sutherland and especially Aidan Quinn. I'm sorry we haven't seen Aidani Quin so far in other such films. He was just the best in the role of Ramirez / Carlos, which he should have earned for the Oscar. The picture was very nice. Scenes are fast-paced from start to finish and the story won't let you get bored. The film is too undervalued and I recommend it to someone else if you forget something. Believe me, you don't have to be disappointed. That's why I give it 9/10.
