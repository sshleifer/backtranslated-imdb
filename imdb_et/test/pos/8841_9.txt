I saw this movie for the first time when they showed it on television and I was too late ... I really managed to get there. This is truly incredible; from the location (as isolated as it is possible to be on the planet, it made the "abyss" in the pool of the ET in the pool of the Council), through interesting characters (Keith David is especially good as reactive childs - "What if we are wrong about him?" - "Then we're wrong.") And its consequences (more happy than an alien). <br /> <br /> Moreover, the actual tension and fear of the movie are not affected. This is the people you start to fear; knowing that one of them can - or not - be "all that seems". It's definitely a feeling "who's going there?". <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is great; it really plays a part in isolation, fear and difficulty. <br /> <br /> Finally, the epilogue scene really cuts off. Even more than "But then again, who does that?" Bladerunner punchline. That's enough.
