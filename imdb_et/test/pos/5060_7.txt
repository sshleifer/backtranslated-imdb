An Arab-American man is abducted from an American airport and flown "anywhere in North Africa" ​​where he is tortured. The reason? His cell phone got a call from a known terrorist. The CIA decides to avoid legal remedies to determine whether a telephone call is a fault or merely a fault. After watching this movie, we can only pray that some terrorists have not accidentally numbered wrong! <br /> <br /> In addition to the transfer, there are several associated side sticks. One involves the daughter of an intelligent commander (secret police) who tortures the suspect, and her involvement with her mistress, who happens to be at school at night for suicide attacks. This story is too complicated, but still intriguing, especially when we see the result. The director uses a clean time switch to hook up the audience. The other side of the story is the attempt by the spouse of the suspects to find out what happened to his missing wife. He can help an old lover. He (silenced Saarsgard) is a senator (Alda) in a camp and soon gets a cold leg when he realizes that his work is not worth discovering the truth. Witherspoon is wasted in this role. Everything she can do is unexpected and pregnant, with one short attack. Streep is good and cold and stereotypical. (CIA? NSA? Homeland Sec?) An official who seems to be a Cheney clone. <br /> <br /> Gylenhall is also wasted when a minor analyst enters an area where he is over head, although he can finally do the "right thing". <br /> <br /> I found capturing a movie if it was somewhat outrageous, but thought it would add little to it. Certainly, it cannot be considered final and it definitely has an ax to grind. Like the "Kingdom", it scratches the surface of a very complex subject. <br /> <br /> The film tries to give us an idea of ​​the transfer, but it can only end with a "warning story" about one botched one. The whole transfer point is not "torture", but to become a "terrorist suspect" in order to give them legal (hence hindering) barriers. Certainly torture may be used, especially if the surrender is beyond our control - although we are not obviously guilty of this, but what can save lives is very important in this "shadow war".
