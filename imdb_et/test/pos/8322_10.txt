As John Grierson noted: "Documentary genres can be defined as: creative interpretation of reality" <br /> <br /> This fabulous 180-minute documentary film marks for the first time a computer project for dinosaurs that respects intelligence when I saw Jurassic Park, which I very much I waited with excitement, I was very disappointed. Of course, the dinosaurs were great, but the story was not necessary. I thought, "What if they were to make a documentary about dinosaurs without crying for children or bad punches, but the dinosaurs made it as realistic as to let us wonder what was once reality." <br /> <br /> My dream brought. The BBC has created a relaxing documentary that explores the different era of dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> This section is for all people who disagree about having to behave in many places on the skin. patterns, etc. Of course they have to do it. No one was there. I think it is fantastic for them to be able to present something realistic. The opinions are based on the knowledge of many palaeontologists and this allows the viewer to have a pretty good idea of ​​what it was. If you want to stick to what we know for sure, just go to the dinosaur bones museum. That's why I added Grierson's quote at the beginning of this comment. <br /> <br /> Anyway, hats are its creators.
