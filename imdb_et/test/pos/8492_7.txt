The year 2004 was a biological year with at least four pictures of real events, real people, different critical praise. Of the four photos taken at the beginning of 2005 for the Oscars competition (KINSEY, AVIATOR, HOTEL RWANDA and RAY), RAY became a big winner at night when the prize went to Jamie Foxx for his portrayal of R & B's Ray Charles. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that Leonardo diCaprio came close, it was well deserved and Liam Neeson was not even nominated. What made Foxx the winner was that the other two played relatively hidden eccentrics, Ray Charles still made music until his death in 2004 and then there was no soul who knew at least one song that Charles was a penny. This helped Jamie Foxx get up from the movie - somewhat weak for himself as a whole, and often seeing it not in the TV's bio-region - and his depiction is detailed because it's wild. He has a delicate task to embody a person in nuances, and if Ray's heroin addiction hits his head, Foxx pulls out all the stops and it's hard to imagine the real Ray, which is actually such a painful challenge. <br /> <br /> The low point of the movie is how it spends a little too much time to describe Ray's relationship with women. Like AVIATOR, Taylor Hackford wants to prove that Ray had this troubled life, his own demons product, and his success at the time he was black and successful brought a huge amount of luggage. Of women, the only one to succeed in real life is Sharen Warren as Ray's mother. She has a difficult role because she is alone on the screen with a young Ray player, but her face and body language is intestinal, especially when she has to give up her childbirth to get her house around her house. Such an intensity of emotion, stand and watch the blind boy over the room and force him to make this rude awakening to independence. Beautiful performance and what should have been recognized. <br /> <br /> Fantastic contrast to RAY is featured music. Anyone who knows R & D enjoys the early recordings of Ray radio as much as he would later bring him to the forefront of popular music, and Jamie Foxx steals the show practically when he performs songs like Ray. This alone lives even when the film itself is a bit more than a rigid biopsy. However, I would have loved it if they had used their latest adult hits since 1993, "Sing my song to you" for a closing credit. After all, Ray Charles is the speaker who was dedicated to his art.
