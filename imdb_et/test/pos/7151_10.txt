I saw this movie at the Sundance Film Festival and I was also surprised that it didn't produce more news because it was not only powerful and beautifully designed, but very original. The audience was completely busy and the biggest part of seeing the film at the festival is the opportunity to talk to the director and present it later in the Q&A session. They had to literally throw us out of the screening room for the next movie - we could have gone further. At the same time, the film is provocative and fun. It is a shame if this film is not expanded to a wider distribution - I hope it will be available at least on DVD because I want to see it again and share it with everyone I know.
