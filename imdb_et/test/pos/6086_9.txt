This is a strangely powerful and moving experience to see "English patient" again after Anthony Minghella's death. Most of his work is dedicated to one break point. The endless moral struggle of those who are consciously attending a very thin line. In "Talent Mr Ripley", Minghella Patricia Highsmith moves from the immoral Tom Ripley to give the murderer a conscience. In "Breaking and Entering" Minghella gives Jude Law a character to recognize and the rewards are cool. Here, in the "English Patient", the love characters are never away from their corrosive guilt. Ralph Finnes and Kristin Scott Thomas are extraordinary. They slip their characters from every pretext with us, the audience, with compelling contributions. Juliette Binoche is simply admirable and her scenes with wonderful Naveen Andrews are full of "Minghellian" sensual innocence. Anthony Minghella gave us films that were in one way or another that were difficult to mix art and trade. He was right for himself, but he thought of his audience. He knew how to push his buttons without his own betrayal. Mingha's opus is something clear, honest and amazing. I miss him already, but I'm grateful for the reflection of his soul that he left behind.
