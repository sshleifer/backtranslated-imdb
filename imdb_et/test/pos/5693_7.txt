When you rest in northern Australia, Gracie (Diana Glenn), her husband Adam (Andy Rodoreda) and her younger sister Lee (Maeve Dermody) decide to take Blackwater Barry fishing. Instructor Jim (Ben Oxenbould) uses a small motorboat and takes tourism along the river. When they stop, they are attacked by a large crocodile that drops its boat and kills Jimi right away. The three survivors climb the tree and when they realize that the aid will never come to their rescue, they decide to try to find a way out of their protected location. In muddy water, their boat is twisted and the crocodile sticks under the trio of water. <br /> <br /> "Black Water" is a tense, realistic, and dramatic low budget movie, and according to the warning at the beginning of a real event. The actions of unknown Diana Glenn, Maeve Dermody and Andy Rodoreda are top-notch, giving credibility to this simple but frightening story. There are many similarities between this movie and Prey, but in different environments. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Medo Profundo" ("Deep Fear")
