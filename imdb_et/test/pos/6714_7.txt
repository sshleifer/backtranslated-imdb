No, "Lifeforce" is not a great movie. <br /> <br /> This is not a good movie. <br /> <br /> This is still an average movie with some good effects and powerful style (and of course Mathilda May). It can actually be one of my favorite SF / horror flicks for the very simple reason that they try to justify their way through space vampire science. How often do you see it? Not even in the case of an "alien" (all time SF / horror flick), the science story does not come at all. In "Lifeforce" they try to justify an unreasonable world. <br /> <br /> Do I think it's a success? I think the film has a massive ensemble that Hooper is struggling to gather and follow, and that viewers must focus on more than one "villian" and have too many road passes. <Br>> <br /> Frankly, the film has eyes and fun to watch. but there is great potential here to make a surprise what Hooper is trying to do and create a really strong, frightening, SF / horror movie. <br /> <br /> If new repetition happens, I'll require Mathilda to have a kame.
