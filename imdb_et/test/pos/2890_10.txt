Rush is just an amazing DVD. This concert is one of the highlights of Rush history, and they offer their music perfectly and more powerfully than ever before. <br /> <br /> I was lucky enough to deal with this concert, not just that, I was in the first row grabbing the gate that separated the audience! This is the first and only time I've seen the Rush concert and it was a dream for me. I have no words to describe this experience accurately, but I can tell you that this is one of the highlights of my life. <br /> <br /> Some people complain about the sound of this DVD that it is not very clear and polished, but the sound you are listening to is real, the way it was at the concert. It is raw and powerful and so authentic that every time I watch it, I go back and live with that beautiful moment. Many artists record live broadcasts and then make a lot of delicacy, so the final product is far from what it was. Of course you can achieve a very complex and polished sound in this way, but you don't get the real thing. That's not the case with Rio's Rush, that's the real thing! I admit that I enjoy these fantastically sounding concert DVDs, love music and sound is a very important aspect, but it's refreshing to listen to such a fair concert. You listen to Rush just how they sounded like a live performance, tricks, and tweaks. This is a real live concert DVD. <br /> <br /> I recommend Rush to Rio, the list is fantastic, and Geddy, Alex and Neil's performances are peace of mind. Not to mention the crowd, you'll see how much they love to rush and sing with every voice, even with YYZ, which is instrumental !! I feel like singing twice; In Tom Sawyer, I sing "always hopeful, but dissatisfaction" and "I only reflect" in Painting. It's just a few seconds, but I just couldn't believe my eyes when I saw myself in a hurry DVD !! Awesome!! I hope you enjoy this great concert from the biggest band on Earth.
