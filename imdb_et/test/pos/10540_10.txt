(This review includes a large spoiler, but I don't know how to explain how cool it is without giving it away) I saw "pinoccio revenge" some time ago. <br /> <br /> Now you may think it's just playing a child. Indeed, there are similarities. <br /> <br /> But Chucky was the overwhelming doll who works independently of the child. POSSIBLE that Pinoccio possesses a demon or damn or something. The doll itself is actually completely inanimate. KID is crazy, and KID is the one who kills people! Everyone, including the audience, survivors and the child itself thinks it's a doll. But that's KID. <br /> <br /> Nudity is almost a pity, otherwise I could see it all because it is a really interesting horror movie.
