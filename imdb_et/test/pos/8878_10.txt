This film was one of the rolling floors that smiled in the movies. Danny De Vito plays Owen perfectly. Momma is perfectly portrayed and was one of the film's highlights. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, it starts differently from what you expect. Larry tries to write a book and has some problems. Larry teaches the writing class and Owen noted for Larry trying to read him. Finally, Owen asks Larry to kill her mother and Owen kill Larry's former wife. The whole movie was very fun. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite movies is at the end when Owen writes "Throw Mom's Train". Larry becomes furious because he just wrote a book on a similar plot. It turns out that Owen wrote a children's pop-up book. <br /> <br /> I would really like to recommend this movie. I gave her 10.
