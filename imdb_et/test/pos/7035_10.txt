This timeless summer love story is classic and never dated. I can't even read how many times I've seen Dirty Dancing. This is one movie that I probably got to see and love every few weeks. <br /> <br /> There is something timeless about this movie. I've loved other "husband love story movies" like Pretty Woman and when Harry met Sally. I think they are there, but Dirty Dancing is something that makes it perfectly perfect. Characters, chemistry between Swaze and Gray, film direction, INCREDIBLE dance, warm summer atmosphere, all the dirty dance is perfect. It's a classic classic and I've never seen a movie like before or after. <br /> <br /> I don't think there is one specific element that makes this movie so loved, but many of which are mentioned by many reviewers. Dirty Dancing has a nostalgic, buggy, summer mood, realistic characters, a relateable honest message with incredible music and dance, and one of the best dance shows in the cinema has ever given us. <br /> <br /> This movie is always on television and I will continue to watch it if they show it. But I mention that I don't care about seeing "Havana night", it should have been alone.
