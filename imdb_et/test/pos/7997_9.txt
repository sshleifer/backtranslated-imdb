So, what's "Batman Returns", <br /> <br /> It was marketed in the form of a feature film and many people who have seen seem to think they've been watching a movie - but there is not so much action, and Tim Burton hardly seems interesting. People often align it with the "grittier" superhero comic at the end of the eighties, but honestly when you read "The Dark Knight returns, which seems just a bit absurd; Burton's overwhelming imagination has more in common with the Seventies Day TV series (Penguin travels in a giant plastic shed for goodness). <br /> <br /> Burton's style is often described as Gothic and is a little closer to the screen; The penguin - deformed, malignant, with forged history and the underground bay - is at risk of being gothic dressed in honorable Dickens clothing - Udolfo, who masks Uriah Heep. But is Catwoman? He can be lifted up from the dead, but the PVC cassette is decisive in the twentieth century, and his alter ego, the world of Selina Kyle, is all the halls and apartments that resemble the romantic comedy of the 1930s. <br /> <br /> And then click. Intelligent, but a downward secretary of a romantic lonely millionaire? What are the complications caused by fraud and concealment? "Batman Returns" is quite clearly an old Hollywood-style romantic comedy filtered through the sensitivity of Burton's S&M Dungeon. This is more common with the Hudsucker Pro (including sets of expressionists) than with other superhero films. <br /> <br /> Like many romantic comedies, he focuses on transforming the heroine; not a ugly duckling to a swan, but a doormat to dominance. Michelle Pfeiffer gives one of her (often remarkable) career performances; she is iconically sexy because Catwoman (bad Halle Berry has never prayed), playful and honest, memorable, because she knows how to act with her whole body. In retrospect, this is his scenes like Selina, which impresses; almost every one is a little comic pearl, especially a glimpse of our single home life. It is a delicately balanced tragicomic performance, and it is these scenes that make the film live. Nothing moves me like Selina and Bruce Wayne, who dance under the hat to Siouxsie and Banshees, a weapon between them that is both capable and trapped at the changed egos who were executed in conflict. Forget the simple sentimentality of "Big Fish" or "Edward Scissorhands" gossamer emotions - this is the most heartfelt scene in all Burton movies. Love, revenge, fatalism, fetishism, madness, self-esteem and not a little wit, all the short lines and actors - especially Pfeiffer. Elsewhere, Danny de Vito is almost suited to him, finding the wounded dignity buried under their truly repelling long lines. The super-humble villain of comics has turned out to be nothing but a scam; The Burton penguin is a wild creature that has passed her own Eliza Doolittle style make-up (almost literally an "ugly duckling"). This is Burton's most radical and funniest innovation. Christopher Walken Max Schreck stops the perfect triptych of the rogues, slips with the occasional magic of the charm and the eyes of the blind with alternating lightness (and is it just me, or does his company logo remind us of Mickey Mouse? Maybe we should ask the former Disney animator of Burton) <br /> <br /> "Batman Begins" by Christopher Nolan - a real action film - is much praised as the first film to make Batman justice; I admire Nolan's movie, but it would be a shame if I were to hide this idiosynthetic pearl.
