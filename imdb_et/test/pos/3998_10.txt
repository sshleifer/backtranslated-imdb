This film may be a bit boring for some people, but I find this film very interesting in the attempt to discover traditions. <br /> <br /> Director Lim has made two films of traditional music in Korea before this movie. Before that, the movie was shown in the entire movie, and this film tries to achieve similar things by taking a film with a background like painting. <br /> <br /> Another thing is that the story is written by both the director and the philosopher Kim, a well-known Korean scientist (who has many degrees - including Havard's doctor). I'm not saying that educated people make better movies, but the philosopher is an expert in Korean traditional culture, so it gives the film more credit.
