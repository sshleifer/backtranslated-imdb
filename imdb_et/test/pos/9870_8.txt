... don't like this movie and everyone would understand why. The plot is bad, so is the actor. But I think it's better than Halloween 5, even though it doesn't give much surprising moments. Some scenes are really well targeted. But these moments don't give a reason to rent it. I do not despise violence in films, but H6 has extraordinary strong and bloody scenes that are not compatible with the Halloween movie tradition. The most wonderful part of H6 is the lack of tension. Comparison with the first masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Halloween 6 will only get 4 out of 10 stars from me. Rent it on request. But don't wait for a big horror test ... <br /> <br />
