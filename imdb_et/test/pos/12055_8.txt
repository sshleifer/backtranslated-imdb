The story of the obsession (Shahrukh Khan) and the length he goes to get his true love (Juhi Chawla), who is already married to his wife (Sunny Deol). The film is considered to be one of Shahrukh Khani's best performances and won both critics and audiences. The fear that your love may not be reciprocal is fearful that you may lose one you love, fear that your loved one may have a change of heart. In short, fear of every love story is a criminal. <br /> <br /> But Darri's fear is passion, obsession, and sacrifice. "Darr" is the story of Rahul (Shahrukh Khan), whose love and obsession with Kiran (Juhi Chawla) frees him from all fears for life and death. "Darr" is the story of Sunil (Sunny Deol), whose enduring love and passion for Kiran gives him the courage to die in fear. <br /> <br /> And finally, Darr 'Kiran's story is a missed man's love and obsession with another man. He fears you and fears you. One stands for love, the other for life. In this struggle between love and life, the highest winner is love, because love is always alive and dying. Just "Darr" is one of the best Indian ever made movies.
