Cuba Gooding, Jr. wins the best competitor Oscar in 2003. And Ed Harris wins BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR. What a beautiful and poignant film is, but be sure to bring a box in the box, because if that movie doesn't get you, then you have water in the water. It was in 1976. The provision was in South Carolina and the Civil Rights Act was about ten years old. We have a white high school football coach and teacher, Ed Harris. Then there is a black, slow-scarred but pleasant companion, Cuba Gooding, whose biggest asset, including radio, has been bought in a basket that is also used as a bicycle. <br /> <br /> Ed Harris is interested in a male movie for a much later explanation. He gives Cuba a nickname "Radio", and then it is an absurd riveting, gripping and humane study of the soul. <br /> <br /> Film is not a masterpiece.
