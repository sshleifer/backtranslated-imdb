I don't really have a tough job here, so I'm just throwing out a few observations. <br /> <br /> First, the film is absolutely proud. It is captured in high contrast black and white, and some scenes are so well designed that they are almost distracting. <br /> <br /> Early in some intense protests there is a sequence and some shots were amazing - three men who protested the tear gas and so on. Secondly, I think that one of the greatest signs of being a film dating back to the 1960s is that it is really about how the idealism of the revolution morphized and shifted something else. Taking this change is really interesting - I think that there are strengths and weaknesses both at the political stage of things and at the artistic and self-conscious stage. The film does not necessarily take things that have broken down. Third, I think romance works very well. <br /> <br /> Finally, I really hated that it ended. It was too melodic. One could even say that the end is unfair for this movie.
