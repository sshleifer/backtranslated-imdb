This is a video feature of the production, where the video release is additional. The result is both stage drama and well-produced film. Julie Taymore's sculptures and masks by George Tsypin are excellent. <br /> <br /> Jessye Norman is fantastic and one can listen (and see) the young Bryn Terfel. This production is stunning, emotional and majestic. If you don't see it, you are lost.
