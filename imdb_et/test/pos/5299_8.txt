I recently watched this movie and have decided to comment on it. <br /> <br /> The best way to watch this movie is not to wait for what Miyazaki has seen in the past. Miyazaki is known for his work Spirited away and Howl's moving castle. also for Western viewers. both films were similar to each other, but at the same time completely different. But Ponyo has a different story and animation. <br /> <br /> The story follows a "Ponyo" fish with a girl. After Ponyo out of his home at sea, he finds a whole new world he didn't know was there, and also the new troubles he nearly caught by the boat saved him a five-year-old boy, known as Sousuke. <br /> <br /> The story follows the pure friendship between these two and pure friends. Can Ponyo really stay with Sousuke forever? <br /> <br /> I feel the movie is inspired by the "Little Mermaid" and at the same time the "Tonari no Totoro" <br /> <br /> movie is very short and you have very little time for the characters in this movie . But the characters are fish and little boy, so how much do you expect them to be? The movie is over three days, I think this is why the film is so short. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed watching this movie and I hope everyone will enjoy this movie
