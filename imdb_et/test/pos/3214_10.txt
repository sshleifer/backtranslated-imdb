this is really a great series. I love the example and I'm so glad that it is not canceled yet. it is really good humor and shows a realistic relationship between a young mother and her daughter. o yes to Gilmore girls! it is very awesome. they are such a sarcastic humorous bunch. they do everything together like my mother and me. Ya Gilmore for Girls. um, I'm out of line. but I love the way Luke and Lorelei finally develop. they had to be together. and i just love Sookie St James! he's so awesome. and the show wouldn't be anywhere without Michel. the whole show is dry humor, sarcasm and life in a very small town where everyone knows each other .... especially Gilmore girls.
