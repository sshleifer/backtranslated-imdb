It is a story of three brothers who are struggling with difficulties and loss, and to learn that really important things in life are family, love, trust and forgiveness. Whole cast succeeds with powerful performance, despite some evil lining. A great movie for fans who are experiencing viable problems with religious families. Also look for Dermot Mulroney or Sean Astin fans. They both do amazing work, often bringing you to tears. Take my word and rent it today!
