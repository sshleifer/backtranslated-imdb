The age of Stewart did not bother me in this film, although he depicted a much younger person. I still remember my fascination with Lindbergh's story, and although I was thoroughly an adult at the time of making this bioopia, I had to see it. <br /> <br /> This not only provides excellent results from Stewart, but also provides many interesting technical details, making them technically challenged, for example, understandable to me. The look of the plane was very good. <br /> <br /> I loved this event before my birth and again the childhood love I had for the idea of ​​planes and air travel.
