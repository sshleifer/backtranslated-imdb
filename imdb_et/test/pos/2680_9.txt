"QUEENS King," I think is a pure CBS hit! Despite the fact that I've never seen every episode, I still enjoy it very much. For this reason, I find it difficult to tell which episode is my favorite. Even so, I have to say that CBS really knows good sitcom. Before I turn it up, I would like to say that everyone always does a good job, the design of the production is remarkable, the costumes are well designed and the writing is always very strong. To sum up, if this exhibition lives in an event after turning off CBS, I strongly recommend that you catch it when it goes out of the air.
