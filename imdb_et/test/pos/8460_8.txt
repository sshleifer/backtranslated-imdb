Although the prerequisite for the film is a big "coincidence", all the actors do a reliable job and look good by bringing the story to life. I found myself at the symbols of Ticer Moore and Christine Lahti, both opposed and willing to agree. Sam Waterston and Ted Danson also have a good role to play, doing a decent job with stereotypical friendships. Although the story tends to jump from time to time, sometimes leaving the audience a bit hungry for missing details, it still flows and prevents real confusion. On this interesting line, all the elements are good for "sliding the chick".
