The passionate empire begins to deceive - that is, when you expect it as a horror film immediately. It's like James M. Caini Posted by always in the ledge twice, at the beginning: Seki (Kazuko Yoshiyuki) is a two-mother and conscientious, hard-working woman rickshaw driver Gisaburo (Takahiro Tamura). But if he's not around, and he's with his child at home, the fierce and purposeful young man, Toyoji (Tatsuya Fuji), goes around to bring Shi ... and a little extra. They will sleep together soon, but after he does something (just say shaving), he knows he'll know and immediately propose to kill Gisaburo. They drink him, strangle him and throw him out of the well. Of course, it goes back to haunt them - but it is literally, at least for them (at first super-frightened Seki and then skeptical at Toyoji), the moves "Kaidan", the Japanese ghost story. /> <br /> This is a movie where horror does not just come out "oh, ghost, ah", but all the fear that the characters build. In some ways, the whole film-and-knife mechanism, when translated through a 19th-century Japanese village with a city in the United States or a small town (ie a policeman, is "evidence" that might have been found by another person). , a word, doubts arise, etc.). It's convincing because Seiko was against the plan from the start, manipulating the tempting but poorly prepared Toyoji, and his reaction to Gisaburo's re-appearance is amazing to him. Take what is closest to poetry: Gisaburo ghost, pale-blue face and mostly quiet, chilling foam, Seiko's movements on rickshaw. He reluctantly does, and he pushes him down the road he doesn't know, the morning before dawn, surrounded by smoke. Most Japanese ghost stories want heaven, which they could get into the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Although it will end in hysteria, there is so much that Director Oshima will be right to make it a distinctive job. After it has tremendously captured the Intense Characteristics of the International Film World (which is ironically forbidden in its own country), he did something he claimed was even * bolder to “Senses”. Maybe he was right; The human empire has less graphical sexual content than far from its predecessor (Tatsuya Fuji also plays a great physical actor with a huge variety of things) but its courage lies in shaping the world of fear. You can believe in the ghost in this story, but you also need to believe how far your personal souls will go about the love they want. Tiny detectives or rumors of townspeople are their least worried: their fate of souls is at stake. <br /> <br /> And Oshima takes what other hands might be just juicy cellulose (unfortunately it wouldn't be) t surprise me when the American remake was already done) and the craft was shot after a wonderful shot, repeating its way -en-scene (ie Seiko and Toyoji shots that travel on this road, camera at Dutch), the world tilted and surrounded them with a gloomy blue tone), as well as some influential movements that stay with me long after I write it (ie Toyoji throws the leaves in one hand with slow motion or how Seiko's naked body appears after getting dark). It is bold lies in the unification of the spiritual level - not to be confused with the spirit, although there may be something like this - the connections of life and death with one another, inseparably. This is a classic that awaits discovery.
