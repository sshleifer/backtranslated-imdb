Just the best and most realistic film of World War II I've ever seen. Not only because German soldiers speak German and Russian soldiers, but also speak Russian (not German or Russian) because the film is realistic. Operation is not working. Not a Hollywood sentiment even a love story ... Stalingrad had to be one of the most terrible battles during the war, and in this context there is no place for sentiments or romantic scenes. What you get is a movie that makes you excited about bones and has one of the best unfortunate endings a movie can have.
