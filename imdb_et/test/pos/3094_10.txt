Fata Morgana is an absolute masterpiece. This is Werner Herzog's most common film. It has no plot or story. Instead of the story, we are given a collection of pictures, words and music that work so wonderfully together. It's not a documentary either. Some of the people in this movie are directed and given lines to read. It has some of the most beautiful and haunting images. Herzog shoots real mirrors, and we see cars and people floating in the middle of the desert, who are not really, but are reflected in the mirror for hundreds of miles away. The use of music in this film is so brilliant - Leonard Cohen, Mozart and the Third Ear. Imagine Stanley Kubrick in 2001 this is the movie. This movie is so hypnotic that it has the ability to make you feel like your spirit has left your body. Must see. This changes the way you watch the movie. Rating: 10 out of 10.
