How often do we live in our romantic life like a big screen with terrible things and passionate meetings? Almost never when what I see as a normal life around me is something to evaluate. As stated earlier, novels are almost always earthquakes that leave you in the top of the world or dough and crush. <br /> <br /> Romance, in its daily form that lived over millions of times around the world, is a slow, subtle and quiet thing. Something that grows inside you, so slowly, probably without you even noticing it slowly from taking over your being. No one can tell me when I love. Because if anyone had done it, I wouldn't believe him anyway, because no one knows me. And even then it is just a feeling of a certain knowledge that you feel this exaggerating emotion. That you don't want anything else other than the best for you, you would never want to see them sad. That you're ready to do a lot of pain against them. I do not go so far as to say that I want to die for my lust, because we are all human, and we do not know what we are capable of dying until this moment is with us. <br /> <br /> Is love between the main characters of the film ever so subtle and undervalued, not less noble than Romeo and Julia? Unswerving emotions, untold feelings, transmit much more than repeated calls "I Love You". The constraint shown by the leading actor, showing that he sees his love interest through the cafe window, but has never let him know, was just heartfelt. Would most of us be sufficiently independent to remain hidden, knowing that it is not possible to reciprocate its emotions and feelings? <br /> <br /> In another comment, how do I deal with my own death? Although I can say that I have been seriously ill, I cannot honestly say that I am ever near death. Am I so calm, putting all my things right and leaving others with instructions I leave? I suspect I am calm because I have little choice on this issue. Can I be so selfless? Again, the answer must be negative. I can feel patience knowing that your life has been lost, that your destiny has killed you and that future events, albeit few, are no longer in your control. <br /> <br /> Life is nothing more than a series of small events, the culmination of which may seem retroactive for some. But only very rarely.
