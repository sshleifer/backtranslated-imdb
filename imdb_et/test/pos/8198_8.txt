This is an epic film about the unification of old Chinese kingdoms in the third century BC. It is interesting to intrigue the king and the palace around him. It reminded me a bit of "King Lear" and some other Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> The King will embark upon noble ambitions, unite kingdoms under one ruler and stop all quarrels that people can prosper and live better. He and his childhood sweetheart, which Li Gong played beautifully, prepared a scheme according to which he pretended to go to the exile of a rival kingdom to recruit a murderer to kill the king, giving him an excuse to go to war. But when he is gone, the king becomes sadistic for his power and goes to killing. <br /> <br /> There are many side plates that keep the action going. There's a Marquis who pretends to be foolish and foppish, but who's really smart and wants to become a king. His dads two children with the king's mother and can keep it secret for years. Then the prime minister, the political rival, is the king who really turns out to be his father. The assassin is a complex character. He's a nice swordsman and killer when he's got a reorganization when the king's lover arrives to recruit him. He doesn't want anything more than killing, but eventually Li Gong (who wouldn't be?) Wins when he sees the cruel and cruel king has changed. <br /> <br /> Some remarkable cinematographies, especially battle scenes, performed on a large scale - as they said earlier, thousands, literally. Actress is OK, something special. This is a story that is interesting, though over two and a half hours it pushes it to the limit. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth a look.
