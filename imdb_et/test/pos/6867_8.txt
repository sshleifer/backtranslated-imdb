I was very curious about Anatomy (aka Anatomie), and when I looked at it, I had to buy it because no video store in my area wore the movie. Since it was not a cheap DVD, I took the opportunity and thought I was watching other IMDb comments. Many of the comments did not give me enough hope to pull out a lot of movies for a movie that I have never seen, and no clues. I basically got the idea that it was a sexy youth-oriented romp compared to many cookie-cutter teen thrillers. Well, nothing in my back told me to ignore these comments and buy it! I did and I was pleasantly surprised! <br /> <br /> If compared to other movies, I would say that this is a variation of coma and extreme action. I didn't see any comparison with films like Scream, Urban Legends, and others. Yes, it is young (because they are pupils! At least they are not more boring high school type characters), and yes, some of them are strange (basically the character played by Anna Loose and it is quite tasty in German) but anatomy is Well designed, there is a tight mood, the sets are amazing, makeup effects are wow and Franka Potente is very reliable in her role. I found myself all the same, despite the fact that there are some open holes in the plot! The story of a student who discovers a sort of secret society that carries out autopsy on living patients is quite a horrible scenario and what happens to these patients later is pretty smart. Of course, you could ask why he just couldn't get from that place? Okay, but then the movie would be an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> It was the first German part of Columbia Pictures and it is actually quite impressive. There was some care in the production and offering real thrill is an achievement. It is somewhat ripe because it does not use continuous opportunities for sexual meetings (breast cancer) or young drug jokes. Anna Loose's character, often for making sexual comments and searching for fun, was actually a nice touch - a character that was more intelligent than any man in school. He found that sex was really just a distraction for him and the men. <br /> <br /> IMPORTANT STUFF: Watching this movie in original German with English or French subtitles is the best way to enjoy it. I saw theatrical elements dubbed in English, and it was reluctant to change the film's tone. I've never seen a properly dubbed movie in my life - they will never be able to find a suitable voice for actors or characters in a movie. Of course, I tried to look at some anatomy in English and the level of intelligence dropped seriously, making it a comedy. A good example is when one boy was cut off and shouted to sew him back - listening to it in German, it sounded frantic, but in English he dubbed a comic. To be honest, I'm sick that people say they can't handle subtitle reading or watch a "letterbox" movie. Anatomy comes as foolish as dubbed voices that seem too big for the octaves to be seen by any person in the movie, and Anna Loose's sexual comments just sound terrible remarks directly at Fast Times at Ridgemont High. I don't know if negative comments about anatomy come from people who watched it, just don't look like the same movie! It's not a cheap horror movie and deserves to be seen. It is interesting to note that some English subtitles are different in different scenes and in the "add" form. <br /> <br /> As it turns out, I played and won anatomy. It is a competent thriller with pleasant characters and not trying to go cheap.
