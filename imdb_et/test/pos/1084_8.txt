Ab Tak Chhappan is a fictional story that surrounds the Mumbai Police Department in India. Sadhu Agashe is a hard-working, hard-knit policeman who puts in a simple-dressed criminal team, named after killing dangerous criminals at staged police meetings instead of being locked in jail. His loyal officers will undoubtedly hear him, but riffle forms when one of his officers in Imtiaz comes down to Sadhu's higher status, and he secretly competes with him for criminal killings and status. A new recruiter enters the brotherhood and Imtiaz is angry when Sadhu allows him to happen in his first case. Further change will take place in the form of a new police commander who does not recognize Sadhu's tactics and anyone can get into internal politics. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see such a well-directed action pillar from India. The camera's work is great, the story is well-talked and the tension is great when drama occurs. A functioning, tempo and political enemy persuades the viewer that they are flying between the blood, sweat and tears on the wall and on their personal stand, and that the events are based on a reality that is no doubt why we are told that it is not at the beginning of the film, although it is likely that the director Shimit Amin has taken liberties with factual accounts. However, Ab Tak Chhappan is an extremely polished film art.
