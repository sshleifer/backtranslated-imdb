I saw this movie on television in Britain about 25 years ago and it has been since then. My interest has recently been revived by visiting the Hilton Head, which is the next "Yamacraw" island (Daufuskie actually), and reading Pat Conroy's excellent "Water is Wide". For the sake of knowledge, I've reviewed Conrack and considered it a masterpiece. Jon Voight grabs Conroy's spirit and the film's atmosphere brings the book's life exactly - a Hollywood rarity. <br /> <br /> I have three more things to say to me: 1. The lack of education and discrimination and the inclusion of the poor remain the same. 2. Education is more than reading and writing. 3. These children were my peers, in 1969 I was 6 years old when Pat Conroy spent his year at Daufuskie. <br /> <br /> Why hasn't it reached the DVD yet?
