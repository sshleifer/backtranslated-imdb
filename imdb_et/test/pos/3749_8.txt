The woman and her aunt go to Scotland to find their evader. It is a much filmed film because it is due to its gap, but until then it has been interesting, well-functioning, terrible and fine-tuned (William Cameron Menzies, developed for 3-D projection). Veronica Hurst is an enchanting and cozy, stylish British Marilyn Monroe, who is still in love with Richard Carlson, who hides the secret of his secret castle family; There is even a bat in the bell tower! It moves calmly to the final, extraordinary piece, when Hurst and his aunt (Katherine Emery, also a narrator), out of the city at night to reach the maze and find what they are looking for in their center. As a child, I always remembered this sequence - there is nothing more frightening (or claustrophobic) than finding a 10-foot high maze with its exits. Of course, these two women are released, setting a stage where amazing amazing music. The end result is really disappointing, because Carlson's epilogue at the end makes some effects on all events, even provoking compassion. It's worth seeing.
