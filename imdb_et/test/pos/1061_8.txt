This movie is one of my favorite music classics. Of course, it's fluffy, it's not "relevant", but if the movies were just fun and fun, would they be bad? No, this movie is definitely a "good thing", as Martha Stewart would (respectively) say! Barbara Stanwyck is so appealing in this movie and Dennis Morgan is excellently recognizing her. They both have the charm and the heat to save. They are assisted by a team of actors of an incredible character who seem to have disappeared since the 40s and 50s - Sydney Greenstreet, S.Z. (Cuddles) Sakall, Reginald Gardiner and Una O'Connor. Where are these signs today? No role could have been better. Bette Davis refused to play this role because he was under him and had refused correctly. He would have tried to evaporate everything and everything around him and completely destroyed the film. Stanwyck was a strong actor but had the wisdom to play it lightly. It has rarely been more attractive and perfect. Morgan is a nice boy's character. Because his part is the smallest splashy, there is a tendency to forget his skills. Just the fact that he could have such a distinctive actor is an accomplishment in itself, but he is also perfect as Jefferson Jones. Remember the unwanted (and meaningless) remake of 1992 and look at this brilliant and sparkling gift of sparkling wine!
