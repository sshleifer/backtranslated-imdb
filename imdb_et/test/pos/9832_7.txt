Random hearts collided with me. Critical to the (a) assumption and (b) the bond between the policeman and the congress, as well as its slowness, felt the film very good and even surprisingly absorbing. I found my interest when the film was cut between the lives of Ford and Thomas when they first learned, and dealt with the deaths of their spouses and the revelation that they were related to other people in very different environments. This can happen; two people lived on the same plane, the plane could go down, the survivors could come together with the following consequences. What if it is unlikely? Unlikely to be the same as the one drawn far. So ... what if it happened? Why not speculate? <br /> <br /> Ford's and Thomas's performances are plausible and nuanced. Instead of finding his relationship unlikely (the opposite of the stories - give me a break), I felt that it was driven by grief and betrayal, which neither side knew. The script does not bring them together too quickly or too easily, and the end of the film does not solve their relationship. If I find this unhappy, the dialogue will bring interesting wrinkles or perceptions of the consequences of the situation, personal and professional, but it never seems to have come a long way. And if you make the mistake of thinking too hard, Harrison Ford seems to be about 10 years old for that part. <br /> <br /> For five and a half bucks in Wal-Mart, a full-length director's commentary and shades of scenes, the DVD is worth having. I don't think I'd pay $ 20 for that, but my wife can do it. OK, ten ...
