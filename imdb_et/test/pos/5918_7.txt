The biographical story of Charles Lindbergh's life, the first person to fly alone in the Atlantic Ocean in 1927, stopping on the plane of St. Louis on his plane. <br /> <br /> Although he was not one of Billy Wilder's best films, he has very impressive production values, especially for a film made 50 years ago. The story is well talked about and the performances are good, though not outstanding. <br /> <br /> One limiting factor in storytelling is that Lindbergh flew alone and without the radio, which means he has no one to talk to. This required some different story-telling techniques, such as internal monologues, talking to the household, and occasionally talking to themselves, especially after exhaustion. Also, in order to avoid a long queue for the famous flight, it is a mixed setback of his life and methodological preparations for the flight. <br /> <br /> Charles Lindbergh was a great hero of his era, but his contradictory beliefs would have somewhat disproved his legacy. Nevertheless, he would continue to contribute to the aviation contribution and to assist the US efforts in World War II as a civil aircraft consultant. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Stewart certainly had a flying background to return his Lindbergh image. During World War II, he rose to the US Air Force Colonel, and in the post-war reserves it reaches the Brigadier General.
