Unbelievably fun 70s Italian swiss, with a lot of non-consensual S&M, lesbian sex, free racial cruelty, and so on. Few redeemable movie qualities, except for the rather cool theme music with dubby "African" drums and flute. Brilliant Sample Dialog: <br /> <br /> White Slave Owner (White Plantation Manager): "You're so stupid, I'll bet you forgot about this n **** r midwife!" <Br /> <br /> Head of the White Plant: "Not only did he listen to him, I did it so well that he died before I got answers from him!" <br /> <br /> All black actors have 70's, and say "yes, mass" with high voice. The female stove is sexual on planting. 10 stars for tasteless slippery fans.
