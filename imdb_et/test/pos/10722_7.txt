Since "Midnight Cowboy I have been looking for movies with Dustin Hoffman and are not usually disappointed. Since I have been watching Meryl Streep on films and most of the time I am not disappointed," Kramer gave an excellent result, really one of his best, Sophie's decision and I cut it out of "Africa." The fact that these two actors came together over 20 years ago for "Kramer vs Kramer" was definitely a very good idea: the result is a great character drama, the subject of which is still very important in today's society important. <br /> <br /> It is a very bad time for everyone to divorce, even though the children seem to be the most affected. Nice Robert Benton's behavior in some original leadership, where some memorable scenes are presented: even mileage takes character and it should be characteristic of cast! just like the breakfast offered by Billy (Justin Henry), it's just great. How can you work at the age of eight? Lead and Hoffman, of course, seemed to be good electricity: the result is definitely interesting, loving and convincing. Justin Henry's performance must be among the best 5 or 6 children of all time. The best thing was naturalness again, there was no surge up so often these days. <br /> <br /> This movie came back to a small screen again the second evening, although I've had it in my video collection for years: it's still worth watching and paying attention to everyone. About 7Â½ out of ten.
