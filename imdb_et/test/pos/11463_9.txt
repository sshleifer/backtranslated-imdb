I saw this movie originally at Times Square in the late 1980s. Who would have thought that this film would create two sequences and would have followed this cult. The night of the demons was like most of the other films that came out at that time. Take the thought that the formula is still in use and seems to be still working, as saw II, which I saw recently. <br /> <br /> I saw Mimi Kinkadet in the Fangoria Convention six years ago and she was so gentle! I think he's a pretty good actor if he could make a career in playing the demon that had a woman in all these horror stories. the movie still holds up. Slightly slow at the beginning when I remembered it for the first time, but then it speeds up quickly. One of the eighties horror classics and worth a look!
