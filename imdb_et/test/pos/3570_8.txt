This film is one that spends a short time, entertainment, but who could do it in a country where it has nothing that stands for "Colombia". Who is looking for the topics of supposed Colombia or socially and politically correct cinema, and what it is "in danger", is better than the film. Some drug traffic or struggle is not a reference to either the farmer and the worker, or the wing of immigration or robbery policy. The corrupt police are a person who could be Mexico, Russia, Italy or China, as well as a personality protagonist, an Argentine photographer, that could be Venezuela, Peru or the Philippines and frequent "boludo". in their parliaments, it could be replaced by the slang of another country without any change in person or history. What matters is that it is a very well-read history with pictures and right performances. Its quality is almost a TV movie, but good. The fact that one such film, if it deserves or does not deserve support from the public, is a bit of a classical discussion of "the Mamer."
