The last few years have seen many famous singers and Ray Charles story, "Ray", have a lot in common with "Walk the Line", which was made next year and told Johnny Cash's story. Money and Charles were almost accurate contemporary, both born in the early thirties and dead in 2003/04. Both grew in poverty in southern America. Both lost their brother in childhood accident. Both achieved success in the 1950s. Both experienced problems with marriages and both were drug-dependent. All these issues are highlighted in both films. There are also similarities with Ron Howard's "A Beautiful Mind". Although this film was a mathematician rather than a musician, he emphasized, like "Ray" and "Walk the Line", the role of his subject's wife in helping his wife overcome his problems. > Ray Charles was born in 1930 to a single mother in a poor black community in Georgia. (His original name was Raymond Charles Robinson, but when he started his career as a musician, he dropped his last name to avoid confusion with Boxer Sugar Ray Robinson). In some ways, Charles was even harder than cash, with two additional drawbacks in the form of his darkness and racism, affecting all black Americans, especially in the south. Charles had a particularly traumatic childhood that showed his younger brother George's death in a drowning accident and blinded about a year or two years later. He seems to have been haunted by nightmares and guilt during George's death throughout his life. <br /> <br /> The first half of the movie is rather slow and it is a normal rich rich show that shows the biological story of how young Charles is taught to play the piano, performs the nightclub and then rises up as a great artist who loves the beautiful Della Bea'd. The best scenes in this part of the movie are the rebounds of Charles's childhood. Colored glass bottles hanging from the tree in front of his house are effectively repetitive; maybe it was one of his few visual memories of his life before he went blind. There is also a memorable scene where teenagers Charles destroys a bus driver who has biased him, letting him on his bus when pretending to have lost sight of Omaha beach (In fact he would have been thirteen at Normandy landing). <br /> <br /> The other side of the movie becomes more interesting when it moves to a more controversial territory, focusing on Charles's drug addiction, his marriage problems due to his interaction with Margie Hendricks, one of his supporters. and his battles against racism. At the beginning of the 1960s, Charles caused a feeling of refusal to play in a racially isolated audience in Georgia (although, contrary to what the film says, it did not cause him to be banned in the country). He also fought for racial division in the music industry himself, presenting not only traditionally "black" musical styles, such as the gospel and rhythm and blues, but also traditionally "white", such as the state and the west (which many black Americans have read music that chooses the red neck community ). <br /> <br /> As noted by The Guardian filmmaker Peter Bradshaw, "Ray" is a sunny film that diplomatically turns away from the darker side of things. It does not mention issues such as the death of Charles's beloved mother Aretha during her teen years, her short marriage to Eileen Williams in the early fifties and her possible divorce from Della Bea in 1977. number of illegal children. Here are similarities to "A Beautiful Mind", which also left a lot of contradictory details about his personal life, including divorce. <br /> <br /> Ray Charles fans will definitely enjoy the music film, but it is also worth watching for those who don't know much about it, mainly as a result of Jamie Foxx's Oscar winning title role, reproducing Charles's motifs so we think we are actually watching the blind, although Foxx itself is visible. (Unlike Joaquin Phoenix, "Walk the Line" did not make Foxx his song - no doubt Charles's distinctive singing win was too difficult to reproduce). He gets some other performers, especially Sharon Warren, like Aretha and Kerry Washington, as Della Bea. The film is uneven and long-lasting, but still rewarding. 7/10
