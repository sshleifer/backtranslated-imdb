I've seen the streets of Lonesome Dove, Dead Man's Walk and Laredo and now return to Loneome Dove. If you're hungry after watching Lonesome Dove, it will fill your stomach. Great cast, great story. Definitely, Lonesome Dove is close. I buy this movie to add to my collection. This is the best or at least my favorite Jon Voight performance. He's a captain call. Lou Gossett Jr., who plays Isom Picket, is not someone I am messing up with, he has a bad ass perspective. William Peterson is doing a good job. Rick Schroder is back with Newt, who has filled with astonishment that reminds me of his blunt NYPD Blue. My only problem with this movie (and that is really picking up the bitches) is that I had the impression that Call wanted to be "the first man to grazing Montana cattle", and it is obvious that Dunnigan had been there for some time. Slightly inconsistent, but just forgotten if you lose yourself in a fantastic story. I especially love the obvious growth of Jasper Fant and John Johnson. I watched this movie many times and I'm ready for the second sequel.
