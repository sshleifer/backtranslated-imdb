Loved this movie, which is a hoot. Rupert and Julie are great with Rupert, who is almost against poker with Julie's animation that worked well. Laura did a good job as a sublime mother. Julie is, of course, wonderful as usual. Although this film keeps you laughing mostly from time to time, it also has it when it is next to the movie because it removes the secrets of the main characters' lives. Interestingly, this was titled Driving, because it might lead you to believe that this is the main feature of the film, which is not directly, although it could definitely be considered "Ben" in the end of his life. Like most things that are funny in life, there is always a sad side and in this movie there are some moving moments. Very enjoyable movie and it's worth watching.
