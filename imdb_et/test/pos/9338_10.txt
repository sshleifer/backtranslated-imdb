This is undoubtedly the big mommy of all the music videos !!! Unlike most music videos, which are "dance videos" of poorly erected and / or badly interrupted words, it was done correctly. Jackson was co-author and VH1 proof of choreography and guiding his masterpiece. In fact, it could be said that Thriller is horrible, the most horror films with this last sparkling eye. For me, this music video is what you understand all other music videos. You can easily see the malicious effect that M.J. had during the early break with the zombie route number. Dance, comedy, storyline and yes horror. I'll give him 5 out of 5.
