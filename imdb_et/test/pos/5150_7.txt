I enjoy the anthem. I enjoy the national anthem, if nothing else, just before Midnight News, I imagine I play in the band. Not as easy as you think! One two three four; One two three four; but what? So I have the sympathy for the practicing bass drum player Roy Andersson's superb movie, patiently waiting for his 70-year-old cassette player to be heard. <br /> <br /> The motif of the 70s seems to be the continuation of all classical, breathable furniture. In addition, each scene has a nervous jade wash that reveals the finest minute nuances of action. <br /> <br /> What brings me to Jessika Lundberg's outstanding purple boots. Boots that would otherwise have inspired the Silk Cult advertising campaign. <br /> <br /> But it's complicated. Someone asked me what it was. Well, there's a scene where the opening line "I'm not that tall in green" Brilliant. Straight out of Gary Larson's box. <br /> <br /> I can't say what it is. Go see for yourself. <br /> <br /> Ron Plasma <br /> <br /> Hmm. Larson! Sounds in Swedish <br /> <br /> (Viewed 15Apr08)
