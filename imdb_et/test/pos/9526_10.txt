I think all the reviewers have captured this movie very well. I've seen it many times, but I still feel joy and warmth as I did for the first time. My emotional response to this film does not seem to disappear. The final scene will definitely bring me to tears, but for a birthday party between Perks and children. And kindly gentleman. Something else is happening with this character. A great provider and solver of problems. He knows everything and has connections everywhere. The perfect father who runs and makes us feel safe. I don't know how the film does it, but it concerns something very deep in English that has long gone from our daily experience, but we all know and miss it again.
