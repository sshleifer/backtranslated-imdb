Buster Keaton was undoubtedly her most enjoyable when she made a short 20-minute movie, and they didn't come out more ridiculously than the pearl. The dead pan comedian participates in the photographic mixing with the desired bully. This leads to its complicated evasion of a number of street police and passengers who feel their "desired" signs. Kits are a choc-a block that has a brilliant place of gags, from the opening scene to the bread order, until the end of the excellent lift. Keaton's film never feels like silence because it never needs sound. His films explain himself through the wonderful (but incredibly dangerous) things he did. It's not hard to see how influential he really was - the man is so amazing today as he was in 1921.
