I watched this movie for the first time since the book was finished last week. What's the problem here? People admit that performances are great - I mean, Lange is a star! - And that the movie looks good, but it's less than '6'! I can't get it. Come on! Writing is not so bad! <br /> <br /> Having read many of Pulitzer's winning novels and having seen many of their films, I think a job with a better job was done to bring a manuscript. I thought that the downfall of the dialogue in the novel was almost perfect. This story was quite a dialogue, and the story rose on the screen, despite the fact that only part of it was used. <br /> <br /> ** PART OF THE LIBRARY ** However, I was a little disappointed with the exclusion of the Ginny-kill-Rose subregion. I thought it was one of the most emotionally flattering parts of the book, but it was probably a good bet to leave it. Avid movie visitors, more than eager readers, think they are less forgiving for protagonists who are pulling contradictory things. It is confusing to mix Johnny Lunchpail and Joe Sixpack. <br /> <br /> If you love this book, this movie likes it. If you hated the book, you probably hate the movie. <br /> <br /> ******** <br /> <br /> Rog
