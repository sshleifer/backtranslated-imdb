A lot has already been written about the film, so instead of adding noise, I just want to say a few words about two female actors. <br /> <br /> It must be a frustrating prospect for every actor to celebrate in some ways compared to the remarkable Monica Bellucci, but Romane Bohringer pulls it on sensational ends. Monica Bellucci starring in the movie, where I love another girl? It shouldn't happen. <br /> <br /> It's said it's a thousand times, but Monica Bellucci hits the saddest picture in today's cinema. I've never seen such an inborn sadness before. He would not have met the heart of Lon Chaney.
