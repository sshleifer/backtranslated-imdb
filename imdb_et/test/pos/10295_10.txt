I watched this movie for the second time today for about three years and it was as wonderful as before ... <br /> <br /> There's more than a dozen trilogy of up to three stunning French movies en couer de hiver and all of them are special . This movie is one of them. True joy with so many great things he gets from respecting Hitchcock to two beautiful ladies in Romanes and Monica. Although Monica is very beautiful, Romane is a very sexy lady and steals a lot of her living beings. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure why people think this movie is complicated because the scenes are such a perfect mix of the past and play the spectacular journey of the actor just flowing, and you hardly realize that 116 minutes beauty and mystery have been seen fascinated and spellbound. <br /> <br /> Like most French and European films, this story never goes over the Atlantic because no studio takes magic without this life being blotted out of Hollywood, which is common in most of the lost films in translation. Americans make great movies, but not this kind of ... maybe if they let this person like young Polanski work, maybe they wouldn't be a full butcher in English ... <br /> <br /> who do not look at subtitled movies that you spend in life with unknown bliss. For those who can read it, you spit on such movies ... <br /> <br /> I would describe it as Neo-Franco-Noir, but just the cheese that called this movie elite. . I think I saw him adding four and twenty pies. She thinks Romane Bohringer is a kind of French mayonnaise ... It's natural that Pulp Fiction is artistic ... but more with Gallic savoire faire ... <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 ... and has anyone got a Romane phone number ... he's the perfect French salad dresser ...
