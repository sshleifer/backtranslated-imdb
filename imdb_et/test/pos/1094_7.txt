It should not be too critical of the director's second feature. <br /> <br /> I like Madiba's camera work. As Mr Shawn pointed out, he had a unique way of looking at things. <br /> <br /> But how can a 14-year-old boy shoot such beautiful pictures? Remember that he has not received any education. I don't think English is the language spoken in the Cape Town ghettos. Worse, Madiba seems even smaller than her 14-year-old. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you go beyond the above-mentioned features, you can watch the movie and enjoy it for a beautiful job.
