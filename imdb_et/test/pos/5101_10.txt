I would like it to be open to film music for the first time when it was first released, as some comments had been. It's really a treasure. To be fair, I have not seen any goodbye, Mr Chips and I do not want to. For me, this is the perfect version. I saw it for the first time in TCM years ago and never forgot it. I was happy to see it with my girlfriend yesterday, although I had previously registered it on TCM Day. The parts of the film where both of us were tears, this is really a moving film. <br /> <br /> And shouldn't that be what the movies are? <br /> <br /> The music is beautiful, the movie is wonderful. Action is the upper limit. And the story is delicate and timeless. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite films.
