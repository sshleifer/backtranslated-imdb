William H. Macy always gives good results. She never looks lazy and never seems to be anywhere else. In short, it is what more participants should be. "Mild Cases of Murder" is directed by Steven Schachter, who made two more big films with Macy (Door to Door, The Wool Cap). <br /> <br /> Television films have long been over-acting, poor cinematography, and sub-standard scripting. That's why it's so refreshing to see a television movie that does exactly what the movie is about. A small story (not a simplified story) that doesn't need to be viewed on the big screen. <br /> <br /> "Lightweight murder case" is a light, entertaining price and a great watch. <Br /> <br /> 7.6 out of 10
