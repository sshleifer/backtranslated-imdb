A group of scary teenagers are going to the former funeral hall for Halloween. They get trapped and the demons that they accidentally woke up. The overwhelming teenagers will kill others and seem to be leading Angela (Mimi Kinkade), who swims and speaks with a really deep voice. The rest of the teenagers who have not yet fired are forced to fight the demons and try to escape from the house. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty decent horror movie with very special effects, including Linnea Quigley (who is a couple of nude scenes, as usual), going out of the boy's eyeballs and slipping her nipple into lipstick. There is also a scene where a couple has a sexy coffin and a boy who bites his tongue. This is a great movie that you can watch with a bunch of friends late at night, while sealing. The terrible and cruel dialogue, however, almost destroys it. In general I would give it ten out of ten.
