I saw "Begotten" last night and I'm in the movie with two senses. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, I appreciate the complete inversion of the Michael Bay movie. There is no dialogue, extremely stylized grained black and white photography, some really terrifying images ever set for the film, and a very convincing use of the sound (which no one else really looks really like). This is a reflection of the subject, and it dares to go where most filmmakers are not only in terms of images, but in terms of production and concept. This is a movie that most people do not understand, and when you read these comments, you will find many people whose inability to portray this film will result in them seeing "pretentiousness" that is worshiping. bars of this cage during feeding. It was really shocked and disturbed by me, and the last time the film was able to do that was a while ago. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it is thirty minutes short, reaching over an hour and a half. I understand that the use of repetitions and monolithic attacks as a drop can be of artistic value, but in such a case it simply does not help to put everything together. Imagine a rapid man approaching the street, grabbing you with the shoulders and saying something that is interfering with the core of your being ... but when you leave your broken and beaten awake, he just speaks and talks and talks. At the end of the movie, I found myself now and again at my watch. <br /> <br /> It's not entertainment, people. This is disappointing. This is how you program people who just looked at Glitter. When you watch entertainment movies, it disturbs you, interferes with you and maybe anger. You're not like "Born" like a chocolate cake you want to eat, because it tastes good. You approach it like a menu you haven't heard before, something you see in the kitchen through the door, something dark and glowing and pulling on your plate; something you order is not because it tastes good, but because you just have to know what it is.
