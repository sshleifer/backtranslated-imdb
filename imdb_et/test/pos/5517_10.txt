I liked the film and the fact that it was more like handling high-experienced material. I saw the movie in preview, and it wasn't spoiled by some stupid video boxes that ended up corrupted. The performances were pretty good, especially Andrew McCarthy's mature roll. I also liked the appearance of the film, which gave it mysterious and banning air. I also enjoyed some of the "twists" on the plot and didn't want to give it too much if the video boxes of other countries didn't give it away! The script was sometimes a little up, but I appreciated the fact that filmmakers were not afraid to challenge the audience for interesting and enigmatic purposes concerning the roll of faith in our world. And while some may find the end somewhat too open, I appreciated that the film refused to bow to the bow. It's not how life works.
