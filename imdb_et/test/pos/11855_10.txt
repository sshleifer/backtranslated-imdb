Intense, funny, witty and nothing else - social comedy for adult dating and its results - be it good or bad. Mohr and Nicholson are working a few months after the wedding day, when a strange event in their engagement department forces Nicholson to reconsider his relationship and start with other people so he does not feel so contemptuous about his sexual experience. This causes a catastrophe of events after Mohri, Nicholson and their cohort. Very intelligent and necessary during this clumsy, outgoing comedy that includes the usual comic, sexual and frustrated characters (especially Charles due to sexual frustration ... very annoying) who even seem to have the right feeling for this heart seemed to comment. <br /> <br /> Film moves as the movies should show these days that boys are sensitive to heart and have morals. Most of the male characters are moral, direct eyes, while the woman is fresh-faced riders who do not let any joy. The boys appreciate the message they have given to men with their own respect, but it is easy to assume that the majority of men who see this film are using this men's sensitivity message that covers all the flaws or signs that a woman can ruin. However, the writing formula uses this as a tool to pave the way for this male leader, especially Mohr, Richter and the director to find a salesman! <br /> <br /> Women are by far the most confusing, because they are not talking about anything but pleasure and what ... against someone else. Although they have friendly features, they are covered with kittens related to sex. Very funny stuff. <br /> <br /> On the second level, the film follows some of its ensembles for different relationships. Richter meets a tight divorce (a very remarkable and remarkable performance by always trusted Helen Slater) called Penelope, separated from her son, who hates her for sharing with her father. As the two go deeper into relationships, the human interest is revealed, and both the comedy and the tragedy of divorce are explored, as well as re-starting. At the end of the film, Mohr and Nicholson have become more profound to see what is next, and what they have learned from each other and from themselves is to decide what to come next. It will become appropriate and dramatic just in time. <br /> <br /> The Wallodorsk direction is emulated very well when the characters learn to face each other after they have happened ... at the right end. <br /> All in all, this movie should have appeared nationwide and I hope it will be for some Academy Award ... maybe Helen Slater will finally get her recognition. Anywho, this movie is not a hit, give it all that you have a romantic sexual career that is very mature and aesthetic. <br /> <br /> Great movie!
