This movie is one of the funniest years. A movie about death and funeral without being frustrating or irreversible. In this charming romance, Christopher Walken offers a great deal of comedy, and I hardly struggle to start laughing. <br /> <br /> I saw a movie preview and when it was over, the audience was not only praiseworthy, but also joyful. I'll tell all my friends that they would look at its arrival in the US. I'm sure I plan to see it again in the theater and buy it from the DVD as soon as it's available.
