Meatballs have been the main food for my family for over 26 years! We saw this movie when it first came out and since tens of times has seen it. Bill Murray is his best and touches most scenes where he reaches out to a lonely boy boy and communicates with him while at the same time driving his CITs with a predatory scheme after another! The characters are fun and funny, and you really came to take care of them and their relationships. This is not yet another fool, stupid, teen sex-fest. It's funny and cute and just fun. Anyone who sees it enjoys himself. It's a must-see. Watch out for Spazit - he's definitely the best! (Especially during the camp, social - if Bill Murray hugs it for the camera - just watch Spazit behind him dancing with the poor girl he's dancing with!)
