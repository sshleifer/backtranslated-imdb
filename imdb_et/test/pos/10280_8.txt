Not all films should have a predictable end we all use, and it's nice to see movies with really unusual twists. However, I was really disappointed with l'apartment termination. In my opinion, the end was not the end of the rest of the film, and it essentially destroyed the story. <br /> <br /> You spend the whole movie discovering all and their feelings, but the events in the last 2 minutes of the film would have greatly influenced everyone's character, but the movie ends and leaves it too wide open. <br /> <br /> Overall, although this movie was very well done and unlike similar movies like Serendipity, all the scenes were plausible and didn't go over.
