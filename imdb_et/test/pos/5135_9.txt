It's an amazing pearl of the movie, unfortunately, it's "just for kids". The plot is being turned around by a young man, Roy Eberhardt, who came from Montana to Florida in the southwest. In an attempt to reconcile with other children in his high school, Roy is discovering a brother-sister team who is trying to protect an endangered construction site on an illegal construction site. Check out Carl Hiassen, the author of the book that is the basis for this film, as the secretary of the evil supporter of the company headquarters. Writer / director Wil Shriner is also an official of the Public Registers Bureau, where reluctant teenagers discover that there is no accusing environmental statement. Luke Wilson steals almost all the important scenes from charming teen actors who have the most of the best features. Wilson is a bumblebee policeman in his tricycle trolley with a blue light and a funky siren. As a Dave official, he tries to do so hard, but usually it literally comes! Many times! Jimmy Buffet is a rather low key as a defensive science teacher. But young actors, Logan Lerman (Roy), Brie Larson (Beatrice Bear) and Cody Linley (Mullet Fingers), are great as teenagers who finally tried Officer Dave on the right track, following the paper trail left by the evil boss. I hope you come out of this movie as well as I do. Just fun! One small complaint. I hope that all non-Floridians understand that not all people from Florida are the same heroes as the newcomers, as shown in this film. We're a really friendly bunch! Just ask Carl Hiassen and Jimmy Buffet!
