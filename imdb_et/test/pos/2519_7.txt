As far as "The Beginning" showed that we still get "classic" x files, Drive showed that X-Files is going to explore the new territory. They are going to give us a unique car with camera-shot shots. It was an interesting transition from TV to real events. I would have liked it even if they had kept this newsletter for the whole teaser and not cut into the car. Looking at this episode in 1998, I thought, "Am I on the right channel?" This first Scully autopsy put me in big words that I don't understand. I think she learned her lesson always to wear a mask before autopsy. Silly Scully! What is Autopsy Laboratory Lighting? It's as dark as the tomb there! How should they see what they do there? Deputy Director Kersh gets his first lines in this episode. I have no love for this person. She is the third recurring character to be introduced to love hate, the first two are Diana Fowley and Jeffrey Spender. I think the producers felt that there was too much love for Mulder, Scully and Skinner. So they had to add some characters to give our favorite agents some grief and incite our shirt as fans. I love Scully and his team's quarantine suits with cool helmet pears. Boy. At night, the DRY in North Nevada is very smoky or foggy. Can we say the word "effect"? Drive is a cool episode, but looking at route 36 on my US atlas, Mulder cannot keep the speed of 70-100 MPH on this path. If he had been in the I-80, maybe there was a motorway. But in this way the curved road does not have any chance. Filming the whole car seemed very authentic. Rob Bowman's great job. It seems that the obvious days or blows of the blue screen that are outside the car outside the car are on stage. It was a fun episode, but some inaccuracies keep it from a big episode. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, so keep it fast!
