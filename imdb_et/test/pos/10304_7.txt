It's not an easy film that would first like the leading figures, but luckily the heart and soul of the film are the performance of Paula Sage, which directs the film in plain waters and goes beyond a rather uncomfortable story. It gives the film a true sense of truth and makes you think you have seen something special. (7/10)
