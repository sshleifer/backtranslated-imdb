Recently, I discovered this fantastic series and I just can't feel getting enough of Garner's retrospective PI. The performances consistently show great writing and alternating episodes. <br /> <br /> This episode, in hand, is slightly different. Forsaking humor in favor of a more serious appeal to Rockford when he is looking for his missing girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Mystery is great and this unraveling is convincing enough. It is based on a book (does not remember the name) and would be easily extended to the episode of the length of the function. Garner stands out here because Rockford is tough and really means business. It has a "noir" feeling all the time, dark lighting and general mood in the 40's and 50's big dark thriller. <br /> <br /> Really good A-class series. Just worth 10.
