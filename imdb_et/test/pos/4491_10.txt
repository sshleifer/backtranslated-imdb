I will never forget the nursing effect that this exhibition had for me for the first time. From the moment the Major is amazed by the clown that his embarrassing attempts to understand the situation ("We are alive, we are people, we must have memories!" Inaccurate quotation, but close), this riveting drama is his wise attempt to improvise the means of escape. <br /> <br /> The small touches will remain on the observer for a long time. The moment when the beautiful ballerinas dancing to all, Scottish musician pound-colored bagpipes; Tramp's delightful note: "Miss is as good as a mile", the main shook the conclusion that they must be in hell. <br /> <br /> This is a great episode, beautifully written and acted. The breathtaking beauty of Susan Harrison adds a strange, touching story memorable.
