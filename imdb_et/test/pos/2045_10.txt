Because of this movie, I'm a fan of Geena Davis. I've always loved Samuel L Jackson. And two are doing a great pair on the screen. That said, I think TLKG is the best activity I've ever seen, forget the twist-ends that viewers are now waiting for and filmmakers are now trying to (mostly fail) to include their movies. <br /> <br /> 10/10
