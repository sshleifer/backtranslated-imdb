This gives the ordinary person / girl the opportunity to be a television ad as her favorite star. <br /> <br /> Most of the time it sounds like the singer they represent. <br /> <br /> Another twist - the team with people and customers dresses up as a singer. They may not look like these, but the probability that someone who sounds exactly like it is very thin. <br /> <br /> It's your Saturday night fun and contestants aren't t raging wannabes as they have another TV song show. The fact that there are no awards involved and that is fun means that it attracts other types of people. <br /> <br /> The only crack I have is with the Kids version - they seem to have done this stage school - what happened to ordinary kids?
