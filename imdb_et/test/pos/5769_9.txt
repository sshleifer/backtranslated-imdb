A sign of what to expect in this movie when I noticed that it was the first (and probably the last) film to have its own "vomiting technician" credit. <br /> <br /> In a couple of hours, stupid gags, fun violence, and great blast humor. <br /> <br /> This movie was just what you were waiting for from Bottom's boys, and it's good to see them at their best after the life-threatening accident of Rik Mayall. <br /> <br /> Richie (Mayall) and Eddie (Edmondson) are too similar to their basic characters when we get any criticism at all, and Edmondson is doing a surprisingly good job of guiding the film. <br /> <br /> This movie has already given rise to predictable comparisons with Fawlty Towers, which is simply not the case, and Guest House Paradiso is hardly Torquay! <br /> <br /> Watch some of the greatly designed dialogues between all violence and chaos. <br /> <br /> If you don't like Bottom, you probably hate it - but I loved it.
