It's less visceral than the only other Tsai movie I've seen ("Vive L'amour"), but the idea of ​​door openings (holes) for other emotions and existences is vividly depicted here, because Tsai's a long shot after long shooting. , usually with long techniques, which refers to the sense of alienation in Taipei. Grace Chang's inspired musical interludes are amazing, but welcomes militants that add new dimensions to the slowly evolving relationship between a young top and a downward woman. It's not necessarily easy to watch a movie (though it is by no means difficult) so I warn all random viewers looking for some "indie" entertainment (like Tarantino or Guy Ritchie). But if you want to know something about urban isolation in Taiwan and something more universal about city alienation and romantic longing, check out this movie now.
