Octavio Paz, a Mexican poet, writer and diplomat, who received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1990, said "Nazarini": "Nazarin follows the great tradition of mad Spanish by Cervantes. His madness lies in taking big big ideas and trying to live accordingly". The humble and spiritual priest (Francisco Rabal in a great performance) tries to live on the principles of Christianity, but has been extradited from his church to help the local prostitute by giving him asylum after the murder. Nazarin travels through the 20th century Mexico's turning-point highway, offering help to the poor and the beginnings of food. His two followers, the murderous prostitute Andara and his sister Beatriz, who have been unsuccessful suicides who are desperately seeking love, find him holy, but this does not prevent him from hating and humiliating both the church and the people he meets on the roads. He comes to jail and begins to doubt his belief that he cannot forgive his attacker. <br /> <br /> In Bunuel, the story says with a Christian parable masterfully and uniquely, combining admiration and irony with the main character and strong criticism of formal religion and hypocrisy. The film is simple and deep and beautiful, ironic and heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> I think Bunuel is one of the best filmmakers. I've seen twenty of his films and they all belong to different periods of their lives, but they have a common magic touch, a sharp combination of realism and surrealism, his curiosity, curious mind, sense of humor, and his blind and brilliant fantasies. With great joy, I add to my list of favorite films a little-seen and almost unknown but amazingly sincere and touching surreal tragic comedy "Nazarini".
