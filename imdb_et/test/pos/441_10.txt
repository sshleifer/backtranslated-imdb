"French Cancan" is one of my favorite musicians. This is a great movie. There's color, humor, music. This is a very good portrait of the so-called Belle Ã‰poque, although Jean Reno's priorities were always to create creation, fantasy. So the film is not a historical film. The final sequences of girls dancing in canvas are unforgettable pictures. This is a movie you shouldn't forget.
