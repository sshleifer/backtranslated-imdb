I always think of Mr Firth as Dorian Gray when I live 100. <br /> <br /> Perfectly acting and leading, bringing Oscar Wilde's understanding, intelligence and humor to life, with absolute and perfect perfection on television > <br /> More evidence that the BBC is more than a talent that's not always in the money. <br /> <br /> Must be for all Wilde fans and indeed for everyone else. Inspired and perfected, each participant seemed exactly the right role and each shot was well done. <br /> <br /> Finally, I found that I loved every character so that no other type was ever inspired. Check it out, then try looking at the second version. It's not just the same, right?
