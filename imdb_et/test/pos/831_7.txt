This is Van Damme's best direct DVD effort I've seen. Van Damme plays a border guard who is unable to stop heroin smugglers trying to enter the United States. The action of this movie is excellent and the fighting scenes are the best of Van Damme. Costar Scott Adkins shows why he should be the next big star in the martial arts genre. For further evidence, see "Undisputed 2". Adkins is so good that before I looked at "The Shepherd," I thought Van Damme might not be very credible when he hit the screen. Van Damme has his own hand and although he is not as sporty as Adkins, he may still be the best. All the scenes in this movie fight are very well done and arms battles are also above average for this type of film. The only negative thing about this movie is that the story is a little underdeveloped. I think Van Damme's motifs should have been made in the film before, especially as to why he's wearing a rabbit. The reason he does this is very cool, but you won't find it before the end. There are other things that have never really been explained, but this is Van Damme's film, so you know where the priority lies in making such a movie, and it's not a character. In general, this is a solid action film that I recommend. So run the Damme border!
