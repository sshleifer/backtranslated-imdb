Fantastic cinema experience. I really enjoyed this truly wonderful movie theater when it came out. There is nothing to add except what is a terrible shame that the AMPAS (American Academy) has not yet received Mr Albert Finney. After roles in movies such as Tom Jones, Orient Express murder, Volcano (just a few - for them he was an Oscar candidate), Dresser is probably his highlight, but ... <br /> I know , Oscars are just a popularity contest, but when Americans like British actresses and actors ("and Oscar goes" Jeremy Irons, Daniel Day-Lewis, Anthony Hopkins, Emma Thompson, Glenda Jackson, etc!), Why did they always continue to chip Finney blank with your hands? <br /> <br /> On the other hand, they gave John Wayne and Marisa Tome (Cousin Vinny). I don't know if I should laugh or cry. <br /> <br /> If you have seen two leaders in Dresser, you will not forget the art of the show. Watch this movie and have fun! I recommend it to anyone who loves art. <br /> <br /> I give this great movie 9/10 (1 point missing from non-cinematographic material, after all it's just a theater) <br /> <br /> Note: My criteria are in IMDb much bigger (10 only for a cinema masterpiece that should / could last forever).
