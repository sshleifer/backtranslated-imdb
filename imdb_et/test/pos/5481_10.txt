I really love action / adventure movies and this is one of the best. Of course, we love the stars of this genre, Bruce Willis, Sly Stallone, Clint Eastwood, Kurt Russell, Arnold Schwarzenegger and the rest, but this is a story that really counts. The best ones are somewhat feasible, but we can withstand those that are a little up, like in the comic book. The more turns, the more challenging the heroes are involved and the more shocking moments in the movie; The more we do / action fans enjoy them. The "Fire Line" has all the elements that are needed for a thrilling thriller. It is Clint Eastwood, a nearly retired secret service provider, who is haunted by one bad moment of failure. This is one of the most evil, despicable, manic villains of John Malkovich, the type where you can't wait to see him, "get him". Rene Russo is a "love interest". It has turns, a random shock, and even a touch of heat and humor. Director Wolfgang Petersen does it very well and has a great Ennio Morricone score. This is a true thriller for the thriller! Don't miss it!
