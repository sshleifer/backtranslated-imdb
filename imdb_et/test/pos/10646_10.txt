/ * may contain SPOILERS, but of course it is not important :) * / <br /> <br /> The battleship Potemkin is one of the most beautiful pictures. The visual direction is (well and is) inspiring, the film's scope is impressive and the technique is definitely a pioneer. What's really amazing is, in my opinion, the depth and effectiveness of the film, lacking the correct literary script, sound (record soundtrack), decent picture quality, faux-deep (self) reference, today's exceptional action, pretense, and so on. What you want is a purely visual experience that needs to be remembered. <br /> <br /> BTW, the previous poster said: "Eisenstien felt great after suffering to give the heroes what they wanted. You think Eisenstein is building a great final struggle and then he tricks you. I'd rather have seen a huge final step. "<br /> <br /> I have to warn you that the end is not cheap and Eisenstein was not generous to the heroes. But history was. Potemkin really went through the squadron, as it was shown on the film. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would strongly recommend to see Battleship Potemkin for someone who is more or less seriously interested in cinema. Look at it with a colleague who kept me talking for a while. However, if you tend to consider films that are generally recognized as "big" or "classic" to be "slow" or "boring", this movie may not be for you. There is not much cheap entertainment here. <br /> <br /> For me, however, it is a complete 10/10.
