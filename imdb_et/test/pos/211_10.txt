For the first time in a disappointed network television program, I remember "Police Squad!" It was completely random. It was a show during the first network that began in ABC in early 1982. I am a chronic channel surfer and I chose the choice one evening when an unexpected "Police Team!" I immediately recognized it as "M-Squad" opening credit with Lee Marvin, one of my favorite music of all time. I finished surfing. Then, of course, the headquarters came to shoot, followed by the immortal Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln. By now I said to myself, "What the hell is that?" Then came the "special guest star" Georg Stanford Brown, which became flat safe. I was stuck from that moment. The episode was "Fear / Dangerous Challenge", whose comics were referred to by "On the Waterfront" and "Muhammad Ali", but the most memorable were all viewpoints and non-organizers. Les Marin and Paul Newlan's "M Squad" in the open parody were Leslie Nielsen and Alan North's absolute rebellion. "Finally," I told me, "The network television program is really worth !!!". Don't you know that it will only be canceled a few weeks later. Leave it on the networks - I should have known. Anyway, I just bought a DVD collection of all six episodes and they're just as funny today as 27 years ago. "Naked Gun" films were also terrible, but I really missed Alan North (he was as good as Ed Hocken), Peter Lupus as Nordberg (what did they think about this part of OJ?) And especially William Duell's "Johnny" pair of shoes. Good stuff.
