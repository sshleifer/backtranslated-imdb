Anthony Quinn is a champion of heart and sympathy. He depicts a Romanian peasant whose IQ is below the average harassed by his wife. It is World War II and the Nazis have taken over their country. Soon he finds he digs in the depths, hoping to benefit his wife. The Nazis have different ideas. In the coming years, we will look at events through our naive eyes, but all he wants to do is go home. His manipulations and bad luck he just passed on hot water. Finally, we see our image on the cover of "Der Spiegel" as a perfect treasure because of his own fault. The war ends and the Allies put it to war crimes. But all our peasants want to do to return to their wife.
