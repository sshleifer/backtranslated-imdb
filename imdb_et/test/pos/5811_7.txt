Like the great fan of Hammer Studios and the enthusiastic follower of their Gothic horror movies, I mean, that took me so long to start watching my TV series "Hammer House of Horror", which lasted only one season in 1980. I saw the first four episodes in the show, I can say that it satisfies my expectations so far. Although this first episode of "Witching Time" may not be the most imaginative Horror story ever said, it does not give the amazing Gothic atmosphere that I love Hammer movies from the 50s to 70s. a spooky story and within five minutes they create a real fool. David Winter (Jon Finch), the composer of the film, is tortured by the 17th-century witch Lucinda (Patricia Quinn) ... Although her story may be simple, for less than an hour it is effective and offers a lot of horrible moments. Northern Ireland actor Patricia Quinn, who is probably best known for her role in "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" (1975), as well as the fantastic Monty Python comedy "Monty Python Life Concept" (1983), has a wonderfully malicious role in her role as a glove . Jon Finch is also pretty good as David, and although Prunella Gee, who plays his adulterous actor, may never be the best actor, he's definitely nice to watch. The episode is accompanied by a nice score that plays well in the atmosphere. In general, "Witching Time" is a very fun episode with several really horrible moments and a decent opener.
