I didn't expect a lot of rent for this movie because many independent films seem to be a bit overpriced these days (well, Hollywood movies on this issue), but this movie was fantastic, really big, it's too bad it didn't reach the big audience because it's just great. I really love Alice's determination, it really makes me look at my life as a gift and I see how privileged I am just education. But all this proves that this film proves that a good artist can talk about good style, no matter what the budget is, it's a great movie and everyone should watch it, they love it and definitely learn something about it. I don't have to be roger ebert to find out that this is one of the best films I've seen during the year, and certainly one of the most true.
