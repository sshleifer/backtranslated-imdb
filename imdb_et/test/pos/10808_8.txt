If there were two parts that GÃ©rard Depardieu, a physically hugging, ugly, charismatic actor, was born in French, it must be Cyrano de Bergerac and the orator Georges Danton. Here he dominates the film, both through his shoulder width and his voice; his charisma is part of the fact that it is clear that the character has as much blood as elsewhere. Danton's celebrations, as the people of Paris are starving ... but he's one man who can challenge the tyranny set by the cruel safety committee for freedom, and he's been presented as a movie hero. despite the fact that the source plays virtually his opponent Robespierre! <br /> <br /> For those who are familiar with history, there is an interest in identifying smaller parts: the frog-bound Tallien, the Couthon the criminal, the Fouquier-Tinville, the tribunal's prosecutor, the pubic St-Just, the epic artist David. However, the script cuts a little in this regard; Names are often delayed, if less significant signs are detected and there is no Hollywood style "info-dump" to make sure that the audience can place events in their historical context. It is taken for granted in the film that you know what has gone before and what will happen after that - sometimes it takes too much for it to rely on accurate knowledge of dates to give a tail to your tail. Robespierre followed Danton briefly for scaffolding. <br /> <br /> When it comes to the film, it is not entirely satisfactory as it slides to the end. The structure of the story brings great confrontations between the participants in the courtroom or some dramatic trial summit that will never happen in history. Things just burn: there is no rebellion, no tyranny, no power, no triumph on either side. It may be historically accurate, but it is not entirely satisfactory as a result of the screen scenario - there seems to be a strange stop. As others have commented, it might have been more logical to take events up to the end of Terror and show that Robespierre falls.
