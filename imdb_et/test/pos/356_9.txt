I saw what I believe is the best Australian film of the year, Jon Hewitt Acolytes. <br /> <br /> Acolytes is a stylish thriller with killer assumption. Get two bullied and molested teenagers in your suburbs discovering a local serum killer and then putting him out to tempt him who teased them. Hewitt has chosen the second half of cutting-edge casting, including superb newcomers Sebastian Gregory, Josua Payne and Hanna Mangan Lawrence. Add to these three, yes, that's the right three big psycho! Leader Joel Edgerton, who is a spectacular comedian du jour, Belinda McClory with her abducted husband and Michael Dorman as a teenage rape bully, with swastika tattoos. If you add these teenagers and they threaten adults, will all hell break up? Hewitt has built a wall-mounted thriller that is original and refillable. You'll see the effects of Larry Clark and David Lynch's Twin Peaks, but Hewitt will do it on his own, at the back of Qld's suburbs, always calling in empty tones. The manuscript of Shayne Armstong, Shane Krouse and Hewitt is tight. <br /> <br /> If it is marketed correctly, this film may be broken by teens. Next to Wolf Creek? It may be. It does all the right moves. Teenagers are the real area of ​​Larry Clark. They are no wonder and they have added a PC plan, they are not communicative, good looking and hip. The killers are dark, with a real threat. Joel Edgerton steals his scenes in an easy way with the local Ted Bundy, who sports a butterfly on his 4WD free area by John Fowles The Collector. Dorman's gasoline chief throws a threat from suburban Mayhem and offers a horrible thug who you can't wait to see to buy a farm. <br /> <br /> The movie is fast paced, harsh and brutal. Not only is it showing trust and mastery of the director from Hewitt, which is definitely a winning IF or AFI candidate, if not a prize! Its nuanced and poetic stuff, stylish sound, excellent cinematic film and dense structure clearly mark it as one of the most targeted Oz features I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> Film leaves you shaking, thinking and restless. This is a truly wonderful release to return to the Australian cinema genre. Certainly, Hollywood is interested. Oh, and did I mention it in Toronto? What other Oz feature films say so much? The world should prepare for the new author Jon Hewitt.
