From the beginning to the end, it seems that this classic double reel in Hal Roach's studio from 1926 appears to be fun in the 1920s. It is now celebrated by the forgotten comedy genius, Charley Chase, and was led by legendary Leo McCarey, who was then unknown, but served with Roach and kept greener pastures in the 30s and 40s. Recently, this video and disc has been released as one of the top ten screenings of the silent screen and should be viewed by audiences of all ages. Although today his star has almost diminished, in a few years of tacit years, a short topic for the comedy was Charley Chase. He helped Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy's career before they were made redundant, Leo McCarey and many other talents. It is a disgrace that he is all but is remembered today. Look at this little movie pearl. If you do, you are looking for other classic comics. He had over 300 movies and many of them lived. Discover this lost giant who has passed the era and its gigantic movie.
