Wayne Wang's direction can be an ingredient that made this film more impressive than the "Beverly Hills Slums", which includes a very similar land. The interaction between Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman is riveting. Real chemistry there. This film managed to bring me to the precarious life of these two women without being dragged into depressed frustration. Susan Sarandon's character hammers on all the nerves that a narcissistic parent can touch in an insecure adolescent. He can do it amazingly without being crazy or deliberately sadistic. And Natalie Portman directs every attack on her character's ego with the intelligence of an independent child of independence, which is not burned by the mystery of Natasha Lyonne's character in the "Beverly Hills Slums". Portman's character is a young man with stress, an extraordinary creature in today's films. The film comes to a very satisfactory resolution without being too difficult. I recommend this movie to a viewer who wants to be challenged and entertaining.
