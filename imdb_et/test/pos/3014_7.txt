CELL looked at me at first glance. I was a little surprised by this fact because the story of this movie is totally boring. If there was no story, the film would be better. Bunuels "Un chien andalou" is, in my opinion, a movie without a story, but also with exciting and sometimes disturbing images. But CELL was originally a Hollywood film and only a second piece of art. I am very interested in Tarsem's next project. Hamlet from India can be very interesting, especially if it looks the same as CELL. its a very modernist style.
