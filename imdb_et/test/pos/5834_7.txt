This is a hard show to watch. It's nothing to sit and relax. It kept me on the edge of my seat for several years. People are screwed, raped, tortured and die like flies. There are men everywhere, there are stools, bangs and blood. Oz is a brave show. This highlights issues such as racism, homosexuality, the reality of prisoners, and most importantly; - Death Penalty. This, in my opinion, is also a success, unlike, for example, one-time monitoring of Medium. <br /> <br /> It missed me sometimes. It had some strange story and they spent a lot of time with characters who just didn't interest me. Oddly enough, I found the 1st season quite boring. If I had followed it, if it was, I think I wouldn't have followed it. I love seasons 2 - 4. Seasons 5 and 6 are traceable (although I don't think the phrase "Cyril" and "Death Row" should be allowed in the same sentence) <br /> <br /> There are so many admirable signs . The old men Bob and Busmalis, who I was totally in love with from the first day. You said, Adebes, Pancamo and Schillinger, four very strong and charismatic leaders in their own way. Augustus Hill, a monologue, tied episodes so effectively. Employees like Sister Pete and Ray Mukada are also great. Also small characters that were only a few episodes or a few seasons, but also left a good impression. <br /> <br /> My favorites are O'Reily's brothers. Their relationship was the most intimate and warmest I saw on television. If there is something I always remember about this exhibition, they are. There is never a second "tying" or calling it that makes me so much pain. That's why when the ends come for them, it has hurt a lot. I wish it never happened. I wish I never watched it. <br /> <br /> But a good Fontana. I recommend it.
