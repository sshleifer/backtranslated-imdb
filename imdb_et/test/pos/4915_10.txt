When it was shown at the Seattle National Film Festival, I was the only person who stood and talked. The rest of the crowd rose or silent. This is a well-played little movie that goes deep into the reality of a young man's humanity. It's a real man; and does not play the amazing hyper-burned muscular "gay paositive" that moves to the non-porn gay movie genre (and that's why there are so many modern gay genre movies so empty). This movie is an intense failure and a great tragedy. Action and leadership and cinematography are fantastic; it all keeps the movie cluster and tense and passionate. Don't miss this when you find it.
