This movie tries to escape the typical "I fight because I am obliged to defend my country. NAZI is all the bad guys, I am against them" (typical of German war films). How? If you don't talk about it too much and just the war and the pieces of violence. I'd like to see a German movie that would be something between Come And See and the "bad NAZI" Das Boot. I say this because apart from this factor, the German films are the best that represent World War II and the German side. German hierarchical relationships that are very different from those of the US Army. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that is trying to really see what Stalingrad was, and I wasn't there, and I doubt most people were there right now, But if I chose one of the films depicting this battle, it wouldn't be the whole American enemy at the gates, so why am I saying that because even the best soldiers are not heroes and considering the conditions they may consider to be their own lives instead of the fatherland. This is true for all rows, and finally you see von Paul as an example.
