Josie is a newspaper reporter whose job is to go back to high school when she is 17 years old. <br /> <br /> As he is there, he remembers some really terrible things that happened to him for the first time in high school, as we see in rebounds. <br /> <br /> show that (a little spoiler) Josie was a high school joke and she picked up a lot and one day the coolest guy tells her she'll take her to the prom, just to the prom when she leaves her house. with herds and her bitch. what a terrible thing to do (some find it hard to watch because it is so unpleasant and it makes you warmer for Josie). <br /> <br /> I didn't find this movie that was funny, but there was really something funny in the office that was much more fun than what happened at school. <br /> <br /> This movie was the perfect happy ending because it brought tears to my mother's and sister's eyes. The performance of this film was not remarkable, it was a good part of most of the film, and some parts of the movie are bad. <br /> <br /> I'll give this movie 7 out of 10.
