On the unknown truth and reconciliation commission, I can only look at it as entertainment. I started watching the evening too late (recorded from BBC2 earlier this year), but when I started, I had to look to the end. <br /> <br /> The bottom side is that it is actually a courtroom drama - never my favorite musician - but it has been marvelously captured (largely over-saturated in ochres) and worked well. Like a good novel, I couldn't put it down. I wanted to see it in the cinema to make music and the justice of photography. What happened to publishing it in theaters? I'm Chiwetel Ejiofor admirer because I saw him Dirty Pretty Things and Hilary Swank see a terrible thing about this - very female and sexy to change (perhaps inappropriate but adds to the film's visual appeal). <br /> <br /> This picture deserves a wider audience than it seems.
