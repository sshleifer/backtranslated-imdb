I'm not talking about it, but I'm going to do it briefly. basically for those who don't know how prue actually died ....................................... .................................................. .................................................. .................................................. .................................................. .................................................. .................................................. .................................................. .................................................. .................................................. .......... The third sister goes down the stairs, says a spell that sends her away but is not lost. (IF THERE IS A THIRD OPPORTUNITY) Leo needs to be healed by both and so on. they come across the line and the only way to save it is to demon the tempo to return. the only way he can do that is that phoebe stays in the underworld. he agrees, the pace returns. now around 7:00 in the morning again. The demon comes with an energy ball for a bagpipe and a prue. they fly through the wall again. but this time, Phoebe is not finishing to demonize. The demon kills the doctor. doctor flies through a window. he is dead. The demon goes to the type of rotating wing and the glass to the door breaks, which has a great impact on the road and air sound. that is where it ends. Now .......... what the whole world does not know if they did not pay attention to the next episode. although what I say did not show what would happen, trust me ................ because this time there was no phoebet to call leo that he would come later. Piper survives because her injuries are not as deadly as prue and leo heal her before prue, so prue is dead. there is a mystery solved. ps calling prue with spell should be worked !!! and he should have appeared in the last episode to surprise
