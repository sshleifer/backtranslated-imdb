The most remarkable feature of this film is the chemistry of the actors, the sense of marriage in their dialogue and dancing. This typical ascendant music even has a plot in 1944, but it is still fun to watch because of the actors. Hayworth is not even so much a dancer, but he has a lot of "inexperienced" charm that suits his character. Kelly plays her usual caring authoritarian role, while Silvers offers a lot of self-restraint and laughs. The film can also be very serious. Not a must-have, but recommended if you like.
