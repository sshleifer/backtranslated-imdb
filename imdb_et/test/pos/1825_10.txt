Valley Girl always holds a special place in my heart: I would say it is definitely the best of 80's teen comedies, but it is a modest compliment. It's a good movie, a period. It is very specific in time and place - almost twenty years later it is a wonderful moment - but the story remains timeless. (It's just Rome and Julia, which has been died!) Nicolas Cage is great, showing all the early promises that it has destroyed the crapola of overwhelmed activity. Deborah Foreman is a revelation of this film, and I can't believe she didn't pursue a bigger career; someone else discovered their QUICK again. It's sweeter and more delicate than most movies in the genre - the required nudity seems to be discouraged because of a contractual obligation - and although it's not a breakthrough, it's definitely nice to see a movie that respects its characters and doesn't cross the low girls for fun - even Foreman's best friends team, who is mistaken under mutual pressure will never be filmed. (Indeed, his friend Stacy, who is forced to double Cage's friend Fred, is good despite his protests and makes Fred back in the back.) It will take you back to the early 80s when you were there, but it's very well today . Warning for those who do not know the movie: DO NOT look at one of VH1's seemingly continuous exhibitions - let's rent it without changing its glory. Otherwise, some of the strongest, time-related dialogues in the movies are missing. The Valley Girl can't write or mention the fabulous soundtrack of the 80's stories - most of them are one-sided miracles that are not only an integral part of the time and place in this movie, but also well-chosen thematically. Look at it - fantastic little tricks! Fer shur !!
