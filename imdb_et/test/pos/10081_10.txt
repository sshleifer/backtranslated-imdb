Is this a bad movie? <br /> <br /> Of course, what do you expect from "BEACH BABES FROM BEYOND"? <br /> <br /> This is a "BABES in BIKINI" movie and there are no claims that they are different. Given this, it is not "INTERMEDIATE VIEW" or "SCHINDLER LIST". If you want a movie like "View Room" then you wouldn't look over Babes Beach. But if you are looking for good babes in a bikini movie with almost no plot, it's one for you. This flick gives what he promises, and then some. It's a pure 100% youngster. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of BABES in bikini and bikini. The movie was pretty funny and nice to watch. These were some of the most beautiful women I've ever seen at home video. <br /> <br /> Every high school child should look at at least one such bad movie. It's actually one of the most memorable movies I've ever seen. So, I say again ... If you look at just one movie, "Babes in Bikini", that's it.
