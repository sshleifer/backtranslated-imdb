A few years ago, when I rented some movies, I came to subtype 4, I was finally looking at it and actually I liked it, we need a good vampire problem that doesn't stop. But when I went back to the video store, they said they didn't have any other sub-videos, unfortunately the same happened to some other video store I was looking for. I gave up, until someone in youtube actually posted all the submissive movies and I could watch them all last night and I'm hooked. I am now a fan of a full moon subspecies series. I think it was such a horror film that I was looking for, I've been looking for good cheese for a long time and the subspecies filled that place. Radu is one of the coolest vampires on the screen and gives almost Nosferata to his fangs! Radu is an evil vampire who, after his bloodstone, his birthrope, has a blood that is absolutely unbelievable and gives him strength. Three American girls studying Romanian history and culture get into a man, Stephan, who offers help. They stay at Radu Castle where we find out that Stephan is the brother of Radu; Radu seduces and turns two girls, but Stephan falls to one of Michelle's girls and does everything to protect her. in some ways more pleasant. Plus Radu was the perfect villain because Stephan was the perfect angel like a romantic vampire. The story is chilling and I think it was a fun vampire movie. It was also the first series, the best part is, the sequels are just as fun. I would recommend it during a scary movie night, watch it in the dark, Radu will definitely send a spine, or even a neck ... OK, funny, couldn't resist. > 7/10
