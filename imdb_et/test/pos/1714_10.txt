For those who have access to the BBC or the CBC, this has been remarkable. Like Battlestar Gallactica, it is an exhibition built from the ground. But for Dr Who, they saved the best parts. I can't believe I'm saying this, but ... it's by far the best dr. It does not have any cheap product value and sometimes a slowdown in old exhibitions. Operation is pretty good and there is a real sense of continuity and history. The new doctor is easily equal to the great Tom Baker, and the writer (former QAF leader) seems to have made smaller characters alive. <br /> <br /> I know ... I stab. But it should be in the list of geeks on every sci-fi. I just don't know why it's not done here. Whatever you do ... if you ever love Dr Who or sci-fi..it!
