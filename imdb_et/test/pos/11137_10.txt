This show was incredible !!! I've seen all three and that's the best. This movie is tense, a little romance, tricks that hit your mind (GO BOBBIE), great signs and amazing locations. Where was it filmed? Is there more? I liked this story with my brother. I look forward to Chameleon 4 and see how the world is rescued.
