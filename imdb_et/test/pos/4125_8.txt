I saw it (video 2000) years ago and I would like to see it on a DVD. A good movie, but I would have loved it even more if it had added The Beatles and The Hollies heritage, and so on. <br /> <br /> I don't know exactly how this story is true - do some of the changes dramatize the story? <br /> <br /> I was only 3 when Buddy crashed and didn't wake up to his music until the late 70s. Later I learned that our family moved to our new house - yes, February 3, 1959. <br /> <br /> Well the little lady does the things you say and do ... Her songs always have to be remembered - always. .
