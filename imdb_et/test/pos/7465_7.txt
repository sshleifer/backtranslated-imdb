This movie starts a bit slowly, but starts to comedy quickly. All three "teenage girls" offer their credible, distinctive, self-confident and entertaining personalities. I especially liked the dialogue and communication between Keith and Lisa. When one looked over the superficial "action" that took place, Keith's character addressed "abandonment" with tenderness and respect. The subsequent comic development was, in my opinion, also drawn up competently. David Boreanaz gives an excellent result to an adult male who obviously gets into more difficulties than he can. The dialogue was sharp, fast and flowed well. The director and writer of this film clearly showed how none of the major characters could claim moral high ground after they were pulled. Although the film is light on the surface, it reflects all gray areas of adulthood, human emotions and desire.
