"The Dead" is really a work of art. It is clear that John Huston wanted to show that he was still "in a glimpse of some passion", even when his body could not. This film is heavily influenced and remembered long after. Reading Joyce's story will definitely add more depth to the characters, especially Gabriel's inner confusion, but basically it's all in this movie. The artist's statement of his love for life and his craft "The Dead" stands alone.
