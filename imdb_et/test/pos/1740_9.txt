I never got dr. Frankly, I never got the chance to see previous incarnations (intended) because it was never "great" in the US because it is everywhere else. <br /> <br /> That means I have to say (probably) that after the end of the 2nd season it's one of the best sci-fi shows I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Now I look at a lot of Sci-Fi exhibitions all over the world, and this show looks like a show. The first season was at the top, in the role of Christopher Eccleston, and I thought he was terrible. Of course, also lovely Billie Piper, who just adds this kind of humanity and warmth to Rose's character, so that no one would have improved it. Let's not forget that Camile Coduri is Jackie and Noel Clarke as Mickey / Ricky who is just looking at the explosion. Then there is David Tenann. First I thought he was too characteristic to play this character (his ears !!), but after watching the 2nd season he fits well. His sharp behavior and physical comedy are almost flawless. He is great, where he succeeds in the dialogue and he can be seriously confronted. <br /> <br /> In addition to acting as a major actress, most have appeared as actor actors. Many of them are veteran artists, but some are new to me and fucking. <br /> <br /> The production and direction of the show is the upper limit. Sometimes there is a cheese effect here and there, but it has always been a factor in the initial series and, like these episodes, it is negligible. <br /> <br /> My favorite thing from the series: The Stories. Writing people is always the key to entertainment. Russell T. Davies has written several episodes with another writer and has done an excellent job. With intelligent concepts and excellent dialogue, they have been able to bring excitement, ingenuity, intelligence and fun. I also appreciate the fact that they are able to spoil the older doctors' past and enemies well (my friend explains this to me when we look at the exhibition) and respectfully. <br /> <br /> I don't mention anything in the second season and how it ends, because the Sci-Fi channel started airing the second season. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't want to spoil it. It's so fun and exciting. You never want to take your eyes off or leave the word off the dialogue. <br /> <br /> It's really so good. <br /> <br /> PS: Thanks to Nicholas Briggs! ** EXTERMINATE! **
