The submarine used is NOT Varang! "It" was actually two boats, P614 and P615, both built for Turkey by Vickers Armstorn in Barrow-in-Furness, but were kept by the Royal Navy during the war. The P615 had sunk, but P614 was finally delivered in 1945. <br /> <br /> There was no doubt about the confusion because someone looked at P61 (as I did) and found Varian! In fact, the last number of both P614 and P615 was just painted .... <br /> <br /> The movie has some very realistic moments. These Turkish ships were very similar to the S class. As no S-class submarines live, their shots (like the P61) and the "Forth" ship make up an interesting record and a great movie.
