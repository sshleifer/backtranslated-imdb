I think it depends on when he first sees the movie, when their impression is formed as it is. <br /> <br /> I saw it as a child on television in 1973 when it was a stranger "and I loved it. It was a time when the space program was a reality when exhibitions like" Search "," UFO "and" $ 6M Man ", a 12-year-old child that the world could keep in their future. Adventure and technology. <br /> <br /> You only have to see it once and it was when the network encouraged them. people could cut their exhibitions, make their own parody about it, they could not accept their exhibition and add their comments to it. <br /> <br /> I didn't know what this "pilot" concept was. I was hoping that Stryker would come home; he didn't know it was possible that it would last longer than two hours. <br /> <br /> Then did I understand what so many people are hating about this movie right now? because I do not remember it as such. Do I understand? Not exactly to understand the story, it must not be seen from its perspective, except id rather than movie characters. <br /> <br /> When one looks at America, it can be humorous because of its lack. securing security in the police ... ... but if it has a topic, it can be expected to match and security may be less. If things are assumed to be perfect, perfect to the extreme, it is perfect that there is no doubt then it is unlikely that things will be as fast as things have failed. <br /> <br /> The movie is interesting, for example, an old man who remembers before but looks at his words because he doubts that there are spies everywhere. Or, the police state will appreciate the knowledge somewhat because they are careful how they control or damage their brain power. <br /> <br /> These days, you will probably know exactly what the film will look like so many arrests before, a surprise disappears. But the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the film is an ideal shift when it is thought that this film is well done during the Cold War and the greatest fear of astronauts is that he has collapsed in the USSR. The film will be quite a long way before it turns out that this is the least of its worries. <br /> <br /> This is the main difference between "stranger" and "doppelganger". The latter can be considered a timeless, as all comments on the USSR are relatively small and the film has disappeared early. In the first, these links are out in the movie, supposedly right at the beginning and then the subject variation after the wards. <br /> <br /> All that is said, despite my fund's memory, is quite easy to see that it wouldn't have made it a series. Every week, Stryker makes friends, follow Benedict, Stryker gets away. Finally, Benedict's society would release him. Someone else would be chasing. Work out robbery. There may be something new, such as another member of the Stryker mission, but apparently not enough to hold the show. <br /> <br /> If someone goes in, others have used the movie to crop, the likelihood is that it will have a slash. But if someone remembers that this was done during the Cold War and what fears and appraisals were on the other side during this time, what is a popular environment for the viewer, they may find some entertaining and intellectual themes.
