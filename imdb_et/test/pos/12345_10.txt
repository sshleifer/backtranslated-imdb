This is my favorite horror film, close to "Poltergeist". I saw "One Dark Night" when it first came out in the theater in 1983 where I worked. <br /> <br /> I was born in 1963, so I have a certain love for the 80's horror movies, despite the fact that they are a bit dated and the dialogue is not well written. I thought it was so original that the phenomenon of "psychic vampireism" has not been addressed (at least according to my knowledge) and it is a very real phenomenon. <br /> <br /> I didn't. Take care if Adam West was in it (nothing against him, but his supporting role was not memorable), but he thought Meg Tilly was a good cast. Unfortunately, the little-known Donald Hutton ("Brainstorm" and "Invaders From Mars") was overlooked as an ambiguous scientist who followed Ramari's abilities. Like a gay man, I paid more attention to David Mason Daniels, Meg Tilly, who was an unhappy but gorgeous boy. He is now selling real estate in Texas. <br /> <br /> I felt the movie "realistic" in two ways: Raymar, who discovered that he had murdered 6 girls in a surreal apartment, was a funeral that was not enough to reflect the fact that not only is he mysterious, hermit , but killer. As you know, these types are buried without a fan. Secondly, if the corpses were telematically mobile, hover, dragging their legs. The filmmakers could have gone zombies for walking, silencing, extending weapons, but chose what would be plausible. Kudos! Ramar's eye-catching electric emptying of his throne of the throne (as he follows his dead kingdom), the mausoleum blurred the magenta light that remains with you for years! If you've ever gone to a mausoleum, even on a sunny day, you'll notice that they have their own rosette lighting caused by stained glass windows. Don't let me start quietly. Even Ramar himself looked like someone who could move an eccentric, perverted old man. The result was one-of-a-kind and memorable, and I'm going to keep myself out for the first time. The track was made where it was supposed to be. I especially liked the carefully planned features of each body: a bride, a poorly decomposed child with a teddy bear, a grandmother, a long thin black boy, and another face from a Veterinarian of the Second World War and a green sliding eye. elderly gentlemen who greeted the sister cluster initiators. Even the bodies can be good actors. The only thing I had to worry about was the hand that came out of one of the vaults and the Julie boy in the abyss could not be possible unless the body was first placed on the stomach and legs, but why? It also seemed a little fresh. <br /> <br /> The film begins to frighten because we never see Ramar's face (until the end of the last quarter of the movie, which is like unpacking birthday gifts) as he serves the girl's mental flash. Then we see the coroners who take their bodies off in their one-bedroom apartment, where we see that they have tested their telecom handicrafts by stepping into the cup on their wall. The rest do not let the Heathers-type group of nurses feed Julie's final initiation when you spend the night inside the mausoleum, but it is a well-placed structure to scare fear later. The film is not bloody in any way. The part of Goriest is when Ramar's daughter uses a compact mirror to feed her power back, and then the bubbles melt. I have always felt that a force like Ramar could never die and the sequel could be worth exploring. I see it now: one dark night II: turning the grave. But let's face it - the movie stands alone. I heard that the film also has other titles, but the original ones fit. <br /> <br /> Transformation would be pointless. But if there were one, I would write a better dialogue and extend some scenes, as shown by the research done on the capabilities of the Ramari laboratory instead of recording it. This information age would be something that would be well documented on the DVD. And still dead bodies! Why just lift them up in the mausoleum when Ramar's might also be in the graveyard? Let's just say I wouldn't want to be one of those people who had to clean up at the end of the climax; something that can also be shown. I think if one of the nursing sisters admits one of the dead as a relative, it would have added something good to the disturbing character. For CG effects, there would be some awesome scenes at the wall where Ramar animated cremated scraps! <br /> <br /> Say what you want, "One night of darkness," but he has it all. So look at least once in your life ... or death!
