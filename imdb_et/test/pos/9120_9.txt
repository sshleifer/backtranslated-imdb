I just saw it in the final film of the Austin Film Festival. Alamo in Drafthouse saw a few pieces of his deeds and thought that the trailer was amusing, but I did not expect such an epic theme of music, and the use of tarot cards is in the order of the genius. Watch out for the fierce and dark master of Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins (who has a fetish for KG). So many surprises and songs are so memorable. The car chase was my favorite scene. I know it will serve as a cult status right now and win some new Tenacious D fans like me. I hope it works well in theaters. "Follow me, we are shadows"
