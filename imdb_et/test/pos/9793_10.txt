It's really a sad and touching movie! It deals with the issue of child abuse. It's really a sad but mostly real story because it happens every day. Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazzello play two children or Lorraine Bracco, a single mother who just tries to get them home. Living with his parents, a man who likes to be "King" comes to his life. He hits the youngest boy, Bobby, but two brothers promise not to tell their mother. But finally it turns out that after Bobby's injury. The end result destroyed it for me because it is so incredible. But, except this, I love the movie.
