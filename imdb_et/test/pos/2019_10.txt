Well, let me say that - I've always been one of the "hardcore brothers"; I've always loved rock music and especially heavy metal! That's why this movie is like a gift from God! I believe this movie is one of the best films ever (well, except for Neverending Story and Star Wars, of course ...). It's great to hear all the classics like "Long live rock and roll" (DIO), "Stranglehold (Ted Nugent), Jon Bon Jovie, Deep Purple, AC / DC, Zakk Wylde and many other legendary rock bands. Extremely gorgeous! WONDERFUL!" I hope they will make such movies more (otherwise they are just movies like "AC in da USA" or what they call it, and "8 miles". Bulls ***!) Well, I would recommend it anyway! What I've lost is a couple of Stratovarius songs, but except it is one of the best movies ever!
