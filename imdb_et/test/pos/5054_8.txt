I was glad to see my husband rent a "passionate labyrinth". I love Almodovar movies. We both loved the movie. We both couldn't stop laughing. We especially enjoyed the scene where a transvestite captures a photo novel, and although it is said to have been killed by an electric cage, it is said to respond to the phone and say, "I can't talk to you right now, I'm" m attacked by a sadistic serum killer when I survive , I will call you back. (This would make a big autoresponder message think about it). We also loved the new found that he loved, "I went to an orgy after the concert, but I couldn't think of you." (I'm waiting for this line on Twitter). "Passion Labyrinth" is a hanging farce with lots of high fun, fun dialogues and eye candies for everyone. The film is outdated well: costumes and hair from the 1980s add to madness. I would give it 10 out of 10 ratings, but I give eight reasons for this for two reasons. The first is a scene that includes laxatives that contain a dirt of themselves: totally unnecessary, and this brings the film's tone for a while to Hollywood's gross picture. The second is the suggestion that Queti sleeps with her father: shocking, yes, but again it will destroy the film's tone. However, I would recommend a movie to anyone who wants a difficult, spicy and fun time.
