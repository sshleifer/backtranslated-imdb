Rose and a good doctor find themselves in a space station located on a planet that is quite impossible under the black hole in orbit. The station team is as confusing as two new residents. Suitably horrible in this atmosphere and getting better as a doctor and Rose get into the situation due to circumstances under the control of strangers who are submissive to Oodi, because something quite dark comes from the planet's crust. It is not possible to see the second part of the two-part part that I cannot guarantee that the end is just as strong. But it does make one hell start. <br /> <br /> My Class: A
