This lesser-known film, starred by Roy Thinnes (television intruders), is, in my opinion, a lost pearl. This was done at a time when the story was more important to the special effects (although the effect is quite good for your time). The scientist says that there is another world directly behind the sun in orbit of the Earth. Since the sun always blocks it from us, we can never see it on Earth. Roy Thinnes has been chosen to go on a mission to this world. I don't want to tell the rest of the plot because it gives the rest of the movie. Let's just say that there are some real surprises. <br /> <br /> The film is British and has such a good British taste that works in TV series like The Avengers.
