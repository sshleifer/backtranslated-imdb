So when I first saw Greek-language advertising, I had some questions about how they approached Greek life when they intend to give away sacred frat and corporate secrets when they intend to focus on brother and sisterhood. or the corporation brings, or what most college kids think of Greek life as a huge party. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, it covered everything. The story was great, it gave you the love of love, hatred, someone you want to be with, someone you don't want to be with, and of course the crazy roommate! <br /> <br /> It was one of my first looks at what writers believe Greek life is like, and I can honestly say they hit the nail pretty dead. <br /> <br /> I love how one of the biggest things they did throughout the season was the relationship between Rusty and his mad roommate. It's hard enough to get away from home and be forced to live in a small room where someone you don't even know come out to find out ... you have nothing in common. Probably every college is associated with freshmen, which is the worst nightmare. What didn't he have? Oh thats right .. Evan all by yourself. Rebeccal and Evan had a "thing" at the beginning of the season that made you feel relatively clever in Casey. His character changed and his relationship with Rusty became more and more loving and outgoing. <br /> <br /> Cappie is one of the fun loving characters and totally crazy. One of my favorite episodes included him that he left the bar in the trash, and Rusty had to call Casey to rescue them. I like how they dealt with the issue of homosexuals in Greek houses, Calvin was a very real feeling and I really respected him because he kept his standards. So Jen K was pretty crazy, but he really liked Rusty. It was surprising and I asked her from the beginning, but of course I wanted her to work between her and Rusty. It takes you to the truth of Greek life, something that many people look to the past. One of the biggest things that frats and corporations are known for is partying and drinking. Greece is an excellent exhibition and the characters are easily connected.
