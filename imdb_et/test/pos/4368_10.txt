This production of British film I AM A CAMERA is based on Christopher Isherwood's "Berlin Stories". It is the source of the famous CABARET music. <br /> <br /> Julie Harris, the main actor of her day, repeats her 1951 Tony Award as Sally Bowles. He is far from the character of Liza Minnell, but the main "Sally" is all here despite the different movie codes that would have blocked the story in Hollywood. Harris might be stagy, but he's also pretty good as crazy and mad Sally. His song number is clearly dubbed (Marlene Dietrich not less), although Harris probably sings at other moments. <br /> <br /> Laurence Harvey (with very ugly hair) plays Isherwood from scratch with strangers and can't even make the character interesting. Shelley Winters plays a bit of Natalia's role (Marian Winters won Tony support) and Anton Diffring is OK as Fritz. Ron Randell plays caddish Clive, but it looks hard. Lee Seidl is funny as a homeowner. <br /> <br /> Despite the general staginess and cheap looks, Harris takes a central position and is amazing. This film was released in the same year as EAST OF EDEN, where Harris gives Abra a glowing performance. Comparing these two performances gives a good overview of the talents of Miss Harris. These two characters cannot be unambiguous. Harris' Sally prefers and favors a very lush laugh. He also acts around the boring Harvey. <br /> <br /> Without music and a familiar style, many viewers can recommend this movie here, but this is a great way to see the great Julie Harris, which was repeatedly very shocking in 1951.
