It has been noticed that John Ford made "big, scary" movies so he could afford to make "small" movies he loved so well. Wagon Master, young Ben Johnson, is probably one of his best, if not the best, small films. All of Ford's brands are location photography, wagons, hard work with horses, and the addition of plains in the Indian Plain. Like many of his films, Eisenstein has a great film director's vision of a great Russian director. The supportive majority, including Ward Bond, Russell Simpson and Jane Darwell, are great, as well as a number of smaller characters from Ford, including his brother (the one who plays the drums). While Ben Johnson won the winning Oscar last picture show, his companion Harry Carey, Jr. did not reach these heights. Although his father, Carey, became Western's leading man in Ford's earlier films, Carey, Jr. Most of the roles supporting your career. For John Ford fans and fans of Western films, this is a commitment.
