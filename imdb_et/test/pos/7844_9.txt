This is a great film that takes place during the romantic period of civil war. This movie must be for Eastwood fans and Eastwood says it's one of his favorite films. I could no longer agree. Look out! This is a spoiler - Eastwood will eventually die. Eastwood and director Don Siegel rightly argued that the end should be unexpected and should be unfortunate for some reason. They wanted to stay in one book. Secondly, there can not always be a happy ending. Third, it was written during the Vietnam War - they wanted a negative statement about the terrible warfare where people died. I agree with that. This is a wonderfully filmed movie and I love movies that cover the most civil war. It is rather a portrayal of how deceptive women might be - that they may be more dangerous than men, so the title has a lot to do with the BEGUILED statement that it is being deceived. The song that was singing at the beginning and end of the Eastwood film is another statement not only against the civil war, but also against the Vietnam War, and perhaps also indirectly by the women he is exposed to during the film. Wonderful story of love and fraud and many memorable scenes - NOTE: This movie is rated R-free. There is hardly any language, this is probably a gender issue, but there really is no nudity. Great movie - 9/10.
