It was a really tense and dark episode. Excellent amazing, wonderful actor and atmosphere control, "Ice" is one of my favorite episodes. Together with "Pusher" grotesque "Wetwired" and "Home" (these are quite good in my dark atmosphere) This seems to me to be quite realistic, their paranoia, their suspicion and the ever-growing rage of perfect perfect players. But "Ice" had a problem I got after a clock: IT was too short! I wanted more! <br /> <br /> In general, "ice" was what 98% of all X-file episodes have: Excellent action, intense story writing, sharp management. All works. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
