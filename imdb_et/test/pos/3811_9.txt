Little Gus is a ten-year-old criminal. She runs away from her parents and decides to go on a journey. Getting a petal is somewhat harsh for him, so he creates a device to help him. His goal is to win a lottery-type card game called Motorama. He must find all eight letters to write M-O-T-O-R-A-M-A. In the dark, laughter follows the road of hell. He runs some Lynch-like characters. The most memorable is the petrol station sender, who puts his story in the hope of seeing God see it. Later, Gus gets a tattoo and an eye shot on his injured eye. He will be one of the most rebellious 10-year-olds you see on the screen. It's not childhood! Look for Jack Nance, Flea and Drew Berrymore. Warn, although Drew is on the front panel, it will appear in the movie in just a few seconds in a dream order. The film will also become confusing when it reaches the territory of David Lynch, you may want to check it out a few times. "Motorama" is written by Joseph Minion, the best known for his scenarios for "After Hours" and "Vampire's Kiss".
