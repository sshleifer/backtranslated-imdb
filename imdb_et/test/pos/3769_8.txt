An amazing no-brainer comedy where comedian Mark Blankfield depicts Jekyll as a dense doctor who is deeply committed to his research. When he has glowed with his experimental formula, he has become a landscaping Hydeks, causing all the problems around him to end. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised. This is a really crazy, crazy approach; It's full of steam ahead of one outrageously stupid yet undeniably fun joke after another. Funny lines and eyesight are abundant; Blankfield plays all its values. One stress is that Hyde breaks the song; "Hyde didn't get anything for Hyde" is quite memorable and even now I can hear it in my head. The climax even goes as far as the abduction of old b & w horror films. <br /> <br /> Supporting cast is also very sharp, with Bess Armstrong, a buggy fianc√© Mary, Krista Errickson as a nervous Ivy and Tim Thomerson is a terrible companion doctor at Knute Lanyon. I wish Thomerson's character could have done more because I am a man's fan, but it is always nice to see him. <br /> <br /> A large number of familiar faces parade before camera: Cassandra "Elvira" Peterson, Peter Brocco, Liz Sheridan, George Wendt, Michael Ensign, John Dennis Johnston, Art La Fleur, Lin Shaye and George Chakir . <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that if you prefer high-level, intelligent comedy, it would be better to avoid it at all costs. But for those who enjoy interesting, politically incorrect, cleverly fun time, it's just a trick. <br /> <br /> One of the best bits is last recorded. <br /> <br /> 8/10
