"Five Fingers of Death" started the madness of the American kung-fu movie, but I remember it for the first time as "King Boxer" in Chinatown, NYC, with no bad duplication and few Americans. I was also fortunate enough to see the American premiere of "Five Fingers Of Death" in Times Square, NYC. What contrast was that it was ... the same movie, but different audiences. <br /> <br /> In Chinatown, this film took a more serious look for viewers. The reason for this was that they listened to the real voice of the actors (in Chinese) that made the film more credible. Chinatown's theaters have been showing violent kung fu films for years (the "Boxer From Shantung" of 1972 they won all the gore), so the main attraction was choreography and story of action. The plots of the competition school were not overused, so the story seemed fresh. Every big kung fu movie had a wonderful, dirty villain that you wanted to see to get your fire and FFoD on them. The star, Lieh Lo, was known in the theater in Chinese theaters. Most Chinese audiences enjoyed this movie tremendously. During this movie's departure, the audience's buzz has given me the ultimate satisfaction. I liked it here too, but for various reasons. The people were ethnic and quite energetic. From the beginning, the film was laughing. As soon as the audience heard these wonderful British accents from these Chinese actors, the film became a violent and gory comic. Most American audiences saw such gores in a horror film, not in a feature film. The sequences blew the audience. Unfortunately, film studios saw that they enjoyed it so much that bad duplication and unnecessary violence became the kung fu flick formula. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie with an American audience, but I enjoyed it much more in Chinatown. Some movies may pass the test of time, but the duplicate version of FFoD can't do that. The original "King Boxer" is still enjoyable ... CLASSIC!
