This is one of Barbara Stanwyc's earlier films and she certainly has an unusual theme. He earns money by dancing with a dance hall with men. She really doesn't like work, but it's lively. His boy seems to be a pretty boy, but he's also a rich guy Ricardo Cortez. Well, after getting married it turns out that his "nice boy" is theft, the feminine doll and the rich Cortez turn out to be a guy. At the end of the movie, Barbara was just enough, because every SANE woman walked from this terrible marriage. <br /> <br /> In the early 1920s and early 1930s, Hollywood did a lot of what he wanted, and some of his films had themes or scenes that many nowadays surprise - such as nudity, adultery, and bad language. Although TEN CENTS A DANCE is not a blatant example of this morality, it is a subject that would never have been permitted since the creation and enforcement of a hardened production code since 1934. Sometimes the code was good - after all, the parents didn't have to worry about what the kids saw in the movies (like the nudity of BEN HUR, 1925). However, it also tended to disinfect some movies too - and it is not possible to make and approve the film in any way, as it tends to respect divorce - serious 1934 and then. It's really a shame, because I don't think that the TEN CENTS A DANCE was bad at all to discuss it, especially since the star (Barbara Stanwyck) was married to a film-driving early. However, the dissolution of the film with his divorce and his marriage to a man who had been divorced twice was simply not. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is interesting and thought-provoking. In addition, it was well-functioning and suitable for a relatively short time. Look at this. <br /> <br /> FYI - Unfortunately, Ricardo Cortez was not really a Spaniard but changed his name because of possible prejudice, because he was a Jew. He was the leading man of his time, but today it's all forgotten.
