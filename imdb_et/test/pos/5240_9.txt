I recently bought "The Big Trail" {1930}. This is a fantastic, amazing movie. I knew it by reputation, but didn't expect it to be so great. My version is 35 mm long and I will talk about it later. When a person thinks of a movie from the western myth, John Ford and John Wayne remember. Well, you only have half the team here, but the whole myth is there. Raoul Walsh has given us a remarkable epic, where the real plot is the battle for Western expansion. <br /> <br /> There is a graph that focuses on the romance between Breck Coleman {Wayne} and Ruth Cameron (Margaret Churchill) with the main villain, Red Flack has been memorably played by Tyrone Power, Sr. random quality when the wagon train fights against both the incredible obstacle and the natural and human. Examples include crossing a river, an Indian battle and passing a burning desert. The struggle will result in an amazing touch when a doll is killed on a child's grave when a loyal dog is in his master's grave. <br /> <br /> Great panoramas are full of energy and activity. The open scene as the wagon train is about to leave, the Square Dance aisle and the great Buffalo herds are some that you like. The location is always pleasantly used. Another feature of this great movie is the fact that men and women are given equal credit for their parts in Westward. Women work, fight and face terrible difficulties with the same strength and strength as men. In the finals, there is a strong uplifting experience when Coleman and Cameron meet in a gigantic Sequoia forest to start their new life. <br /> <br /> Operation is perfectly acceptable. I've already mentioned the theft of the Tyrone Power scene. Tully Marshall is great when Coleman's Sidekick and Marguerite Churchill represent a convincing woman who develops inner strength when she encounters both her own and her own problems. Comic relief is the weakest aspect of this film, but these scenes are not common and are swallowed up in huge sweeps of the film. <br /> <br /> Have I read a lot about Wayne's performance? even goes so far as to blame his "woodwork" for the film's failure. I think it's unfair. Wayne was in his first important role, and he was certainly not a charism in "Stagecoach". But he does a caring job in a role that will surely play the second violin on a big overall theme. After "The Big Trail", Wayne played in many small budget B Westerns. I have a number of them and they can see an evolving actor. When "Stagecoach" came, he was ready and "The Big Trail" was an important part of this practice. <br /> <br /> I mentioned earlier that my version is 35 mm long. It is still impressive, but the effect of the 70 mm version puts the TV screen 16: 9, which does not cause distortion. Although there was no full effect of the Grandeur's version, it was good enough to want to get it. {additionally, there are a couple of extra scenes on the 70mm film that are not shown in the usual theater}. <br /> <br /> All-in-all, this movie deserves to be in any of the greatest Westers ever made.
