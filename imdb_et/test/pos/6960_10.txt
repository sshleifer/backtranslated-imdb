I recommend this movie very well. It blurs the line between childhood fantasy and everyday reality so smoothly that it must be believed. The actor and the director have such a perfect timing that in one scene the name-fighting fight becomes a kind of dance. I loved the story, the actors, everything. Although I think there were one or two decisively fun scenes, the whole movie was done perfectly.
