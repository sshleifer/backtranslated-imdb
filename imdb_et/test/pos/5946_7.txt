A fairly amusing scam with special attention to detail: the look of the 1960s spy films and how the action took place. The fight in the hotel room was a hoot and the casting was perfect with Peter Lorre's lookalike, which was added to the villain. Big plus: Jean Dujardin is hot and the scene where he is without a shirt is highlighted. Plus her eyebrows deserve some recognition for doing a great job. <br /> <br /> Funny Aside: The people behind the theater held up each plot as they looked at the "real" spy driver. <br /> <br /> Before the movie started, "Get Smart" trailer was screened. The preview made the film embarrassingly bad when the flat tries to engage jokes and gags from the TV series. It looks like it is a bomb and quite the opposite of OSS 117's relatively sublime jokes and gags, although of course the OSS was a mixed type. But the overall tone of the OSS was not an insult to the viewer's intelligence, and the material didn't feel as if it was "disappointed." I got a clear impression that if I understood the language, I would have been joking more and one particular (pistol) was wrong in interpreting the subtitles.
