Sony Pictures Classics, I look at you! Sony got rights to Harry's records - you need to distribute the movie and you get much more sales for your back catalog! Anyway, this is a great research for an exciting musician, well-known, full of stories, bigger music and it could have been 3 hours longer and I would have loved it more. You saw it at the American Cinemateque Mods & Rockers Festival at Santa Monica Aero Theater, where he played in a packed house. They turned people to the door! I went to several Mods & Rockers festival films and let me assure you that no other film even came close to selling, let alone people. Watch it in the theater, buy a DVD, and make sure that some slow-running [* cough SONY cough *] picks up this ASAP!
