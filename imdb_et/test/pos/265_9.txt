Vg Brit rom-com, one to see if you can get your hands on a copy. Exciting and often surprising, it's not the best of Brady's movies (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is by far the most funny), although it has a unique charm. A well-written story rolls into a dead end, but mostly surfaces with a new plot. You know from the beginning how it ends, but when it is honest and very open, it is a realistic and reliable end, the end seemed to start, enjoyable and left me more of a wish.
