I find it sad that simply because Edward Norton didn't want to be in the movie or do something about it, people automatically think that the film sucks without giving it or giving it a chance. I hope Norton didn't. He's a good actor and everything, but he's afraid of people from a decent movie. <br /> <br /> I found it fun. It wasn't bad or something mad with special effects, but it wasn't bad. It was fun to watch. But yes, definitely not a bad / terrible movie. <br /> <br /> 7/10
