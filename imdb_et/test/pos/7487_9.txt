OK, so Pulp Fiction owes it, but in my opinion, it has its voice and identity mainly because of the style of the music-video direction, the sketch-like narration and the great performances. Thomas Jane offers an excellent (drug-dealer show is extraordinary) as well as Aaron Eckhart. James LeGrosel has a short and effervescent look - great humor - they got the Wong house. The scene of Porzikova's interrogation and rape is memorable, as does Mickey Rourke's cheeky look - "take the tip". <br /> <br /> Great Hollywood popcorn production with strong performances by A-level candidates and renegade (Rourke). Well, take the tip, it's worth it.
