A very nice bit of a movie that should have been more widely distributed. Ian McShane is playing at home, playing a soul-loving DJ who is preserved because he doesn't "go with the program" and makes the world know what they are missing. Supporting cast is also great and music is the "soul" of the movie. I just want the movie to be released so I can get a copy of it for my movie collection.
