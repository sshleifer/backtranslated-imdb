Again, we can see that such films are becoming more and more English humor, not too often on the screen from Monty Python and Man About The House. Too bad. <br /> <br /> Brenda Blethyn (who I saw for the first time in Saving Grace at the beginning of the year, the other must see by the way.) Just looks like Alfred Molina does. The rest of the majority, though practically unknown to me, also goes into great shows. The film starts slowly and gradually at the pace and amusement - meanwhile, I was tears laughing in my eyes. <br /> <br /> All in all, a funny English movie, a thousand times better than the allegedly funny garbage from Hollywood. <br /> <br />
