This movie was really well written and was very entertaining. Luke Perry did a very convincing job. (as it always does) If you are looking for an eventful movie to watch, it should be at the top of your list. It is a mixture of comedy, drama and action. You can literally feel what the actors know. I was very impressed with this movie. Special effects were very well done. The whole movie was very convincing. This movie is one of my favorites. What happens is that North America can be crushed and Jack and his team must try and break up with the destruction of North America. It was a very cool and creative idea. I loved this movie and I know that too.
