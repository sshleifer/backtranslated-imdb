If you want to see Shakespeare's masterpiece as a whole, I suggest you find this BBC version. Indeed, it is over four and a half hours long, but Jacoby, as Hamlet and Patrick Stewart, as Claudius, is worth the effort. <br /> <br /> It won't let you be amazed when the "Hamlet" is clear when you see it in the length and order that Bard has set. Every version of "Hamlet" has seduced its structure. Olivier focused on Hamlet's indecision, Gibson on his passions. Jacoby can pull all these aspects of Hamlet character with the help of Shakespeare's complete script. <br /> <br /> Why doesn't Hamlet immediately kill Claudia? Hamlet says, "I'm very proud, revengeful, ambitious ..." Hamlet is extremely upset not only because of his father's death (and suspected suspicion), but also for his mother's marriage, but also and mostly because Claudius has been attacked by Hamlet Throne. She is furious for her mother to marry Claudius (marriages between royal relatives are not known, made for political reasons), but her marriage was secured by Claudius' claim to the throne before returning from Wittenburg. It is therefore impossible for him to do anything about it. And this is true even after he hears revenge on his father's ghost. He can't just kill the king or he loses the throne. He must give out the "king's secret" and here is the tragedy! At the moment, Hamlet is able to publicly show Claudius' fault, he has the opportunity to kill him and not. WHY? He wants it ALL! He wants the revenge, the throne, and the exhaustion of Claudius's soul in hell. Hamlet USE YOURSELF IN THE CLASSIC TRAGIC. His own HUBIS is his withdrawal. He kills Polonius thinking that it is Claudius and the rest of the game spirals until Rosencrantz, Guildenster, Ophelia, Laertes, Gertrude, Claudius and Hamlet.
