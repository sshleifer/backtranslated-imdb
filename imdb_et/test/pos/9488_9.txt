The only Zeppelin movie I've ever seen on this DVD is The Song Remains the Same movie since 1976. We spent hours around this house of friends, but I never liked it and hated the fantasy sequence. .. <br /> <br /> What is this DVD? I didn't know it was there before browsing the Physical Graffiti CD ..... 'When did it come out?' I thought for some reason I thought the page was not a great live guitarist, but saying that watching this DVD has changed, my opinion is a massive underestimation. <br /> <br /> In the 1970s, "White Summer" is a 10-minute guitar wizard. <br /> <br /> The 1975 acoustic kit - The Bron-y-steam Stomp has an excellent fingerprint repair part. <br /> <br /> "My Time Dying" and "Trampled Underfoot" Performances (including "75s") are breathtaking - with Page and Bonham tearing down things like no other. Brown demonic things !! <br /> <br /> Magic continues in Knebworth's 1979 section. Transferring "Achillies Last Stand" to their diverse drug-related states, but easy faith! The complex guitars, Page, organized it so that it can just live - this effect is incredible. "In the evening" - I didn't like it on the disc, but it stays here. "Sick Again" - a big piece of flower. Knebworth footage is very interesting, with large screen, large rostrum and band material cutting with great effect. <br /> <br /> The factory is amazing in all shows. The page, despite being painfully thin, looks like a six-year-old child who has the most fun of his life at the Knebworth concert - and makes infectious viewing. <br /> <br /> One thing that amazed me - "Black Dog" The 1973 performance sounds very "camp" !! Robert Plant always loved the little "minced meat" and these jeans are completely ridiculous - and today they give the right Very different from the version of the muscle-related kick-a $$$ studio. <br /> <br /> I love this DVD, it reminded me how good Zeppelin was and remains.
