For all those people who believe that dialogue is worth something and who appreciate the farce that is smart enough to take it seriously, this film will surprise you. This is not a "twilight" for people who cannot follow the verbal exchange of our hero, Professor Dexter Cornell (Dennis Quaid). <br /> <br /> Cornell teaches tar mines in Southern California. She hasn't published a novel for four years, she divorces her, drinks a little and blesses or curse the nervous spirit she gives her students freely. He has recommended the promotion of a friend and a bright young student has presented him with a handbook as an independent project. Cornell doesn't even want to read it, so it gives him "A" and pushes it to the side. He runs back to his office with a drink and looks out of the window when a bright young student falls down the road from his window to meet the sidewalk. chat, drinking still. Cornell realizes that he must now read the manuscript. When he goes home, he waits for divorce documents. He drinks a little more. She leaves and goes to the faculty to find her there. He drinks even more. And when his wife learns that the student is dead, he learns, and he learns that he was in communication with the student. This, of course, forces him to do more serious drinking. The next morning he wakes up to find one of his student's dorm, cordially named Syd (Meg Ryan). <br /> <br /> She feels worse than a hangover, goes to the doctor and learns she is poisoned, it is irreversible and she has 24-48 hours to live. He does not have much time to find out who killed him, and at each stage there are subtleties, motives, relationships and surprises, even though everyone is at the end of the point. All his discoveries and exchanges are decorated with sarcasm, dry spirit, and enthusiastic observations. Let's just say that this film gives a new meaning to the "publication or death" of a message. <br /> <br /> This movie has no bad results. There are repetitive images and the symbols are used carefully. Watch cracked glass and glass distorted images. Some camera shots are revolutionary in 1988 and some violent activities are carefully and skillfully choreographed. Music is unobtrusive and relevant, though from time to time it does in the lyrics of its own wording. The visual images of this flick are impressive. <br /> <br /> If there is any failure, the opening 20 minutes will move a little slow and will almost make you fall asleep. But the pace is accelerating fast, just the right amount of exposure between the segments. <br /> <br /> There are no clear sexual encounters, although there is violence and some bad language. <br /> <br /> This is a writer's film and is best appreciated by those who have a sense of humor in their success or failure. I think if you take it seriously, you already have big problems.
