This movie is powerful. I watched this movie at 3:00 and I was probably at 6:00 at work, without saying it was too late. I couldn't get out of my bed. This is the most powerful film I've ever seen. And it made me cry and feel the pain of the family. I think Emilo did a great job of managing this movie. I agree with the earlier views that this is the only movie I've seen that has brought the home of war and shown what the family had to go through, what the veteran was going through. It is almost heart-breaking to think that people just thought you could live home from a changing life and be the same person you were before leaving. Kathy Bates reminded me of my mother's way. I believe he really showed how women knew and acted then. I'm surprised that this movie didn't give more prizes.
