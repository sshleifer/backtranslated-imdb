Is this really a Troma movie? Some scenes have the appearance of an "A" movie. Action is generally competent (two leading and sister substitutes were particularly good and I liked some contradictions between young Capulets and Ques); scenes were changed smoothly; The plot is coherent. It's funny. It has a clean and original soundtrack. <br /> <br /> It has the usual Troma brands and low humor, but I don't think Shakespeare would think so much. Actually, I think he could have laughed at this couple. <br /> <br /> It's a good DVD. There is an alternative soundtrack that has a very informative commentary by the director, a number of deleted scenes and the usual Troma collection, which is self-defeating. <br /> <br /> I'm not telling you it was Citizen Kane, but it's pretty inspired by low budget filmmaking.
