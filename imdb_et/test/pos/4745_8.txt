compact criminal drama with a good amount. Unique NYC location images add to this tough little movie. Technically well done, good direction and action. Needless to say, the downtown nature reserve extends across the western part of Washington Heights, across George Washington Bridge, and has one of the best movies in the NJ. for me, the time from 8 to 10 will improve ... easy
