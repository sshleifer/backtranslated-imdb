I only saw this movie when I was in my hometown at the beginning of India, at a time when the only thing that was bothering me about girls was tigers. I came home after looking at the glazed appearance in my eyes, who wants to be the one who is friendly with Tiger. What a movie and what moment it was! The theater I saw it does not exist and has given way to the mall. I don't know how I feel and don't want to ruin my childhood memory for so many years after finding a movie on a DVD or something like that and find it more interesting. From past experience I have learned that childhood memory is often faded when a person travels to lifetime roads from time to time, trying again to discover his uneven past films to find his innocent innocence completely negligible and no longer welcome. And I don't want to throw that movie's memory experience into the wind. I have no children, so I'm probably selfish, leaving this film in my brain with sepia tones, not on DVD. But if you are premature and want to remember memories of a loving child in later years, try watching this movie (if you can ever). It's really worth it.
