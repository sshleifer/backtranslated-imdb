This 8-minute pearl is not just timeless, it's drawing. This is Mickey's third comic and one of his best. This is a milestone in the cartoon because it was the first sound. And my goodness, even after 70 years, is always so good and gives the narrative a real extra weight. The black-and-white animation is great and the characters are convincing enough. Music is wonderful, I love the soundtrack, it adds fun to the cartoon, no matter how thin the story is. And the comic is funny! So many memorable moments, like cows' teeth, used as xylophone and its udder as a bagpipe. The characters are also included, Mickey and Minnie's two landmark Disney characters are well expressed by Walt Disney and Pete also serves well as "criminals". All in all, "Steamboat Willie" is just a timeless pearl that everyone should see at least once. 10/10 Bethany Cox
