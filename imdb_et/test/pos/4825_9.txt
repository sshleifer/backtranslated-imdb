The new familiar familiar ghost that shows the direction of Cardone is the wrong subject that keeps you glued to your seat. From time to time it is slow, because it builds the tension of what happens. On average, well gore, but what is probably nasty. Spoiler: The death of Christmas Eve and the following party is the highlight of gore hounds. <br /> <br /> Writers wrote an old story, but added twists and imagined you were a typical haunt. Cardone brings this life. . . er. . death. <br /> <br /> Lori Heuring, Scout Taylor-Compton and the ever-fabulous Ben Cross are real, no signs of action here. All cast persons are committed and really not what every director is trying to do. Actors believe we believe. <br /> <br /> Together with the traditional ghost story, the film will surprise you with the film's ton of atmosphere, mine, Hank's house, and Tunny's home, the last of the first frame. <br /> <br /> Horror fans, do yourself a favor and enjoy what sums of real horror movies today. <br /> <br /> Finish with the great weave of Boaz Davidson (story) Ben Nedivi (scenario) without inventors Hollywood would be nothing but an ugly reality TV.
