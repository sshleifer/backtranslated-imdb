I'm surprised that what is over 80 years of comedy is only 5.2 of the IMDB voters. Dan Ackroyd makes his usual satirical order, which seizes an excellent opportunity to steal the contract from his prison doctor. He leaves for California to start his work by advising on a radio show pretending to be infamous Dr. Lawrence Baird. The only person who knows he is a prosecutor is a drunken priest (Walter Matthau) who comes together to be spoiled by Ackroyd's new discovered wealth that failed him. Charles Grodin also complains of good support. For this genre, this film deserves the same credibility as "Ferris Bueller" or "Trading Places". 7.5 / 10
