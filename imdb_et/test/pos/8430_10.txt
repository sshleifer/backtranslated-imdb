The "Chinese Syndrome" could not be released in a better time: Twelve days after its release, Three miles of the infamous screwed on the island. But even if it (and / or Chernobyl) had never happened, this film will remain an important glimpse of what can happen through poor management of nuclear facilities. Jack Lemmon turns into a fifth-star director who drives his nuclear power plant views, Jane Fonda plays a reporter trying to investigate, and Michael Douglas plays his operator. <br /> <br /> Do not know if the current threat of a terrorist attack makes the "Chinese syndrome" more troublesome, but in both cases it is definitely a movie everyone should see. <br /> <br /> I hope that those people who have spent years wasting nuclear energy have seen this film so that they can know that their views and ideals are completely gone.
