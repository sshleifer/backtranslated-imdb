I had never seen this movie before it was broadcast on a local cable sci-fi network. It reminded me of Irwin Allen's TV (Time Tunnel, etc.) at the end of the 1960s. Great effect (they won Star Trek 5, which was made 20 years later, but then it was not very difficult to achieve). <br /> <br /> I found the script very interesting and mature for this type of production. They would have needed some ways to tie some loose ends at the level of the characters, but for the boyfriend it is surprisingly interesting (especially a look at a futuristic Eurolean policy that is surprisingly similar to today's European Union!) <br /> The type really reminds of the Twilight Zone in general ( as other users have noted), but this is a compliment. <br /> <br /> Great set, by the way! <br /> 7/10
