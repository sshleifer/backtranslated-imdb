It's the essence of the beginning of the eighties! Shopping centers, credit card machines, food, punk hair color, soundtrack ... I love this movie. This sweet, intelligent servant of Romeo and Juliet is instantly addictive. <br /> <br /> Martha Coolidge is one of my favorite leaders. She really works for her actors like John Hughes and Steven Soderberg, so look at -Jey Sex and Real Genius. -Valley Girl's tracks are great. If you find a copy of the movie, buy it! It is printed and very difficult.
