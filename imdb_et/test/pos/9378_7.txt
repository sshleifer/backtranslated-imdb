Edward Dmytryk led this shady investigation into the murder of the film, which included demobilized military personnel. Robert Young gives a lecture on hate speech, Robert Mitchum walks on most of this picture, and Gloria Grahame is reviewing his exhibited "It's a Wonderful Life". This is Robert Ryan, who is at the heart of the matter: anti-Semitism. He goes so deeply into his role as Monty Montgomery (Imagine parents called Lawrence, calling his son Larry!) That drama sits on his shoulders and is more than a challenge. Without him, the film would be normal. Ryan has played many memorable badges ("Bad Day at Black Rock;" "Billy Budd") in his days, but this performance put him on the map. Sam Levene is a victim of murder.
