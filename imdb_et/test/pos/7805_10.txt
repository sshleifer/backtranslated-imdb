There are some movies that are loved by almost everyone you come across, but it happens that there are box-office failures. Andaz Apna Apna, an intelligent and fun comedy, belongs to this catechism. Once upon a time, the Indian director has been in the minds of the audience and has not defeated Kader Khan's stereo-typical hoax. There are about two men in the film who dream of wealth and try to achieve it by comforting the millionaire daughter. The humorous drama opens up, while the story is much more complex. The complexity adds comedy to the entire plot. Aamir Khan plays the street-smart man, while Salman Khan gives an unexpectedly good result as a stupid boy. Paresh Rawal and his minions, Junior Ajit and "Kaliaa" blisters are laughing at you. Though the film borrows from many other films, despite the dirty camera work, and despite being sometimes "loud", it still remains one of the few funny movies that Bombay has after films like Padosan, Golmal and other Amol Plaekar films. . It is sad that it did not manage well in the office, which means that producers return to formulas and give up creativity.
