Andy McDermott (Tom Everett Scott) is a shy American teenager who spends his holidays in Paris with his friends Brad and Chris. Andy rescues Serafine Pigot (proud Julie Delpy) from committing suicide at the Eiffel tournament and is on her. He doesn't know he's a werewolf. They go to the underground and attack by werewolves. Andy is wounded and becomes a werewolf. He has said that the only way to get back to normal is to kill a werewolf that has hit her and a heart. This movie is a violent black humor movie. The special effects and soundtrack are excellent, emphasizing the band's Bush song. I do not know why some readers compare this movie with a masterpiece "American Werewolf in London". Stories are nothing in common (only American teenager, werewolves and the city in Europe). Very shown for fans of werewolves and black humor films. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Um Lobisomem Americano em Paris" ("American Werewolf in Paris")
