There are many factors in how comedy works: <br /> <br /> 1. Don't be afraid to take risks. 2. If somebody or something deserves fun, do it and go on, <br /> <br /> ... but most importantly: <br /> <br /> 3. BE FUNNY !!!! <br /> <br /> "The Chassis War Everything" succeeds in all three things. In fact, the show turned out to be so popular and so funny that the first season's DVD was released just a month after the first episode. I picked it up a few days after it was released and smiled on the floor and I had so many fu # @ ing tears in my eyes - that's so good, good! <br /> <br /> In short and saving me from the show, watch it, buy it, podcast it, regardless of what fu $ # ing is the best show in the world !!!!! <br /> <br /> Go to CHASER !!!!
