Note: After writing this review, I can see that this record is really a television series, not an original movie. My mistake. I thought IMDb was a movie database, not a TV show. But since most people search for this movie by BAGDAD CAFE and not by OUT OF ROSENHEIM, which is the name that this movie is listed under IMDb, I leave this comment here. <br /> <br /> Maybe I missed something, but when I read this other review, it seemed to be a completely CBS series review that was loosely based on this movie. I didn't see the TV series and I might like it or not, but one thing I'm sure is that it is very different. This movie is not like a TV show at all, and Whoopie Goldberg is not in this or any other famous Hollywood star (except Jack Palance, who was very charming in his role). <br /> <br /> This is a terribly sweet movie that completely thinks "out of the box". It's not like Hollywood's formula film, which is probably why (which is a nice word for idiots?) Who decide to market or decide not to market the movies. <br /> <br /> First of all, this movie pulled my heart and imagination. Music (which is only part of the time you can't really call it music) is a really cool story for cinematography. <br /> <br /> German or Bavarian woman (very pretty and pretty tough) gets an argument with another German or Bavarian man with whom she travels through the California desert, and is doing her way with her - picking up a car and she's left behind to abandon her deserted and desert on the highway There's nothing. <br /> <br /> He finds a small and broken but charming Baghdad cafe in Baghdad, California, and controls. The rest of the story is magic. I don't want to describe this movie because I want you to enjoy every surprise. <br /> <br /> Warning: If you are racist or have something against big women, this movie does not like the main romantic lead is a big woman, and brown and red skin characters are characterized by big roles and are "blends" without of any kind of racism. </p> and a delightful joy.
