The revelation here is Lana Turner's dance ability. Although she was exceptionally well-known as a nightclub and dance dancer, Miss Turner rarely got the chance to show this movie. <br /> <br /> So viewers note! Here, MGM clearly attempted to determine what direction they were still developing the young constellation, and they sent everything that Andy Hardy gave to the doctor Kildaire. <br /> <br /> In Two Girls on Broadway, he has been given a great opportunity to show his native rhythm and ability to change the pace with the ultimate product number "My Wonderful Dance". This number has been created and filmed as a hybrid between the Busby Berkely-style extravagant and the sort of routines Hermes Pan designed for Astor and Roger at RKO. <br /> <br /> So the number opens for George Murphy and Miss Turner depicted as patrons (full of chorus) before the black flat curtain where Mr. Murphy plotted Miss Turner. The camera (on the boom) is then pulled down by a remarkable crane to reveal a huge step and a rotating set equipped with steps, columns, housings and sliding walls. <br /> <br /> From that moment on, Murphy and Turner quickly perform a variety of moods and attitudes, including elevators, spins, a soft shoe, and an electrifying series of pirates ending in Murphy with both lifting and rotating Turner, an exciting speed for the orchestra. > <br /> Everyone said that a spooky game proving that Miss Turner was able to keep her as a dancer, even though I dare say that most of her admirers would not let her throw the queen of melodrama out of her throne.
