Although friendly and entertaining for the gay audience, Frank Oz's film "In and Out" is a closed gay teacher whose former student has appeared on national television, disinfected and deodorized to appeal to the larger and more profitable straight viewers patronized by The Bird Cage. Although the audiences are likely to have won from behind to be tolerant and liberal enough to see the film, the film revolves around Kevin Kline's Howard Bracket, who is an extremely stereotyped gay man. The film confirms that the tendency to dance to disco music, Barbra Streisand's films and dress shows her sexual orientation well. Like "Queer Eye", the film actually strikes a straightforward men and stereotype that is weak, dim, weak and lacking in taste and culture. OK, so "In and Out" is just comedy, but even comedies send messages that can hurt. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie's humor is somewhat pathetic in the middle. Howard is a medieval, deeply closed or denied, and apparently has never had sex. Three years of participation with a female teacher at the school where she works is described as sunset, long talks and watching a "funny lady". Fortunately, Joan Cusack Howard's intention, Emily Montgomery, is stealing the show. Most of the funniest moments of the movie are for him, although Kline's attempts to resist the machine's behavioral tape are fun. He is a talented physical performer, but the film gives him a few moments to shine. Matt Dillon stands out when the student turned to actor, and his Oscar-nominated film about a gay soldier is hysterical. But despite the gay theme of the movie, there is no boy-boy-boy-romance and only one man-man-kiss, and this smooch is about as erotic as Michael and Fredo Corleone in "Godfather II." <br /> <br /> Although "In Out and Out" is not capable of deliberately dealing with injustices and prejudices that it illustrates. Howard is fired for his outstanding performance and credentials despite his work, but little resentment is expressed. Most symbols are more distracted by canceled weddings than Howard's self-realization, which seems to be happening overnight, and his sudden and unfair dismissal. Not surprisingly, Howard's parents, shown by Debbie Reynolds and Wilford Brimley and his students, support him. However, the sugar finale is as embarrassing to the audience as it appeared to Howard Brackett. The film would have been refreshing if it had turned around, dressed like a football who was a fan of football, led a station wagon, listened to country music, and lived fast food. Despite some good performances and funny situations, "In and Out" affirm stereotypes and, whether positive or negative, stereotypes should be directed to the social history trash.
