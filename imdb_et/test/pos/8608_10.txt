The opening of the Imamura masterpiece avoids merely sensationality in describing the meaningless terrible events of the 6th century 1945, where 90% of Hiroshima and tens of thousands of lives were immediately destroyed. Instead, Imamura emphasizes the unprecedented curiosity of the disaster, focusing on such remarkable images as the diabetic mushroom cloud, which is quietly alternating with the black rain that crushes a beautiful woman's face. The rest of the film traces the consequences of the latter incident, bringing the atom to the Holocaust and its consequences (over 100,000 people died in irradiation poisoning) to Yasuko (Yoshiko Tanaka) and its small community to a poorly understood level. "<br /> <br /> Survivors are trying to achieve normality and continuity, in particular by trying to find a suitable marriage for Yasuko, but the direct possibility of radiation illness conceals every aspect of life. Yasuko's potential defenders are, of course, enough young women, no matter how attractive, who can real love, when it finally appears, does it unexpectedly and ambiguously.We do not know whether the love of the classroom is the status of Yasuko's status as "damaged goods" or of common mankind, which has been thrown into coarse relief by harsh circumstances, The classical finite style of the film enhances the effects, the eligible inner images that remind us that Imamura started his career as a great Ozu assistant. Imamura's mastery is evident, for example, in the pair of Yasuko swimming pairs, first emphasized by his sweet the back and legs, the other is how the hair falls out it is the same as the trajectory of the book, which distils its tragic nature. The documentary-style realism of the film is broken many times for expressive purposes, perhaps most of all in a scene that brings the life of a shocked veteran in a shell. The well-known avant-garde composer Toru Takemitsu score as well as the stunning black-and-white photography make a great contribution to the film's exciting atmosphere. When released on the latter, the laconic narrator of the film, Yasuko Uncle (Kazuo Kitamura), looks at the rainbow from the free sky as a sign of hope and regeneration, and the black and white image suddenly becomes such that it is almost intolerable. Compared to the great humanist Japanese masterpieces of the 1950s, some Japanese (or somewhere else) films could be compared. This movie is one of them. When I first graduated, I sat in the stomach, could not move for at least five minutes, because I felt that a great tragedy should inspire: terror and harm.
