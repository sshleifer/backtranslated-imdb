Denis Leary can really be funny and smart, always pleasant, but it takes a cake! This show showed the Leary genius. <br /> <br /> The job is set in New York. Leary plays Mike McNeil, a hungry detective who is married, has a random drug problem and has a girlfriend. McNeil has a serious attitude. So much he drips. The area is full of funny, interesting and pleasant signs beyond McNeil. Also great pain. All episodes of this stage are really funny and addictive. One liner in this show is everywhere. After listening to them, you have to sew and still laugh at them in a few minutes and then some. Case Cases are something else to remove nuns, a bathroom hostage situation and more are up. This show was too good. There may be increased legs to last much more seasons. <br /> <br /> Last word: great, fantastic show. I miss this show dearly. All episodes of this stage are great. You can even laugh at your belly ... a lot. ABC made a huge mistake, giving it an ax. Too bad Leary did not restore the cable television show. Nevertheless, I will give this exhibition one of my highest recommendations. Really one of a kind show.
