Gently spoken narrative story: uncomfortable young Jewish girl in World War II with American friends flees from escaped German fear, hiding her clubhouse. They talk about their lives and their beliefs (he is an opponent of Hitler), he feeds him, he becomes his only friend and ally. All of this reminded me of a much better theatrical film "Whistle Down The Wind", where Hayley Mills sings for the conviction of Alan Bates, but definitely cannot blame the direction that is smooth, or performances that are pounds. Kristy McNichol carries most of her picture after her teenage years and never gets a false statement. Suddenly, when a prisoner is discovered (and Kristy is discovered), the film becomes very tough. His father, shocked and ashamed of his child's acceptance of "this Nazi", puts him in a quiet rage I have rarely seen (he tells him "you are dead to me", which must be a little devastating to hear of a girl). Final scenes don't bother; no big gatherings, no handhelds. The girl has to face the world and in doing so she learns a bitter lesson from her neighbors, friends and family. Amazing movie.
