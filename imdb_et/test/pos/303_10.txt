I have always loved the ironic symbolism and brilliant cinematography of Coppola's masterpiece. I was lucky to meet Martin Sheen outside the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium one night in 1981 when he waited for Charlie and Emilio to leave. He was very humble about the appeal that I shared with him about this work of art, especially the portrayal of his young captain. This is undoubtedly a pattern, a complete 10 and an important part of American film history. "Charlie doesn't surf". Robert Duvall's famous line (second) does not need to be repeated because it has become a frequent hymn, and his Pattonesque character is long remembered as a classic American warrior in the John Wayne tradition. It is surprising to see how young Laurence Fishburne looks.
