Stephen Sondheim SWEENEY TODD: On March 1, 1979, Broadway opened DEMON BARBER in leadership positions with Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury. Although it was a sweep of almost every imaginable prize, it did not meet the expectations of the ticket office and the original production ended with 557 performances. Fortunately, the game went on a tour - and was filmed along the way. The result is a remarkable capture with George Hern, who replaced Cariou, and Lansbury's original Broadway production. <br /> <br /> However, there is an error. Simply put: the performances do not film very well, that the performance that performs well must perform in the theater and is therefore very, very large - and when put on the film, such performances often seem slightly static, aggressively aggressive or both. SWEENEY TODD is no exception. Looking at the film, this is the quality of "stand and sing", and although both Hern and Lansbury seem to have modulated their performances in the interest of the cameras, this is not Betsy Joslyn and Joanna; his more vivid performance reads the film with an unpleasant sensation, and his extremely operative voice seems inappropriate when it is opposed to the voice of general pain. <br /> <br /> Taking this stage-movie effect into consideration, it is a unique and macabre comic book style operetta. Lansbury is an amazing, confusing stupidity, stupidity and cunning mischief, while Hern really has the role of a psychotic hairdresser whose clients "go to their tombs to shave perfectly." General casting is quite good and although the film doesn't allow us to see enough sets, the screen is impressive enough. And music! Who can claim what most of the best works in Sondheim do? The story itself is especially well known, especially in England. In 1846, Thomas Peckett Perst created several urban myths for a short story titled "AGRICULTURE"; In a year or so that it was adapted to a stage like SWEENEY TODD, FLEET STREET DEMON BARBER - and in an era that knew little about copyright law, the variations soon played throughout England. However, each of them was more or less the same: hairdresser Sweeney Todd kills men who come to shave; Mrs Lovett, her companion, bakes them into pies and feeds them to an unsuspecting public. The Sondheim version is based specifically on Christopher Bond's 1973 version. <br /> <br /> The story is very big in Guignol, with lots of blood, bodies that fall apart, and grotesque humor; at the same time, the music, words and sub-block of the innocent in the clamps of evil clips open up with many lyrical charms that are not expected. Sondheim's words are often ironic, but never more than here; he passes the way through a lot of bad weather in industry and capitalism, and certainly can't put this complicated music into the sort of Victorian elegance. <br /> <br /> Like the "concert version" played by Hern and Patti LuPone, this particular film also gives us a number of choices cut from the 2007 Tim Burton movie format, especially the opening "Participate in the Sweeney Todd Story", that runs all over the game like a thread. This, in my opinion, is also much more comical than a film that tends to lower comedy to show even more blood. Whether you are a fan of the story, this is a legendary excursion at Broadway and it is a fallout. Recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
