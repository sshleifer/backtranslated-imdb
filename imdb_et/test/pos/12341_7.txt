Thorn-BMI is out of business before they stopped making movies, made the film cooler. Using E.S.P. and in Telecine as the daughter of a daughter whose father had succeeded in terrible power. Only in the death of his father, Olivia found that a Raymarkovitch girl from Raymar had murdered 6 girls and planned two more using the Ps√ºhic Vampirism technique. <br /> <br /> Our picture starts with 6 corona wagons that pull in and the music fits with 6 girls. Dead all when their eyes are in the closet. There were all sorts of objects on the walls, the coronaries pulled the old man up when the blue lightning hit the ceiling, which caused the formation of a circular hole, making the film only strange. <br /> <br /> If you like extremely cool scenes for you. If you don't see dead bodies years ago in every level of decay, don't look at it without a friendly companion. Like "The Changeling", it also has cardiac arrest. I gave this rating 7, it's colorful, actor Meg Tilly debuted in this movie when you find it.
