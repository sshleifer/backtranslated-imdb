Dallas stars Gary Cooper, Ruth Roman, Steve Cochran, Barbara Payton and Raymond Massey. It is headed by Stuart Heisler, photography comes from Ernest Haller and customs duties fell on John Twist. Produced from Warner Brothers, Dallas is vividly filmed from the Iverson & Warner Beaches in California at Technicolor. A lot of movie in your tongue firmly cheek, the film is upside down in western western states that exist without any claims or deep-seated meanings. <br /> <br /> The plot is seen by Cooper Civil War renegade, Blayde's "Reb" Hollister, fake his death to kill his reputation and free himself from his family's killed brothers in Dallas. Essentially a routine plot, the Twist story is perked along the way with lots of fun and exciting diversion. There are roles of cancellations, dandy fashions, horse races, shooting fields, a love triangle, a vigorous dialogue and small revolutions to keep the piece clean by number. <br /> <br /> Cooper also seems to be enjoyable, which further enhances the good feeling of what it offers. It is true that he has not really been asked to do anything more than be a laconic guy on a mission. However, when called upon to perform operational tasks, it will deliver the products that its fans have been waiting for during their successful career. The roots offer entertainment (especially Steve Cochran's whistle and dopy Bryant Marlow) because everyone has their own little peccadillos to keep them from familiar bliss. Two girls in the girls look proudly and keep the men well, while the high production value allows Haller to gently treat the lush Technicolor, and it involves working around the cameras. <br /> <br /> Ideas to be A List Oater makes Dallas, something he just can't achieve. But this is not a lack of trial, and the end result is pure entertainment that should really be enjoyed on the cold winter day when the viewer needs me. 7/10
