If a joke doesn't offend anyone, it's not funny. <br /> <br /> Ink cartoons are offensive, no doubt. So is rap music. Get over it. I suspect that any reasonable Black person finds the Ink cartoons fun and that the people they have offended White people who still think that Black needs their patronizing protection against racist humor. <br /> <br /> Seriously, Inki's cartoons are funny. It's sad to me, not because someone is really offended, but because someone can be offended, I can't buy Inca cartoons or the African Queen or South Song on DVD.
