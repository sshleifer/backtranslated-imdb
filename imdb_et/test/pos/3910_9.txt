I've heard many different opinions about this movie and then find out that Paris Hilton was in it too, didn't give me the best impression of the movie .... when a group of cinema drags my friends and sit there waiting for a pile of pants I was shocked to find that i was terrified of the rigid whole movie ... it was predictable yes, but the accumulation of death and the whole atmosphere of the film made it really scary for me ... i watched through my fingers all the way through. So I say go and decide for myself and if the fact that his scary movie does not convince you to go see it, then is Chad Michael Murray in that can not be bad to watch a few hours ee?
