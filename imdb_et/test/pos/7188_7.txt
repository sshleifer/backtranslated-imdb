The line above summarizes this pretty good. The best assets of comics are visual gags and word jokes (the latter is almost impossible to translate, so the comics are the best in their original language). <br /> <br /> Both are quite difficult to capture in the movie, so they are never as good as comics. Movies are just different media than comics. With this in mind, this movie will make your comics fun. <br /> <br /> The word gags is tolerable and sometimes even funny (Debouze makes Amelie reference!). I have to mention that I looked at the French version. If you don't look at the French version or if your understanding of French does not allow you to hit subtitles, jokes are likely to suck. it is a very simple form of humor and not quite funny if you are older than twelve, but it is the spirit of comics. Other visual jokes are the savior of the movie for older audiences, because they are often quite funny. comics. Only Depardieu and Clavier really do not overestimate what may be the reason why some people think they do not have their role (I didn't notice anything). On the other hand, Jamel Debouze, and especially Claude Rich, turn into art. It's nice to watch. Again, I'm afraid it wouldn't be nearly as funny as the votes are duplicated. <br /> <br /> In general, it is not a bad movie, much better than the previous one. It's not classic and it doesn't stop Asterix's twelve tasks as my favorite Asterix movie, but it's still worth it. French version, that means. 7/10
