If you liked the TV series, Diagnosis Murder, you will love the murder 101. It's nice to see Dick Van Dyket in the mystery of murder. If we are happy, this is the beginning of a series of television or at least a series of films. <br /> <br /> This movie definitely featured some great and remarkable actors performing roles. But it didn't seem like a "face" movie. It was really a story that made you forget the fame of the people on the screen. <br /> <br /> I thought it was over and I was so pleasantly surprised when I had to look at it again! It must be any mystery or for Dick Van Dyke lover!
