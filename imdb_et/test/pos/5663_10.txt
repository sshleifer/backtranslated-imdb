I think it is incredibly difficult to write any full-size review of Giorgi, but because it is one of those viewers, sophisticated, poetic and philosophical films that suffer when you try to enjoy their shell and reach their core while watching them. There are several things that are certain and no doubt about any artist (which I hope I am). The first thing: this is a certain masterpiece, even an art that will last a long time; another: it is one of those rare "dark" films where darkness is poetic, even romantic, attractive and much more sad than depressing, like the art of Pieter Brueghel or Caspar David Friedrich. As for the kernel of the film, someone called it Kafkian, although I disagree with it, because it is actually far from the misanthropic logic of Kafka and much more than the parables of Edgar Poe: dark and scary, but by the touch of our humble strings. In fact, on the poetic side (which is much more important than the narrative), Giorgino has a story of eternal peace and love that can only be achieved through the eternal childhood of the soul. Those with such souls are traditionally crazy in our society, but from another perspective they have all the virtues that everyone else lost when they "grow up" - the virtue of God's love. Indeed, Giorgino is a very Christian film, "Be Like Children" (Matthew 18: 3), whether it is a real hidden tag, although the film never deals with moral morality and focuses only on Christian philosophy, dares to assume the true God is beyond human morality . But I think that Boutonnat is too harshly "grown up" people, a kind of demon trying to steal childhood with rare surviving souls, but that is his position and he has the right to think about it. When looking at Giorgino, do not try to look for some hidden symbols (though there are some), look for signs and learn more about their behavior. Nor can it be said that the film looks amazing through excellent photography, especially the rational use of the color filter, incredibly suitable editing, all-cast admirable operation and, of course, the atmospheric beauty of the winter mountains. "Hunters on the snow". It is also interesting that the old woman with the death of the eyes of the black rings that traveled with the basket immediately reminded me of the series of drawings by Pesta (Norway), the painter Theodor Kittelsen, showing how a black plague strikes a small town in a mountain valley. Is that a coincidence?
