There are two ways to deal with the "head". Is it a dazzling, delightful music collage, old movie clips, psychedelic and T.V. Sitcom-style comedy or plot less, pretentious, bright mess. The truth is probably somewhere in between. It is also one of the best movies of all time. <br /> <br /> "Monkees" - Davy Jones, Peter Tork, Mickey Dolenz and Mike Nesmith - had just arrived at their table and wanted to make a movie. In collaboration with writer Jack Nicholson and director Bob Rafelson, they made "Head". <br /> <br /> It begins at the bridge opening ceremony in San Francisco, where the Monkee Gate interrupts the procedure. Mickey jumps over the safety rail, getting into hundreds of feet of water. Merine saves her with a superb composition by Jerry Goffin & Carole King, called "The Porpoise Song", and visuals that make Stargate the finale "2001". By now you have either turned off confused reluctance or be completely fascinated. Mickey uses a tank to destroy the Coca-Cola machine in the middle of the desert; the whole Italian army abandons him; the group is hired to play dandelion Victor Mature in the television trade; the overweight reporter offends the group by describing them as "God's gift to eight years old"; Mike's surprise birthday party goes wrong; the group is sucked into a vacuum cleaner and all its lift is driven inside a giant glass tank. I found this to be a refreshing change from the unobtrusive pop music we do "show here". Songs are also good; Daddy's Song is superbly choreographed by Toni Basil (later appearing on Rafelson's "Easy Rider") and boasting excellent editing, Davy's clothing is changing at lightning speed. "As we go by" is a lovely Goffin & King number whose accompanying pictures bear a strong environmentalist. <br /> <br /> Frank Zappa, Annette Funicello, are just two of the guest stars that are growing up. Did Victor Mature read the script before he agreed to do so? However, he's having fun. It was a shame he didn't find the audience at that time. If only "Spiceworld" was such!
