"Aristocrats" is classic Disney's best. It's not considered Disney's classic alongside the most famous Disney movies, but it's a well-made and fun movie that definitely deserves Disney classics. "Aristocats" is definitely a sure child's pleasure because it has all the components of the fun children's movies. I liked it very much as a child. I'm not sure if this movie is definitely fun for adults, who might look at Disney's classics for nostalgia, but I enjoy this movie as a young adult. <br /> <br /> Storywise, "Aristocats" may not be as complicated or innovative, but it doesn't matter. This film was made in the period when the filmmakers followed the motto that the characters were a story and a clever way that "Aristocats" definitely shows. Characters make a movie; they are all pleasant, fun, have big lines and have great interaction. Voice participants are also part of the fact that these characters are so convincing (Eva Gabor as Duchess, Phil Harris as Thomas O'Malley, etc.). The wrong idea could have been the Napoleon and Lafayette dogs, because they are actors and they don't have the real story to do, but fortunately they are fun and fun characters and the scenes with them are pure gold. > <br /> "Aristocats" is both fun and cute, but also a very funny comic. The style and appearance of the animation are perfect for the film's French surroundings (especially the city of Paris looks extreme). Character animation and design are great. And the songs are really memorable. My favorite is "Scale and Arpeggios", but the title song is a lovely song with "Thomas O'Malley Cat" and a memorable show stop "Everybody Want's Be A Cat". And George Burns' score is perfect for a movie in a funny and emotional situation. <br /> <br /> Generally, "Aristocats" is, in my opinion, the best 70's Disney cartoon and it is a film that deserves to be seen and remembered. So what are you waiting for? Do it yourself and share this Disney classics with your kids. It deserves to be in their memories.
