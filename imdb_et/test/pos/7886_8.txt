I remember so many things while I was watching this movie during this original theatrical release - after the advent of Woodstock's peace and love with the fear and paranoia of Watergate. It is hard to believe that it is thirty-seven years later, and I still remember how to go through my head while watching a movie with my best friend. As admired by Peter Boyle's ultimate redhead characterization, be sure to mark his remaining career (Oh, wrong!) And how counter-culture pulls the feelings of most of the country. To date my friend and I still use Joe Curran's drawing from my summary when I have a dilemma; curious about how such a simple line can last for decades for you. <br /> <br /> It is curious to read comments about the film from other members of its board, especially those that confirm the date and quality of the film. However, when you were in that time, the image depicts exactly the polar opposites that existed at that time, quite side by side, when the events of the story appear. If you really want to date, when was the last time you heard the words of Macy and Gimbel in the same sentence or line like Joe - "Come, go with the Pepsi generation". From a historical perspective, you have such a large Nixon poster that is one of the wallpapers - "Would you buy this man's used car?" With small complexities, such as, for example, director John Avildsen captures many subtle but never-present hints on how life was four decades ago. <br /> <br /> Today's viewing was the second time I saw the movie, and I have to admit that I don't remember Susan Sarandon in one of the leading roles, but then again it was her first picture. The scenes of nudity and free love at that time were completely new and bold, actually shocking the fact that filmmakers began to test their ability to push fitness and convention. "Joe" made a big leap in this, especially since it was a "mainstream" picture. <br /> <br /> Over time, what impressed me most about Peter Boyle was how he won the Joe Curran stereotype that appears in some of my favorite works. I mean, how do you go "Joel" to this fun "Puttin" Ritz "Young Frankensteen"? And my X-Files absolute favorite episode is Boyle Clyde Bruckman, both gentle and tragic, funny as well as a serious imagination that makes Scully and Mulder tables more than once. And like a master of careers, Frank Barone has to be one of the funniest signs in television history. Even recurring episodes in syndication are funny when he - when Elder Barone unleashes one of his observations. He is one of the actors that the viewer does not already know.
