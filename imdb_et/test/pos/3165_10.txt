I saw this in European plexis. Great movie! <br /> <br /> This movie is a study of Spirit and Meat today. Jim Kirk, chief specialist, rides the clumsy RV across America, often stopping his gas-tight tank. He's middle-aged and confused. He heats his thick diabetic body cup of coffee and radio conversation. She is meat: irritated and sometimes isolated, quite attentive to her growing tension, but she feels discomfort. <br /> <br /> Spirit encourages the film through speech and other sounds, but also what appears and goes in the visual field. The spirit finally collides with the muscle and Kirk falls, unable to understand what happened to him. He has denied how bad things are due to the movement of all of us, because we are all focused on the needs and desires of our flesh. We are all in the same denial, and as we, Kirk, have been threatened to fall and burn off the desert as he did.
