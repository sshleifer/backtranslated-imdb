Billy Wilder created a somewhat conventional biopsy of Charles Lindberg's flight. He extensively structures the film to tell the story of Lindberg, which carries the famous flight along the Atlantic that is currently in the film. The hour of an hour after an hour is not an excitement, and Wilder is not going to deviate from Lindberg as a hero of a normal man, so things are predictable. But James Stewart is well cast and quite plausible, like Lindberg, and many of the obstacles he needs to overcome in order to get his plane in the air, look at one. <br /> <br /> The film is most successful when Wilder strikes the parts of the story together to create tension, then relieve it, then tension again. Cinematography is pretty good, Franz Waxman's score improves scenes and Stewart really seems to be Lindberg, he believes he might be Lindberg. Finally, there is a bit of religious schmaltz in the 1950s, but the general direction, behavior and high product values ​​exceed the predictability of the story (does anyone really see this picture and do not know that Lindberg made it over the Atlantic?) An enjoyable film that is better than most of it movies from time to time. Billy Wilder made many films that are best for his craftsmen.
