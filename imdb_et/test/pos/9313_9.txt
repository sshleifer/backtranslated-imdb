How's the bear's paw, elephant's body or monkey's brain for dinner? Las Tsui Hark will tell you about this wonderful and easy-going comedy about traditional (?) Chinese art. <br /> <br /> This movie shares the common structure of the American sports film, but instead of focusing on baseball, it focuses on cooking, which makes it even more interesting. I even think Leslie Cheung's character looks like Charlie Sheen in the Major League ... <br /> <br /> This movie also includes a little bit of Zhao Wen Zhao vs Xiong Xin Xin fight (I love to see it more after Blade) and quite a funny joke about Leon Wide pop song ... <br /> <br /> Maybe not an ideal movie for strict vegetarians.
