Shunya Ito's third and final scorpion film on female prisoners. The series star, Meiko Kaji, finished the fourth installment, Grudge Song, which was headed by a capable Yasuhara Hasebe (who also led Kajit in a stunning Stray Cat Rock: Sex Hunter). The original female prison # 701: Scorpion is one of my all-time favorites. Jailhouse 41 is almost as good. Generally, this series is considered to be the best, and I think when I get a better release on the DVD (the original, the picture is very bad). Beast Stable is, in my opinion, almost as good as the FP701. It's much slower, much more reflective. It's part of violence and nastiness, but more focus on story and characters. Sasori (Kaji) elutes detectors in the first scene (he is attached to the handcuff and slips his hand and escapes with it, which must be viewed credibly!) And join a freelance prostitute Yuki. Yuki is busy with a local prostitution circle that includes a wolf-looking madam with a cage full of pets. What really surprised me when the sad movie is. Yuki's story that has never been solved is heartbreaking. The images are amazing and Ito's direction is masterful. It's too bad that he never went out of the FP701 series. This is a fantastic movie.
