Separate LIES changed my life. In fact, Q&A did. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ALAD. Read only when you look at trailers or have already seen it: <br /> <br /> The character of Emily Watson deceives Tom Wilkonson. My first reaction to the puppy-eyed Emil was "It's over. Dump him. For some reason he was around. Not in a pathetic way. He just listened. He tried to accept his needs. Sometimes he had to leave. But he stayed with him and let him But I still wanted to see him. <br /> <br /> Later, the screenwriter and director Julian talked about the movie. I am glad he did because, frankly, I'm too you and was too immature to get a point before when he broke me. <br /> <br /> Tom's character loved him and no matter how much his needs met he'd love what he wanted, he always loved him. because he wanted to be with someone else. The fact that he wanted to be with someone else didn't make him who he was. If you get in the last fifty years, there is a high probability that finding a love for your life won't come around, so that you can't be so modest k ui you were younger, you have to try and do things because the alternative can be much worse. He needed what he needed, and he couldn't help. He had to learn to let him go if he wanted to be the man he could be. She helped her as a lover, even if she hurt her. <br /> <br /> Another thing: Julian said that the strongest tool in the controller is guilt. Again, the strongest tool in the controller is guilt. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, Tom released his load. He felt the need to let him know that he loved him, but not to get him back; he wanted to let him know that he did not have to feel guilty of the relationship or think badly, but because it ended so terribly. <br /> <br /> It's not my way to watch a movie based on a message, not a performance, especially if I understand this message better when the director explains it to me, but I'm making an exception here because I feel more mature than watching a movie. <br /> <br /> Making a movie was nice, British pace. Rupert was mild and acidic. Tom and Emily were their usual solid characters characters.
