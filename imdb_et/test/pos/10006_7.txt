I felt that this film had many good qualities. Cinematography was definitely different, which set the stage for the production and story. The original characters as actors were definitely an accomplishment and I felt that they were playing the most convincingly, of course they play themselves, but certainly unique. Cultural aspects can be disappointing for many, because knowing Chinese and Oriental culture answers many questions about parent / child relationships and stigma related to drug use. I found Jia Hongsheng's story interesting. There is a note that the story is in Beijing and some fashion and music reek in the early 90s, although it was made in 2001, so it's really cheesy sometimes (Beatles crap etc). Whatever, not ten or twenty, but if it's on television, look at it.
