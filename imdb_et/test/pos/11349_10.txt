The most attractive factor in this film masterpiece is not the beautiful actors. It is also not their outstanding acting and sizzling chemistry. <br /> <br /> For me, this is the movie's precious scene. Settings, lighting, props ... everyone adds a feeling of love between the main characters. Chow's cigarette smokehouse tells us his mental state, Lizhen constantly changing tightly matched cheongsams reflecting decision-making constraints, Angkor Wat ruins link the two wires between the deteriorating relationship. /> <br /> The excellent use of Mis-scenes gives the film the right amount of hours needed to refine the complex character of the characters. The film leaves the audience for a long time.
