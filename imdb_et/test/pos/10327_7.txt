This movie was roasted by MST3K boys, but it is actually a clean and nasty little noir film. The plot is dense, the characters are plausible (good-boy-gets-obsessed-bad girl genre), this pace is sure, the climax is well handled and several good character actors are cast. True, most of the time you want to hit the main producer with brick, but he is actually quite effective when he plays the master. The scenes between him and his father are quite powerful, minimalist. Of course it's frustrating, but that's the thing. Good movie.
