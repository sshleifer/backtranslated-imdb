Chuck Jones 'Beep Beep' (despite the fact that Road Runner clearly states that "Meep Meep" is from other exceptionally popular Road Runner series, and it is a huge advance in its predecessor, historically important but weak "fast and fast" . Furry-ous ‚Äù. Although it has several predictable fast parameters, Beep Beep also extends to this original comic with more ambitious and longer sequences. Among them is the main, long-running yacht through the old mine, where we see Coyote and Road Runner, represented by two small lights. There's also a very funny longer gag that includes some rocket roller skates. "Beep Beep" also sees a major improvement in Wile E. Coyote's office. Not only does he see a more beautiful than his fast prototype "Fast and Hairy", but he also draws more images to the audience, with more looks to show his idea shine or fear of pain soon. Although it is a bit slow to go (too many permanent drawings that hamper the speed of some early gags), when "Beep Beep" arrives at the mining shaft queue, it is clear that Jones was beginning to get their hands on the signs and the greater opportunities he had you can do them. There are better Road Runner cartoons than "Beep Beep", but there is a real triumph with this comic, as if it was a confirmation of a series of milkshakes from this scenario.
