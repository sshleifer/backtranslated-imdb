So funny is a great way to describe this 12-minute original Star Wars. Hardware wars are incredibly funny. It is presented as a trailer for the space epic hardware wars. The joke is: Imagine Star Wars, played by bad actors and incredibly bad special effects. The characters include "intergalactic boy-wonder" Fluke Starbucker, "ace mercenary and intergalactic wise man" Ham Salad, Darph Nader, "villain" and a host of other fantastic characters. It is impossible to laugh when looking at a 12-minute treasure. It's stupid, but it's fun. You laugh from start to finish and you feel the need to look again and again and again ... And you laugh every time you see it !!! <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10. More fun in 12 minutes. You believe it lasted a minute!
