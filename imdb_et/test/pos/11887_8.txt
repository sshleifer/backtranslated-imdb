This is one of the great kung fu movies. Many reviews seem to be in contradiction with the fact that comedy is based on old and new China from time to time, quite subtly (at other times). Kara Hui is called a country of bumpkin, for example, and gets into difficulties when trying to adapt to a new one, but ultimately rescue her families from dresses like an old-fashioned hero, unlike Hsiao Ho's modern military style. Gordon Liu seems to have played his part with smiles playing his serious, fellow workmate with foolish wigs and guitar. The final battle is just fantastic and ends with the death of Johnny Wang, not death. Kwan Yung Moon should be mentioned during his excellent playing with an invincible armor - just terrible. And Kara Hui is doing some great actors and fighting. Great movie.
