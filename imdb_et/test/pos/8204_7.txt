You could get into the mood of this movie and say how it failed, or how the main player could just enter the office and start using the computer, etc., without anyone noticing and really watching the movie bits ... or you could just sit in a bucket with a popcorn and enjoy the story and the actor . Personally, I prefer the latter, I live in real life and watch the news with all its destruction and darkness, so that my movies would be more entertaining and would see bad guys get their prizes. Don't take it too seriously and you can enjoy this movie thoroughly.
