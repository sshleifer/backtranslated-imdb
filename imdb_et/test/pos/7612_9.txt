I love this movie so much. It always makes me cry. If you appreciate Drew Barrymore as much as I do, you'll love this movie. It has all the movies you need. It has good actors, good characters, good humor ... lots of warm-hearted moments. However, when we see Josie in high school, we see a cold. Every time. I'm sure you like it, don't decide that it looks like a teen movie, though it's in some sense a teenage movie. Of course, if you're a man, and all you look at is a hardcore special effect movie with just about 250 best movies of all time, that's not for you. But if you like romantic comedy, then you won't forget to see, enjoy and enjoy the video store: Drew Barrymore is great!
