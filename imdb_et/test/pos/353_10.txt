Mario series is back and I think better than ever. Galaxy is still the most creative mario; even more than 64th super-mario. some of the best for wii. also beautiful graphic design. The levels are very high and good old bosses are back. this game has tons to explore; definitely a high recurring value. I have only 2 complaints: 1: the story is a bit like Mario 64 and 2: the weight is not very big; although it needs patience. Mario Fans: The game you have been waiting for. Casual gamers: This game is more than worth buying. 9.8 out of 10.
