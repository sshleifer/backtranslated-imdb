This is an unlikely anti-war movie that has been ignored for too long. Time is Thanksgiving of 1972. The place is a typical suburban home somewhere in Texas. The eldest son is just a return from Vietnam and has the time of hell to adjust the life he had left behind. And the family doesn't know how to solve the problem. I do not honestly believe that I exaggerate when I say that it is one of the most close-to-heart films I've seen. The funny thing is that there are only a handful of combat sequences in the whole movie. Most of the story takes place inside the house within a few days. But such a home war is as intense as any real battlefield action. The film does something that is hard to achieve; somehow, Estevez and his team have created a film that embodies the experience of Vietnam. Given the similarities between the current invasion of Vietnam and Iraq, the film is surprisingly important. Estevez does a great job with the material. He gets a lot of help from the hand-picked pain. Especially Martin Sheen and Kathy Bates are excellent as parents. A truly moving film. Highly recommended
