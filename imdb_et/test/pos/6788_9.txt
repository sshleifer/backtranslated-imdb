My family is watching this movie over and over again. Even our 3 year old loves it. I like "goodness" in the movie. Giving strangers the opportunity ... to show good will to one who apparently needs unconditional approval. The film gives good will and victory. Another aspect of the film that makes it so attractive is the personalities of the Velvet siblings. Bird lover. Fault Lover. Boy lover! Very cute and happy movie. However, there is one thing that irritates it. So Mr Brown often makes Mr Brown often stupid or unreasonable. Sometimes he comes when you know all this, and he's a twilight he's not. Too bad to make a nice story. Nevertheless, we enjoy this wonderful, old movie!
