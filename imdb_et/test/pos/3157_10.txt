It's funny because I read all the comments on this page after getting this movie and it's either love it or hate it. You probably love it or hate it too. I think the best movies are sharing people because they obviously have no effect. I'm in a five-star camp because this movie made me a real number and wanted me to go back and learn more about Afghanistan and Iraq. I have to admit that I was pretty tuned when everything happened. Especially Afghanistan and I feel guilty about it. The music through the movie was beautiful. I lost it especially during historical setbacks. Personally, I thought the sound was great. It seemed to me that the soundtrack of the calls, music and radio had been assembled so that you felt in the RV with Jimi, the headline or the head. Everything that wasn't on the radio was very clear, and everything on the radio sounds like radio. Anyway, it's a very amazing DVD that made me cry.
