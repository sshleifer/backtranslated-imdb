Jean Dujardin gets the motifs of Connery: adjusting the cuff links when entering the club, if all women admire him, competing straighteners and ties soften, exhilarating, sharp walking. It is unpleasant and you will understand how much of Bond's creation in the 1960s was Connery and not really the character of Ian Fleming. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is for young early films, mostly from Russia with love and Thunderball. The main joke is how a cowboy hero is not only sexist, but also nationalist and colonial, and how he shares the nose when he is sent to Egypt. <br /> <br /> It's not perfect - in about 20 minutes, it seems like one joke movie and its bits resemble one day spoofs, which was a lot. Morcecambe and Wise's Intelligence The men were with the suspects in the fise, who also watched their heroes, and it goes back a little. Unlike Clouseau sellers or Baron Cohen Borat, Dujardin does not give the character of his reality or the true layer of sin - he is too busy to improve his Connery motifs. It's not enough for credit or big song, and it's not a funny or serious villain, like Mike Myers Dr. Evil or Ricardo Montalban's naked weapon to answer. <br /> <br /> While OSS117 wakes up in Cairo one morning, I had three quarters of ridiculous cinemas and the whole thing looks wonderful, plus you never get the chance to see Kid Brother on the screen and women are ace crumpet, really hot. This is Bond-looting without getting into a mad scientist / Ken Adam kit or a funny gadget routine. Quite recommended.
