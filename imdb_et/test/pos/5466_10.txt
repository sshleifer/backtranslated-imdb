A great story with all the actors acting on the supper. The warmth and understanding of who represents Joad went into the heart of the screen and its viewer. Barbara Hershey also made a great contribution to the disappointment and resilience of her mother, Madalyn, in her work until her last breathing. The intertwining of Joad and Mother Madalyn's personalities grew throughout the story by breath taking the final scene.
