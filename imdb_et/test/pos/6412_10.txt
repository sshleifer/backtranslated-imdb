This film, which is one of the best I've ever seen, speaks of disobedience. It strikes in living Taipei, which is a painted cold color where rain falls consistently; DAMP World. It shows us the story of two people, men and women living in this world. coincidence or destiny unites their existence, but they cannot open each other's words. Characters are a reflection of the difficulties of our society in relation to human relationships. The communication capability that is being taken under extreme limits here. all characters change only a few words during the movie, dialogues are almost absent and when a word is spoken, they are often weak and empty, far from describing people's real feelings. So, the progress of the story, the appearance of the characteristic feelings has been developed (a brilliant idea!) Musical trimming, which seems to be just a meaningless film. The course of the sentimental event and the drama of the female protagonist lead us to an excellent end that is highly symbolic. A film that is different from the usual is a great talented director's intelligent execution. PS. Forgive me for your bad grammar!
