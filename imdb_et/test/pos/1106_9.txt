The DVD from ACCENT's product line, which is a specialty of flop art, released the irreversible and numerous Bergman opuses. <br /> <br /> The thing to me about Alex Frayne's strange title, MODERN LOVE, is that it is an impeccable film that breathes with perfection and vision, a film that takes us to Joe's middle mind, full of voices, visions and madness. It's set in a rural redneck in Australia, the film doesn't trivialize or praise people like many Australian movies. that is, our films are full of "loved criminals" or people with "golden hearts", etc. etc. <br /> <br /> Not in this movie. The spirit of Stanley Kubrick tends to be great here, it is not flawless, but has a remarkable attention to detail, a romantic line, and a mood that is capable, if not captivating. <br /> <br /> Small questions ... the appearance of the transmission is faulty - the pre-credits were sliced, they are not suitable for the frame. <br /> <br /> One of the short films is also broken, it stops halfway.
