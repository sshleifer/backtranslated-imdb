I saw the opening of the gate of heaven in the week almost twenty years ago. Tickets were sold in advance, based on a high expectation of seeing Cimino for a long time following the 1978 masterpiece "The Deerhunter". The opinions came and the critics sprayed the film terribly. The influential New York cinema criticism led the way and most critics followed suit and 3h. 40 min. the film was pulled out of the distribution. Cimino had been shortened for about an hour by joint artists, and it appeared again several months later for equally horrific reviews and inconvenient business. At that time, the film cost about $ 40 million (which is now considered a low budget), making it one of the most expensive in history and Cimino's endless setback despite the fact that it was only his third film. The Deerhunter also received a negative setback, based on perceived political ideology that was not popular. I'll call it all to give you a possible advantage over Cimino. At that time, I thought the film was very good and when I saw a shorter version, it was still very good. The film appeared again in the museum in the early 1990s. They had to show a long version, but they didn't find the existing print. Despite the years of the film, I now thought that the gate of heaven was a masterpiece. Finally, a long version of a couple in a selected city appeared, I saw it recently and was expected. The gate of heaven begins with a graduation ceremony at Harvard University. Two graduates are Kris Kristofferson and John Hurt, and we have some shortcomings in these signs early. Despite his mandate, Joseph Cotton gives his graduate a class to use his education to enlighten and improve his country. Many graduates behave as if they were part of an elite club. The film flashes for 20 years in Wyoming, Johnson County. The Cowboy's "Shareholders' Association" has hired poor people to shoot 125 poor immigrants, claiming that they are thieves. Kristofferson is in favor of immigrants, while John Hurt is part of the association. Although Hurt is totally against this mad action, he is too inefficient to do anything about it. It is a massacre, but immigrants can protect themselves well. The United States Cavalry comes to the rescue of the Association when they allegedly arrest them after more harm than they actually punished for mass destruction. Kristofferson also suffers great personal loss, and the film ends with him years later as part of his Harvard Days elite class, married, boring, hunting, living but dying inside. <br /> <br /> This is a very sophisticated movie that is great in every department, such as its themes, structure, direction, cinema, writing, music, editing, design and acting. Kristofferson, Walken, Hurt, Huppert, Dourif, Bridges, Waterston, and Cotton are great signs of great complexity. Some of the major complaints I read about the state of the film, which is ugly to look at, inconsistent, too long, that characters don't make sense, and that words are often incomprehensible. Heaven's gate has the appearance of this time, just like "McCabe and Mrs. Miller". Some scenes are smoky to recommend an industrial revolution, or sometimes horses, wagons, people go through a sense of reality on every side. Nevertheless, the composition of each frame and cinematography are impeccable. When it comes to film, it makes sense if you pay attention to it. Not everything is accurately displayed to the viewer and needs to be closely monitored to understand the characters or its themes. In terms of length, it is a beautifully structured piece, sometimes moving, poetic, exhilarating or devastating after almost one other scene. Sometimes some words are incomprehensible, especially in some of the activities in an exciting scene. However, such a cinematic film could be understood as the use of the language of the film, the characters and their actions. One day, this movie must be completely released to give people and critics a second chance. Don't let Michael Cimmon get another Orson Welles, which is valued during his lifetime and who can't make such great movies he can do.
