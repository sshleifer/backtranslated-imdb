At the end of the suburb, there is a lot of concern about the upcoming "peak" of world oil supplies. As the world population grows, there is also a demand for oil and electricity. When we take out oil and energy, we reach the top of production. More oil is required, less oil is produced. The inevitable result is conflict and big changes. <br /> <br /> This movie is annoying and worrying if you are new to this topic. You can first respond to anger and denial, because the consequences are so grim. It should be watching. In addition to politics, no optimism beyond mathematics is disputed. Suburbia is a focus because our suburban neighborhoods are communities that have the greatest impact on energy when the price of energy rises. While intuitive logic tells you that metropolitan areas are avoidable in times of crisis, suburban distribution is, by its very nature, difficult, if not impossible, to maintain an effective community without our vehicles being transported. <br /> <br /> Peak oil is no longer a topic for discussing survivors and back fields. This question is on our doorstep earlier than we think. This film is a clear and consistent look at it.
