When I was younger, I saw the end of the HAIR on the TV. I just watched the movie for the last 5 minutes. And I was impressive. I got goose pimples and I told myself I was watching this movie. <br /> <br /> And I did and I say: This movie is amazing. The songs are great, the actors are very good and the message ... The message of this movie is one of the most important: "Love, not war". This movie is a real masterpiece. In the meantime, it's my favorite movie. <br /> <br /> The last song is one of the saddest and happiest I've ever heard. I almost felt like joining the crowd. All I have to say is: "Let the sunshine, let the sunshine"
