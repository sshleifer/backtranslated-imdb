This movie is not all the more frightening, but it is a great example of the terrible fear of the eighties - low budget, stars, many inventive death scenes, and enough nudity to keep teenagers in their seats. The premise is interesting and fun, and three evil children play their parts well. A nice starting point for "Just Say" Julie Brown reveals her talents at the beginning of her career. This movie is not seen by many, but it is a must for fans of the 80's.
