Jamie Foxx's masterpiece is just one of Ray Ray's most important feature in 2004, featuring Kerry Washington, Regina King, Curtis Armstrong, Richard Schiff, Sharon Warren, Patrick Bachau and many others. The film has several main focuses: the first is Charles's childhood - his brother George, who haunts him for years, drowned, the glaucoma that blinded him, and the strength taught by his mother - do not bend, do not break, never irritate. Finally, he sends him a special school where Charles presents a gift of music. The next focus is on Charles's artistic development as a Nat King Cole-like singer, organizing his gospel music, his music teaching, and the unique sound that came from Ray Charles. The third focus is on Charles's personal life - his marriage to Bea, his many things, his heroin addiction and possible rehabilitation. <br /> <br /> Since Charles lived packed for 74 years, there is a lot of skipping. Although Charles was orphaned by his teenagers, his beloved mother, his stone, was not on the film. Although she is shown in a chitlin and refused to play in isolated clubs, her almost hunger for music is not covered. At one point he found a can of capsule and tried to eat it, but the jar broke. He was it down and out. Bea is shown with him when the Georgian state who banned him takes his "I remembered" Georgia in 1979 and welcomes Charles to his homeland, but he and Bea were separated in 1977, which was not mentioned. He was probably there. He was also not his only wife - he was never married before he met him; that marriage is not covered. The film talks about an illegal child - there was 12. It would have been impossible to get all this and more movies. <br /> <br /> What's not overlooked is his glorious music that continues to shine throughout the film, constantly strengthening his genius and artistic work. <br /> <br /> Charles's story is convincing and keeps the audience interested. Those who do not talk about it on television do not give him credit worthy of. The direction of Taylor Hackford gives Ray a good pace, and the film has a lot of atmosphere and it provokes beautiful decades. <br /> <br /> Like Ray, Jamie lives with the Foxx character and forgets that he is a comedian. Foxx wore a prosthesis, made his own piano and spent a lot of time with Charles to prepare this role. He nails him, but it is not a personality - he is a man of flesh and blood who has hallucinations that stand in the water and find his brother's body; a man who denies his addiction hates the word junkie and believes he is not hooked; and he denies his home life, thinking his wife doesn't know about her different things and illegal children (in the movie, the child); and the man took the early advantage of his career because of his darkness, who refuses to go on later. He requires $ 1 bills to be taken into account; when he discovers that he is a poison train for the club owner and his partner, and he had almost set a record, he makes his deal and leaves his job. Foxx's performance when he first appeared on the camera is Ray. <br /> <br /> This is a great biography that, like Walk the Line, is the artist's fantastic music. Are you a fan of Ray Charles, "Ray" is something to experience.
