We saw this movie at the Toronto Film Festival last year. It was a truly moving experience. I had heard of the truth and balancing process, but as others have written, they did not know much about the details of the process. This film demonstrated the process and growth that can occur when people can confront their past, understand the events from the point of view of others and persuade them. Archbishop Tutu and other people involved in the development of the R & D process deserve recognition for their feelings. Seeing this movie gave me hope for the human race. If we can do T&R, we may not destroy ourselves. People look at the T and R groups as the first step in human adolescence and maturity. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film was flawed. I didn't notice any major problems with running, managing or writing - but for the first time in years I was completely lost in the movie, so I didn't notice. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie. The Toronto audience did not give up on the next film, we had so many questions and comments for the stars and the director. Tom Hooper, Jamie Bartlett and Chiwetel Ejiofor went on the walkway to continue the conversation. People just came to shake their hands and thank them for the movie. It moved us all.
