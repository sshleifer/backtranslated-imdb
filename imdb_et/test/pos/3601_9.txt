This film gives us some history of World War II with some romance, little fantasy and meaningful emotion - and a beautiful landscape. Nicholas Cage is never able to fail us and here is a great job again. And so are other fundamental characters. One key element, John Hurd's doctor / father, gives (your daughter) the best definition of love I've ever heard. Some events are a bit too casual to be real, but I apologized for knowing it was partly a fairy tale and fantasy. My wife and I really liked the movie. And it's nice to look at people who risk being loved by the enemy. One man who left us near the theater said to his wife, "This is a chance to make war!" I think you can see what it means when you look at the cute Italian occupiers of the Greek island.
