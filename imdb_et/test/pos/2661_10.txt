The awakening of humanity itself is the "2001: A Space Odyssey," a process that goes along with space-time continuum. We see our original past and we conclude from the "cosmic future". The powers of intuition thus become the door to our understanding of our ongoing collective journey. <br /> <br /> From this transcendental perspective, a normal, egocentric plot seems superfluous. Our crazy conflicts and self-expanding dialogue are consuming evolutionary changes and are insignificant in space, which is widely understood. This is a tough lesson for an inefficient and aggressive species. Then it is not surprising that some of us are slowing down the film and its little story. For a sensitive viewer, reward is an inspiring way of thinking and awe. <br /> <br /> In this movie, which is mostly visual, geometric symbols guide our intuition. Circles and arches represent nature. At the right angle is conscious intelligence. Some people think that the shiny black monolith is a von Neumann probe. Maybe. Undoubtedly, the monolith is a visual metaphor for extraterrestrial intelligence, the physical form of which has never been shown. The mystery is deeper than the explanation. <br /> <br /> "2001 ..." is unique in terms of content and scope. Cinematic art is beyond this world, special and visual effects are breathtaking and classic music is sublime. I rarely use the word "masterpiece" to describe a movie. But Stanley Kubrick's "2001: Space Odyssey" is the art in the highest sense, such as Leonardo da Vinci's "Mona Lisa" or Vincent Van Gogh's "Starry Night".
