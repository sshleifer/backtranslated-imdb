It starts a little slow but gives it the opportunity. In the spirit of "Wackiest Ship in the Arm" and "Pink Sub", this film is not an orthodox group that deals not so much with Orthodox methods to overcome everyone. Rob Schneider is invaluable to LT, which takes himself too seriously, resulting in an attempt to fail and a "pirates" team makes him walk. By contrast, Kelsey's grammar (similar to Cary Grant) does not take anything serious after work. This film is more of a line than a plot. From the "beered up" fisherman in the port of Charleston to the "whale" lure, they took their surprise surprise and laughed out loud.
