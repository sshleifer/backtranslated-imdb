I share my review in the following 5 categories, each with a maximum of 100% (if perfect) ________________________________________________________________ <br /> <br /> Visual pleasure: [100%] This is a visually appealing film. I looked at it very well. The golf scenes have come very well and the dramatic effects on the green were amazing. I also loved seeing old wooden golf clubs and bags. <br /> <br /> Director Director: [70%] Bill Paxton is more involved with acting, but this movie shows he has a talent. I did a decent job. <br /> <br /> By: [90%] Shia LeBeouf was very good in her role as Francis Ouimet (this guy can do well). The rest was also good. <br /> <br /> Entertainment Value: [100%] I liked every minute. It was mostly entertaining. <br /> <br /> Script: [91%] Actual story and thus makes the movie more special. It was intriguing right from the start and loved every scene until the end. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> All sports enthusiasts, especially Golf (see all), will love it). Anyone looking for a nice entertainment movie and not hating sports can watch it. <br /> <br /> _____ <br /> <br /> 10/10
