This is a great documentary and the above comments give a brief overview of how big it was, so I wouldn't repeat the same stories. But Faith is similar to a Turkish-oriented man who apparently knows more about this country than a normal European, and it falls into the trap of orientalism that other Western artists usually fall. But come on a man you are bloody in Turkey and your movie can be deeper and describe what is beyond the "bejoglu old town". The Muzeyyen Senari and Orhan Gencebay performances are a look at the film and Ceza (a very talented and bad ass Turkish rapper) talks about the American gangsta raps, which I totally agree with. I recommend this movie to my American friends.
