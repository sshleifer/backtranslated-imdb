Oh my God ! I can really say that Maya Angelou is one of the most intriguing and important people in the world, especially my culture. She is incredibly inspirational and her story is a story of a great woman! When I first selected this movie, I thought that the cast was perfectly put together, now we see them in action! Maya Angelou is already my favorite PoetEss and now one of my favorite actors and speakers. I believe he is the biggest ever. This movie was at my place and came to Kleenex, reminding me that, no matter where you come, if you decide you're big, you're great! And Ester Rolle played a wonderful supporting role ...... 100% AWESOME ... and now even "I know why drilled birds are singing."
