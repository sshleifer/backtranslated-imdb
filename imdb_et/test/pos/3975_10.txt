The best thing about American Pie's "bakery". I found that humor and the plot is a lot more interesting than any American Pie movie. Also in terms of content content, I find it acceptable for a much larger audience than any previous American Pie movie. I enjoyed this movie experience thoroughly. When the movie came out for the first time, I read a number of negative comments and couldn't see it when it was still in the theater ... I'm sorry about this decision now. The film surpassed my expectations of plot, dialogue / scripting and overall quality. I'll give her two thumbs up!
