In one way or another, you cannot stay away from the main message. Strong survival. Those who are psychically or emotionally sensitive are leaving. They leave behind the lives of those who love them. Open what is seen in its finality as selfish. That's what Phoebe finally understands. Just before you helped Wolf blame you. He can accept his sister's missing ... closing. Beautiful European landscape. Much truth in this ideal and dependent on the next great moment. For a moment, I was thinking of the Baader-Meinhoff gang who was around the early 70s. I liked this movie because it reflected the time I was born.
