When I was very young, my mother had four Looney Tunes / Merrie Melody bands and I watched them all several times. Coy Decoy was one of those short pants and I was really shocked to read in another comment that it was forbidden. When I was young, I probably didn't even think of the Black Beauty gag. However, this is probably forbidden, although while I was watching this video on the site, I didn't even remember it was. While watching the video, I remembered some of the shots - especially the decline of Daffy's hat and Daffy's eyes turned into a bell as a lure in the circle around the lake. I was hardly bothered by what was probably the reason why the gag was banned. Instead, I was flooded with childhood memories for a brief look at it. Because how much I liked this child, I appreciate it from 7 out of 10.
