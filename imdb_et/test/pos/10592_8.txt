Personally, I found the film great. I had to pre-order the month and watched it twice a day when I got it by mail, and several times after that. Yes, the time passes can be a bit much, but the rest of the film clearly compensates for it. Every armature was cast, but action was right for every part. The plot itself is just ... haggard! There is no other way to describe it. Who makes a movie from someone who gets f ** gered! ??? BAM, that's who. Genius. Just a genius. Two thumbs up. I would be honored to work with him every day, any time, with any thing.
