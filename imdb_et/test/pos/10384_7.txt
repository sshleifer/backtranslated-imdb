"Behind the Clouds" is the top-over-the-top artistic group of four vignettes, each with a look at the relationship between man and woman between the weak and the turbulent. Although the film offers great cinematography, fine visual beauty and fine performers, its fragmented work on the bones is little meat. The taste of the relationship cannot give its completeness, and synergy suggests that one log can achieve much more in 2 hours than four. Nonetheless, "Behind the Clouds" is a bait for dilettants, and a visual feast for all, though superficial, tends to be absent and essentially absent.
