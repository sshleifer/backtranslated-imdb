"The journey towards the sun" (aka "Doppelganger") is a fun, twilight zone-style sci-fi offer by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson (team behind Space: 1999, UFO, Thunderbirds, Fireball XL-5 and others). In Roy Thinnes ("Invaders" TV show) and Ian Hendry star in astronauts sent to a plane that divides the exact orbit of the earth, but on the other side of the sun; hence hidden. A strong European space pilot (too late by Patrick Wymark) can fly quickly and astronauts are good to go after tough training. Thus, the best sequences, launching, flying and landing on the "other" land begin in the film. The dazzling rocket miniature work (Derek Meddings) and dreamy, elegant space light (somewhat reminiscent of the best moments of "2001: Space Odyssey") is a simple highlighting of the film. "Doppelganger" landing is both exciting and terrible. After that, the Twilight Zone aspect will start; The classic TZ episode, "Parallel", raises almost the entire plot. Aside from this, the film still leaves a strong sci-fi with some intriguing "mirrored world" things to chew (for example, backward writing and left hand shakes). Less successful are scenes depicting the mid-21st century; where all men wear bicycles and Nehru jackets and all women wear mini-skirts. Some relationships with women in the movie are, according to today's standards, very "non-PC". And (most consistent with most of the 20th century sci-fi), computers, phones, and other hardware are all big, colorful, and gimmicks (directly from Patrick McGoohan's "prisoner"). Nobody saw the age of the digital microprocessor! If you accept these failures in your predictions, the film is very interesting, as Thinnes's powerful astronaut. And a nice nihilistic ending in the 1960s / 70s style! For retro sci-fi (like me) fans, it's worth a "journey"!
