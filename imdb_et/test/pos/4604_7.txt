Black Castle is one of those films that has found its way into the collection of Boris Karloff and is expected to be a terrible horror film. Although Nathan Juran's film has some horror elements, it is actually a versatile genre that is closely produced and effectively depicted. Joining Karloff is a small but critical role for Richard Greene, Stephen McNally, Lon Chaney Jr, Rita Corday, John Hoy and Michael Pate. It is produced surprisingly from universal international images. On the plot there is a Greene English gentleman who drives to the castle's count, Count von Bruno {McNally}. He follows the investigation of the disappearance of two friends, an investigation that is full of danger and surprises at every turn. <br /> <br /> It has everything the old dark house / castle genre fans might want. Real good and bad boys, fair lady, dark corners for dark action, evil traps, clock finale selection and even good old-fashioned bit of wilting. All effective performances are cast, especially Greene and superb sneering McNally. Although the writing of Jerry Sackheim is lean and there is no meaningful filler that has so often made a film like this one. A highly recommended film, assuming Karloff fans understand that this is not a Karloff film, and perhaps more importantly, horror fans do not expect the blood to be on the agenda. The Black Castle is a subtle atmosphere that seems daunting. 7/10
