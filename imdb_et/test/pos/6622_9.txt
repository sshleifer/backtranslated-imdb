My skateboarding career ended in 1974 when my two or four skateboard skateboard rollers hit the stone and I fell into the days where it seemed along the sidewalk of my parent's house in Boston. By the time I came out of my hand, it was summer. <br /> <br /> But I've always been admired by X-games and surfers. I think I spent the first month after I moved to South California on beaches and camps watching surfers, having eaten the fact that I missed my call. This is a kind of thing you should learn from young people before you are preserved and you are aware of yourself. If that's the best, you're so worried that you're not injuring or smiling. like an educated bear. <br /> <br /> I've always admired how a good surfer seems to be interested in anything other than this moment, this wave, this experience. Together with natural forces. A good surfer makes it look like there's nothing but the wave there and how you interact with it. I have a lot of Zeni here. <br /> <br /> This documentary describes how some young people got surfing concepts and expanded them on the skateboard. Ramps, lowers, low sweeping schedules that work with the cement debris under your feet. It was all new in its day and time. radical. Before the Zephyr Skate team, the idea was probably to go as fast as possible on a straight line on a skateboard, so my long "Evel Knievel in Caesers Palace" looks like a drum-shaped front. <br /> <br /> This movie is back to America before it was tagged, tagged, marketed, and stuck. (Seriously, what is so "extreme" about Taco Bell's "Extreme Value Meal", except that it is extremely dangerous to your colon ...) <br /> <br /> Watch this movie and see the birth of extreme sports. Before the X-Games, before the Boom-boom Huck-Jam, before Crusty Demone, before ASA ... these were the young streets who created "extreme sports" without actually trying. They did it just for the friends in the sun with the purity of roller skating, with pure joy. <br /> <br /> I hope they will get out of the money. Goodness knows that they don't get the credit they deserve. Maybe this movie can correct it. <br /> <br /> A great portrait of a great soundtrack, Southern California, indeed America, no longer exists. <br /> <br /> Take care of Sean Penn, but he does a decent job.
