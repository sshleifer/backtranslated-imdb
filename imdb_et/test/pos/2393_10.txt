I was a guest at Eddie Monroe's September 30th, and I was pleasantly surprised by this story, great acting and talented leaders. I found it hard to believe that all this talent is independent of the film. Vario, (Uncle Benny), Sara, (Jessica Tsunis) and Morris (Eddie Monroe). Supporting pain was full of colorful and fun characters. This movie reminds me of one of those movies you look back in 20 years and discover that it has launched many actors. Much like "The Outsiders", where Tom Cruise, Emilio Estavez, Patrick Swazey, Ralph Macchio and others will find you. Look at Hollywood, there are new stars on the horizon and you can discover them in tiny Long Island, an independent film called "Eddie Monroe". Great work!
