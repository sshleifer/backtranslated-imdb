I saw it for the first time when I was a teenager in my last Junior Junior year. I was cursed about it! I loved special effects, fantastic places and a test story, and feedback to tell the story. <br /> <br /> Several years later I read the book and although it was interesting and I can definitely see what Swift was trying to say, I think that although this is not as perfect as a social commentary book, this film is better. It makes more sense for this to be one long-term adventure than returning Gulliver after every trip and profit, selling tiny Lilliput sheep or whatever. <br /> <br /> It's much more arrest than everyone thinks he's crazy and sheep do anyway. When I saw Laputa, I was stunned. It looks very much like the Zeali Kingdom Chrono Trigger video game (1995), which made me even more into such a mini-series. <br /> <br /> I saw it about 4 years ago and realized that I enjoyed it as much. Really high quality things and a great start to the Sweeps mini-series NBC, who followed its solid Merlin and interesting Alice in Wonderland.
