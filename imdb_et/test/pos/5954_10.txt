In French, I found it very nice to laugh at an old stereotype made of French, some of the Western nations, Spy movies, etc. ... and many other things. ... I saw it 3 times and every time I discovered new things and laughed at tears ... Jean Dujardin, Bérénice Béjo, Director of Aure Attica and all cast, all the teams did a great job. This movie is funny, but there is much more than that: it's got a lot of it. You're laughing at simple gags, because some critics who made the spirit (brave enough to be critical) are due to physical comedy because you believe in characters, etc. ... aesthetically and musically it is also successful. Go where you can.
