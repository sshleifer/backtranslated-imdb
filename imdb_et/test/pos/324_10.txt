Mani sir as usual brings out another amazing story with Kannathil Muthamittal. Such a wonderful relationship between parents and the child is in a beautiful form. Mani Sir as usual without many special effects and not many trips. (In fact, it was the only movie he went outside of India ever ... that also just Sri Lanka) .Mani class is written for the whole movie ... and add it to ARR's music, which is just amazing ... Vellai Pookal is one of my most popular songs ... Maddy, who is in the film industry, has impressed too much. From alaipayuthey to cantataill ayutha ezuthuni to guru. Mani Ratnam has shown the world a versatile actor, Maddy. Simran has also been very good. He has shown that he can also act in non-enchanting and characteristic roles. All amazing movie. It's sad that the Tamil public couldn't understand this gr8 movie and it was bombarded in the box.
