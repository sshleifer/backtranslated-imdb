Niagara, Niagara is a stunning and heartbreaking story of two outsiders, Seth and Marcys. Robin Tunney gives a fantastic result when Marcy suffers from Tourette's Sidrome, making the film thicker and thicker during the advancement. This film is not very optimistic and it is very emotional, but at the same time very romantic. It's hard to explain, but to see and find out for yourself. It's definitely worth it.
