I think I was one of those people who found this other roth pearl. his award was amazing. The story that Francis Ford Coppola spoke so beautifully 25 years earlier really does open up gradually and leaves room for development. Roeg proves again that it does not have to be a war setting to be interressting. The most amazing place is the story of contrast. Ruthlessnes and beauty go hand in hand, while loneliness should become your best friend. It shows a little golden kingdom that lands on a coast full of wealth for the first world country when you send the right men. All in all, the beautifully directed film is Nicola's wrath, who is overflowing.
