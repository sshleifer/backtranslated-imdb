This picture was released in May 1979, playing Playboy Playmate Susan Kiger like Honey Shayne, Playboy Playmate Lisa London as O'Hara and Playboy Playmate Pamela Jean Bryant Terri Lynn. In one of the most delightful comedies in history that is in history, all of the young lovers come together in a story about fighting bikini sister-in-law who doesn't let everything be revealed. So what does H.O.T.S really stand for? You must watch the movie to get the answer. You see, girls have problems with girls at the university who make them look like they are just sexy. That's why girls tried to discredit girls in society, no matter what they have to do to work. In addition, this clutter is a college dean who wants to demolish a group of girls before they get out of control. I loved this movie especially in Lisa London. I thought his acting was fantastic and I was disappointed he didn't get other actors. Based on only three game tables, I give this movie 10 funny cards.
