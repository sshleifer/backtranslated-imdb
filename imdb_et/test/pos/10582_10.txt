Okay, let me break it ... Haggard is probably one of the funniest nonsense movies you'll ever see. It became a unique story about a girl with girls problems and everything that turns her back, mixing countless humorous scenes that keep you laughing at the whole movie, basically, if you've seen a jackass or a CKY series, I know what humor wait for it to have most of these movies. In general ... I just had to give this to the 10/10 because it is one of my favorite movies of all time. <br /> <br /> ~ F0rs4k3n <br /> <br /> Hagger Rules!
