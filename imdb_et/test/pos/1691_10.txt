is one of the best films directed by Andrzej wajda, this story speaks of a young writer looking for his place after the second war (he lives in a German camp). An excellent real atmosphere (the action goes to a displaced camp), the main hero (plays one of the best Polish actress Daniel olbrychski) finally fall in love, but unfortunately his lady is killed. There was a beautiful scene when he talked to an American soldier and says (his girlfriend about death), nothing happens, you have just shot us now ... he has destroyed the state of the soul. 10/10
