I have to see this movie four or five times, and that's better for every viewing. Suffice it to say: This is the best film I've ever seen. And I think I've seen a lot. <br /> <br /> But I've always wondered why this movie got so puzzled in some reviews or ratings. For example, take IMDb Top 250. Why is it just # 216 (nowadays)? Surely the answer is not in the film itself (because it is nothing but flawless), but at the reception. The film caused controversy over the convicted murderer and his attitude to the death penalty. So, apparently, a more conservative user has probably not liked the film (as you can see from some other comment). So DEAD MAN WALKING gets a rating that is nothing but ridiculous about its quality. These people did not understand what the film wanted to say, and suddenly they did not want to understand being a pro death penalty. Now I get it: it's all political. You're Death Penalty - you don't like (and don't want to hear) what the movie has to say. <br /> <br /> I am really sorry that there are still many people who just tune in when a new perspective doubts their beliefs. <br /> <br /> Mr. Robbins, the theme of your movie is shared by people. Some have studied their position, some simply did not listen, but you did a very important point. Your movie will probably never appear on any of the "TOP 100 MOVIES OF ALL TIME", but it must be remembered long after movies like Braveheart or Babe or Apollo 13 (all of them were unfairly favored in front of their film at the Oscar 1996) have been forgotten. Congratulations, Mr Robbins, and thank you for this important filmmaking.
