The four-year-old merchant does not want to call a joyful movie at all, or even to impress the heavenly glory (there are other Fassbinder discs, such as Veronika Voss and the undervalued Satan Bride). But it is certainly not less than an exciting experiment to look at the society you and I and others we know may or may not know. I imagine that in the early 70s in Germany, the generation that came from WW2 was a stigma to live with, but tried its best to get. This is a stigma that swims all over the film and in many cases in the work of Fassbinder in general, but especially because it takes the middle class and especially the couple - the distant, the depressed, the angry Hans the fruit vendor and his long-suffering woman - with the Four Seasons. short as realistic melodrama shade. If Cassavets was a crazy German, he could make this movie, maybe just a lark. <br /> <br /> The story sounds just enough where Hans controls drinking, he wins his wife (this scene is one of the hardest, perhaps in any movie, how the Fassbinder's camera slips when his wife is helpless and their daughter tries stop him from his madness) and then he is ready to leave him. When she is in the room, her family keeps her back, she demands a divorce and gets a heart attack. He will recover, his business will start to flourish again with the help of some good (or not so good) worker - and it will only continue his longing for another woman and his despair in general. <br /> <br /> And it is in this simplicity that Fassbinder tries and succeeds mostly to achieve the mood of fear, tight vibe in the kitchen or bedroom or on the street that can be cut with a knife and bleed. The weakest part of it may be acting ... at least it was my original impression. Hans played by Hirschmuller can be a desolate presence, but the smallest movements in his face and eyes, and for some time he does not seem to be a very good actor. An actor who plays his wife, Irm Hermann and his sister (Fassbinder Hanna Schygulla), enjoys a better price, but only because they are given more traditional, such as crying or watching. It takes time to adapt to what is essentially empty in her boyfriend Hans, something of his own psychological self-esteem or self-dignity that passes through himself and those around him who want some normal feeling, especially when Hans becomes successful. <br /> <br /> Not everybody clicks on a four-season merchant, but he did quite a lot to recommend those looking for another life if you could use more modern American films. The world of the Fassbinder here is the struggle between the harsh, destructive feelings of cinema-melodrama and humanism, which it knows personally and makes characters that are better or worse, somehow know. Is Epps the family you know? Or could you even have them? Who says. It is a methodological study of the tragic emptiness of human activity and all its goals have been achieved.
