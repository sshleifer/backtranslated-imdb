I saw a movie at the Hollywood Film Festival in October 04. Mark Robertson took an enormous opportunity to write an extremely difficult part for his first film and paid a lot for Kelly Overton casting. I had a strong feeling that he came from the theater, so I looked at him here and ... surprise, I'm right. More Hollywood actors should follow their lead, give up expensive classes and return to the theater because only this type of training is preparing for such a trip. For all the great things I can say about the film and the director (and there is a lot), I just can't talk to people about the masterful performance of Kelly Overton. We see much more work, no doubt. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Mark and Kelly for the brave movie. Get it out in theaters so I can bring all the people I did to see the movie ASAP!
