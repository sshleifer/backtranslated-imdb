Being advertised as the most expensive film ever made in the Czech Republic, it will automatically make you believe that it is glorified and cleaved (out of budget fears). But with a budget of 8 million euros and half of the English movie, it wasn't a big budget, a high-risk movie. <br /> <br /> What we have a great epic story that focuses on the friendship of two people, the younger Karel and the older Frantisek. As Czech air force pilots, when Germans invade before World War II, they flee to England to join the RAF. <br /> <br /> Their friendship is tense because of the same woman's love. However, there is a friendship that goes beyond mere friendliness. Their friendship is an elegant metaphor for the attitude of the Czech people and their country. Remember, they weren't the winners, the Germans won only by the Russians. <br /> <br /> A funny, exciting, intriguing, beautiful, sad and enlightening movie is one of my favorite war movies. Most of me like how they are so fond of the British friendship and give an amazing overview of how the British army fought during World War II. <br /> <br /> Forget the recent American efforts (On Harbor Harbor, Saving Private Ryan), this is the best WWII movie for a long time.
