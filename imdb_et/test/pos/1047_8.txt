A columnist who writes about his farm when he is actually living in a NY apartment has to work out a plan when he learns that his publisher and hero of war are spending Christmas with him. After a slow start, it becomes a little bit of fun with a fine screw comedy. A big deviation from his previous role as the femme fatale "Double Indemnity", Stanwyck shows a nice comedy elegance. Morgan is smooth as a military hero, while Greenstreet is well-cast as a publisher. At the same time, Sakall steals a movie chef who tries to speak English, speaking almost incomprehensible European accent.
