As I said earlier, I'm not a Tweety fan. She is just as aggravating as I wish Sylvester would eat her and get over it. <br /> <br /> In this comic, Sly is again homeless and she's back to bins. He places a cruise ship that leaves the nearby port and decides to fly on board when he is one of the passengers. <br /> <br /> The ship is providing a sufficient stage for the following hijink and Sly desperately tries to catch the bird and avoid the sea disease. If only if he succeeds in chewing and swallowing, ending with an irritating Canary forever. But when cartoons play Tweet, it's pretty good, but that's all thanks to this brilliant cat.
