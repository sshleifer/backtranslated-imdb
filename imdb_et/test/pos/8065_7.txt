Although the 32-year-old woman's concept of a 12-year-old girl can be a modern stretch, <br /> <br /> for an experienced audience, in the 1920s Mary Pickford fans wanted to wait and wait for their favorite star. . Open scene shows Annie's tomb-like character as the obvious leader of a multi-ethnic street gang in a competitive "battle" with a rival group. Seeing young girls who are caught in the jaw and threw it can be a bit of crude oil, but the scene is played in such a "gang" fashion that it would be difficult to take seriously. Anyway, Annie can take it out. When Annie returns to her rental space and replaces her street colors with a girl's dress, it becomes more complicated (especially in close-ups) to portray this beautiful young woman as a street city. But for those who may accumulate the incredible stoppage, the rest of the film has a reward. Leaving a comedy (Annie gang shows an exhibition) (Annie is planning her Irish police father's birthday surprise) to a tragedy (her father is killed on her birthday), the movie gives Mary many opportunities to show different emotions that would want any of her fans of any era. <br /> <br /> Of course, the "happy end" will be achieved; The criminals have been detained with the help of Annie's friends and rivals, and is seen most recently in a company of his pals on a busy journey on a sunny day. What a good way to finish Mary Pickford's movie. <br /> <br />
