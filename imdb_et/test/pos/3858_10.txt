Aristorcats is a fun movie not seen by many people. Obviously not so much because it only got 6.8. There's nothing wrong with that. This is my favorite Disney classic, which already has many fantastic movies. Like beauty and beast, snow white and Peter Pan. The reason why Aristorcats is so high on my list is because the movie is funny. I hate to say this, but I don't blame Edgar for what he does. I would probably have taken care of them too. I would destroy an old bag I had worked for so many years, but decide to give my cat a benefit. I'd kill them too. I don't like cats, so I'm not fucking fucking. I think Aristorcats is so funny and cute. There are many signs that are fun, like Edgar. Aristorcats is my favorite Disney classic and it's final. The cat is out of the bag. <br /> <br /> Aristorcats: **** / ****
