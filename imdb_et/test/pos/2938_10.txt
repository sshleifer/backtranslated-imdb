As the reality shows, "American Idol" is not enough for judges like Simon Cowell to compete with competitors trying to record their music in the world - many times have reduced even the most outstanding singers. After being considered a "bad result", "America's next top model" has now penetrated the boob tube version of its "looking next big deal" business that values ​​superficial, beauty and body dysmorphia. <br /> <br /> The concept created by Tyra Banks, who is also an exhibition judge, collects about fifteen contestants from all walks of life and has allowed himself to count on numerous tasks they have to prove their "talent" in front of the camera and not just the Janice who has just left. Dickinson (in itself dubbed "America's first supermodel"), but equally fucking Jay Manuel and Nore Marin, who may at one point focus on one girl does not work well and gently ri p her to crush as it was a bad morning coffee. Like many other reality-based exhibitions, one competitor is voted each week and he has to pack his bags and leave right away (the thing Tyra recalls at every turn). Of course, there are many more A-type women, female ties, tears, dramatic swellings at key moments, and some truly breathtaking pictures that make the usual, beautiful girls out of reach of gods. > <br /> I have to admit that the show is an innocent pleasure. Maybe this is the mood, but I thought where the vomitor was in cases when the thin girls had to cut and see how the judges and photographers and many embarrassing designers would feel right now. Nevertheless, it has been drawn from my previous paragraph, perhaps because I have always been interested in the fashion world and have always loved to look at stunning women who make it even more uncomfortable with perfect light. But I don't know where they're going with these increasingly difficult photos. It would be like they would compete with the "fear factor". Bills that look like the transformation of fighting scenes into TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, shoots, where models have to depict underwater or in almost impossible situations. hour? Or shoot, where they are underwater, chained, trying to release themselves at the same time, while watching the chiffon strike and never forgetting their necklace proteins in this camera? How about the "Pit and Pendulum" version of the photo shoot? <br /> <br /> In one case, some praise must be given to the show and it is similar to "American Idol". That's why I probably justify the rigor of both exhibitions and its abrasive judges, and I am basically against my original paragraph. "America's Next Top Model" is an exhibition that is a long-term listening, such as "American Idol", and the girls get a kind of test procedure they get in a real world where future designers and photographers are ruthlessly dirty when they may be, crushing them into hats when they cannot sell themselves, and when asked to leave, the other will replace him with the necessary requirements. What makes it surprising is that every girl would like to enter this difficult media, but that's what dreams have been doing. <br /> <br /> Going for the fifth season has been a major disappointment for Janice Dickinson's departure. ; During his run, he was a pretty tough barometer about how girls should walk, talk, emulate, express themselves and ultimately present themselves as a walking, living product that sells. By adding Twiggy cold I mean where it goes from here - Twiggy just can't replace Dickinson's upper temperament. So, in the absence of Janice, this exhibition has lost some of its edge and may even have signaled its slow death, but in the meantime, it is a memorable pleasure to watch, meaningless entertainment at weekends, if at all this beautiful image. If at all, this is an exhibition that drew Adrienne Curry's attention. Curry has named himself for the facts that are less involved with modeling as much as his theatrical love relationship with a single actor Christopher Knight in his own soap opera of reality.
