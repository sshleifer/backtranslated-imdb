I feel compassion for the situation of the first man, Schmitter, whom we see killed in this episode. He reminded me of the fear of an individual guard at night somewhere - a job I did briefly about 20 years ago. Of course, I never had the risk of burning the crowd because the colonel master (Lynch) loves to describe it. The dark monster, the murder of a deep mining colony, gives the first law a frightening impression. We do not see it in the early scene, and as many of us realize, the best monsters are sometimes imaginative. "Big and hairy" is one of the expressions described, but in fact it turns out to be similar to a large, one-off pepperon lace that slides on the ground like a silicon centuries ago - unfortunately the budget of the exhibition is limited. It also shows the latest matte paint that is famous for Trek fans, the only way to deliver long images of mining. <br /> <br /> But the whole theme of this episode is about what's inside, rather than appearance. Of course, this Horta, a newly discovered silicon-based form of life, sees at first glance a pointless monster. Thanks to Spock's telepathic ability (probably the best use for Vulcan's mindset), we learn that it is a very intelligent, even experienced creature. In addition to the instrumental use of Spock's talents, McCoy can replace his usual medical routine - healing rocks or asbestos-like creatures. He can also hear his most famous lines: "I'm a doctor, not a mason!" I found it really alive in my scene when she achieved her success, even though she can't share her enthusiasm with Kirk - Kirk is too busy organizing the results. An episode throws an unexpected character and motivation to the audience as the story progresses; Spock fights if necessary to preserve this discovered life, as Kirk takes his usual position to avoid the death of any red shirts (not half-dimensions like "The Man Trap"). But later, this is Kirk, who for some reason prevents the explosion of killing, as if the heat of the hunt had gone away and had had time to think about Spock's point (I believe that it was during this episode that Shatner learned that his father was dead For most of the first season, this is not typical because it is fortunate. The conflict stems from the needs of basic capitalism, such as standard quotas, as opposed to protecting the natural environment and its inhabitants - a version of space time that protects owls from modern development tractors. At any moment, one raised phaser could go to hell, Kirk and Spock could mediate an agreement that would satisfy everyone, and I think people and silicates are more sensible in the 23rd century.
