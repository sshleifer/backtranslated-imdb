James Bridges 'Chinese Syndrome' is a first-rate thriller; a model for those who want to make a truly scary thriller but don't know how. <br /> <br /> Most thrillers end with standard shooting and tracking, ending with a villain getting what he deserves. But Bridges realizes that such a standard final is not so in some scenarios. "Chinese Syndrome" is exciting as no one expects. It has a final result that is so unexpected, but still so logical. <br /> <br /> Film stands for three (then) current Oscar winners: Jack Lemmon (1973's best actor "Save the Tiger"), Jane Fonda (Best Actor 1971 and 1978 respectively "Klute" and "Coming Home" ) and Michael Douglas (best picture of 1975, which produces "one flew over the cuckoo nest"). It is so strong and strong that we forget who plays the roles and believes that the characters are real people, showing the collective ablative of all three actors, which may be stars, but they are actors First. <br /> <br /> There is no music score in the movie, there is nothing in addition to some background music made from jukeboxes or TV shows. simply presenting the material in a simple way, in the case of such a dramatic dramatic story, we do not need to disturb our mind. This is for me as the predecessor of Dogma 95 films, started by Lars Von Trier in 1997. It focuses on characters rather than on style. <br /> <br /> The story is related to a nuclear power plant located in southern California. ** SPOILER ** The accident seems to have happened and the film is basically about Lemmon, Fonda and Douglas trying to reveal the truth. In a way, it is not a spoiler, because the trailer, TV shows, video boxes and reviews give it away. However, this seemingly simple premise results in a surprisingly complex moral game and a human being of nature and human activity, not of a man who is shaping another man (although it is a feature of the film). That's what makes "Chinese Syndrome" so good. <br /> <br /> **** 4 stars
