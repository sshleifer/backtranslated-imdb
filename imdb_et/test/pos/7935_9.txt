Eisenstein describes his collaboration with Prokevjev as an equal partnership, where they worked with the picture and music, the scene. Unfortunately, audio recording was a disaster, so one time the copyright commitment was behind the DVD criterion. Fortunately, there is at least one restored version of the VHS (BMG Classics) movie with excellent music rewriting (St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir). <br /> <br /> It is interesting to compare this movie with modern propaganda films in England, Germany and the United States. Eisenstein's film was made in 1938 in response to the fear of the German invasion; and Olivier was in 1943 when another German invasion was expected. Both movies are on stage, but different. Olivier begins the performance of Shakespeare's own company, Globe Theater, with a staged performance, then takes us from the theater to a more cinematic (though still stylized) setting. Eisenstein's film has been stuck since the beginning of cinema, but the dialogue and speech are still influenced by melodramatic acts in the old Russian theater. It works very well for Alexander Cerkassov's speech, because some of his work as a prince and military leader was in the public domain. <br /> <br /> The Nazi Germany's first major propaganda film was Leni Riefenstahl's tedious Will Triumph, which recorded a huge political spectacle - the massive crowds who delighted Hitler's talks. Propaganda's masterpiece, the 1936 Berlin Olympics, is much more subtle, in honor of the athletic male body that carries the disturbing myth of bosses. But the German propaganda films of the war could also be fine. Karl Ritter's Urlaub auf Ehrenwort is typical (Furlough is an honor). It shows a young Lieutenant who allows his company men to leave 24 hours before returning to the ditches of World War I (and almost certain death). With the advice of the veterans, he agrees to return his honor, even though he is acting and shot, if they do not. Of course, they all return (although some of them do so), assuming that they inspire viewers to perform similar tasks in their country. <br /> <br /> In the United States, one of the best World War II propaganda films was Howard Hawks Air Force. In this, we follow the controversial team of the bomber, because they associate the battle experience with each other and overcome obstacles to continue their role in the war. In Hawks' movies, however, their true loyalty is more than one in their own country. <br /> <br /> Eisenstein must come back a long way to find the triumphs of the Russian army. It is ironic that Alexander (like other Russian princes) comes from the Vikings who traveled to Russian rivers to conquer and rule their independence. So he is a conqueror who displaces another future conqueror. Physically, they are not so different (although the actors representing the German princes were clearly chosen to be ugly and stupid). But the real contrast is between the common soldiers. Russian peasants are as high and strong as nobles; whereas the German peasants who kill the wounded Russians from the shield are shorter than their masters. There is a historical truth in this contrast. In the Middle Ages, Russian serfs were much better than their European counterparts, because they could always escape the desert and empty their land. <br /> <br /> The Eisenstein film also gives our first glance to Alexander as a fisherman. In his fight with the Germans, he uses his fisherman's knowledge of the ice and his military tactics to hit them. When Gavrilo covers the turtle, they are forced to re-group and bulk up on the western side of the lake, where the ice is thinner. <br /> <br /> Another Eisenstein movie joy (which most viewers do not know) is historically a precise way of depicting medieval Russia policy. Cities such as Pskov and Novgorod owed their growing prosperity and prominence to trade, which put merchants in power and left the princes until their military knowledge and feudal taxes were necessary to repel the invaders. The film shows Alexander not only as a military leader, but also as a captain's politician who knows how to wait for his time and how to take advantage of his victory.
