I saw it at the London Film Festival last night, probably a shorter version. James McNally's summary of the film's content is very good. Nossiter carefully interferes with the research of the wine industry because of globalization, homogenisation, the impact of mass media, the power of capital and the need for diversity. <br /> <br /> The film is hand-crafted The DV found that some of them find themselves in a rush, but that allows Nossiter to try to catch people on several occasions, which would probably not have been possible with more conventional equipment. <br /> <br /> Despite the sprawling feeling of the movie, editing is very sharp, not only giving us the parade of dogs in the world, but also some comments from interviewees with somewhat contradictory visual images and giving others enough to hang a rope. To a certain extent, this caused Michael Moore's recent work (although Nossiter operates in a more subtle way), but apparently the roots of the film go back to the emergence of Marcel Ophuls "The Sorrow and the Pity", both for the film's building and for the "peas salt" French peasants. . The De Montille family that fils took part in the screening of LFF and later answered questions. We really need little interference - bravo Hubert! <br /> <br /> In general, this is a great movie with the consequences that go beyond the wine world as we build ourselves as human beings and organize our world.
