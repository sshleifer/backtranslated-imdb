Dan Ackroyd in his main stars, such as Johgn Burns, a spiritual asylum driver, who is deprived of his own shrink to travel to La La Land and host a popular radio show, while a normal host (Charle Grodin in his acute prime) takes a break. Along, Ackroyd hooks up with Walter Matthau, colleague nutjob, and the rest is slim fun. Ackroyd and Matthau play very well with each other. Ackroyd's real wife, Donna Dixon, is another shrinkage. The ending seems a bit hasty and viable, which is the only thing that keeps me from giving this film my best rating, 8. Lost 80's pearl.
