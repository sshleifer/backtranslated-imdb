One year after the love of his neighbor, his I.T.V. debut, followed by "On The Buses" and "Steptoe & Son", ending with a big screen on Hammer Films. It opens up with a patriotic speech that interferes with the green and pleasant ground of England, then cuts off Eddie and Bill toward the street, arguing fiercely. It rises in strange white and black neighbors that swear each other's homes. At least the original theme has survived (even if it is sung by someone other than Stuart Gillies). <br /> <br /> Local Paper - "The Gazette" - Organizes the best neighbor to find, the winners land on a Mediterranean cruise. Barbie suggests to Joan that they should enter. The thing is, can Bill and Eddie stay long enough to win? This is the main part of the plot. The film is big and episodic. One piece is lifted directly from season 1, namely Bill and Eddie, who go to a club that claims to be a "union". In fact, they see a stripper (which doesn't match two girls). The second part of the film is Bill, along with other black factory workers (in the series where he was the only one), the impact of breaking Eddie has contributed to the emergence of various advantages (including smuggling through gate gates). While the other (seemingly Powell and inspired by Ada's love) sees Eddie's talking mother (great Patricia Hayes) friendly with Bill's father (Charles Hyatt). <br /> <br /> Episode 1 climax season 1 will appear again in expanded form. Bill puts color and a towel back on Eddie's scare, but his friends join him and they dance a drum that contains naked Booth so they can pretend and eat. Eddie must then go home naked (surprisingly, there is less nudity than Episode 2 in season 2). <br /> <br /> The movie ends with Reynolds and Booth, who won the "love of your neighbor's race and ride together, but unexpectedly turns Joan's sex-crazy brother Cyril (James Beck," the father's private walker ") who works as a steward. <br /> <br /> This is your typical 70's movies, where all such films usually occur. The laughs are scattered and interesting in about half an hour. Pain has been supplemented with familiar faces such as Melvyn Hayes ("Terry", which is characterized by Episode 2 Season 1, played by Leslie Meadows in this case), Bill Fraser (as plant manager), Anna Dawson, Andria Lawrence (who seems to have been every 70's British comedy, mostly nymphomaniacs) and Arthur English. Director John Robins was also responsible for "The Man on the House". <br /> <br /> More fun moment - when Eddie sleeps in a quiet factory, Bill paints her face in black. The first one he knows about this is when the manager's secretary screams. The tables have been turned!
