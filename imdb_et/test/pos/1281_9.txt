The debut of the director, Christopher Nolan, is memorable. The film was very well received and helps land contracts to make Memento and rightly so. <br /> <br /> The following is a great example of how to make movies. There are no fancy effects or blood dripping ideas ... just brilliant writing and good acting. Nolan is able to conquer us again with his letter. Actors, all unknown and I think most people did a good job to make the characters live. They were all plausible, and they must all be. The film is confusing because it plays a lot of chronology, but in the end it is very useful. The film is short to be a full-length feature film, but any extra length would have ruined the style of the movie and the writing glow would have diminished. In short, the film has all the aspects that make the film attractive (IMO): an intriguing start, an exciting center and a surprising end. <br /> <br /> I dare say Next is almost as good as Memento, his best film from afar. Coded chronology is equally masterful for both films, amazing land plots are available and the actor is very good. <br /> <br /> This movie is made for just $ 6,000, but the quality is much higher than most (almost all a million dollar box hits. Using b & w can be a difficult pill to swallow for a big audience, the next is mainly Nolan shows off your skills in studio bosses :-). And what skills do they ... rarely have written so much like "Next." Even the Pi doesn't even come close to the IMO, although it is also very good. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that definitely shouldn't be missed by any self-respecting movie lover. If you liked Memento, "Next" is definitely for you.
