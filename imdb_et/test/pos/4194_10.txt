I testify that I had the opportunity to watch this movie in the past, and after about 5-10 minutes I felt that many did it. I had been waiting for a Monkey movie that was similar to TV shows, but I was given ... well, I didn't know what I was honest with. <br /> <br /> But after the last review of this film, I realized that I had not only the shine of the closed mind, which he depicted, but I found myself over and over again. It's a movie that doesn't help me anymore, just because it warns me because I'm trying to decipher its meanings. And just when I think I've found something in the movie, the answer is destroyed when I watch the movie again. Brilliance really. <br /> <br /> Most people who did not like this movie seem to want to watch the movie mainly with a clear plot. They want everything to be clarified and all questions answered in the finals. Well, sorry, if that's what you want, it's not a movie for you. But if you liked movies like the Matrix (and even better, their follow-up), I think you appreciate the film's thought-provoking, desperate experience. <br /> <br /> Think the movie is a dream. In our dreams, things have no meaning, things that we assume are not happening, people do not talk about places and things, do not act or act in the same way as in reality. Making a "good" complaint is like complaining about a dream you've felt you didn't understand. The mind is a complex system, and the fact that the film, headed "Head", is just as difficult, is it difficult to associate the two? <br /> <br /> The music (and musical number) really differs, especially Peter Tork's two compositions, which are the best stories in the movie, "Can you dig it?" and "Long Title: Do I Have to Do It All Again?" <br /> <br /> This movie proves that monkeys were much more than four zanny boys in the pre-fab group (their critics) called them on television, but that they are actually much more intelligent and talented than the world would give them credit. There are so many messages in the film about The Monkees and the "entertainment industry" in general that it is a masterpiece of making a film that was far from that time. <br /> <br /> I feel that if this film, and in itself, is separated as an independent piece, it would actually earn the respect and admiration it deserves. <br /> <br /> And one of the finals: <br /> <br /> It can be compared to the Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour, because The Beatles movie seemed as strange and weird. But, in my opinion, "Head" is far from what The Beatles puts on celluloid.
