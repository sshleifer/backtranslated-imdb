What deserves to be mentioned, which has been omitted elsewhere in this review, is how the law shaped gays in the lifetime of life and behavior in the film. Although Courtenay's character is apparently gay, he is not the only one: often talked about Mr. Davenport-Scott, and the reason he's never seen is the reason he's gone, it seems he has a police has adhered to homosexual activity - criminal punishment in England. <br /> <br /> We can read underneath this surface that this recent event has caused Norman, Courtenay's character to be puzzled: and we also see the character of Edward Fox, the forwarding of the Oxenby remark, the quick abandonment of any relationship with such a person if It is related to the law: Fear of association affects many signs and is part of the portrait time and film. the people who live it. The rejection of Courtenay by Siri is expected to have been completed when this subtitle is added: it is also reasonable that so much of his unexplained omission by Dresser is on the list he thanks. The amazing combination of fear of exposure creates a combination of longing and fear that Courtenay must "step into the luminaires" as he does when he makes a statement about the upcoming air strikes, a scene that would otherwise be free. is both symbolic and literally human internal torment. <br /> <br /> So when drama is the fall of Finney's gentleman, much of the tragedy in the film and playing is the "deadly mistake" of Courtenay's gays and makes it a movie as the title suggests. <br /> <br /> The artistic direction, tempo, and cinema style of this film seem to come from another time, farther than the eighties and in some ways even as World War 2. Indirect portrayal of a society still detained under modern moral order and the conspiracy of this conscience that has been abducted and destroyed. stick to the closed world of the theater, and the knowledge we have about how much of this after the war wipes after this film is all the more scarce because of its shortcomings.
