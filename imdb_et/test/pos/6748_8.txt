In the 40s this story has to be sold back. The epidemic threatens New York (it's always New York) and no one takes it seriously. Some may say that Richard Widmark and Jack Palance did it on the right panic streets, but I disagree. <br /> <br /> Of these productions of poverty lines, there is always something about the nerve. The production values ​​are never such that the polished and the working ones are a little rough on the edges, but that is why I think that this film and, as it is, are effective. Tough, grainy, nervous. And cast. All 2 String Instruments or List A participants went to their prime minister. There is no ego here. These people were ready to work. Whit Bissell, Carl Benton Reid, Jim Backus, Arthur Space, Charles Korvin and Reed Hadley's melodic voice flowing in the background like crude oil. By the way, I've been to the hospital a couple of times; how did my sisters never see Dorothy Malone? In these films, they mostly don't worry about makeup and hair, but they managed to turn Evelyn Keyes into action. Or maybe they missed make-up and hair at all. Anyway, it was quite effective. He plays a lovesick jeweler who takes a small Pox case in Cuba, while at the same time smuggling jewelry to ultrasound Charles Korvin (who in the meantime accuses his sister). You have customs agents looking for her jewelry, and the Health Care Board is looking for her because she's going to populate New York. There are no rights to Amendment 4 here. Everyone gets in trouble. <br /> <br /> You must have the right attitude to enjoy such a movie. I have a brother who controls the death of movies. If they can't keep their Orson Wellian standards, he will bombard them forever. They must have David Lea's movie, Wolfgang von Korngold, Douglas Shearer's sound and art, and Cedric Gibbon's score. That's not the case. <br /> <br /> But I have the right attitude and if you do, you love this movie.
