This movie punch. Now there are some and then some that make me think deeply and bother me. I saw myself in this same situation - passively, allowing things to happen around me, not standing for the right and proper things, just trying to avoid problems. How often do we avoid waves or stick to our neck? How often our inaction acts on the evil activities of others. We would never join them, we say, we understand that what they do is bad, but do we do something about it? <br /> <br /> Lawrence Newman (William H. Macey) is a low-key office worker who has paid home in Brooklyn, NY during World War II. She rarely gets used to what is happening around her, never married, rarely socialized, just goes to work and cares for her invalid mother. Then he pulled out of his "white" small neighborhood events as a master of his self-conscious shell events. It begins when she admits rape of her neighbor's son, Puerto Rica, from her bedroom window. Soon after seeing her glasses because of poor eyesight. As he is now better able to see, he is less able to cope with the circumstances of his life. One bright spot is a new life in her life and she is getting married, hoping to continue in her normality. Then the virulent anti-Semitism of this street gets him, despite his credentials as a presbyterian WASP. As things get out of control, he discovers that he needs to make an important decision - whether he's going to stand or just go. <br /> <br /> I can't get anyone to film this film without influence and without thinking about myself and what they really stand for. Post-war anti-Semitism is a setting here, but there is injustice at any time and in all places. The individual decides where he stands.
