"How can we crush the misery of the whole world?" ? Mia <br /> <br /> A lovely aerial view of a big city makes a fleet approach to aircraft bombers dangerous; a passionate hairdresser, who reacts to the perceived racial gap, cuts the path through the hair of a businessman's bush; a man who dreams of being led to an electric chair after an unsuccessful magic trick, and the teacher breaks his classroom class because his wife called him an action. These and about fifty other vignettes that play the very depressing, wildly humorous joyous settlement of Roy Andersson's You, Life, its first feature since its critically acclaimed as commercially unsuccessful songs from the second floor. <br /> <br /> You, Life, are filled with the same type of imaginative pieces as songs full of black humor, surreal situations, and strange looking characters. Andersson's exclusive style with a still camera, a sterile background and precise attention to detail is a bit longer and less focused than its previous work. If there is a topic that connects the sketches together, that is, our time on Earth is limited and "tomorrow the second day", so we communicate with each other kindly, doing the tube and drum music at the Louisiana Brass Band, the banquet hall at their chairs, singing a singing song and a house that becomes a moving train. <br /> <br /> Emotions range from the darkness of her daughter, who is trying to communicate with Alzheimer's disease, who marries a woman's female ecstatic dream against the crowd of spectators of the beautiful guitar player Micke, although there is no continuous narrative thread, there are several schemes of greed and despair. it has two corpse people and their little dog, sitting on a park bench, has a woman that nobody knows or loves her, but she ignores her comfort and soothing words. <br /> <br /> Adding bouncing irony. During the time that seems to be an executive lunch, one man tells another phone that employees do not understand quality and how good it is to value the money and things he can buy, such as fine wine. However, if he does not look, the man with the neighboring cover will lift his wallet peacefully behind his chair. Although Andersson's cynicism is sometimes not very well hidden, you have a humanism that shows compassion for the human condition. This is a warning story that looks at the confusion we have had with people, but suggests that it is still time to turn it around when we follow the warning from the poet Goethe who opens the film, "Be happy then, lively, in your pleasantly warmed bed before Lethe ice cold wave will stop your fleeing leg.
