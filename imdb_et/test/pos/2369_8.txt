I did this for Sundance and I had no idea it was Miike's movie. I thought it was just another kung fu movie. <br /> <br /> Then I saw things like a dance player <br /> <br /> that sounded like Oriental Gato Barbier and I knew it had to be Mike. <br /> <br /> I left the opening opening credit and had to wait until the end of the closing credit to see Miike's credit. <br /> <br /> So far he hasn't been disappointed yet. Audition, the City of Lost Souls, Ichi Killer and Katakurys Happiness were all good ties and now I have found that this was the third trilogy. <br /> <br /> Other than Miike and Todd Solendz, there are no interesting movies today.
