It's too bad iameracing wants to deny the reality of Faulkner and Clarence Brown in creating the Intruder In The Dust story and movie. I think the burden of the history of racism is difficult for every southern part and I understand it. But saying that this film is not specifically about racism is ridiculous and inaccurate. YES (to borrow your capital letters) iameracing, there are many places where black and white people in the south are pretty well. But in order to deny the way black people were and sometimes live, the conditions and injustice they had to endure were not imaginative. Sometimes, black and white people got true affection and understanding. Sometimes it was only as long as the blacks knew their place. The idea of ​​Juan Hernandez's character (film and print) is somewhat prone to, not warm and fuzzy, to emphasize the fact that bigotry is in itself false and human rights are just everything, whether we like the individual or not. <br /> <br /> It would be good to end the denial of racism and the great damage he has made to all stripes of Americans. The fact is that black people (among other things) have not, as a rule, benefited from the legal system as evenly as white. Segregation, discrimination and lynching are historical facts. People like iameracing may claim that these things were not as widespread as some think, and they probably love to release their ancestors and heroes from any relationship with such behavior. It would be wonderful if the southern ancestors of iameracing (if any) would never participate in any terrible racist activities that break the history of this country, and I hope they did not. If it congratulates them, but this fact, if it is true, does not erase the fact that others did. And even if there were only half, but only a third, of the terrible things left in the southern black things (and other regions, not forgetting the civil war rebellions), would this make them less terrible? Is the murder of ten children hanging on ten male sexual assaults less than the same things that happen to a hundred? <br /> <br /> Iameracing asks us to get the "Mississippi Burning" chip on our shoulders before we see "Intruder In The Dust", will I ask you whether the murder of civil rights activists took place or not? Why forget it? Sorry? Maybe. However, to avoid their recurrence, they cannot be forgotten or turned into smaller events. Racism, which is displayed as an intruder of dust, is shown there quite purposefully. It's a thing to make a point. <br /> <br /> The cinematic historical level is also a ridiculous discount for the racial angle. The filmmaker, who was filmed before the 1960s, knows that black actors / characters / attachments were usually deliberately cast. Decide on film history; Wars were always fought by middle-aged white men; There were no black people in the old west; in a larger city it was possible to walk down the street and never come into contact with black; there were no black hospitals, taxi drivers, officials, sellers, etc. The blacks were almost in no way involved unless the race was a factor. If Falukner (and Brown) had just wanted to tell the story of a murder, he would probably not have made Hernandez's character black. <br /> <br /> Racism is iameracing. For various reasons, I am sure that we both want it not to happen, but to do it. However, if you want things to be the way we want them to be, they can't be done.
