I really enjoyed the harsh people. I discovered the film at random by searching for my On-Demand movie listings, trying to find something interesting to watch. The film is mostly about the American class and it quickly takes your attention. The characters are intelligent and articulate, and the story doesn't follow the usual Hollywood rules. Donald Sutherland plays the Patriarch, Ogden C. Osborne, the seventh richest man in America. Diane Lane plays a Finnish mother, Ogden's friend, who is also a regular cocaine user and bitch. Osbournes has a large property and seems to be living with its own rules. At first they seem charming and experienced, but they are very different. They are used to their own way. The film is enjoyable mainly because it has a crisp intelligent dialogue, a great action and a story that takes unexpected turns. It's also an R-rated movie, so it's not completely healthy. <br /> <br /> Cast is great. Anton Yelchin is a credible and sympathetic to Finland's demanding role. Sutherland and Diane Lane have never been better. Chris Evans is impressive when Osbourne's embarrassed grandson. Kristen Stewart is a pretty big daughter. High quality film.
