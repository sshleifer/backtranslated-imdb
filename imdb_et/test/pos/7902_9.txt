It's not your typical Indian film. There is a great sense of humanity and the characters are pretty realistic. There is great dynamism in interpersonal relationships, and many characters include guilt, grief, passion, passivity. Looking at it, you feel the social existence of one of the oldest civilizations in the heavy burden of the 5000-year-old layers and layers. The last scene of the elephant away from the countryside was a very old sign of this ancient civilization, but human relations are maintained and maintained. I saw this on the DVD, two interviews with the director and the chief curator are very interesting. It was surprising to know that the film wasn't well done in India (or not shown) (... but maybe not too surprised). The artistic heritage of rural societies is slowly disappearing and its heritage is not taken by the younger generations because some of the older musicians are no longer living today. Great movie.
