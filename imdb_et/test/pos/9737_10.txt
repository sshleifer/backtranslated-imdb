I loved "Flash Gordon" as a child, and watching the DVD again, brings such pleasant memories back. In every 15-minute episode, our hero Flash, the lovely Dale Arden and the intravenous Dr Zarkov on the Mongo planet, where Flash escapes from death at every step: Shark Men almost drowned, confronted with the Fire Monster in the Terrorist tunnel and is in a static space in mortal danger! The characters are still fun: Buster Crabbe is a daily blonde dreamboat hero and Jean Rogers is a delicate and beautiful Dale Arden. Princess Aura kruntb still stealing Flash, Hawk Men's King Vultan still has a flourishing laughter and angel's wings, and Ming Merciless, the emperor of the Universe, gives himself evil eyes and creeps. <br /> <br /> This series is unlikely to interest children today with their hockey effects - oh, that spacecraft! - But it's a funny nostalgia for those who liked it for the first time. Actors play it directly and do not play for children. I appreciate that young viewers were considered to read chapter events that had quite big words in them. <br /> <br /> I'm glad it appeared on DVD. It's fun to watch this classic sci-fi series.
