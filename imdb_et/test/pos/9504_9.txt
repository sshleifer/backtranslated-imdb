"Icky Flix" is a great starting point for anyone who even has a vague interest in the population. Most of their classic videos are available (though "Earth vs Flying Saucers" and "Don't Be Cruel" are curiously missing), and the "concentrates" of these various CD-ROM projects offer an amazing look at how orbed has spent its time because they realized that MTV didn't put them in a heavy rotation anymore (or even a video submission period). <br /> <br /> All videos in this compilation contain striking images and distinctive music (along with original songs and newly recorded music). And two of them - "The Third Reich" Roll and "One Minute Movie" - are in the permanent collection of the Museum of Contemporary Art. Check out this DVD and find out why.
