Okay, so it starts with a very dreamy story when the story goes (Justine plays Laura Fraser - an amazing actor on her own), but it gets something wonderful. It has stupid things that you really shouldn't find funny but do every time. Particularly memorable moment, seeing your jaw for the first time you fall to the ground, when Jake's male body containing Justine's female mind tries to get used to her new anatomy. I don't break it for you, but the second time I looked at it with friends; their eyesight was great. It makes you force, but at the same time laugh. I am also a big fan of used music. There's a nice little band that will appear on the street or on the road every time and later, but also some great but unknown (often the best) pop songs. It feels like it's written for an English writer by an American writer that irritates me a few times. In general, this movie is fun. I'm a big fan of Laura Fraser now, having been waiting for her birthday movie, though, though some of the majority are known, you'll enjoy it too.
