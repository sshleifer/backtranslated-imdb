This is an entertaining surreal movie. It has been written by Joseph Minion, who also wrote Martin Scorses an excellent surreal movie after hours. The film follows the adventures of a ten-year-old child, Gus, who heads the red Ford Mustang with the names of some fictional countries like Tristan (a tribute to Luis Bu√±uel's film, perhaps?), Essex & South Lyndon, looking for eight heavy Motorama game cards from different Chimera Company gas stations. The film has a surreal feeling because many things are unusual, such as money that is like blank paper with numbers. <br /> <br /> Most characters are disgusting to Gus. trip. They tattoo her, hit her, but it doesn't end the boy involuntarily. There are also some oddball actors such as David Lynch, Jack Nance, Meat Loaf & Flea. Jack Nance plays a motel owner who will meet Gus when he first meets, "If you see squirrels, give me these". This is a film where a man and his wife give up their little children because the man owes $ 100 to Gus; and her mother encourages her son to raise her voice by speaking. If you are a fan of Twin Peaks and surreal movies, you will like it. Strange little pearl from the movie.
