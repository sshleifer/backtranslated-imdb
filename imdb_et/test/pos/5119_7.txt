This time a lovable dimwit is called out by a jury where a corrupt lawyer notices that he looks like a jailbird who wants to break out so that both can change. Of course, most movie lines are gags; Most of the gags associated with "Ernest Goes to Jail" are electric. I liked the entire vacuum cleaner sequence early. In general, the idea of ​​a movie is just fun and I'm sure you will. This is perhaps the ultimate movie you look at. It's pretty safe to say that Jim Varney really misses. Knowwhaddamean? FYI: The only other cast member I recognized was Randall "Tex" Cobb who played Lyle. You've seen her somewhere.
