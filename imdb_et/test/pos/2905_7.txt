"Egypt" is placed during the reign of one of the most fascinating characters of the ancient world, Pharaoh Akhnaton, who, during the thirteenth century before Christ, sought monotheistic religion for ancient Egypt. But the main character is not Akhnaton, but rather a fictional Sinuhe. As a child, Sinuhe is mysteriously swim in a basket in the Nile River and is received by a doctor Senmut and his wife. If he grows masculine, he will follow his adopted father as a medical worker, initially working (as his father did) among the poor in the city, but he will come out after he and his friend, the ambitious young soldier Horemheb, rescue Pharaoh's life in the hunting desert. Sinuhe is called a physician, but he becomes Nefer, the Babylonian. Not only does he not destroy himself in an effort to win his love, but also be ashamed of if his neglect means that he cannot save Akhnaton's daughter's life. <br /> <br /> Sinuhe flees to exile where he will succeed as a healer in neighboring countries, but will return to Egypt as he learns to invade the Hitachi plot. Although Akhnaton easily forgives him for his previous offenses, Sinuhe is confused by the state. Pharaoh's attempts to introduce a new religion have led to a civil dispute between his followers and the old priest of the polytheistic faith, and he is too quiet in nature to take any action against him. Sinuhe is symbolized by Horemheb, now General of the Egyptian Army, and Princess of Akhnaton, Princess Baketamon, to overthrow Pharaoh and to replace her with a more effective monarch. <br /> <br /> The film's weaknesses stem mainly from two romantic sub-points. During the film, Sinuhe has appeared as a long-lost son as a Pharaoh and a half-brother to Akhnaton and Baketamo. So the surprise of today's audience is that he should fall in love with him; Brothers and Nurses were not necessarily uncomfortable with Egyptian royalties, but the standards of the 1950s cinema lovers were generally more liberal on this issue. In any case, the Horemheb-Baketamon-Sinuhe love triangle is an unnecessary complication and it undermines the role of Baketamon in the film, with the cold eyes, with the cynical real politics. <br /> <br /> The Nefer sub-block, which takes most of the first hour of the movie, is overwritten and overly melodramatic. Nefer is morally worthless, but fascinating, and the role needed a beautiful actor and also a great dramatic skill to make him credible, especially when Nefer gets a difficult task to fight against away from a woman who is as cute as Jean Simmons Sinuhe rival for her feelings). It is therefore regrettable that the role went to an actor who was as comical as Bella Darvi, whose only qualification was that she was producer mistress Darryl F. Zanuck. Darvi was not just a wooden actor, but also talked about a thick foreign power that Lisp made even more incomprehensible. He wasn't even particularly attractive compared to the two legendary Hollywood beauty films, Simmons and Gene Tierney, who play Baketamon. <br /> <br /> Film is better than focusing on its main political and religious themes. The other actors are better than Darv, although Peter Ustinov, while Sinuhe's servant Kaptah, makes the same mistake as "Spartacus" to try a comic relief movie that doesn't need it. Anyway, his voice was too comical for the role of the servant. <br /> <br /> Edmund Purdom, a little-known British actor, drew the main role when Marlon Brando pulled out at the last minute, but more than enough to fit a big man's shoes, although his style of action was quite different. He is well challenged to show the changes in the character of Sinuhe, from an involuntary idealist, a lovesick fool, to a cynical finish to the enlightened seer of the latest scenes. Victor Mature was never the most expressive of the actors, but he fits well with the role of Horemheb, a practical, underground man. He's better here than he was in his second epic since 1954, "Demetrius and Gladiators". Simmons is bright as Merit. <br /> <br /> Michael Wilding (still best known as the second Mr. Elizabeth Taylor) plays Akhnaton as the desired philosopher-king, who ends in a sort of sacred fool. His inability to make difficult decisions is made by an inappropriate ruler, but he has a prophetic vision of peace and justice that gives him the moral glory beyond those who hope to replace him on the throne. Although Athens had more in common with the Deist Supreme Being than the Old Testament Jehovah or the Trinity Christian God, there is a rather deliberate attempt to parallel between Atheism and Christianity. In the film, the Athenian symbol "ankh" is undoubtedly chosen because of its similarity to the cross, but in fact it was an ordinary Egyptian hieroglyph for life, not unique to Athenism. The Akhnaton language often has a Bible circle; his comparison of the "desert wind" reminiscent of John the Baptist's "voice in the desert" (hence the title of his review). Sinuhe find by the river equals Old Testament story of Moses. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, Sinuhe, who is a deceased deceased of Aknaton's spirit, will attain its moral size. The film's message is that although we need practical men like Horemheb, we also need vision and thinkers who are ready to ask "why?" For all his mistakes, the "Egyptian" film is idealistic and humane to both religion and politics. 7/10
