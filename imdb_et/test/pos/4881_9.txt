I am not in reality that it shows so much, but it is extraordinary because in the end the viewer will get something useful from this entertainment. I have no kids, but SuperNanny lessons are a great help if (and if) I ever do it! My only complaint is that the exhibition is broken because it has been in the US. I prefer the British version, with a babysitter approach. Is it just me or anyone else thinks the US version is a bit soft ... now it's a "kinder, softer" nanny? I think we need Yanks a spoonful of sugar to help the drug go?! However, there is something wrong with the happy ending, isn't it?
