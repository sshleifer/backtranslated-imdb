Isabelle Huppert must be one of her or some of the biggest actors of the next generation. "La Pianiste" really confirms this. As it wouldn't be enough, Annie Girardot plays her mother and Annie Girardot is one of her or some of the next generation's biggest actors. So, as you might imagine, these casting details are the horrors we put through. Isabelle and Annie play symbols we've never seen on the screen. Mother and daughter, yes, but with such a virulent fear that sometimes I couldn't even blink or breathe. Personally, I don't believe in the director's intentions, I don't think those (intentions) will go beyond the shocking anecdote, and the end made me scare, but I had swallowed the story that was written by the sensational strength of Huppert and Girardot. I recommend this to cinema lovers everywhere and to collectors of great performances like me, you can't afford "La Pianiste"
