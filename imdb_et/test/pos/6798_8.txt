Mickey Rooney (like Mi Taylor) is a young man who travels along the figurative path to destruction, where he meets 12-year-old Elizabeth Taylor (Velvet Brown) - he adores horses but has a sad history with animals. Mrs Taylor is in love with Mr Rooney's sense of horse; she takes her home and gets her family with her. They are very well supported by Anne Revere and Donald Crisp (Mr and Mrs Mrs). Butch Jenkins and Angela Lansbury are Taylor's tense siblings. <br /> <br /> The National Velvet plot is an incredible mistake; for example, the circumstances that led Taylor's "Big Race" to run were quite stretching (but most likely they were on paper). Yet these characters are well connected to horses and Mrs. Revere is beautiful. Rooney and Taylor have excellent role roles; there is a balance between Rooney's bland "lapst√§d" and Taylor's overwhelming new "child's star" that adds depth to their testimonials. <br /> <br /> The excellent performances of Rooney and Taylor will be further enhanced by subtle direction, photography and editing by Clarence Brown, Leonard Smith and Robert Kern. Sentimental classic. <br /> <br /> ******** National Velvet (12/14/44) Clarence Brown ~ Mickey Rooney, Elizabeth Taylor, Anne Revere
