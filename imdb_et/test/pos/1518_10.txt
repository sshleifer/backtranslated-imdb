Just beautiful. One of the best thoughts - umm ... screws --- available. Both Rickman and Stowe play their role as a child's book writer, perhaps? has written a subversive tract. Moscow can learn some things about the methods of torture in this film. They could also be worse off than hiring Alan Rickman. Five out of five stars and now (1-20-2000) # 2 with my 100 best films.
