I have not seen the latest traffic based on it, but I am against it as a better creation. I don't know of any other film that has so well depicted the tragedy of the drug trade and the 'war on drugs'. I've been watching it at least four times and enjoy it again as part of the 30th anniversary of the Masterpiece Theater.
