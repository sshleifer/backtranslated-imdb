Italian work requires daylight and no experience is required. It is great for matinee and good afternoon movies. The plot is good, but the actual playground is very simple and does not require a thinking process. It's a chase of the car, explosions, and everything just to fight the bad thing Edward Norton played. For Norton, he seems to be able to represent exactly the same characters as his previous films, such as "Score". Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron deserve better scripts. Warning: If you've seen a trailer, you've seen the movie. If you are looking for entertainment at cheap prices, you need an Italian job.
