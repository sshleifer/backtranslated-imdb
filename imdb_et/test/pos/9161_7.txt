Well, the film is essentially about a specific Russian regiment in recent days in Afghanistan, before the withdrawal of the main force in 1985. The film depicts the gloomy realities of the Russian army that have made it notorious: "dedovshina" (officers and NCOs) physical harassment, beating and humiliation of younger workers, confusion of war (you can trade your enemy one day and kill him), at the forefront of women's lives , documentary helicopter attacks and coffins that have been soldered and sent home capturing C-130 Hercules class Russian cargo planes with a label to let Stinger missiles, fatigue, boredom, anti-war mood, emotional side just put on. There are some activities, but they are badly done and often illogical, such as the suicide attempt by Major Bandura and his back for a 10-year-old child armed with AK-47, whose father he just killed. Also the fact that in the middle of a fire in the mountains heavy grenade launcher pops out (and any semi-white person knows that 40-50 lns launcher is practically impossible in the spring). At the same time, the films show that war is a dirty thing, sometimes condemning murders, scarce destruction of whole villages, or not at all, indiscriminate killing of civilians during war is an inevitable damage ... Some foods thought why the Afghan war has disappeared. best war movie but deep and smart enough to look worth it.
