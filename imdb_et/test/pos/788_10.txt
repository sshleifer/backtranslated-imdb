It's a wonderful comedy short - one of Keaton's absolute best. Through a long series of foolish bugs, Buster has gone astray with a deliberate killer. And as a result, most of the film is made up of police and one detective. Although, as a rule, I don't have a lot of movies that have a lot of chase, it's a perfectly sporty and acrobatic ability. I've seen some who have been in wild tricks, but none where the star was so narrow and capable of moving with amazing love. Especially there is a scene where he runs across the table, jumps on the man's shoulders and dives through the transom as accurately as possible. Plus so many gags are funny and completely timed, for example, how it really needs to be believed that it has actually killed someone. By the way, this film is very similar to COPS, including Keaton, but original enough and enough energy to be both worthwhile. <br /> <br /> This movie is brilliant and the only short I think of it I thought was even more of a game where Buster plays every role in the theater.
