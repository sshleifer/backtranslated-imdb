I saw this movie the same evening when I saw another 6 short pants. It was in front of outstanding front lines, ie in terms of operation, leadership, filming and originality. With professionalism, often short films. <br /> <br /> This is a great short film for the following reasons: <br /> <br /> 1. Amazing performances. Two actors are both compelling and credible. Their chemistry is sensitive; their relationship has been communicated, even though the film is 10 minutes long. Operation and management are very powerful. <br /> <br /> 2. Beautifully shot. Lighting, framing and general filming are striking. The 35 mm film defines the short shorts of this movie. And what's the difference. Filming is worth the film stock. <br /> <br /> 3. Strong story. Often, short films try too little or too much time. Or they try to predict a predictive story. It's a good balance to tell you an interesting story without pulling it out too long or leaving you unhappy. You don't know what happens next while you feel something is happening. <br /> <br /> Also a nice score. Congratulations without overflow. <br /> <br /> If you find it at the festival, try to see it.
