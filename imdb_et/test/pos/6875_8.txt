Matthau is a widow's hospital doctor who enjoys her only status and salary increase and the available nursing staff, while her colleague and friend Richard Benjamin is looking at amusement and amazement. Their boss is hearing impaired, which takes place in the ancient chief of staff, Art Carney, who is ready to re-elect this post. <br /> <br /> Matthau is unplayable until he meets one of his mothers, Glenda Jackson, who demands that she be the only woman in her life. At the same time, he is required to respond to a potential litigation as a grave pretext for the abusive state and to support the scary and incompetent Carney in his quest to re-elect the Chief of Staff. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent old-fashioned romantic comedy, rated by four A-level actors and a great form of support that works with a first-class dry, corrosive and sarcastic script. Carney steals every scene in which she is, and in IMDb's speech we are rolling on a floor that laughs out loud as she appears on the screen. Otherwise, we have entertainment between switching off two wires and different sub-plots. <br /> <br /> There is no ambition to be a great movie, but remains one of the best and most traceable - just to see comedy value. It is worth more attention than what seems to be the cost of a DVD or videocassette.
