An X-file that shows that action is always the same as intelligence. Rob Bowman's direction is sharp and sharp, the episode looks as fresh as almost a decade ago. David and Gillian give both fine performances and both seem to be delighted by the lack of luggage - a standalone X-file that even non-fans can and will enjoy. Junior Brown gives both drivers his own scene for their money, he is so convincing that you can believe that the team drove to the center and knocked on the first door they came to. Bryan Cranston is intense and energetic like Patrick Crump, and since then he has admitted in interviews that he knew nothing before the X-Files before that role, making his strike-floor work even more amazing. Great fool episode.
