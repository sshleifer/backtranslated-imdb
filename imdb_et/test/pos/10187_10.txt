It's not a movie, it's an experience! <br /> <br /> Not the usual eye candy I thought. Too many things happen at one time, your minds couldn't handle it anymore. A product of cutting-edge technology (we were tearing back sitting back to enjoy the show and putting the 3D glasses in and out to charm magic), the music is great (it's a concert!), Disney's characters are in it (and you get part of your world), it's funny, it's magical, it's exciting - I know it's going to sound like an ad - but it's really so fantastic! Running with Christmas to bring your boyfriend out! <br /> <br /> This attraction alone will make Disney all worth it. ;)
