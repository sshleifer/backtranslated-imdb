If you enjoy puzzles and tension, you'll enjoy this movie. It must be said that this was mostly the part of Adrian Paul that started to go away, I knew almost anything about the film. Plot is: Sarah (Carly Pope), a student of philosophy and metaphysics, begins to play a mysterious puzzle game, trying to figure out the "cause" and participate in the "game", solving puzzles. Vern (Adrian Paul) is the shop owner as well as the riddle fanatic, and it also plays the game. The myth is that when you solve a game, the meaning of existence ("Design") becomes apparent. The character of Brendan Fehr is the "village idiot" that hangs around the store, which turns out to be more than it seems. All in all, I thought the film was pretty well done. And this is definitely the original concept, a rare find of these days! Personally, I like riddles and punches, so even though most of them were not very difficult, it was still a fun movie. It is worth renting it. <br /> <br /> So if you haven't seen it, I'll get it! :-D <br /> <br />
