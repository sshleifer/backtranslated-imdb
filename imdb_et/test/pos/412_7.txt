Look, this movie is unclear, brilliant and classic, which should find the tools you need. I think the powers that have decided that it will bring down the binain forever; nevertheless, we could pray for this opportunity to see it on the DVD. I'd say it even wins big Phatasm. If you like a dark movie with a lot of spooky pictures, look for it and see how the 80's horror movie is.
