An amazingly harrowing report of two soldiers who were in World War II. This film is not only a fight against the Nazi and Belarusian traitors, but also against the harsh natural elements, but this film talks about two polarized moral soldiers who survive, but finds it somewhat impossible to cope with themselves and those who die. having done all that can be done in intimidation and all sorts of ways to break your spirit, namely the title "ascendant." A movie that everyone should see, especially the phenomenal performances and concealments of the main characters (especially detention and hanging scenes). The absolute must see.
