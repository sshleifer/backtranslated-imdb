Dear New York married couple leaves when a woman wants ("She took a lot of courage to walk this door!" The neighbor tells us); a busy, disturbed spouse takes on "mother" responsibilities and grows closer to her son, but soon she returns. A highly manipulative image does not give us a very realistic family unit (certainly with Justin Henry's younger Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep's marriage product!), But the dynamics are intriguing and inclusive, and director Robert Benton keeps pace with a lot of intelligence, wonderful classical music, canyon editing and definite fun. Streep's character has been created to be a cold, self-centered witch, but I was much more familiar with her than Benton apparently wanted. All this has to be painted in black and white, in good and bad terms, Hoffman learning how hard his wife was, and getting another chance to be a good parent. The film never loses its intentional journey, and it works very fine, but I'm not sure where Benton directed the film in the final act, and the scene of closure is terribly steep. *** from ****
