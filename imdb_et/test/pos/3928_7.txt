I don't think this film deserves the low rating that most of it gives. It's one of the best "teenage" horror movies I've ever seen; and it says a lot. Nothing is left without explanation to back it up, characters and plot to break countless stereotypes of horror movies, and it has nothing to do with any other horrible piece we've recently made. (A clear example is a meaningless "Saint Ange".) The first 30-40 minutes can be completely boring, except for the beginning, although some small flaws can be easily noticeable. However, after the village arrives, horror begins - a different, twisted horror. <br /> <br /> Cows are small for plot and details; The characters are the strongest point of this movie, because there are so many clich√©s. For example, the two main male characters Nick and Wade are in no way idiotic types we are used to; although Dalton might be better suited for this stereotype, he is not the only one who pays for this lack of consciousness. Some scenes are truly satisfying, terrible, filled with tense moments scattered around the film. And finally, and although everything is beautifully explained, it is easy to see that things are not so easy to survive. <br /> <br /> The only mistake I see and that does not mean consistency (IE, Carly didn't find unconscious Bo pockets in his cut finger) is the lighting that is first, boring in 30 minutes somehow annoying. Although, because of the plot and effectiveness, all the main characters in Ambrosia, a small village that is not something, are drastically and cruelly, so I give it. There have been quite a number of claims that about 70% of the film is illogical; "How can two people build a whole wax house?", "Where do they get all the wax?" These would not be resurrection if people had paid more attention to the film. The Sinclair brothers did not build a wax house; their mother worked on making real wax images and exhibited in the museum. And the scenario where Paris Hilton's unfortunate character corresponds to his premature death is the answer to the second question; What are the personal belongings of all dead people (mobile phones, cars, clothes)? Using your third brother in connection with the outside environment, it is quite controversial that the Sinclair twins should receive the money they need to buy wax in World War II-style fashion. <br /> <br /> I think the film deserves much more than it gets, and nobody should lose the chance to watch it. So look at the wax house. Right now.
