Warning - This movie has some amazingly graphic images that children should never see. <br /> <br /> The artist who speaks this story was indeed a good Korean painter who rose from the lowest depths to become the greatest painter. Unfortunately, this man had so many options in so many ways. Some of this was an artistic temperament, and what might seem annoying was just her demanding creation that came to art. But at other times he was just a drunken jerk - especially when he was on his way to a great artist. At the end of the film, he seemed to be annoying, abrasive and unnecessarily cruel. Although not all of it was a very nice man, it is important to film, so we understand a lot about the nature of the artist. <br /> <br /> I really found the movie exciting and loved, how the artists' actual works were shown throughout the film (like LUST FOR LIFE). I really wish I could show it to my students (I teach in art school), but I can't, because there is too much adult material. Yes, there is nudity, but for any audience (especially the younger ones) it is even more problematic than it, ... hmmm, ... I don't think IMDb allows me to describe what happened, but it was very graphic and includes body fluids. Not only the nasty and nasty scene that you shouldn't see, but the reason why the junior doesn't see this otherwise wonderful movie. This is a real shame.
