I looked at the reader with sugar, which is not the optimal place to watch, and the film was at the peak of the evening. The technical elements were very prominent and it was clear that Duncan Rogers had chosen his designers and team well. But it was a story and its delivery that really made it a short glow. Duncan Rogers' tight script was just what was needed tonight. It didn't bend as many offers did or announced us. The reader was a simple story that speaks in this best form, worked by Rogers and worked beautifully. Duncan Rogers is obviously the director who can put all the pieces together, I look forward to my next finished project. K.
