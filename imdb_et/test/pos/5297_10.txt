Miyazaki's studio Ghibli shows Ponyo's everyday violence with its amazing animation. When Sosuke puts his little boat so carefully to catch the red fish, you know it's a good time to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Characters are interesting and you care for them. They visually resemble other stories, Riisa seems to have grown up with Nausica with her son, the old wheelchair remembers the witch in Movli Castle. <br /> <br /> The presence of elements, wind, rain and sea with their large and powerful waves is so strong that I don't think it has been created in this way in any other film. This is a simple story inspired by the "little mermaid" inspired by the audience, such as Totoro, another Miyazaki real masterpiece. <br /> <br /> A fast classic with a great soundtrack and a memorable song at the end of the songs. Don't miss it.
