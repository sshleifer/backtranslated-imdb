When I first saw the advertised movie, I thought it was another Disney movie that almost went straight to the video. I finally got around and rented it. I thought it was bad because I didn't see Shia in any other role than his recently canceled "Even Stevens" show. When I turned it on, I was ready to turn it off after ten minutes. It started a little slow and I didn't understand the beginning because the years were not reasonable, then they explained that later in the show I apologized for thinking about it. Everything and I thought it was a good movie and I would recommend it. The cast was top-notch and although I'm not a golf fan, it kept my attention on a good plot.
