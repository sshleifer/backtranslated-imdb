Some things that relate to the comment of a previous person. You just have to pay attention to what's going on on the film. <br /> <br /> (I think these are spoilers) <br /> <br /> Red things under David's mouth? Poison ivy, woman says not to scratch it, otherwise "spreads". <br /> <br /> David goes "crazy" because a stranger tells him to come out of the house, which probably proves David's theory of what is happening between a woman and a stranger; he runs after the man. <br /> <br /> David will not lose him in the woods, he will just hit a stranger a few times and will leave his wife in pieces. <br /> <br /> Only a woman eats a mushroom. I have to say that after that one thing about a woman and a stranger, I started to feel disappointed. But the end is for the whole movie. <br /> <br /> And for this and the last scene, it's one of my favorite movies. I would have had to put it together before, but let me deviate. I was really surprised, honestly. <br /> <br /> This movie is interesting, at least say. But if you don't look at the exhibitions that the actors give, I'd say it's better because that's all that keeps that particular movie together.
