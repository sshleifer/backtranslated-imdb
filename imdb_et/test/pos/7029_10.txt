<br /> <br /> When this movie came out, I ended up with a lightweight nonsense. It was a mistake. <br /> <br /> After repeated views and looking at the documentary DIRTY DANCING, the depth of this film will definitely increase its appeal. <br /> <br /> DIRTY DANCING is a movie about change. The evolving nature of inter-family relations, changes in worldviews as they age, etc. The story takes place in August 1963, the last innocence of the American people in the summer. Many of the personal changes that characters experience are reflecting many changes in American society, marked by Kennedy's murders and Vietnam. <br /> <br /> Female film members respected this movie and recurring trips to film theaters, this is the world's most successful dance film. I find it very difficult to accept the romantic tying of the ultimate wife, Patrick Swayze, with a very simple Jennifer Gray. It would be deadly for the most romantic dramas, and it could also have caused intense opposition from most male reviewers. <br /> <br /> The movie soundtrack found # 1 status before the movie was released. To date, it is almost impossible to participate in a wedding competition without DIRTY DANCING singing. <br /> <br /> Near the center of the movie, the baby wakes up and asks the baby's father: "Is something wrong?" /> <br /> The baby's father, a member of the family against change, is trying to keep everything that is secret. He tells his wife to go to bed. But resistance can be unchanged. DIRTY DANCING is the story of one person who is awakening in the last moments of the last dream of our country.
