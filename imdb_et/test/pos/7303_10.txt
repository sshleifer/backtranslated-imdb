After watching this movie for years, it didn't disappear from my memory. I always thought it was Michelle Pfeiffer's best show I've seen. But I'm surprised by the number of negative reviews in this movie. After seeing it again today, I think it is powerful, mobile and doesn't care if it is "King Learil loosely". <br /> <br /> I know now that this is the greatest force I have ever seen in Jessica Lange - and she has recognized much lower efforts. <br /> <br /> Thousands of acres are complex, human, viable and tremendously mobile, but definitely not one of the primary women directs any kind of glamor or "sexuality." I don't think it has been well received at these times. <br /> <br /> Maybe there is one reason why this film is constantly responding to the writer (Jane Smiley (, Laura Jones) and director (I know that on my younger days I wouldn't have read a woman's book but I did not focus on this fact only years later. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie in the past, try it again, maybe you're ready.
