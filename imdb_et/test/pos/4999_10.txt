The warmest, most interesting film of his genre, these lips, those eyes, made me smile and cry because it reminded me of the work that is needed to achieve the pain of dream and frustration. Hulce and Langella are great and the story seems to be writing. David Shaber (one of my favorites! - see The Warriors and Nighthawks more ...) and beautiful sets that were filmed locally (I think) in the actual summer theater where the story goes. You don't see this movie and don't want to miss everything and get into the theater! Check out this video if you find it.
