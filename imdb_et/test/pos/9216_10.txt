This movie is awesome, as it showed how really good 80s in the 80s really did, animators were not lazy as they are today, the comic had so many details that they had very little resources compared to what we have today. If more people would like to redistribute these cartoons, perhaps all the other 80's cartoons on television might be shown to finish their sentence, I would just like to say that this was a comic that I grew up and really want it to be on TV yet once.
