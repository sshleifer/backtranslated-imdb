Okay. In order to enjoy this silent comedy briefly, you must stop believing in the main point of the film. If you can't, this movie is likely to be much smaller. Charlie Chase has a huge predominance and his wife has a big enough nose with a regional code. It is unknown to each other that both are spared to correct these errors. Apparently, in the 1920s, plastic and dental care was better because they didn't seem to need to recover from these larger operations and they saw dandy right away! Okay, remember I ignored it, right? Okay, then you also have to ignore the difficulty of believing the idea that both could meet and have no idea that the other is their husband. Okay, now that you promised to accept these two foolish spaces, the movie really does, really good. <br /> <br /> Charlie handed him over and he handed him over. Both are shocked and excited because no one has really considered them to be attractive. So they agree to continue the date because of this new vanity. But they both jump back home - don't want their spouses to know! Anyway, they meet later and quite attracted to each other. But with the poor spouses allegedly at home? Well, they both learn that the other is married and both predict divorce as a result of their marriage because they want to be with each other! At the end of the movie, Charlie thinks that she is actually her husband and she goes through a very funny sequence where she plays both boy and old - changing her clothes and putting the wrong teeth when she plays the hub! It's really a ridiculous government to see that it bounces in and out of the room because it seems to be fighting with another person! You really have to believe it. But she sees Charli before and after the photos and knows what's going on. Finally, they both feel pretty stupid!
