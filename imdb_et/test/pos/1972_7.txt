Film eXistenZ is a futuristic video game "pod" in a system that is almost like a virtual reality. The only copy of a video game is damaged when a designer is attempted to murder (Jennifer Jason Leigh). If this is not possible, years spent on development and $ 38 million will go to waste. The only way to improve the game is to play the game with the only person he knows (Jude Law). This movie was pretty good, but it didn't get up very late. The best thing about this movie was the turn to the end. Definitely worth seeing. 7/10
