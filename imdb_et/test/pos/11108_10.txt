I really fell in love with the characters. They were very underground, but each had a hidden dark side. Mystery variety. David Graysmark himself was a mystery. Secret fear and just the secrets he had. There was a whole half of him that other characters didn't know anything and left the audience thinking or assuming. This man was always part of what he would hide, but he also shared a little. He was a strong male leader and I admire this type of character. Billy Moses himself is an incredible actress who could do almost any part! He is an amazing talent and a good man. His fans love, respect and support him endlessly. <br /> <br /> Since this exhibition has gone to many other projects and has been able to stretch its performance quite well and quite well. Knit it and all the other actors for this great job! I wish them all well. I want the series to continue! It's so shame that it wasn't!
