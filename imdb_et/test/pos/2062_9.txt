I wasn't planning to continue with the review, but I saw some other terrible reviews of this movie. I had to say something. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to end or give anything, but I'll give you some important test points in this review so you should know. A short (non-spoiler) version of my review - Samuel L. Jackson and Geena Davis both put it down and it's a lot of fun. Look at this. <br /> <br /> This movie is my favorite of all time. Geena Davis is perfect as a hero who has broken her life as a housewife and mother, and memories that have transformed her former life into a CIA Assassin. His presentation is excellent because he plays both facets of a relatively complex character. Samuel L. Jackson's performance is always as great as a private investigator hired by Geena Davis's character to look into his forgotten past. He is doing a great job to play the involuntary bandage of Geena Davis's harsh character. Some of the lines she talks about in this movie are the best she has ever used in every movie she has been. <br /> <br /> Seriously, if you haven't seen it, do it. This is a fantastic story with a lot of unexpected turns and it is very well targeted and acted.
