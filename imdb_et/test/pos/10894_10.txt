007's Goldeneye is one of the best N64 releases. <br /> <br /> Better than this game? Well ... Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, Star Wars: Episode I-Racer and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is much better and better games. But I still love Goldeneye. <br /> <br /> This is the best movie made for Star Wars adjustments only. The story is perfect. It's like you're in the movie. <br /> <br /> Graphics are great. Movements are extremely realistic. The best part of this game is the artificial intelligence of the enemies. I loved to play the stage where James and Natalya broke the Janus base when Goldeneye prepares to burn it. Without disturbing the disturbance, the escape was very difficult. Inclusion of cameras and fire control is a big aspect of gameplay. <br /> <br /> This is also the hardest game I've ever played. N64 games are usually very, very simple. Goldeneye is one exception. I'm still trying to win 00 agent complex levels, but winning simple levels was already a big win. I loved when Alec Trevelyan asked, "England James?". I replied, "No, MY!" It happened just when I broke her down. Just like in the movie. I love the achievement of every goal. <br /> <br /> Multiplayer gaming is even better. First I killed every sacred one. Now I know how to win. I love forcing my playmates to play Kill. <br /> <br /> The music and sound are amazing. Super Mario 64 looks like Atari. The only thing I wanted to hear was the Goldeneye theme song that plays at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> When Zelda appeared, I forgot about this game. It's still great, even if it's already overrun. I hope other 007 games will be produced. <br /> <br /> Fantastic Rareware! Nintendo was very smart to release this game only on N64. Great work for Nintendo!
