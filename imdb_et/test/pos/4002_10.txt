Wow, What a wonderful movie making! Mr. Im has done this again! <br /> <br /> His latest work, ChunHayang (2000), was a great movie, but it's even bigger. This 66-year-old director has been officially the second time in the Canne Festival for the second time in succession when making Korean culture. <br /> <br /> Simply put, Chihwaseon has a great Korean painter, "(Ohwon) JANG, Seung-Up", who was considered wonderful at the end of the nineteenth century. The main story of this film is about Jang, the life of Seung-up and the historical background. He was an orphan, but in his teens he rose to a noble man called Kim, Byung-Moon. This Mr.Kim becomes Jangi's mentor and lifelong friendship and continues to support his great talent he first knew. With its great efforts and natural talents, his fame is growing faster and faster than his country's strength, Korea is falling. <br /> <br /> In the movie, the personality depicted in the movie is very complicated and one of the best players in Korea, Choi, Min-sik goes deep into Jangi's soul. Afflicted eyes reveal the life of a great artist. He is sometimes very serious, but suddenly he becomes a wild maniac. He drinks like an alcoholic and sleeps with his contemporaries at any time. Even he said in the movie, "Without alcohol and women, I can't draw. (Alcohol and women are my only inspiration)" At the top of celebrity to develop his style, he moves around and never gives his pride to the artist as money. I don't want to give out every detail, but I think you really got some thoughts about the movie. <br /> <br /> The most amazing thing about this movie is cinematography. It is just as breathless as they photographed all the beauty of landscapes. Yes, every scene is like Jangi's painting work. And the script is also perfect. It mainly deals with the deeper meaning of the true artist. For example, Kim Jang in the film advises that "before one has a brush, a goal must be set alive". It is a very moving and inspiring line and much more. <br /> <br /> Go Watch this movie if you plan to participate in the Canne Festival. <br /> <br /> Chihwasun is the biggest ever film about life in painting history.
