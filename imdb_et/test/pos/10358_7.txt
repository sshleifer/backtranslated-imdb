I saw this black and white comedy at the Noir London Film Festival. It is structurally compared to Pulp Fiction, but it is perhaps closer to Amores Perros's structure and Kevin Smith's Clerks slipping. There are four tracks on the French motorways. Franck (Edouard Baer) is on the first matrix to eat. The reporter, Suzie (Anna Mouglalis) takes the damage and tells her story. The other is two incompetent robbers, Leon (Bouli Lanners) and Paul (Serge Lariviere) take a teenage girl from her rich family. Unfortunately he is suicidal and his family does not want to get him back. The third is a dialogue between two aging rock stars who get into one another's canteen (Alain Bashung and Arno play themselves). The final part is about four ex-offenders who smuggle their old partner out of the hospital to visit their old shelter that has since been taken? dining room. "Epilogue" returns to Franck and Suzie to complete their story (not actually an epilogue, more inference). <br /> <br /> The structure is not really working. Stories are not intertwined enough with Pulp Fiction. Also, the dining room is not important to the activity for at least two readings, how the car accident was crucial for Amores Perros's four readings. The quality of individual stories varies. A hidden story is a lovely idea that has a few good gags but doesn't come out; And rock-star reunion is pointless and boring. On the other hand, the story of the robbery is fun, although its connection to the dining area is weak. The most balanced and successful story is Franck and Suzie. <br /> <br /> This movie is not quite successful, but it has interesting moments and fun. Waiting for the work of Writer / director Samuel Benchetrit.
