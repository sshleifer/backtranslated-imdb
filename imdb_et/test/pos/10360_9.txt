I saw it for the first time on January 1, 2009 and after I looked at it again and I want to look at it again. Love everything (well, almost 9 stars) about it. No color, nice naive stories, funny gangsters, Anna, camera work, music. Sometimes you just want to listen a little longer and the music just stops. But that's not music. I like Anna's behavior, this naive wannabe gangster girl, how she talks, keeps the gun, everything makes me smile. No, it's not that funny, even though I've been laughing for a while, it's just that fine. Great work by Samuel Benchetrit. While the 3D nouvelle seems weaker, but they are also gangsters, perhaps even worse because they steal ideas. And the last scene is my favorite. It seems so warm and romantic to me. Yes, I would recommend this film to romantic souls who have a taste for such art-interested films. And I disagree with those comparing it to Pulp Fiction. It does not mean action or a twisted story, even though all the vignettes intersect. It is a calm and perhaps too slow movie for most people. It's about characters, their feelings, very subtle. In any case, this review may not help anyone (my first), but wanted to express my appreciation. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: This movie has no Goofs part. Wonder, did anyone notice this hand in two parts when the kidnappers decided to go home? It looks like it's part of the team, hehe. I know I should post it on the forum, but I disagree with some of the policies here.
