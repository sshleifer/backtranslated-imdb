Many of the previous comments are for real money, but some, well, not so much. <br /> <br /> It's hardly a B movie ... it's well produced, live flying sequences are really great and model sequences are the first. It's not "cheap". Ricard Barthelmess is pretty good in this respect and it makes a nice companion "Only angels are wings". <br /> <br /> If you want to see John Wayne, spot J. Carrol Naish first, they will end up together. <br /> <br /> Tom Browne is a minor (and somewhat boring) but when they saddle him in the most pathetic pencil-mustache of Hollywood history, it makes his character even less plausible. Sally Eilers is much more. <br /> <br /> As for the later effects, this is Wellman's early training zone ... the opening order of the movie where the man of the airline arrives "Grand Central Airport" would have been very good for "The High and the Mighty" ... just imagine Regis Toomey ... and 1955 Buick.
