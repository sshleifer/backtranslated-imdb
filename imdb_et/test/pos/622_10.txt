This is a very good movie. I give it to 10. <br /> <br /> It's very different from the fact that it's a long stalking scene all the time. The fact that the main character is silent is used in a very credible way throughout the story. <br /> <br /> He sees the murder (snuff movie) and decides to drive, but it is tracked (it takes quite a bit) at a time). I won't publish the rest of the movie because it would break the experience, but you can be sure: it is very plausible, well played, very intense and has some nice surprises and a great ending. <br /> <br /> Don 't miss this movie.
