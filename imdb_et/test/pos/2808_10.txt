Really do not care that someone here does not like this film, I do, and that is what it reviews. Lou Diamond Phillips is big in this comic role. this train ab and c line is now a classic class for me, cg is great, yes the train looks a little fake, but foreigners will ever get a stone ,, Todd Bridges, where is Arnold and Mr. Drummond,, wow he's out of the loop, think that what the prison is doing for you .. ball train is there way to Las Vegas with Senator to give him a big speech, the meteor has just hit, and now all of a sudden we got on board the foreigners who got off the train and our hero must save the day so that even worse his former wife would be on board, claiming to be with her. I just thought this film was so wonderful, you have to see if you like it.
