"Doppleganger" (or "sunshine" as it is commonly known) is written (with the late Donald James contribution) and produced by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, known for their "Supermarion" television. exhibitions like "Thunderbirds". <br /> <br /> The international space agency Eurosec is discovering the existence of a mysterious planet on the other side of the sun and offering a manned flight. The Committee is stopping for amazing costs and restricting the project. But when a security leak is discovered from the agency, fearing that the Russians may be the first to enter there, the project will be green. <br /> <br /> The American astronaut Glenn Ross (Roy Thinnes) is with British scientist John Kane (Ian Hendry). After weeks of exhausting training, Phoenix explodes into an unknown place. Three weeks later, their ship, which seems to be a dark, mountainous landscape, breaks. Ross survives, but Kane is injured. Light is moving towards them ... <br /> <br /> I leave a synopsis here. Until that time, the film has been amazing, with great special effects (Derek Meddings) and music by Anderson resident composer Barry Gray (why it's not in C.D.) is a mystery. But when Ross and Kane attack the land and discover the mystery of the alien world - this is our own duplicate, everything is the same, the only big difference is that things are the opposite - it becomes less interesting and ends with the destructive anti-climax. I think the cinema was the wrong place to make this idea, but actually Gerry & Sylvia later did something similar to her "Space: 1999" exhibition. Ross risks (and ultimately loses) his life, trying to retreat to Earth - to his land. But why? The New Earth is so similar that it wouldn't bother. <br /> <br /> Roy Thinnes had recently made "The Invaders" television series and competencies (sorry there are no scenes like where he and his wife line. Ian Hendry is good than "Kane" but disappears too soon Andersons 'UFO like Ed Bishop and George Sewell. Blink and you leave Nicholas Courtney (' Brigadier 'in the role of drWho). But the actors' awards go to Patrick Wymark as 'Jason Webb', the head of Eurosec. John Wilder "he played ATV Webb is a terrifying character he is looking at. Herbert Lom's contribution (like a hidden camera spy) reaches a little more than a cam. <br /> <br /> As I said, special effects are wonderful So the movie is worth watching, but don't wait much for the action to move into a mirror plan. With a stronger script it could have been another "Apeside planet" or - dare say - "2001: Space Mystery". /> <br /> Anderson In the productions he made the future seem like a great place, an adventure playground where science was cool, everyone had a finger on cars whose doors opened up vertically, sexy women, and absolutely no suggestion that anything is seriously wrong in the world. We are in the future and people are still looking at the crowning streets every other night. How disappointing. If the mirror Earth really does exist, it hopes it will be a better place. If all women look like Lynn Loring or Loni von Friedl, then I'm on the next flight!
