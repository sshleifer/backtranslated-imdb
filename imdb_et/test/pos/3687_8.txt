Small Spoilers <br /> <br /> In Chicago, Grace Beasley (Kathy Bates) is a housewife with twenty-five years of marriage with Max Beasley (Dan Aykroyd) and a hysterical and psychotic dwarf. Maudey (Meredith Eaton). Grace worships the singer Victor Fox (Jonathan Price), who presents the Chicago TV show and places five spots on TV on the first line. Kate calls the exhibition and wins the ticket if Max asks for a divorce at the same time, claiming that their life is too monotonous. Grace becomes depressed and when she goes to the show, the audience is informed that a Chicago runner who is using the competition killed Victor Fox. With a broken heart, he decides to fly to England at the funeral of Victor Fox. There he understands that he was gay and becomes a friend of his former companion Dirk Simpson (Rupert Everett). They fly back to Chicago, trying to find a killer. This movie is a delightful, original and weird dramatic comedy with odd signs. It has tremendous potential as a cult film, with Julie Andrews and Barry Manilow himself presenting and joking with Nicolas Roeg's "Don't Look Now" when Maudey wears a red raincoat in the north of Chicago. The beginning of the movie, where Jonathan Price sang "Hitchcock Railway", is wonderful. I repeated it four times in a row. The cast is excellent, featuring Kathy Bates, Jonathan Price, Rupert Everett and the unknown Meredith Eaton. Indeed, this movie is a great entertainment. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Amor a Toda Prova"
