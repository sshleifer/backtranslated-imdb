First, I looked at this example because I was a little toddler and I always loved it. Of course, I didn't understand it when I was young, but I still enjoyed it! And now that I've understood it for several years, I love it even more. This music score is the most wonderfully detailed score I've ever heard! Every character is perfect, I don't even need to hear singing to enjoy it! <br /> <br /> Going With This Specific Production - It's Great! Of course, nobody could play Mrs Lovett next to Angela Lansbury and she does it completely. And he should play this part for several years. George Hearn is absolutely brilliant. Best Sweeney Todd I've ever heard of. She has a great voice, but she can throw her voice so well! His "epiphany" is incredible as you can say in response to the audience. The judge, Toby, Antony and Pirelli are so wonderful in their roles. Everyone is perfect! Well, I have to move forward with Johanna's green penis and the fir tree. He just doesn't sing this song at all. <br /> <br /> This indication can be evaluated at any age, but is not always accepted. I'm not your typical medieval theater player, I'm only 15 years old, but Sweeney Todd has given me more recognition for music than my music.
