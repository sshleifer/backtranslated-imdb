Large Businesses Vs. Responsible to do good. It seems that we see this kind of events (both real life and reel life) all the time and most of the time is obtained by greed using all the necessary means (dirty) and the truth is suppressed. At least in this movie, Jack Godell (Jack Lemmon) got his points and paid for it dearly. In recent years, we have seen many of the most memorable films, The Insider, where Russell Crowe played a tobacco industry scientist trying to whip, claiming that the industry added more nicotine to cigarettes to make smokers addicted. There was also the reporter-protagonist, where the reporter is looking for a scoop of his dreams, and the protagonist is facing the moral dilemma where he has to choose between justice and livelihood and sometimes between his life. br /> <br /> Jane Fonda played the reporter in the Kimberly recesses. He plays a reporter who wants to continue serious news while his bosses appreciate him more than "Eye-Candy". He and his team (the operator playing post-'Michael 'Douglas, who is also a film producer) are familiar with the accident at the nuclear power plant during their visit. Michael Douglas, a cameraman, obviously / illegally saves the shots of this event on the tape, despite being a non-photography zone and smuggling it out of the station. The station refuses from the air and informs the company that owns the plant. Meanwhile, Chief Engineer Jack Godell is launching his own investigation and discovering a lot of irregularities in reactor equipment. It launches all the dirty policies of corruption and greed. <br /> <br /> It is a good thriller and it managed to create a lot of tension for the audience and the fun thing was that the background point was not to recommend all the scary moments. Now the movies are big and unusual. The performances were all good and I love Jack Lemmon. We know him primarily for comedy roles, but in dramatic roles he is equally good. I'll give this movie 8/10.
