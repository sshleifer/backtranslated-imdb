Leaving aside the drawbacks and drawbacks of the film mentioned by other viewers, I have to say that it seemed to me that it was a film of power, which, in my opinion, is one of the most pleasant illusions. I saw the drama of the emperor and the people. It seems to me that the director wished to raise the question of what the people are doing and what the price of "happiness" is for everyone. Is there a justification for forced gain and "happiness"? How much can be lost for the security and peaceful existence of the people? Does the idea of ​​a worthy future empire worth reducing misery and killing thousands of its citizens? It seems to me that the emperor himself does not know the answer and tries to learn this film all the time. He has been severely torn between these desires and at the same time psychologically harassing his true origin. He seems to hate his subjects from his father and give up love, half loves people as a good emperor. No wonder his actions are controversial and emotionally confused. It seems to me that film, which is a problem of human power to other men, is a success for the film.
