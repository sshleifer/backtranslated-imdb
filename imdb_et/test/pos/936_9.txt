This is the latest film by Krzysztof Kieslowski - one of the greatest directors of cinema history. He was going to retire after the film, so it is his artistic will. He died a few years after making the film, and although it has been said he was going to be directed back, Destiny decided it was his last. And what movie! <br /> <br /> 'Rouge' is the latest film in three colors in French trilogy, actually a very Swiss film. One of the main characters in Geneva is the Swiss retired judge, and Durenmatt is about to remember. But in Switzerland, in a cool atmosphere, there are more signs of communication, courtesy that surrounds the cruelty of life. Many characters who start with small relationships will end up at the end of a mobile and human finale that could only be played by a great artist. times. Yes, the film starts slowly and fans of American style or melodrama discourage them first and get lost. They deserve it. The film achieves its success and one of the less hidden messages is that real life and real people are more interesting than the Hollywood comic and the plastic and the characters. The quality of the cinema is very original, as the picture is "Study in red" as the title shows. The action is fabulous, Irene Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintignant - which will probably be the best role of their old age. <br /> <br /> Great movie. Seeing this again will probably add, and I'm glad it is being recorded on tape. 9/10 on my personal scale.
