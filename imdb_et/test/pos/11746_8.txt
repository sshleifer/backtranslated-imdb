This film is catching the eye of where the weather patterns are very beautiful in Hong Hong. Filmed in the rich colors of the 1950s films that today's explosives never let. Probably the sign of these times, because it is not a great source of power, it was seen before a film full of destruction and violence. However, there is discomfort and violence where thousands of refugees are trying to get out of China. It is a very moving and convincing story full of hope and love in tragic history in recent history. The story of two people from different cultures. And building them, trying to overcome it, is the heart of this very fine and moving movie.
