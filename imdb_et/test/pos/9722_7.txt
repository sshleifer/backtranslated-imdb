Despite its generation, the most interesting things in this series are animated or puppy products that are charming but are slightly more than lateral, at least the story I saw, A STORY SHORT. In fact, although I feel it, the main pleasure of the program is that the oldest art, storytelling. John Hurt, Rowley Birken's QC mode, a grotesque, medieval makeup, is related to the story of a narrative, a cynical dog sitting by the fire. One winter day, hungry and poor, he puts out a colleague who has been thrown out of the Royal Kitchen in a terrible cookery. Story Teller tricks this last by giving them an excellent soup. Furious, Cook asks the king for permission to boil, but pleased with the story of Story Teller, the monarch offers him revenge - 100 nights, he must tell the king a new story: if he doesn't, he will give him a chef. <br /> <br /> The story may be old, but it is very much spoken about. Anthony Minghella's manuscript is excellent dramatic (as a playwright), funny and with some worrying concerns, such as fear of self or culturally self-proclaiming narrative, associated with the continuation of ideological power. For a child-oriented program, it is boldly self-reflective (little pointless if the film is a new oral culture); Despite the American style, there is medieval passion, its grotesque and arbitrary terror, as well as its magic and power.
