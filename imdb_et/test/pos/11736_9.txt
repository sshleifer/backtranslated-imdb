I've always loved this scratched voice in all these western countries. He was at the Wild Bill Hickock Exhibition (Jingles) in the fifties. It is a great tool for this wonderful bragging character. He is harmless and nobody believes in him, but he is not glowing and will continue anyway. If you have such a boy, there is no challenge, because the details are not steadfast. Of course, in this episode, a group of aliens who do not have a sense of humor and do not believe everything they hear will be taken on board a spacecraft. They don't have their vocabulary. As it turns out, he is so weak that he can't handle him; and of course there is a secret weapon. Just look at it to see Andy.
