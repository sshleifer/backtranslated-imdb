In fact, I have more questions than comment. I loved the Z-Boys and the Dogtown lords. First I saw the Lords, then the dock, and although I loved this story, I am curious as to why Sid played an important character, but in the documentary he was not part of the team and was just mentioned by some child they knew. Does anyone know the story? The story of these boys was amazing. I've never experienced a skateboarding track where I grew up, but my kids have enjoyed it. What I saw in local roller parks has invented these boys. I never knew that. When the film showed the competition and Z-Boys did their thing, they put them to shame.
