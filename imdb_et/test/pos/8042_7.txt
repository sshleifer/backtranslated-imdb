This is definitely a high quality film with stylish pain. Concerning movies from Carlos Jackal, Bruce Willis wins the weak efforts of The Jackal with the bloody pulp, then spits on them. I'm a little surprised that this movie hasn't got any more votes, probably "going to bed". Sorry, because this movie is definitely worth it. It's wise and never boring. Look at this, 7/10
