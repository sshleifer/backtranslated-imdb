This must be my favorite movie. The script is sharp and limited by the great Miller and the fantastic Carlisle! Sharp wit, great narrative and Hollywood polishing; a completely immersive movie that is against you bad guys! Stott faces again as a varied opportunity, while Liv Tyler truly wins his other, lighter performances as a thrill of Rebecca! The soundtrack may not be known to you by name, but anyone who has ever seen Top Gear looked at football or saw some TV shows is probably familiar with it, especially because of Craig Armstrong's "Escape", which must allow him to work again! A soundtrack based on the first game may sound like a drama / action / comedy of a costume, but one repetition shows that it is at home when the script is given a drama. <br /> <br /> This movie is that it is not shown enough on television! Where is it? Really great, sharp and stylish - you will never regret it - over and over again! (exits to turn on the DVD player!)
