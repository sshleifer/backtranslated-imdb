I thought it was a very good movie. Someone said it was "sick" so they couldn't look at it. I think if you understand your valued R, then you are ready for nudity and drug use. It's a good story and the actor is amazing. Just can't be proud to appreciate it! It is basically about a mother who does drugs and wants to get clean that she calls a very wealthy old friend and she moves them on her property and crazy things happen. I think it's a drama. I'm just so sick of people who don't like movies because of anguish or nudity. It's the world we live in. You probably aren't happy if you don't see such a movie. And it is rated R. So, it should tell you from the beginning that not all peachy happy rainbows. I liked. I think you too!
