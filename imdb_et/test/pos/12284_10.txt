Most Hollywood movies seem to follow some pre-formulated and highly predictable plot. This movie is not and is a great example of what I look at IFC. <br /> <br /> There's a man, Michael, and his girlfriend left the word. He wants to know what happened. Is he OK? Can he say goodbye? Maybe you could close it. He has not been able to contact Grace and he found that he has made a film asking for help. <br /> <br /> Michael's figures we may need to help him, so he tells us his story when he interacts with his friend (Nadia) to play the role of Grace (girlfriend who left) < br /> <br /> The rear view is 20/20 and it doesn't differ from Michael. Speaking of his story and receiving friends' feedback, he understands his mistakes and how much he values ​​what he has lost. Unfortunately, this is a lesson we all need to learn (or learn) and that is easy to identify. It makes you want to hear more about Michael's story and want to know if he finds Grace.
