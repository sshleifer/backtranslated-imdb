I really started to enjoy this exhibition. It started slowly and was not given the opportunity he had earned. There are so many people in the summer who do not watch TV. I know there are some talent and song competitions, but I enjoy them like many others. Believe it or not, when the American idol is made for the year I miss it. Although it wasn't an American idol, I thought it was potential. I feel bad about singers who really started to grow up on me. I wish they would consider and show it again. I think it was a hasty reversal. My only complaint about the show is that I didn't care much about the judges.
