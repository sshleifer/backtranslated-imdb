Great movie from America's G.I. who leaves the military to marry a German girl who saved her life in the last wartime. She accepts it, but does she do it because she really likes her or can she help her with food and food? Meanwhile, his brother and old friend make up a group of American terrorists called werewolves, which aim to drive away the riders (perhaps you remember the same group that plays an important role in Lars von Teri's film Europa (Zentropa)). James Best, known for his role in Roscoe P. Coltrane's 1980s The Duke of The Hazukard, is shockingly excellent as America. He should have become a big movie star? at this age he reminds me of Warren Beatty. Other key players are also good. Fuller's direction is quite good, using a lot of time (although they are not nearly as complex as they were in Park Row; long periods are more frequent than long scenes with lots of dialogue). The only problem is in the script, as it seems to be for all Fuller movies I've seen. It is not too badly faulty, but it should have been expanded by specifying the main features and script parts. Her husband, Helga, is undergoing a major change, but completely out. Therefore, the emotional center relies on the best of the best shoulders. Fuller would have had to kill the sick mother's film early. I hope it doesn't sound too harsh! He just does nothing in the movie except in bed. He has so few features. But Fuller brings him up when the movie continues. I would have died that David and Helga's relationship would harden. And the movie ends too abruptly and it's not cost effective. They are not really the biggest mistakes in the world (as I described them, they make them bigger than they are). 9/10
