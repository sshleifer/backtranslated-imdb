I lived in this area (Hoboken and Jersey City) for about ten years. This film certainly confirms the feeling of time and place. Dialogue is very good, music is right and scenarios are realistic. As another poster said, it seems almost a documentary. <br /> <br /> I like how these children are humanized, who would probably have been born in Westchester, but fall into the child there. It just so happens that the area is pretty tough. <br /> <br /> They demonize the police quite a lot, but it's expected. I would say that it is all-inclusive. <br /> <br /> This gives the viewer some meaning as to how this idiocy is created and is proportionally blown. Hopefully, Newark's new mayor will progress.
