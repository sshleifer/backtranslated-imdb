After that DVD I saw the floor. It's so wonderful. Not only does Led let Zeppelin take over during the appearances, but also for a few years. It shows only the growth of the band and the growth of their great music. This DVD must be! The DVD is over 5 hours, extras. The extras also have large pieces, some of the bands that appear in Denmark and other promo sites. It contains video material that was sometimes lost, fortunately restored and carefully restored to 5.1 Dolby Digital, under the direct supervision of Jimmy's page! Includes many timeless classics such as Stairway To Heaven, driving to California, what is and should never be, Moby Dick and so much more. Also included are large acoustic songs. It improves all the perceptions that Jimmy Page is not the ultimate guitar legend!
