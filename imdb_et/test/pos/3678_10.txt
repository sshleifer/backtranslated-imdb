When I first bought this movie, I had doubts about it, though it was quite impressive. But after I see it, I'm not losing money. In fact, I would like to spend it again and again on such movies .... Absolute combination of humor, drama, excitement and big issues. That's what makes this a great movie. Okay, some may not enjoy what they see, and some may even turn it off after some time. your loss. This is a great way to deal with the problems we've all gone through in one way or another, and the characters you think you don't want to enjoy the whole movie will be what you really came to love in a short time. Open minded and with a sense of humor and living people - watch this movie, I promise you won't be disappointed!
