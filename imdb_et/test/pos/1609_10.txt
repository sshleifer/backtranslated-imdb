The desire for strange love and fall. A poem about beauty and its perfection, fear and touch. Visconti, Mahler and Mann's Slice. And agonizing Venice. Don't know if it's a masterpiece, a poem or a reflection of the film director's world. This is absolutely "memento mori". exploring the illusion. An old reflection of boundaries, signs and the delicacy of death. The journey in the old room, nostalgic, cruel and wonderful. "Death" is a copy of the direct reality of Orfeu. And it's essentially music. Soft, sweet music like honey or winter light. Like every regret and all the sorrows. Like a shelter in deep loneliness. Gustav is happy. He is a researcher of the last form of God's presence. Beauty, the beauty that gives life to the sense of being a sin and a virtue, a gift of expectation and suffering. He dies because he has the right to count, to believe in the reality of the miracle and his ways. Victim? Not possible! Only Tadzio can give freedom as an insignificant victim. Who saw the sun hope to live in the same situation?
