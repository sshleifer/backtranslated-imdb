The effects of other science fiction and thriller films and stories are evident throughout this film. The movies that come to mind right now are Alien, Aliens and Starship Troopers. The story itself is quite simple and not all of the original, on the winter trip that travels through the space, strikes the landing without a clear life and an "abandoned" geological expedition - except when the lights go out, forcing different people to work with them. Mutual survival while the body counts. Such a film always tends to be fun when it is well done. I believe Pitch Black was well done. The characters are interesting and you want to know more about them, the longer the movie continues, and I think people are surprised to do it and don't. <br /> <br /> Vin Diesel plays Riddick, a stereotypical convicted offender with murderous past, physical ability, high tolerance for pain and comfortably seen in the dark. You know he's about to do the right thing at some point in the movie, because it hints at the whole film that he may have a conscience of things. <br /> <br /> Cole House is an addictive drug hunter who is probably a bad guy compared to Riddick because his character shows himself throughout the movie. It is most likely that he is the most brave when the odds and the firepower are in his favor. A very self-serving character that eventually ends with what it deserves. <br /> <br /> Radha Mitchell plays a co-pilot on a dead ship that has been left out of deep sleep because the ship was riding through a meteor or comment tail. The pilot's death in his sleeping chamber attempts to ground the ship, leading to our discovery of its character with a potentially deadly flaw - the fear of responsibility, responsibility and leadership. His character story in a short period of time is likely to grow the most, because he really grows somewhat convinced, receives and does not sit waiting for the alien aliens gobbled at night. He somehow connects Riddick with an increasingly distant mankind, who in turn respects him for his choices and adherence to them. <br /> <br /> In some cases, this story is what you expect, but I think you are surprised by the characters living in this harassing experience. This movie is an interesting train wreck to watch. Look at this! <br /> <br />
