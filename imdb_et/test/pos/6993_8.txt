It was definitely a "sleeping place"! Much better than I thought! It is never understood that it was a horror ..... and who was the proud, baritone pronounced hunk named Vin Diesel. The monsters of this movie were quite unusual, not the same mill that was a mill-te-up! The end was also great for change, not all "bad guys are bad" !!! I'll give her 2 thumbs up !!!
