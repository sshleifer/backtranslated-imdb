Well, someone who enjoys the road at 120kmph eats McDonalds and runs twenty-four of the air conditioners and looks at Fox News as a non-stop, I found this documentary interesting. One thing I raised when they spoke about North America, I assume that this documentary was Fabrique Au Canadie. For the Canadian bashing, I'll leave it to Bill O'Reilly. <br /> <br /> The consequences of oil depletion will affect everyone, especially those living in large countries in Australia, Canada and the United States. I am sure that green peace is no longer happy with gas, it means no more SUVs, without realizing that people living at lower temperatures may be starving. <br /> <br /> Like someone who has studied the economy, I know that we are living in a world of limited resources. I will provide documentary details to try to present a balanced view of oil depletion. But I study the degree of journalism, this documentary is full of messages - Republicans as warm. What did the Democrats not send to the Vietnamese forces? <br /> <br /> If you intend to submit a documentary about the economy and resources, it is better to leave the political bashing on one side, as this may cause a potential audience member to be completely shut down. Focus on the issue of limited resources. At the end of the day, it is best to open the mainstream minds, because it is not a good sermon to the musky choir. <br /> <br /> I really enjoy the end of documentary films like Fahrenheit 911 and Suburbia, not because of their political prejudice, because they remind us that the world is not so safe. Of course I like to buy, and consumer junk food is not like tomorrow, but when the world ends tomorrow, I'd rather die a rich and consuming live beep. <br /> <br /> For potential document makers, just give people facts and let viewers think. When you try to pack your political views into a balanced documentary, people will start to smell a few miles from the rat.
