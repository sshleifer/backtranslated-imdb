I enjoyed this movie. More than I expected. It has enough activities, intrigues, and locations to make it worthwhile for you. Although I can't see Mark Wahlberg as leader, he's good enough to be a trusted leader and that's OK. The superhero of the movie is Mini Cooper. It has shown that he has the speed, skill and muscle to remove any job. And handle the maniac leader like Charlize Theron's character.
