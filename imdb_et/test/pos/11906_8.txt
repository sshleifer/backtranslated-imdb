The film was better than I expected. I worked with the film for a short while Damien made this movie. Better music would be at the top of this movie. Some music sounds like hippie days. Remember Damien, you have a gangster of gang violence, some of whom might have done it. It was more realistic than blood in the blood. Casting was really well done. Suspectentertaint did a good job in this movie. But if you do not always win. And in my history, this is how it was. I first adapted this movie when I watched it.
