SPOILER WARNING <br /> <br /> We've all heard the "Boy Who Called Wolf" Legend. But when the wolf was a person in today's world. Well, it can be something like Big Fat Liar. The fourteen-year-old Jason Sheperd (Frankie Muniz in the middle of "Malcolm") has always lied to keep himself in trouble. One day he is forced to write an English essay, but it comes to slippery filmmaker Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti) who plans to turn Jason's story into a Hollywood explosive. Nobody believes in Jason when he tells the truth at the same time and he gets to the summer school. But Jason has decided to prove to his parents the truth and to travel with L.A with his friend Kaylee (Amanda Bynes). When Wolf refuses to acknowledge his story, Jason plans to make Wolf's life a living hell. B.F.L. is not a masterpiece, but it's a nice way to spend 90 minutes. I wanted them to do it a little longer, and there aren't so many scams, though they're smart enough (I like the best pool color). I wouldn't have liked it as much as I did if it wasn't Paul Giamatti. He's just having fun. If you have 90 minutes to kill, try it. You can just enjoy it.
