My favorite show all the time! Yes, I thought it was so cool and Larisa Oleynik was the first impression I ever had (AAAAWWWWWW). It was well written, funny, except when he wanted to be serious and just a big show. But since we couldn't keep Nick, I didn't see any episodes after February 1996 and maybe it makes me think more than show. For me, it's more of an epidemic (now that doesn't look right!) To say "goodbye" to someone you love, and you know you never see them again. And I still think it is because, as far as I know, it is not planned to publish this DVD immediately ... yes, life is average! I found it firmly (although an odd episode can be found here or there), but I never liked copies of stuffed rubber copies. <br /> <br /> So much about my sad life: (.... Most of the 7th grade kids don't have the powers like Alex can live these lives (unrealistic - definitely), but then again, how many cities are super - The bad chemical factories that are ready to do something "Advancements DO NOT TAX"? Gee this show was fun to watch! Although I would agree that the diagonals are a little overdeveloped (and sometimes a little politically correct). children for some reason would break into a factory (videotape or something) like a child's version of "Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six" (which a year later I got to the same cause with this series of games) almost a "security" team trying desperately to find "an accident boy "... very middle dudes (at least when I first look at an example ... they seem more sympathetic to me now) .I feel quite sad about Larisa Oleynik who is not sure if she thinks about its role Ã¼bile ... ... but this is what I will always remember him. <br /> <br /> Oh and BTW, the actress who plays Aaron Peirce from "24" is here too as a school trainer or something .... too cool! Maybe he can get the producers of this exhibition to Larissa next season "24". Jack Bauer is my second TV hero and I just love seeing things like that, lol :). Both are placed in California, so I just keep a dream ... I see it now, "Let me have a few minutes with this suspect ... no, I don't need a car battery!"
