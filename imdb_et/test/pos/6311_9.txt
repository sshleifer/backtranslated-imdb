OK, I'm Italian, but there is no Italian movie. I think the plot is very good for 3/4 film, but the final is too easy, too predictable. But this is the only small mistake. The consequences of love, in my opinion, are great sequences, especially at the beginning and on the big track. I'd like a lot of lighting. The best thing is a great and wonderful actress. You know, if your name were Al Pacino, everyone would have talked about this performance. But this is just the big theater of Italian actress Toni Servillo. Yes, someone tells me this movie and this kind of presentation that is too slow, it's so boring, so much by default, but I think these components are a fantastic, right way to describe a loving story for very talented young girls, the Italian actress Anna Magnani , Olivia and the old mysterious man Toni's old daughter. One of my favorite Italian movies.
