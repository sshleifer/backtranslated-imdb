This reviewer thinks the best time to be a child in the 1990s, when cartoons were not heavily censored and talented and creative minds were responsible for some of the best family entertainment that hit the air waves. The best producers of Saturday morning animation were at Warner Brothers Television, who experienced a great golden age with the dream team of Steven Spielberg, Tom Ruegger and Paul Din. Together with serious and dark series like Batman, they also revived natural, extreme cartoons, famous for Looney Tunes. Animaniacs was the biggest hitter with his dark adult humor and a modern celluloid admirer, but Tiny Toon Adventures was so popular that he invented Looney Tunes for a new generation, while keeping that mad-minded and intelligent comedy that can be for every age group, no matter how old. Even when Tiny Tones stretched to the length of the function, how I used my vacation, this longer episode of television series did not seem like a curse that often captures the functions of other popular animated exhibitions. <Br /> <br /> Tiny Toon Gang is a young source of classic comic strips that made the audience laugh in the 1940s and 1950s and is currently learning comic "Tone Degree". Summer holidays have started and every character has an idea of ​​what to do. Buster Bunny (Charles Adler) and Babs Bunny (Tress MacNeille) are launching a water gun fight that will eventually lead to the Acme Acres flooding and both sailing under the Mississippi. Plucky Duck (Joe Alaskey) joined Hamton Pig (Don Messick) for cross-country ride on the world's happiest theme park, but the Hamton family is harder than he imagined. Meanwhile, Elmyra Duff (Cree Summer) tries to bully and squeeze in other stories, Fifi Le Fume (Kath Soucie) tries to go to her favorite skunk star and Shirley the Loon (Gail Matthius) goes to the cinema with Fowlmouth (Rob Paulen). <br /> <br /> Although the spatial length of a movie sounds thin, many directors and scriptwriters are doing well. The best of them is Plucky's unfortunate journey that uses the golden comedy opportunity very well: knowing someone while laughing at their contradiction. Happy is the annoying reaction to all the bad things that happen to him, the perfect mix of script and animation. The story of Elmyra is definitely another to see how a small, almost innocent girl can cause fear for so many jungle animals. The violence of the cartoons mentioned above will definitely come before the story of Buster and Babs, which makes us smile not only because of the fun of the results, but also nostalgically, because Ruegger and the company would probably not be allowed to show half of what they do in this segment. Practically half of this segment is playing parody and respect for Deliverance, including a smart twist on the dueling banjos scene with an unforgettable Tiny Toon Adventures theme song. <br /> <br /> Part of the universal attractiveness of Tiny Tones is that humor turns out to be very intelligent, as it is aimed at wildlife that proves it is not worth the "children's fare" that people seem to strike. The whole segment, which includes the Fowlmouth bad label in the cinema, will entertain the enthusiasts in an ideal way, along with the Lucasfilm THX logo with an additional jaw. This scene has been made so perfect that it should be before each cinema is shown. There are also a few moments of fun at Disney World, the cinema holes and even the Warner Legal Department. The fact that today's cartoons are blissful and un-creative makes these intelligent moments even more valuable because there is probably no other animated series that would go. <br /> <br /> After looking at how I spent my vacation for the first few years, I can say for sure that they don't do cartoons as they used to be. With the current censorship that today's family entertains, it is no wonder whether something is being done again. This review is not only a recommendation of a really smart movie, but also a call from Spielberg, Ruegger, and Din to resume and remember again the magical creation. The Lord knows that the children of the 21st century need something with the intelligence of Tiny Toon Adventures. It's not a simple money fight, it's a great movie full of spirit, crazy chaos and fun.
