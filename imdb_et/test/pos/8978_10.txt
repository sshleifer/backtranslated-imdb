Charlie's Wilson War proves how futile a war can be, especially for people who spend countless hours and financial resources to finance them. Virtuoso's performances and remarkably memorable characters joined the strikingly sarcastic script, which the film constantly invented by Mike Nichols, at the beginning of the year. Politics has never been so fun. <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks) is a Texas Congressman who has been credited with almost unilateral victory over the Cold War. Speaking of a lot of drugs, women and the church, he is also unexpectedly interested in the events in Afghanistan and the fears of the Soviet Union in the 1980s. Gust Avycotta (Philip Seymour Hoffman) Assistance to Refurbished CIA Hidden Mission Expert and Joanne (Julia Roberts), a wealthy society, raises money to give Afghanistan rocket carriers and anti-attack weapons that need serious damage to the Russian army. Finally, by the end of the 1980s, the Cold War ended, and the funds were immediately reduced, thus eliminating aid to all new countries to restore and restore. <br /> <br /> Action is subtle, although it's expected to be more than the cast cast. However, a large part of this should be attributed to a script that will allow each character to be well developed and memorable. And the cheerful help of this credit goes to the novel of the same name that is fun to be honest. Tom Hanks has yet another unrivaled performance, like Charlie Wilson, a man who did so much and still relatively unknown. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Gust, a character that is a viable bofo in both his physical and his cynicism; The unrivaled Hoffman again shows great choices he represents. Julia Roberts is perhaps the only weak link in the film that has a general snobbish character and a non-fine-enough accent. And then the Wilson youth secretaries' jailbait team who despise him to keep him happy. Every cheerful Amy Adams leads every supporting role to its wonderful moments. <br /> <br /> Attacking the Soviet Union was not an easy task, especially considering the many contradictory goals between different political leaders. "Why is Congress one thing and nothing?" inhibits a satisfied politician. "Tradition Mostly," Wilson returns. Everyone seems to want the end of the Cold War, but the blind eye is being drawn to the atrocities in Afghanistan. To motivate Wilson, as well as his main source of finance, Doc Long (Ned Beatty), he is traveling to war refugee camps in Pakistan. Wilson uses strategic ties with the Commissions to raise Afghanistan's funding by a simple order from $ 5 million to $ 10 million, but the Pakistani President is firing for the idea of ​​fighting such a trivial sum. By the end of the Wilson campaign, $ 1 billion will be sent to Mujahedin to shoot Russian helicopters - the first step towards victory, as Wilson predicted. In addition to the scale of the film, the unresolved confusion in Afghanistan has led to even less unknown problems that Wilson was supposed to anticipate. <br /> <br /> During Charlie Wilson's war, the main characters from the United States traveled to Egypt from Afghanistan to Jerusalem, but wherever they go, sarcasm always follows. The film has a surprising amount of comedy, given that political influences are generally serious. Hoffman offers jokes with almost every exchange of dialogue, as Hanks does, of course, with funny woman-in-law ideals. Early scene, where Gust has been routinely guided by Wilson's office, trying to straighten the legal problem with his grandiose gals ("you can teach" to write, but you can't teach them to grow into tits ") reminds me of the routine routine sent from Marx brothers. /> <br /> If the press focuses on drug claims against Wilson, then against the Cold War's major issues and the controversial budget of officials, their help is clear that, by the end of the film, politicians are still attentive to what is really needed. so quick and intelligent, some audience members may not be able to keep up with all the intense events in the dialogue, but, as politicians in ignorance between Pakistan and Afghanistan show, this is essentially the second argument to support Charlie Wilson's position.
