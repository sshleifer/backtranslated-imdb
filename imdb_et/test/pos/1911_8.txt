Blaxploitation classic, this film was a terribly influential rap music "toast" that Rudy Ray Moore performs. Toast is a long funny story that is funny and gives a point and you see how they naturally turn into rapids. For more toast, Rudy Ray Moore and why this movie is important, go to Dolemite.com. <br /> <br /> What leaves us just talking about the movie. This movie packs a lot of fun-joking-jokes-clothes-and-hairstyles bang for buck because almost every shot has some sort of outrageous element or dialogue. It begins when the Dolemites are released from prison to find out who designed and brought him to court. I didn't know that prisons would release people so they could prove their innocence, but that's me, I'm in prison. She is assisted by Queen Bee, the leading prostitute of the Dolemites, and she has run her brothel when she's gone. He has also put all his prostitutes through the karate school, so now he has carat carat fighters. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie in two parts, which is usually an error, but in this case an interesting contrast. The first part I looked at during my lunch break and didn't enjoy it at all. It struck me with a badly done blaxploitation, with a ridiculous story, a shameful finish, I think it makes it sound like there were some crafted, awful places, equipment and dialogue. But I didn't enjoy the fact that it made me feel dirty. Let's be honest, a white guy looking at something that laughs at the equipment and the things the characters say is essentially what is racist: how ridiculously these black people dress up what stupid things they say. I wasn't really enjoying it, laughing or waiting for the rest. <br /> <br /> Later that evening, when I was in "much relaxed", I looked at the rest and rightly loved it. Like Disco Godfather, which I watched a few days earlier, it has its own warmth and sweetness, which makes it pleasant even when it is stupid or violent. The character of Dolemite has its own parody element that makes the whole thing fun and the appearance of many actors who were also in Disco Godfather means looking at group friends who just want to do something fun together. Even bad duplication, karate fighting and everything else makes it much more charming. <br /> <br /> For Dolem movies, it is interesting that they have moral ambiguity that I don't see in other blaxploitationides movies and certainly in very few mainstream movies. There's an African-American woman giving a speech (white) about the mayor, saying, "He's done more for the black community than anyone else." Later, we find out that the mayor is a surprise, corrupt, but I like this film to make this woman basically wrong and not try to redeem her in some other way. There's also the Hamburger Pimp, who is presented with useless junkie and no one is trying to find a redeeming, socially positive corner of what he is, he just is. The Disco Godfather has a religious character Lady Reed plays just as nuts who want to pray for her child who has hopelessly lost an angelic hug. I like the films to make such harshly critical images of people in their community without sugar cover or trying to redeem them to make them more tasty. <br /> <br /> There are many hootworth elements, such as when the Dolemite says, "Go over and let me pass, or I'll pull those Hush Puppies out of their muthatf ** a **." There is Queen Bee, who comes over and answers the phone: "Total Dolemic Experience". And you can't survive (though you might want to cover your eyes) with an expanded naked scene by REPULSIVE Mayor. I'm all blacked up for older men, but even I have borders - and my limits are usually a few miles from most people, so they need to be warned. The DVD that I had was clearly edited, which is noticeable in certain scene scenes and at the end, when killing big Dolemite characters with bare hands obviously excludes the main event. <br /> <br /> When you get a DVD, be sure to follow all three Dolemite movie trailers as they are hooters. I didn't want to look at the human tower, but after that trailer, I saw that I was better. The Dolem trailer also has a scene that I can't remember from the movie when the Dolemite resembles a Mexican-style thug, obviously not going, and the guy slides into the nearby car trunk. <br /> <br /> After looking at the first half, I said I missed it and look at Disco's godfather, because the movies and the story have somewhat improved, but after the real pleasure of the second half, I would recommend watching it on Disco Godfather. it is even more amazing, funny and kind-hearted, and they have these roasters, which, even if you don't understand the roots and nuances of the form, still have something to see. <br /> <br /> --- Check out my website's comments about bad and cheesy movies, Cinema de Merde, cinemademerde.com
