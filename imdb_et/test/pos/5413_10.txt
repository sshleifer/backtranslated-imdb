This movie is a powerful commentary on North American family life today. The story is so well designed that it almost seems to be happening on the street! If you are in some way connected with your family and community, this film will take you and take you home to Travis and will not allow you to leave before making the credit. <br /> <br /> Our imaginary heroes, through a number of innocent circumstances, often involuntarily, lead us through sadness, confusion, and isolation. The Travis family invites us all after a terrible tragedy; Father, Mother, Brother and Sister to Life to Share Their Experiences in a Dynamic Situation That Just Don't Exit. We see all of the above and ultimately the thrilling performances of big players and other players, making this movie an absolute treasure for filmmakers. <br /> <br /> As well done in film as it is usually difficult to find something special, but Sigourney Weaver's imagination of Sandy Travis was outstanding. I would be surprised if others did not feel it like that. <br /> <br /> Clearly 10. Well done!
