I am always surprised that the famous title line of 2001 is also called "also sprach Zarathustra", that no one (someone I have never read) has observed parallels between the film and Nietzsche's famous "Ka sprach Zarathustra". . The idea of ​​a human rebirth for adulthood; the infamous form of the infinitely more advanced creature is the clear part of N. Zarathustra; there is a prominent passage "It is how the camel becomes a lion and the lion becomes a child", where N. describes the first incarnation of the ovary as a child, crossing both the human ascetic and altruistic side (always asking for greater weight on the cam) and the man (lion) dirty, brutal and powerful half. The fact that a song plays during an adult sequence may not be a coincidence. And Zarathustra also said that "man is the rope between animals and the ovary." The film's structure fits this description: short in history like a beast, until we become a real man after acquiring weapons and acquiring the cause, then a long sequence of man (rope as it was) and then a brief glimpse of the overman. Nietzschean is also the meaninglessness of these transformations and the suggestion that external forces caused them; "Zarathustras" makes it quite clear that he has no idea how people can implement these changes themselves, and recommends that we depend on the Zarathustra showing how to "go down. Bowman's psychedelic sequence in the near future may be Kubrick's best 1960s style attempt to portray a mysterious "downfall". <br /> <br /> I know that these parallels are quite wide and almost certainly seen elsewhere, even though I didn't see it personally. I wanted to mention them as for some other reason than to try to dispel the myth that Nietzsche was finally a gloomy philosopher. Few people find that the end of 2001 is gloomy and that I think is Nietzschean explicitly and unmistakably. in particular, the drama of Zarathustra is up-to-date for today. Feel free to ignore my alliance with Nietzsche.
