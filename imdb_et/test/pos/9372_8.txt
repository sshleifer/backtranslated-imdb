"Crossfire" does not remember the fact that all three stars had the first name "Robert", but one of the first Hollywood films dealing with anti-Semitism. <br /> <br /> The story opens with the person we learn later, with a Jewish man named Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene) killing in a silhouette. Pipe smoking police captain Finlay (Robert Young) is assigned to the incident. Former soldier Montgomery (Robert Ryan) comes to the scene of murder and we learn through rebounding that he had met with Samuels in the bar with other soldiers who had left the service after the Second World War. > <br /> According to Montgomer, he and Ballyd Bower (Steve Brodie) said Samuels and Cpl. Arthur Mitchell (George Cooper) Samuels Drink Shop. Montgomery tells Finlay that Mitchell left the apartment for the first time and that he and Floyd soon followed Samuel alive and well. <br /> <br /> Without finding Mitchell, Finlay suspects him of murder. He supports Sgt. Peter Keeley (Robert Mitchum) to help him find Mitchell. In the meantime, Mitchell has marveled at the streets in a wonderful situation. She meets a prostitute at Ginny (Gloria Grahame) bar and strikes friendship. She gives her the key to her apartment and goes to rest there. Unexpectedly, a man (Paul Kelly) appears who is looking for Ginny. Mitchell leaves time and time again to meet Keeley and his palms. Keeley manages to keep her from the police and hides her all over the night. <br /> <br /> From Mitchell's point of view, we find out that Montgomery hates Jews and is probably a killer. Finlay will focus on his research at Montgomery, trying to prove his guilt. His organizers had one of the soldiers, a child named Leroy (William Phipps) set a trap for Mongomery. <br /> <br /> "Crossfire" is considered one of the best "movie noire" genres. In fact, he received several Academy Award nominees, including Ryan and Grahame's best supporters. It was done from a modest budget for about three weeks. <br /> <br /> It has all the classic "movie noire" elements, shadows, low key lighting and a story that mostly plays at night. Necessary "femme fatale" is Grahame's Ginny, who plays a small role but still has his classic "femme fatale". Paul Kelly (in a great bit) played an unnamed character with Ginny chewing and spitting, and was he going to do the same with Mitchell? <br /> <br /> Robert Ryan steals the picture from the brutal Montgomeryna although he wrote his roles for years. Robert Young makes a good low-key detective, but Robert Mitchum has little other than Mitchell-friendly. Others are Jacqueline White as Mitchell's wife, Lex Barker (who will go to play Tarzan next year) as one of Mitchum's soldiers and Richard Powers (formerly known as Tom Keene) as Finlay's assistant. br /> <br /> Director Edward Dmytryk will soon lead the United States Parliamentary Committee because he has communist ties and spent a few years in prison.
