I think this movie deserves 10 out of 10 because it's funny funny from start to finish. The plot is simple and straightforward, but it keeps you looking and so much laughs that you really start to love it. When I saw this movie, I didn't hear much about it and I didn't know what to expect. I thought it was an old female movie type, such as Calendar Girls or something, but it took me quite a surprise. Although I am still a teenager and the film is probably not for my age group, I still found it great and I think people of all ages would like it. I think it's disgraceful that it's not at all famous, and it deserves more publicity to get more people to watch and see what a big movie is.
