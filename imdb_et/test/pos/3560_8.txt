"Gun Can Play" (1967) led by Enzo G. Castellar is a very good pastor of Spaghetti Westerns, especially Leone. The first half is great, which, apart from the opening, which is literally "For Less Dollars", Monco, Colonel Douglas Mortimer and El Indio look into the ghost town and immediately kill the Bounty Hunter, called The Stranger, is absolutely serious, with big bomb attacks (especially on the train) robbery), fast and furious action and nice performance by Gilbert Roland, George Hilton and (who manages well given his poor success) Edd Byrnes. But when the movie reaches halfway, Hilton and Byrnes are joking. It is not very funny and is the weakest part of the film, but it throws everything you have seen in a new light before. You realize that in fact the whole thing is a scam for the western conventions of spaghetti, and afterwards the first half is so well done that you are completely subverting the undercurrent of this fraud. The next is a more obvious parody, even some acrobatic jumps from Brynes, which preceded all these seventy Circus Westerns. The end, the complete sending of "The Good, Bad and Ugly" peak is very well done, because it might have been very silly in other hands. So, a pretty fun Spaghetti West that doesn't take itself too seriously. I recommend this to anyone who likes Spaghetti Westerns.
