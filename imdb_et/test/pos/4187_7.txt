Unfortunately, this movie is left with "curio" status. Many people I have asked, "Did you know that the monkeys made the movie?" usually answer 'No'. When you say this, if you are one of the big numbers, I suggest you see it, but with the following warnings: If you expect Monkey style humor, it's there. It's not just all over the place, like TV shows. <br /> <br /> Yeah, they're trying to break their television board a bit, popping fun, like a bunch of non-teenagers who have been the short end of many sticks. <br /> <br /> No, you don't have to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> No, you don't have to be turned on to understand this. <br /> <br /> If you like classic, you will love all the clipped clips. <br /> <br /> If you like a psychedelic time, you will love some coming. br /> <br /> If you are a Monkees fan, you may feel some of the jabs they are taking in the band's heavy marketing. <br /> <br /> One of my best friends after seeing 5 minutes: "It's a weird movie, man." In fact, it may be better if you do not try to understand it, just sit back and react to it. It's weird, it's funny, it's a bit surreal, it's experimental (still) ... it's a lot of things. In general, this is an experience.
