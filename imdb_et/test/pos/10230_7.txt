I enjoyed this movie. The way these mutants looked with the film's tone is very good. Plus, David Cronenberg when Philip K. Decker was great! This makes me wonder if his personality is exactly the same in real life (except of course the killings). <br /> <br /> I was impressed by the creatures of this film, although this film probably had a small budget, mutants / creatures / monsters seemed superb, especially since 1990. This is definitely a unique film and not a mess. This makes me want to read a short story based on. This is an interesting film because it shows how people can be monsters and "monsters" are against humanity.
