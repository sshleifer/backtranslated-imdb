The theme is World War II, and Robert Ryan has been rejected by Lupino as an employee. He's a widow of war. <br /> <br /> The set is limited, but it works. Robert Ryan is at odds: at one point he looks nice, then confused where he lives. At first Lupino tries to help her. It looks like he's worried, but something more dangerous. But how do we know? Relationship builds. I really like movies based on the human element in the mid-term review. What is this man capable of? There are some scenes with O.Z. Whitehead and Dee Pollock as an annoying grocery boy who sees something wrong. We think he will be helped, Ryan will turn again. He is like a Jekyll / Hyde character and finally pursues a knife. <br /> <br /> Watching these two great actors is worth it. 9/10
