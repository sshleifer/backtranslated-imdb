If you liked this movie, be sure to check out other Hrebejk-guided movies - you are a treat. Unfortunately, it's not his best, but still a million times better than the average movie of a regular movie. He explores relationships, especially abusive, with some powerful and sweet moments and great exhibitions. Some plot contradictions, clich√©s and hollow moments violate the overall effect. The previous reviewer and his comments on Czech psyche: an interesting approach, but I don't see this movie becoming a Czech blocker. These people are rather spoiled by their filmmakers (see also Sverak's, Gedeon's) and it is a bit behind.
