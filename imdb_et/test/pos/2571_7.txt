"The Black Snake Moan" is a rugged symbolism by the writer-director Craig Brewer that part of me felt that the whole film was being left unfair - a southern sermon that has some oh-so risky subjects. The film also has a heavy spiritual subtitle in which religion is involved in the image - again it is integrated without nuance. After the darker scenes, the film is increasingly discovering its edge until all the output comes from the artificial quality of the performance (and I admit that in the last 15 minutes, I find myself happy in the end of "Happy Ending" territory). And it doesn't talk about the musician Son House's archive material about love and death (and of course the things that arise naturally). Yet these inconvenient ways are the kind of "Black Snake Moan", the story of an aging Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson), recently leaned on by his wife (his brother, not the least), who are dying almost nympho Rae (Christina Ricci, who gives the lightest view of celluloid) trash can); feeding a girl to health, chaining her to her radiator to overcome her demons and hopefully redeem her own fallen. While there is a definite firm appeal to watch Ricci fall out of his dirty outfit, his performance is risky and mature - not a trace of Wednesday's Addams find, and he just keeps his with Jackson, who personages the "blues" of his portrait of a faulty, godly man. The heavy-handed scene where Lazarus sings Rae in the midst of a mute noise / blackout is powerful, just as the scene inside a jumping blues club that makes you want. The provision is strong and can make a written symbolism (chain, radiator, strange blurry person who grabs the Rae Libido) a case of deliberate growth of vegetation and spirituality. And this is the conviction that this spirituality is played by borrowing "Black Snake Moan" most of its strength - Jackson and Ricci's dedicated performances change the film that goes well from shear to upgrade to seamless grace. Though Justin Timberlake's jealous lover is a plot contest, I could have done it without it, both he and the sledgehammer's fineness can't be regarded as an enchanting meditative film.
