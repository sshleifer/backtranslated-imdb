As a young servant, when it came out, I was completely involved. As an adult with the current sexual obsession in American culture, it does not have enough nudity called Tamek. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for American Pie-type lewdness, vulgarity or fart and feces of fun, meatballs are disappointed with impunity and a guarantee. <br /> <br /> If you like Bill Murray and you like good clean fun, you probably like this movie and enjoy it very much. Like Stripes, Ghostbusters, Caddy Shack and so on. <br /> <br /> Sufficiently said, just go look and finish its intellectuality. It's meatballs to pronounce! Why Review? Just enjoy it and have fun. And ignore talking to others in the trash. Movies, like many other things in life, are subjective. Everyone has their own. <br /> <br /> Always beware of an "expert" who reduces the taste of others.
