This movie is a real action at its finest, it doesn't improve. This is one of those movies that can be easily kicked back and watch some really good stops and finishes, and there are also some great features. My favorite is one bad guy who breaks into this old pair and steals a TV or something and he goes to them and shouts, "I came here anytime I like!" and just before he jumps out of the window, he "Anytime !!!" I mean it's just classic stuff, so you have a choice, you can see that crappy Will Smith is trying to go to the movie or you can watch one of the masters Charles Bronson !!!!
