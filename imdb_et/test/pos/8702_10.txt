Subspecies are always the best vampire films. they have something that makes them special, because I think that is when you look at them. <br /> <br /> They are set today and feel like in 1700. s or 1800 thinks there is something to do with the set that is used, if it is, it will keep this guy :). <br /> <br /> What happened in the first part - Radu was supposed to have been killed by his father a year ago and he has decided to come back and take what he thinks is his birthrest. the blood stone and all his father are killing his father, played by Angus Scrimm (the high man of Phantasm films). takes a stone of blood that is powerful, who ever possesses it, because who ever needs it, because this stone is supposedly meant to be holy by the saints, and every time Radu takes it away, it slowly goes crazy. (that's all we need for a crazy vampire like a normal vampire that's not bad enough). well Radu's brother Stephan tries to stop his evil way, trying to stop himself with a tourist who is staying in his friend's friendly house / fortress. <br /> <br Well one thing leads to another and the two brothers have come into contact with each other and you have to look at the movie to see what's going on here. <br /> <br /> I'm watching / commenting on other queues soon <br /> <br /> The difference between this and the buffer is buffy is too commercial, and it's not that it doesn't like everyone, but it's an atmosphere which is much better than buffy, though Radu doesn't look as good as a miracle full of Sarah Michelle Gellar :). <br /> <br /> The rating of this film is a good example of how a vampire movie should be made :). <br /> <br />
