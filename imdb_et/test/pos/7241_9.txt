Although it is not as good as the reported murder, which was not only delightful, but almost surpassed the book, it is a great adaptation. And you know what the enormous improvement of the Geraldine McEwan version is. Now I'm not proud that Geraldine McEwan's adjustments are bad, two or three of them were surprisingly good, but others started well, but destroyed the scripts, the confusing final solution, or both. Geraldine McEwan's version suffers from a lot of the above-mentioned problems, and I think the second worst is ITV adaptations, the worst being Sittaford Mystery, which for its own purpose proved to be boring and confusing. Adapting this book to Nemesis is a tremendous improvement; it not only respects the book, despite some freedom, but it also greatly improves the ITV version. Regardless of Lionel's added character, which is quite irritating, more relevant to how he was written than how he acted, and one or two moments of slow pace, it is good as a proper book adaptation. It's beautifully filmed, with nice photography and periodic detail, and music is always great. The performances are wonderful this time and use a well-made script, as Joan Hickson is brilliant as always as Marple and solid appeal by Liz Fraser, Helen Cherry, Joanna Hole and Anna Cropper. Margaret Tyzack is outstanding but cools and moves like Clothilde. In general, it is worth looking at, better than the latest version in quite many departments. 9/10 Bethany Cox
