This new part of the child's play series does not contain one scary scene, but tons of fun jokes, like Chonni's witness, giving her a finger and saying "rude doll" and a lot of references to the series: "you can kill me, but I'll be back. I'll always come back. The title of the movie was probably thought of and written before the script, which is completely different from all the other films in the series, not even Andy, who is the central character of all the previous ones, and it seems that Chucky disturbs the characters of another movie, a soap opera that is about Two teenagers are married, there is one cool complex death scene that includes broken glass and water everywhere. The film is very gentle, very funny and has pop culture references from Martha Stewert to Jerry Springer. DO NOT IT BEFORE THREE THREE USES. Effect because first is really scary. Many innocent joy fun and stupidity. <br /> <br />
