As this film opens, you will begin to know the existence of human life. If you carry questions with you, the inner war, unresolved puzzles about the meaning of life, you will feel this film with the cunning of every body. Charles Darwin begins the war with a completely predictable end. War with God. His theories resemble the fact that God has nothing to do with humanity, nothing to do with the amazing world we live in. Savage, harsh, ironic and chaotic, these words surround the material truth of the universe thrown into the universe, which slowly pushes hope to God, in his mind. Nevertheless, Charles Darwinina still sees miracles and beauty beyond God in the universe of infinite Evolution.
