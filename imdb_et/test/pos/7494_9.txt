It's a fucking good movie with some surprising twists, good light and a great script. Only a few foolish bits like Rasta's hit-man scene (this man is professional?), But it's already commented. The fact that I had only heard one man at work mentioned it earlier and there were not many opinions or comments that made it even more interesting. It gets more points than maybe some people think it deserves, but I have to consider low budget and effortlessly. That sick of me, some movies are getting, whose budget equals small country's GDP, mortgage, good reviews, Oscar winning director and / or actors, and turn out to be so disappointing when participants forget about their roles Sandra Bullock was able to drive a bomb-laden bus what was so great that the predicted plot lines and strokes are so big. (Examples in my opinion are Terminal, Castaway, Matrix: Revolutions) Extra points are given to the wardrobe department by choosing a lover of great clothes, especially Paulina Porizcova, who is wearing a rubber dress in one scene, and a jacket "c * eg" on the back in capital letters in the second! your tight ass and good soundtrack, adds bonuses! And PLEASE, with enough Tarantino comparisons, it didn't remind me of Tarantino flick .... and Tarantino borrowed virtually any idea he's ever had from other movies! opinion, do we say that if a film or book is written or directed in one way, no one can ever use the same idea - to become real.
