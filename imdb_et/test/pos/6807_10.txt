I'm 13 years old and I am writing this review of my mother's login. He will write his review later. <br /> <br /> This is my favorite movie of all time. It was filmed in England in 1944. I watched it so many times when I was little to record a video tape. I love this movie and it changed my life! Beautiful landscapes. Powerful pie-bold horse. A small Irish village where a young girl who wanted to do what no other girl ever did compete in London with her national resurrection horse The Pirate. It all made me want to ride horses (which I've been doing for 7 years now) and learned everything I got about my breeds so I can draw and paint. It is a groundbreaking film that has won against all odds, overcoming its fears, believing itself and achieving difficult goals. Also, the horse racing scene was one of the best ever made and I've seen many movies with horse racing. I'm not bothering watching this movie. All this is perfect. Especially if you're a young girl and passionate about horses!
