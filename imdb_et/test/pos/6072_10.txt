Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas) is in a critical scene in the Cave of Swimmers, where she writes something that Hana (Juliette Binoche) read out loudly, saying that "the light is now gone and I am writing the darkness ..." The phrase of such poetic beauty could not be ideal for the cinematic glory of a hostile English patient. With such dramatic sweeping that keeps each other firmly on their feet and the power of a movie that doesn't let up, this movie proudly celebrates the secrets and romances of World War II with some of Casablanca and Lawrence Of Arabia with some with an element of independence in the form of Tuscany. <br /> <br /> The English patient pulls the heart trajectory unabashedly and takes us through a mysterious first act, a romantic second act, and a beautiful ... beautiful final act, and it's not just a wonderful tempo and setting, Ralph Fiennes's performance, which keeps us sympathetic even when Count Almásy turns out to be a very unlikely start Usually he writes as a villain, he shows that man is a desperate love he has to fulfill, foolish, but ultimately human. <br /> <br /> Many people criticize this movie on the basis of "adulterous adherence", but those who do not know anything. The contrasts between the two periods (before and after the initial crash) are remarkable because the patient is an unfortunate person who suffers from what he did, the evil he had ever missed, while before the crash there is an individual like someone else, he wants this woman, but he does not have it, Fiennes brings Almásys a human character in no way an actor. Couldn't have a better actor. <br /> <br /> So please take these comments to heart, watch the movie, those who call it "boring" or "despicable" know nothing and should be ashamed of the one-dimensional view of the film The view that they have not learned or corrected and is unlikely to make a correction. The English patient is the best of every film that has ever won the best picture of the Oscar, and for so many reasons are hidden in their poetic triumphs.
