This is one big, sprawling film you remember for a long time. It concerns history, America, the changing times, Teddy Roosevelt, Morocco, the abducted American and his children, and the Berber leader with the Prophet's blood in his veins. <br /> <br /> The movie is based on a real story - as Jesse James was a banker. In Morocco, America and Marines were kidnapped to rescue him on Tripoli to save him. So much. You know Hollywood. Sean Connery is Berber's leader and Muslim leader. Candice Bergan is a man kidnapped with two children; son is Rex Harrison's grandson, Simon, not less. John Huston is a state secretary with a large John-Huston straight line at the state dinner. Brian Kieth is Teddy Roosevelt, an all-American, all-male, character that is an interesting commentary today. <br /> <br /> Next to the beauty and beauty of the desert and Morocco is the cinematic film that remains with you, a haunting and delightful memory. The result is as extensive and exotic as pictures. <br /> <br /> This is a story of two cultures, both great ideas and a historical past that fight for the future without ideas from each other. In any case, the struggle is that it can be inventive. <br /> <br /> Then the last little boy - remember a little boy? What do you think HE thinks?
