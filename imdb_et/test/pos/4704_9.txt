It is indeed a documentary about love for excitement, vitality and extended family. The filmmakers spent three years recording their sister Helen on their side of the house and managed to capture so much wonderful material that you can't help but feel you know Sister Helen and her "boys". The house has 21 renewable addicts, each with a story almost like Sister Helen. Final scenes are especially involved and emotional. <br /> <br /> The story of Sister Helen's marriage, addiction and disappearance shows a very complex character who is always tough, touching and loving. <br /> <br /> The film is amazing as it tells its story about the wonderful living creatures that evolve into a story that is almost as clear as each scene would have been scripted and worked best. "Customer" honesty (and obvious dishonesty) is very inclusive when you learn their fears and watch their aspirations grow. <br /> <br /> You will never forget Sister Helen, Robert, Moet or the bad Ashish (spell?).
