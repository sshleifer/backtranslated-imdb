The Chaser War is all about weeks showing guys who brought you CNNNN and the chaser decides where weekly 5 chasers and firth burst problems that we didn't know were important. <br /> <br /> The exhibition goes beyond the mere satirization of politics and television, because it is not afraid that mickey will be taken out by anyone, be it a subway or even an Australian prime minister, and although it may be familiar to American TV on Chaser War is not the smartest, most fun, and the most entertaining show on Australian television, and if you haven't seen it, you owe it to yourself.
