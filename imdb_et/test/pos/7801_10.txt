Andaz Apna Apna is a movie that I treasure and this one movie, I don't want to see anytime ... well almost any time! This movie is just wonderful and I find this more fun movie I've ever seen. And yes, I put it on Hera Pher ... cause? Hera Pher has scenes you look at, but Andaz Apna Apna? Not possible! Just because every scene is the scene you need to look at! Aamir & Salman has a great chemistry and they are perfect in their shoes, but I put the characters in the order of preference: <br /> <br /> Ranking # 1 Gogo (Shakti Kapoor's best score to date and yes, this Gogo is an innocent character who belongs to the well-known Mogambo family (Mr. Indian celebrity), the offender Gogo is actually a nephew of Mogambo, but for Mogambo he is more than a responsible, beautiful, charismatic charming son. Gogo makes the biggest mistake in giving life to 36,000 rupees (who is like Balla never said, "Fraud and Fraud!") Gogo's sole purpose is to get back on her and her lost money on the recovery journey, Gogo realizes that more than 36,000 are needed, which she must achieve and thus start ... /> <br /> Ranking # 2. Tea (Main Tea Hoon, Mark Idhar Hai!): Tea is the evil character of Ram Gopal Bajaj, originally named Shyam Gopal Bajaj, who decided to change his name The tea, as the child was always envied his brother and then one day, he turned worse when his father gave all his wealth to Ram Bajaj. Teja decided to kill her father, but Munshi Harish Chandra (Rave's father) was killed in the dark at night, although Teja does not regret her actions. The only task now is to get your property back and start your own farm of poultry and households. The tea must also return the loan to Gogo (but it has no intentions). To achieve its evil goals, Teja works with two people: Robert (Vijay Khote, who has a very good goal) and Balla (Shahzad Khan, Ajit's clone and son ... who is a very smart boy!) <Br / # <br /> Success # 3. Amar (Aamir Khan): Wants to marry a wealthy heir to Raveena, so she sells her father's inexpensive cabin and leads to Mumbai. Amar has no problem with taking care of a big company, which Raveena's father gives her after the wedding and is ready to sacrifice her happiness and, if necessary, the transition to London. <br /> <br /> Ranking # 4. Prem (Salman Khan): After Gogo, Prem is the second most innocent character who appears in the movie and how Amar tries to use her in a friend's mask is tragic. <br /> <br /> I won t show more signs because Jesus Christ! I just wouldn't stop writing! The movie is absolutely stunning! Go and get a DVD now and avoid these inexpensive VCDs because they have left many good scenes out of the movie. <br /> <br /> Background music is a plaque and action is better than a matrix, especially the final meeting between Prem and Crime Master Gogo (beware of it), it will appear at the peak. Andaz Apna Apna is also a drama with many negative and positive characters and teaches us a lot about life and values ​​and ethics. It teaches us for bravery (why else Amar Premil asked them to stay with the kidnapper, even though Prem complained he had to go to the toilet?) Andaz Apna Apna is also a tragedy, especially scenes where Salman is directed to Amir and has been given a stomach irritant Pills overdose, where Teja reveals her sad feelings about why she couldn't go to London and where Gogo was arrested at the end without even returning her 36,000 people. Andaz Apna Apna is a complete package .... sit and enjoy the ride! But that's another race after that ... and then a third! <br /> <br /> The movie was then seen as a flop and I bet someone didn't like it but put the boys! This movie is a big hit! Even if it doesn't have enough people in the theater, the movie is one of the most sold home video DVDs and one of the most common movies on most channels, so the producers have laughed at their banks long ago!
