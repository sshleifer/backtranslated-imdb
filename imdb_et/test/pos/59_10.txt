I always felt that Mrs Merkerson had never met her skills. It looks like millions of law and order leader and is seen in many theater publications, always in a supporting role. HBO Lackawanna Blues changes it and allows this talented actor to shine at Nanny, a successful entrepreneur in a world that is becoming segregated for integration. But this story is actually a colorful set of characters that he and his adopted son meet in the suburb of Buffalo, New York, Lackawann. <br /> <br /> The story can be placed in any major African-American community in the 50's and 60's from Atlanta's Sweet Auburn to New York's Harlem. However, the angle of segregation-integration is only in the colorful life of people living in a dirty boarding house. The story revolves around Nanny's relationship with all kinds of people in some of the best entrepreneurs in the business (I didn't mean to say black actors - this band is a stunning set of talents who are black except Jimmy Smits of course) recommend this movie as a fun and colorful look to the past day.
