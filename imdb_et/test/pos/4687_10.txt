I looked back on this series in PBS in the eighties and still look back on the old tape a few years later. Sometimes it is very obvious and horrible. This is a very good example, as the characters are all well defined and functioning. You've pulled the plot and have to take care of these people. The crooks are almost ridiculous, especially the sheriff of Nottingham. Man, I'd like to kick off this s-t for this brilliant little bastard. Nicholas Grace is doing a great job and has a great time on the sheriff. His boy, Sir Guy, is equally angry, but also pathetic. Lots of murder and chaos in this series with tons of black magic and devil worship and such kind of things. I noticed that it received a prize for children's television, which is surprising. If I had kids, I wouldn't let them watch it. Also excellent use of the locations of this exhibition. Now it's on a DVD so go out and buy.
