That's pretty good. The terrible need of every mutually wise people (i.e., all of us!). The trailer does not give away any plot for good reason. <br /> <br /> The premise is absurd, so it's nice to see that it doesn't take you seriously. It's like someone from the BBC Children's Department decided to make a movie for adults. The IMO is not that bad. <br /> <br /> 7/10
