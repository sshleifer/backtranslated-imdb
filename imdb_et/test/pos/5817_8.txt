Minnie and Moskowitz are the most pathetic and invulnerable love story I've ever seen. Minnie, a disgruntled curator of a museum whose abusive married boy casts her down and leaves her even tougher and confusing, and Seymour Moskowitz, a carer, so desperate to spend her nights driving to bars and restaurants that make people more difficult from the start chaotic and frustrated game. Just as many pairs we see every day. <br /> <br /> Almost every love story is a man and a woman, a man is confident, funny, either classically hot or attractive in his own way, whose flaws are charming, and a woman wounded with a soul who may have one man he wants who chooses this boy because there's something. These films make everyone feel so good that the characters embody what every man and woman wants to be, not what they are. Minnie and Moskowitz, in the sense of romance, represent any fantasy clue, but depict people who may simply be more common than attractive, confident people with so much experience in this field. What is the stupid, worryingly uncomfortable story of the lack of life and the lack of work we all have, or a woman who is so insecure that it's hard to talk to her? <br /> <br /> The film is not as exciting as Cassavetes' faces or opening evenings, but it has the riveting quality that Cassavete always struggled so hard to portray an unlimited image of people under the ego that hides in almost all other films. Gena Rowlands and Seymour Cassel, who offer amazingly gracious people, are hardly pleasing. Moskowitz almost takes us crazy, not to mention Minnie. He puts himself so forcefully in his life, the dates are an explosion of our inner voices, reacting to the unpleasant inconvenience of the times we have all been, the rejection we have all swallowed, and the arguments we all had that we know were our own mistakes. I admire a movie like Minnie and Moskowitz, because because the brand is the beads of Cassavete films, it recognizes 100% honesty with us. Our egos play no role with their characters, so the actor has achieved tremendous achievement.
