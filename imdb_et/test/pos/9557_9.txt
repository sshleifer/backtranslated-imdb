"Best in Show" is definitely the most entertaining and deepest film by Christopher Guest. The characters are perfectly depicted, and linking the pet to the owner adds a new level of comedy to the film. I've been a fan of the guests since Spinal Tap, but in this movie he has really achieved what he did "gloomy" with the genre he invented and is now perfect.
