After his earlier film "Videodrome", which certainly shows similarity to this film, director David Cronenberg is once again a virtual reality in a world of truth and fiction. This is a virtual reality that has been brought to the next level. <br /> <br /> "eXistenZ" is a very original film that is well targeted and well-written, but above all very well written. The film has an enchanting and thoughtful concept led by David Cronenberg. <br /> <br /> "eXistenZ" is a movie that always makes you feel stupid. Just when you thought things were excluded, another surprise is waiting around the corner. Things are never the way you think they are, especially when truth and fiction are proven. You never know what the reality is and what the game world is, until the end. It makes the characters and events very unpredictable and also offers a movie endlessly, leaving you even more to think about. <br /> <br /> The film has a perfect gameplay narration, mainly featured performances and puzzling events. First of all, they must complete a certain step or task before they can continue in the world and find out what their purpose in the game is. <br /> <br /> The film knows how to create the perfect balance between realism and surrealism. without ever having gone over each other. Storytelling keeps the movie as simple as possible, although of course the movie is not always easy to follow due to events, dialogues and unusual environments. <br /> <br /> The film is not just strange. I was actually surprised that the videodrome is higher here, I thought it was a much less accessible and "strange" movie. The film is still entertaining and with good speed. It will never allow the film to withstand its philosophical moments and deeper meanings. It also makes this movie completely traceable to people who usually don't watch such a movie. <br /> <br /> The film has a good look, with a fine, effective special effect, an excellent visual look that also provides the movie with a certain sense of “gaming”. <br /> <br /> The film is well cast, in the role of Jude Law, which you do not often see as a shy insecure person. He once again shows how a versatile law actually is as an actor and that he is more than just a real face from Hollywood. Jennifer Jason Leigh was also a big female leader. He has never really played so many big parts in big productions, but with this film he shows why he has always been a big movie star. The film also includes other well-known actors, with much smaller roles such as Ian Holm and Willem Dafoe. <br /> <br /> A very original movie worth watching, especially if you have seen videodrome before. <br /> <br /> 8/10
