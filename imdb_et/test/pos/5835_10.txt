A rare series of life in Oz - an experimental prison where they try to restore prisoners. There is gay sex, rape, torture, distortion, killings, humiliation, tons of male nudity ... all of your face and full force. <br /> <br /> It is also just one of the best written dramas on television and almost all of the participants are just big. Because it was a cable, there were no restrictions on what they could say or show. There are many racist comments here, but it is for all competitions. In fact, white characters come quite badly (especially the Aryans) and black characters come better (Muslims who love peace). The Spaniards do not have a strong role and are not at all Asian prisoners. All prisoners seem to be upside down and want to kill someone for a moment, but you still know some of them. Even prison guards, counselors, and doctors have serious problems. <br /> <br /> I heartily recommend that you rent - don't buy it. I have a whole collection and quite frankly I don't think I ever want to see it. It is an incredible TV, but so gloomy, dark and frustrating. I think I have to sell it all online. <br /> <br /> I'll give her 10.
