As it turns out, Chris Farley and David Spade only made three movies together ("Coneheads", "Tommy Boy" and "Black Sheep"), but it was really a "citizen" of these couples. Farley plays Thomas Callahan III, who is the successor to the auto parts business. His father Big Tom (Brian Dennehy) hires Richard Hayden (David Spade), a groom who is groomed. Big Tom marries "Ten" (Bo Derek) so everything has to be fine. After Big Tom's sudden death, Tommy and Richard must try to sell half a million cars to save the company from bankruptcy. Since then, Chris Farley has been completely excited to do what he does best: do all the mess. <br /> <br /> When this movie first came out in theaters, I saw it with my grandfather. He thought early that the characters of Bo Derek and Rob Lowe would hide something. But you can completely ignore it and just relax at Chris Farley. There is nothing safe on her stomach and there is no rage in hell as her happy-happy attitude. The scene in which his cars fire, and later the deer scene, make a clean laugh. Chris Farley and David Spade were really John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd of their time. It's a pleasure to always think of "fat boy in a small coat" over and over again.
