Cowboys and Indians are a great movie. Writing, acting, and managing could not be better. It was a story that asked me to say, and this group of talented people and teams did this great job. Such stories are not pleasant, but they remind people of the social injustice that exists throughout the world. I hope that when this movie is seen, the attitude and prejudices will change. The film that can do this is a rare special thing. Andrew Berzins is an excellent writer and his talents and knowledge in this field came through this film. <br /> <br /> Thanks for this story! <br /> <br /> Ruby
