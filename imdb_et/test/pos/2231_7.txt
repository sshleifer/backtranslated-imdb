There is a good run on the silk price tag. At the Bimbo office, it shows a good price for $ 22 (near the label). Later, Mary Astor finds a tag in the boss's bedroom (proof that bimbo slept with her). Later, Mary Astor starts communicating with Ricardo Cortez, looking at her silky negligee price tag ($ 14) and reminds her how she was outraged at bimbo, as well as the fact that she spent $ 8 less than the "most obvious" woman she ever met. It sounds obviously moral, but it was well done. The film would be stronger if Robert Ames' character had been played by a more powerful actor (he is too low a key for a salesman and he spends most of his film than his face away from the camera) and if Ricardo Cortez was given more than an ironic smile. Both male leaders are blissful and forgetful and are blocked by the popular pancake makeup of this film era. But the character of Mary Astor is interesting, appealing and credible. Behind closed doors is worth it.
