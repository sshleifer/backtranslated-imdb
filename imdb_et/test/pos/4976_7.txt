It is always interesting to try to draw a film that is somewhat prophetic for the actor's future. In this case, I was interested in Edward G. Robinson's statement to Barbara Stanwyck - "I promised you the valley" as he says that the individual keeps his attempt to control the whole country in Logas. Ten years later, Stanwyck celebrated the Barkley family as "The Big Valley". Somehow I thought he would have seen a parent in an earlier picture. I think all these brilliant gowns and fancy riding gear are the way to bring out your youthful side. <br /> <br /> As for my summary above, this is Lee Wilkison's assessment of John Parrish (Glenn Ford), one of them Earlier, when Parrish uses his knowledge of military tactics to take out several Wilkison hands when they rob your ranch and burn your home. I liked how the film explored his character, starting with how he treated Master Wade Matlock (Richard Jaeckel) at the calculated showdown. There was also a smart maneuver for the shelter, as opposed to a strategy whereby bad guys attacked and both sides were fighting against the latter. To do this, Parrish also had something to say - "Never answer an enemy on your own terms". <br /> <br /> "Violent Men" is a good title for this movie and probably in the middle of the 1950s, the head of this class will not come close to the blood of today's standards, promising to find "Tombstone" or "Open Range" where the balls are exactly disgusting. But it has been designed with subtle performances by principals, where the downstream examines the infidelity that seemed almost ironic, given Stanwyck's character who was cheating.
