JFK Jr. it is very difficult to find new information and this fine movie was very little but it was a pleasure to watch. The casting was very good and the script, although somewhat similar to the documentary, was also good. My only complaint was that it wasn't long enough. Perhaps a two-part film could have told us more about his "pre-George" days and his relationship with mother, sister and other relatives. Some of the book's materials, "American Son," Richard Blow, would have greatly enhanced the film. WTBS should be praised for creating such an entertaining film.
