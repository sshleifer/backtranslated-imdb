I know many people have said that you do not bother about this movie because it is not a good fight and a hard subtitle. It's really a lazy way to think about a movie. If you want to focus on the part of the movie you should find, find something else and learn about cinema as an art form that is a masterpiece. If you want to see it, it's not really a fight. Sometimes there are good fighting scenes, which are filmed quite well with good camera work, but the story itself is what keeps the story together and plays an important role. This is not Kung-fu's main film. The story is really central, not in the struggles, and the combination of the two makes a great movie that is worth watching and even better with subtitles in the original language.
