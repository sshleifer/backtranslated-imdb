My wife and I watched this wonderful movie tonight because we look at Russian dolls tomorrow and the first is important to see before you. <br /> <br /> We both loved Spanja's apartment and enjoyed some signs thanks to our first years of life - now St. In Pertersburg, Russia. We both identified a bit of a story with harsh frameworks, because we were pupils to us, Florence Italy, so the script wasn't completely strange in our early life. Our lives were very different, but like this movie, every time they throw young people who go through the same stages of life as all the advanced people, they experience a lot of the same life situation. <br /> <br /> Collecting people and the personal difficulties they faced were universal, and it is the beauty of this movie and probably the sequence I see tomorrow. As I wrote, both us and these situations are all familiar to us and therefore we can enjoy our lives for a while. It has to be one of the great strengths of the film, allowing the viewer to experience the emotional upheavals of the people involved and still be left aside. Through this distance, the viewer can think of himself, "I wouldn't have done anything like this" or "I would have avoided this trap". Maybe that's why we go to the movies.
