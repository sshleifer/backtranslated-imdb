"Just before dawn" is one of the best slasher movies. It is very realistic and atmospheric. It reminds me of the Tobe Cooper "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "Deliverance" .Deborah Benson very good is played by the heroine and director Jeff Lieberman, who has created great horrible and dark movie. "Just before dawn" is a beautiful shot and the soundtrack is very disturbing. I've never <br /> <br /> loved slasher movies or gore except it. Very impressive and convincing film (at least for me)
