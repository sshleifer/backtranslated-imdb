After the Second World War, Phenix City was even worse in Alenama, which has encouraged the army base on the Georgia River. Gambling, prostitution, borrowing and the like helped organized equipment in the city. Soon it was too bad and even violent to tolerate. This movie is based on a real story about this fight. <br /> <br /> According to the standards of the 1950s, it was shockingly clear. Although it is a small budget, it helped with a small budget of realism that requires location. Very sharp film. Richard Kiley was wonderful, as always, and John McIntire stiff. <br /> <br /> Why this good movie is not a video, it's a real puzzle!
