The American Submarine Team discovered HELL BELOW in 1918 to fight the Adriatic Sea. <br /> <br /> Although this great war movie offers almost forgetting, it is a form of entertainment thanks to literary performance, great performances and very credible power. Robert Montgomery & Walter Huston play submarine officers under warfare who are in rapid conflict with each other and have dramatic and tragic results. Since Montgomery is in love with the well-played role of Huston's daughter Madge Evans, the situation becomes even more complicated both on the shore and under the waves. The observer is between two strong characters, one of whom is by his heart and the other by the rules. <br /> <br /> Robert Young is a Montgomery friend. Sterling Holloway creates a short, vibrant, portable seaman portrait. <br /> <br /> Eugene Pallette as Captain of the Torpedo & Jimmy Durante when the sub chef makes a very funny comedy team and gives a lot of laughter. Many straps arrive at Durante's nose, and his obsession with an amateur dentist brings some chaotic encounters with British torches. <br /> <br /> Cinematographers know Babe London as an obese Italian miss; Maude Eburne as the Admiral of the British Admiral & Paul Porcas as an Admiral of Italy - everything is unredeemed. <br /> <br /> MGM has given the film absolutely first-class production values, especially for submarine sequences. Both the claustrophobic compactness of the ship and the inevitable tension associated with underwater warfare are accurately depicted. Other unexpected moments of the drama (Montgomery & Miss Evans, who have been hit by a robbed bike on an air strike) and fun (Durante boxing kangaroo) are expertly fortified by the film fabric to provide a completely satisfying viewing experience.
