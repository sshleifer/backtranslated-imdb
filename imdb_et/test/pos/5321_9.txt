I note that the official IMDb review refers to Leland as a sociopath. I believe this diagnosis is obviously wrong. <br /> <br /> This is a film about sadness and the ability of one teenage boy to see sadness in everyday life, because it will wait around every corner before the life that it affects affects. Sociopath is a person who cannot feel empathy for others, and who, while understanding the difference between right and wrong, does not care about this difference. A sociopath is a subject that places itself at the center of this subject, ignoring the influence of the subject's actions on its surroundings. One of the decisive features of sociopath is that a true sociopath has no ability to feel empathy - it has no ability to feel what others know, and does not correlate with changes in the mood of others due to the sociopath acting with them. Sochi cannot feel the pain of others, nor realize that the pain of others is due to the actions of sociopa. Sociopath is a person who is not fully formed. The psychological and emotional makeup of true sociopathy does not play an important role in making sociopa immune to "talking therapy" and other therapies that involve human interaction and the study of personal feelings. Sociopathy is devastating even when a subject is treated and placed in a highly structured environment that is designed to prevent the damage that sociop can do to others. Many sociopedists work more or less normally and never raise the criminal justice system to the radar, although they tend to leave a trace of emotional debris on their awakening. <br /> <br /> Leland Fitzgerald is not a sociopath. He is a person who is blessed (or cursed) with the ability to foresee what he considers to be the inevitable consequences and outcomes of human activity. Leland literally sees the eyes and faces of the people around him, as he slowly absorbs and internalizes philosophy that life is about to disappear, and that people are slowly submitting to the inevitable and unmistakable fact that things are broken up by better metaphors. People who fall in love and who can and do today become "pathetic" elderly couples. Electricity in the eyes of Leland's "mother" (a rich New York society who loves Leland and who calls her home to share her family when she arrives in New York, alone and decided to stay in town) disappears when she explains to her the latter visited New York to find out that her husband had been cheating on her all the time, that she had a divorce, that a heart break would happen to everyone and that such loss was an inevitable part of growth. His eyes still reflect light, but the electricity that once shone is gone. This scene - this explanation, is coming late - is crucial to understand why Leland puts on a seemingly wild, pointless crime (killing his former girlfriend's slower younger brother). Leland knows what this little boy is waiting for - the lifetime of unattainable goals, to teach only words that pose a threat, never know the love of another person, never knows such love and never connects with another person. More than any other character in this movie, this little boy is all about what Leland sees as inevitable and terrible for the world. Leland's act - killing this little boy - is an act of mercy for Leland that has been committed because it was one thing he could do in a world where activities cannot change results. If a true sociopath knows that activities can change and change results but don't care about the damage they cause to others, Leland cares. What most people see as barbaric and dreadful is the only decent thing Leland can do to alleviate the suffering of one person. <br /> <br /> It would be comforting to present. this is an explanation of Leland's action - comforting but incomplete. Because finally, "blame" for Leland's activities is elsewhere. As is so often the case, there is no easy explanation and balm that the resentful soul could apply. Why didn't Leland learn something that even the most pessimistic people admit - that sometimes - just sometimes - people remain in love and that relationships are successful and even the worst life has changed? Leland lacks a centerline, an inner core to which it can be regrouped and reconnected. There is only pain and sorrow. It is a temptation to blame his arrogant and profoundly unpleasant father - a brilliant writer (played by Kevin Spacey) - that he was not at critical times during Leland's development, but given the man's embarrassment that may be a blessing. br /> <br /> Finally, the viewer moved with a huge sense of sadness. Why was Leland understood the world through the veil of pessimism and depression? The character of Leland is mature, for example, when she repeatedly demands that no one blame her girlfriend for break - it is both stoic and heartbreaking. Stoic, because it is completely genuine, despite the warmth of Leland's teacher. But heartbreaking because it was born not as much as despair. Leland's indifference to his fate is only a reflection of the full certainty of his belief that nothing is really important. Something he can't do can change his destiny. <br /> <br /> It's not sociopathy. This is, if at all, its polar opposite ......
