What are movies? I mean ... what are the movies? Shooting? The killings? NO. They are made for life stories and that's what this film does. This shows how life has changed between the two ages. Father and son whose father needs work and asks for help from his son. <br /> <br /> Although there is a second generation, there are some features that also include family conscience. br /> <br /> The main theme in my opinion is the father's love for the son and vice versa. <br /> <br /> The film consists of only one dialogue, but this dialogue is more than I would ever have liked. This movie is pure art! Again, after "Marfa si Bani", Cristi Puiu gives us a new beautiful movie. Well done !
