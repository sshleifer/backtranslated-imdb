and there is not much in the history of cinema. "Rouge" seems to be a bit of a hope. Hope in humanity and life. But to say only this can be naive. Kieslowski can find the right way to talk about this nervous judge and twentieth, but look at the model. Perhaps the old and disappointing love does not repeat - when the young couple is with the new judge after the accident. But what to say about this camera captain? You can't leave another movie because you have to look at everyone and all these faces. Kieslowski loved people, and it is quite obvious how the camera treats. Mrs Jacob and Mr Tringtignant are perfect This is not just a movie, but a shrinking "You Shouldn't Kill" and a "Story of Love" that could think of a modern way of expressing cinema as an artist. The unfortunate American public - the average couldn't see these movies. At least they are not in Maltini's dictionary. And even Baseline doesn't know what to say about this unique person. abel posadas
