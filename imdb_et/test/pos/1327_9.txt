I heard that after the first ocean, the film would come down. I believe this is not the case (at least not for this film). This movie is even better than the first movie! The original team returns three years after the robbery of Terry Benedict's casinos. Now Benedict visits each of them personally and tells them that they will get the money back in two weeks. To do this, they have to do a couple of heists in Europe to get the money. <br /> <br /> Operation is very good. All asterisks have exceeded expectations. Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, and Catherine Zeta-Jones were probably the best in this movie. <br /> <br /> There are some confusing moments in this movie. But that doesn't matter, because there are only a few confusing moments. Anyway, this movie is made just harmless fun. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a great movie. I appreciate this movie 9/10.
