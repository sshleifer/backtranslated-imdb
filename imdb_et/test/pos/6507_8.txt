The deletion of Jazzy Jeff, the creator of Chirp and the transformer of the transformer, raised some eyebrows, but it is good to see that he made it into the DVDs. With SCRATCH, Doug Pray, who had previously crowned the 90's grunge phenomenon HYPEs (1996), made an excellent documentary about the world of hip-hop DJ and the evolution of turntablism. His latest documentary INFAMY (2005) explores contemporary American graffiti culture. After a few views four years ago, my DVD had collected dust, but recently I looked at it again and after the material I was surprised how well this document was made and edited. You also call it an enormously enjoyable soundtrack and not just talkative, but a lot of music, old school materials, parties, dancing. One of the best things about the film is that it is mainly researching where the art of turntablis (today in 2001) is, without of course taking into account pioneers. Good stuff. <br /> <br /> Obscura Camera 8/10
