The theme is banal even in 1942. It's war propaganda. The Fascists are among us and they will do their utmost to sabotage the war aspirations and prepare for their victory and confiscation of power and their effective totalitarian state. But Hitchcock must make it a real thriller. So he discovers the first sabotage that succeeds, but one of the victims, his dead friend, becomes the main suspect and sabotage. It allows him to speak to the country and discover a complicated Nazi organization with acquaintances and support for the ultimate benevolent society and using small, dissatisfied whites to do black work. Chasing the actual saboteur leads our false suspects from Los Angeles to New York and the top of the organization. He meets a blind pianist who believes that his senses do not feel that the cabbage is a culprit, his niece who is the star of the billboards, but also a frantic and fanatical patriot who only thinks about going to the police. Then a rich quarry and its plotters slot. Then, on the roads, it was worthwhile and friendly truck driver and long circus caravan and their dwarf, bearded woman, siamese sisters and some other grotesque of this type. And he discovers a target in Soda City, an electric hood that provides the energy needed for Los Angeles and its war industry. He participates in organized sailing on the USS Alaska warship when it is launched. Eventually, he and his elbows and elbows did not get fat, so that his brother and granddaughter could clean up a lot, most of them were arrested and the first saboteur, Fry, fell from the torch of the Liberty. It doesn't burn under the old electric sparks. But Hitchcock is not yet in his habit of owning personal films in his films, so don't look for him. It is well-built and well-executed, but it's just a propaganda movie with an extra style. <br /> <br /> Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine, University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University of Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
