I've lost hope to see how many times I watched this movie. I am never tired of this because it is a film that can be enjoyed and interpreted on so many levels. they just don't make such movies anymore. <br /> <br /> After the last time I looked at the documentary film (Hearts of Darkness: Crazy Trip), I am even more astonished that this movie was even finished, but it was so big. <br /> <br /> The fact that they actually filmed in the movie movie branches is the biggest asset of the movie. You really feel like your Vietnamese. <br /> <br /> All actors are fantastic when my favorites are still Robert Duvall ("I love morning napalm!") martini bright and great Marlon Brando. <br /> <br /> Many people complain that the film is too endless, weird and near the brain. well, remember what Coppolla said about this movie: "This movie is not from Vietnam, it's Vietnam!" What he thinks is that this movie is MADNESS and not war. <br /> <br /> This movie is based on Joseph Conrad's short "Heart of Darkness" and is set against the Vietnam War, not a civil war as in the book. I think it was a great combination, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> This is a perfect, challenging movie that is dark, violent, humorous at times and well done in every way possible. <br /> <br /> Real Classic <br /> <br /> Rating: 10
