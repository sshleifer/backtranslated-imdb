Though it was dark, frustrating and sometimes difficult to look at, you kept my attention alone and refreshed honestly in your dialogue. It really captured the romantic relationship between teenagers. In addition, the soundtrack was amazing. The lyrics and the tone of the songs complemented the film's sadness so well that it made you feel if the songs were created specifically for the film. <br /> <br /> Jessica Bohl is the best actor I've ever seen. His delightful and credible power made the film. It made me wonder if she really was a prostitute. Who knows. Anyway, this movie was very worth it. Love, your inner! Yes, that's right....
