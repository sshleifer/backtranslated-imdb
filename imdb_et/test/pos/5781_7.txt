Today I have seen several films at the University Art Museum. Sometimes I can't watch more than half of the movies there. I've consistently tried to look at all the things I've forgotten. So far, Plagues and Pleasures have been at Salton Sea and killed an electric car? there are other movies I had to watch in this way. The film has an intriguing theme and is well theoretical (emphasis later) but not as successful as Plagues and Pleasures, but much higher than the Electric Car. <br /> <br /> The film's final thesis is the future of the American concept of urban life. This calls into question the feasibility of this practice, as oil prices are rising. Thus, the film tells about the origins of the suburb and its development until the early 2000s. One topic that the film speaks for a long time is the suburban alienation among its inhabitants. Although several people can live together, they do not know each other when we define this word. This, to me, is the strength of the film: its call for real human emotion. We can understand the filmmakers' argument so much more easily because they do not have to convince us of the legitimacy of their arguments. This is also one of the reasons why Salton Sea is such a great documentary. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Suburbia loses its message in the explanation to support its central arguments. As the interviewees say, their arguments are becoming more and more similar to the arguments of environmentalists of military personnel. We are told that oil production will hit the top of this decade, but there is no scientific evidence to support this claim (professional reports, statistics, charts, etc.). We have little information on how to calculate this date. Fortunately, this was the only significant mistake I could find in the film's argument, but it is still outstanding. Another less noticeable discrepancy I noticed was the liberal (political) prejudices that could cause some viewers to polarize. But this prejudice shows the in-depth clips of various events, not the filmmakers themselves. Clips, especially those from the 1950s, seemed to me to be useless. The film was not better with their presence and would have been shorter in their absence. <br /> <br /> Since I was thinking about this movie before compiling this review, I wondered why I found this argument more convincing than other recent documentaries. Finally, I realized that filmmakers offered an analysis of the suburban problem. They offer a decentralized village system where people's pockets live together. They confirm that this practice would reduce the need for fossil fuels and reduce wastage. They define a waste of space between long parking spaces, for example, between shopping areas. With this assumption, it is incredible that it is actually conceivable. Most documentaries say vaguely that a problem needs to be stopped but does not offer any method. Thinking more about the film, I decided that this analysis was what saved the movie for me and why I give it a good overview. <br /> <br /> Although the Suburbia is not completely convincing or liquid at the end, it's worth your time. It not only addresses the modern problem of enlargement, but also gives a realistic picture of how it is to be changed. The audience can also enjoy high production value with various clips from the 1950s, combined with modern advocates. People living in Atlanta, Georgia, or the Triad area of ​​North Carolina enjoy this documentary very well because it is the most widespread.
