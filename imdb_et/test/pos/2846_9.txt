I've just seen a very original movie that I would recommend to everyone, including the young and the restless. However, I think some of the stupidity, violence and sexual enthusiasm of the film are not suitable for all of their children. Before the sand fills the sand, let me tell you the name of the movie: "Nurse Betty". The stars of Renee Zellweger are Betty. He is a Kansas waiter who falls under the trance and thinks he is the real life of his favorite soap opera. That's why he goes to Los Angeles to reunite with his alleged soap opera character lover. Rubell. He is also prevented by some merciless "one life, not living" to add fuel to the fire, who think he has stolen his drugs. You can say that this is how Sister Betty spends her life days in her life. This very "general" situation ultimately leads to his beloved soap opera "to the hospital". But the only problem is that Betty thinks it's all real. It's like his mind is in another world. Okay! Enough! I wipe the mouth with soap and no longer mention the names of soap. I've already registered my vote for Renee as the best actor for Oscar. Greg Kinnear was also dr. Rubell's performance as good as his biography. All in all, my last diagnosis is that everyone has to invite "sister Betty". ***** Great
