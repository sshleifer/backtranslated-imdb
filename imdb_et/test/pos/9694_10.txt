I don't like Jackass Number Two. No one should. Jackass is there and has never redeemed anything. And yet ... this is one of the funniest things I've ever seen - and I just can't explain why. <br /> <br /> This new film leaves the first dust. It's so funny, so terrible and so wrong. The whole team gives their all - Jackson's leaders under Knoxville. He's nuts. I adore her, but she's crazy. And more power for him. With his growing film career, he could sit back and let everyone else do it, but the fact that he almost literally returned to the "Ass" world makes me strangely respectful. More runners must go to Bam Margera, who previously seemed to be content to sit down and just make sure everything around him was pretty much what he wanted. Here, Bam is not a tormentor, but tortured and it is better. <br /> <br /> I just can't say what my favorite is, because I laughed all the way. True, I looked at the film largely between my fingers, but I haven't had a "real" movie I've seen for a long time, which made me feel livened up. Love them or hate them, the Jackass team has given their expectations beyond and beyond. But I agree with Bam. The Jackass number three will never be because someone dies and I want these guys to stay around.
