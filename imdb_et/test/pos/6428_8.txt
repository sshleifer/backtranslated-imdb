It's actually a very good surreal mystery film, despite the description that tries to sell it as a Sci-Fi movie. Balkan stars like a woman haunted by mysterious visions and lost memories she is trying to put together. He spends most of the film trying to understand his visions. Very obvious and effective. It is true that Kinski does not look very much in this movie, but the powerful actors are very good. In the US, only the English version is duplicated and duplication leaves something undesirable, but the participants do a great job. The film art of the Academy Award Winner Vittorio Storaro is excellent. Earlier Giallo director Bazzoni, FIVE VIIS is also excellent and also objective by Storarro.
