It is a mistake to refer to the film of this era as a horror film. Most of the German films that contain supernatural themes are not so much horror films, because they are dark fantasies borrowed from early German romanticists such as E. T. Hoffman and other works. Fritz Lang's "Der Mude Tod" (also since 1921) takes his personal death away from his own gold, but Lang's film cannot alleviate the fate of behavioral characters. Neither of the young lovers deserves to die, but they are due to the fact that they are reunited only with death. <br /> <br /> Victor Seastrom's "Korkarlenis" is, however, always an option for repentance. Fate can change - and delay death - through the choices of the characters. Though the phantom cartoon scenes that collect souls have really failed, these deadly images of death as a great plain endangered by the deadly redemption of this story to a true monster, David Holm, a brutal drunken man who, due to perverse hatred of mankind, is spreading tuberculosis and emotional misery to anyone with whom he concerns. <br /> <br /> One New Year's Eve, Holm strikes down in a fight with a drinking companion. As the first person to die at midnight, he must become the leader of Phantom's transportation and gather souls during the New Year. The Phantom carriage, led by an old acquaintance who had begun Holm's path to a damaged path, comes from his soul and leads him to the path of self-discovery. Along the way, Holm sees the horror he has caused his family and the people who tried to help him. <br /> <br /> Perhaps my disappointment at the end of the film is criticism of Selma Lagerl√∂f's novel in which the film is based. But I would have liked to see that David Holm cannot escape his destiny and see that his repentance is too late to prevent his wife from poisoning her two children and herself and seeing Holm suffer from the consequences of her sins to gather their souls. It would have been a more appropriate punishment and fear that would be more immense than witnessing the abuse of others. In the film, however, there is no message of the unchanging nature of destiny; redemption is. The chief driver allows Holm to return to his body and rescues his family into the era. His repentance smells of Scrooge's repentance "Christmas song." <br /> <br /> If the subtle and sentimental end does not spoil you, there is still a lot to admire in the film. Special effects are amazing when measured by day standards, and they are still surprising, which is more amazing when you think these double exposures are created inside the hand-crank camera. At the same time, the film on Tartan's new DVD has been restored fabulous.
