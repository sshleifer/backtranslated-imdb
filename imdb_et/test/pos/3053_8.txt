Please note that this movie has nothing to do with Radio City Music Hall! Archivist: Music Hall .. I know what is and is not related to the New York meeting. Theodore is just "Music Hall". There's no Rockette in the movie. Only great snow readers and great actors and fun. I thought you'd like to know. Really great movie. You never think who the "murderer" is while watching this movie. What a great platform and beautiful skating. This performance will never be seen again. Roxy Theater and Center Theaters in New York had stage performances on stage!
