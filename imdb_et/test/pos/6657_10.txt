I just saw a DVD and loved it. In particular, I thought the director and Jude and Nicole were doing an amazing job of kissing between Inman and Ada just before Inman's departure. It was the most romantic kiss I've ever seen in the movie. I thought it was very important in determining the rest of the film's tone; it succeeded in believing that Inman and Ada were walking / waiting for each other throughout this time without ever having a relationship. I thought the film has this important plot point much better than the book itself. I'm sure many of you will quickly call other movie kisses that are the best, but that's for me! Jude and Nicole had shown incredible chemistry with too few scenes that they had together.
