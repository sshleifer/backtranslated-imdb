I would like them to bring back the surface. I really enjoyed the show with my family. I felt that the plot development and story were the first. As another person said, it seems that everything becomes a smaller common denominator. There is something other than a blissful, politically correct junk. Just look at the Internet to see how many people showed up. It is also not nice to leave us hanging on what happened to all the characters in the exhibition. This is the same thing that happened with the time that I think was called 8 days, but it should have been called upside down. Did the Olympics kill the surface? I know that the writer's strike killed another years of my favorite exhibition called the greatest American hero.
