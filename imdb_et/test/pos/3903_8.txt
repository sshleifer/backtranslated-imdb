After learning that her sister Susan is going to divorce, Kate decides to travel to the home of a frustrated woman and spend time with her. When Kate arrives, Susan is nowhere. This is because someone has murdered him and filled the body in the basement of the trunk. When the storm rumbles outside, Kate tries to figure out where her sister could have gone and put her life in great danger ... the killer is still in the room! Elizabeth Montgomery gives her first BEWITCHED vehicle a strong dramatic performance. Merwin Gerard's teleplay is based on McKnight Malmar's short stage. The story of Malmari was first introduced on television in 1962 as an episode of the Boris Karloff THRILLER anthology series. THRILLER missed the story very precisely, which is a kind of damage, as it could have used a bit of beating. Permitted Malmar wrote a moderately scary number, but Gerard (the creator of ONE STEP BEYOND's creator) adds a number of smart ingredients that increase tension and tension.
