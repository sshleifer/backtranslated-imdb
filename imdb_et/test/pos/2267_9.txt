2005 was one of the best years for movies. We had so many wonderful movies like Batman Begins, Sin City, Corpse Bride, History of Violence ...... We also got Brokeback Hill, King Kong. But if this year was the only big movie that came out was all enlightened, then we wouldn't lose all this year. The first film as a talented Liev Schreiber leader is a delightful, warm-hearted drama that also brings one of Elijah Wood's best roles. He is perfect as Jonathan, a curious man who leads Ukraine to find a woman who saved his grandfather in World War II. Liev Schreiber, who also writes the film, manages the masterpiece, memorable scenes and (many) funny quotes. It is a true comedy and drama mix that will bring you a movie that will be commented on for years. A serious Oscar contestant, all enlightened, is a powerful, original and, why not say, enlightened film. But when you enter the movie, you should keep in mind one thing: leave the ordinary behind. It's special
