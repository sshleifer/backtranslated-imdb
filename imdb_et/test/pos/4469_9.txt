Lucio Fulci, later known for his graphic horror films, such as The Beyond and Zombie, was a champion of films such as Lizard In A Woman Skin and his masterpiece for years in Italian giallo (Argento and Bava). Torture duckling. This film has all the elements known as the Italian mystery / thriller genre, but it really pulls in the viewers with every key in their closet. It keeps you as much detective as the movie itself. Who kills the young boys in the city? A young rich woman who is so bored that she sexually kills potential victims, a reporter who loves to adapt to the crime, to get a better photo, a townspeople with a daughter with intellectual disabilities, a local witch, an urban idiot. .. the list goes on and you have to keep mental notes like a real game to play and solve. The themes of this film are very bold and perfect in the Italian style in the early 1970s. It is certain that no American studio would have even considered making such a strong film, and that is why it is such a satisfying film (despite some extraordinary accent choices of dubbing) and certainly people will have to discuss their meanings long after viewing it. As they say, they don't do that like that, so get a copy and pamper this important movie!
