Binodin's mother, Kalkuta, is accompanied by a free-spirited binodin. Soon his friendship with Ashalata will flourish. It seems that the two that deal with each other as "Chokher Bali" (sand in the eyes) share a permanent bond. English-speaking Binodin hits a special place in the house. But soon he will remember his real face. Good-natured Ashlata, manipulating Binodin near Mahindra and fulfilling her sexual desires. <br /> <br /> Binodin reluctantly searches for Behar when he is thrown away by the Mahindra's exhausted mother.

Other leading artists, Prosenjit Chatterjee, Raima Sen and Toto Roychowdhury, are equally brilliant in performing their character. The widow's idea of ​​marriage was taboo, even among the top class! Speaking of the movement of peoples' freedom in parallel, the author confirms the importance of individual freedom from drilled life. Tissue to an art director who gave life to Bengal at the beginning of the 20th century, and applause the operator for collecting their sound recordings. <br /> <br /> This Tagore "passionate game" has been turned from the filmmaker's screen without losing originality.
