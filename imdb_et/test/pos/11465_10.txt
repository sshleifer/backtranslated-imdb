This is a great horror film for people who don't want everything that is vomiting and sensational. This movie has equal amounts of horror, intercourse, humor and even a little light nudity, but nothing great. Linnea Quigley is not up when she was "Returning the Living Dead", where she danced naked, but she is still essentially the same. Cathy Podewell is a native and bright character before entering "Dallas" and we've also introduced Amelia [soon to be Mimi] Kinkade, a sexy dark dark house of the house. When he and Linnea are in possession and take over the house, they revive the bodies of their dead friends to frighten the boundaries of the survivors. I've heard many people compare this movie to "The Evil Dead", but if anything, this movie is the same as Freddie competed with Jason.
