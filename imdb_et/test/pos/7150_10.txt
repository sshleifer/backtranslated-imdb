I was surprised that "Franklin's forgiveness" did not give more buzz to the Sundance film festival this year. It was time that laughter with the smile I saw was so loud that you barely heard the movie. The film has some great exhibitions and stories that really make it one of the broader issues to explore. You know a few questions like religion, sex and truth. Many comedies seem to rely on the same old silver situations, many of them leaving you to think, "I know they'll get it out of some of the knitters." I really think Jay Floyd did a fantastic job for this movie, the budget was tight.
