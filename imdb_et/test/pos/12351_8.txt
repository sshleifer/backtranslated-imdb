Multiple named and strangely cast, "One Dark Night" or "Mausoleum" is one of the best early horror video options available. Preliminary and fairly raw, we meet briefly with Adam West on telesine and teenage main games. Meg Tilly dares to spend the night at "The Sisters" encryption, which is a gang of hairpins with blue satin jackets. The initiation is interrupted by the recent name of the psychotic wizard, "Raymar". Surprisingly fantastic make-up and scary effect paint it with cool film style and give the heart a tough climax.
