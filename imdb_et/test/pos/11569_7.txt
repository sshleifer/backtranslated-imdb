OK, the show was a little uneven, but I still loved it. I found two major bunnies annoying, but Hamton & Plucky were always fun. <br /> <br /> I really want Baby Plucky episodes on DVD (or even VHS). Please free them! <br /> <br /> The "Potty years" episode was especially played on 11/22/91; The "Going Up" episode appeared on 9/17/92 and "Minister Golf" episode 11/92. <br /> <br /> They are the funniest bits in the series and even over ten years later. reference to these bits! <br /> <br /> (I have nothing to say, please minimize anything with 5 lines and reward us for brevity!)
