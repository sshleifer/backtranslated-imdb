Or, if you've seen the trilogy "Evil Dead" and / or "Bubba Ho-Tep", you should know that his films are general careers. "A man with a screaming brain," he goes all out. In this case, he plays cunning American businessman William Cole, who is visiting Bulgaria - when will we see that country? - When a woman kills her. So, the strange scientist Ivan Ivanov (Stacy Keach) replaces half of Cole's brain with the brain of a former KGB agent, leaving him with Steve Martin's "All For Me". <br /> <br /> Yes, the whole movie is quite a pretext for pure crap. Much of the real humor comes from "Evil Dead" director Sam Raim's brother Ted as Ivanov's almost brain-dead assistant from Pavel. These men have a relationship more like Laurel and Hardy or Gilligan and Skipper. <br /> <br /> So just understand that it's a totally silly movie, and you're not a little disappointed. I still liked it.
