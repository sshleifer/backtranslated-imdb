One of the most famous film series! It is still interesting today, though it has an "old movie". The second series looks better, but just doesn't match it. The actor has a good time, especially Middleton and Lipson. Excellent editing by a team of universal experts. The track was followed by Universal, "unknown", "invisible", "black cat" and "London werewolf". And what a great action music it was! If the best serials of all time were possible, it should be (# 1).
