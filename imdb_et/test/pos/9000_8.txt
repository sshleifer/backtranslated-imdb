I just watched it last night and it was great. I see why some ppl have a bad feeling about the rugby fan and the Maori culture viewpoint, but not that I have no idea what is so negative. The film is great. It has a lot of heart. Very inspiring and encouraging at all ages. Great family movie! They did a good job, considering that it was a budget movie. I love movies based on real stories / events. I lifted all my life around rugby, this is a great game, but I never got it because (please forgive me if I offend anyone, something personal, how I saw it) I thought their training was not so merciless or hard, players are not as disciplined and as serious as other athletes, and it seemed like it was just muscle and flourishing, dealing with each other, and so on. But after watching Forever, I was like, wow! I was proud! It made good things for the rugby (well changed my opinion on rugby) and the New Zealnd Haka. I actually cried. I'm not even New Zealand and I was proud of my culture. Even did not know what this song meant before the movie. The film is not about rugby techniques or rugby, it's not even New Zealand's black or haka or etc ...... mother of pearls !!!!! hahaha SHUX! <br /> <br /> So you have no points on all the beautiful pplets! I am sure that if they had the tools, it would have been better, the hook is there because it was part of the Highland Rugby culture, tradition or what you ever want to call it. <br /> <br /> So all new members on this site, like me, will not postpone these negative comments. See it for yourself! Must see a movie! There's a lot that you can learn from this movie, ppl at any age. It definitely wants to be a better person and be humble! This movie reminded me of a lot of things that I already know and raised, but I lost my way! I loved it! Happy reading and all the best! <br /> <br /> Muawha!
