I was surprised when I read the comments of a person about this film. It's really quite funny. Certainly, the couple will laugh out what my boyfriend and I quote for each other. Some situations may be regrettable (bisexuality, drugs, especially the strange child's opinion on sexuality) but at the same time plausible. This concerns communication and communication between men and women.
