The Edge of 1957, directed by Martin Ritt, stars by John Cassavetes, Sidney Poitier, Jack Warden and Ruby Dee. This is the story of a man worried about Axel, who has a mysterious past that gradually comes out during the film. He has a connection that gives him the real meaning of a loading dock that works for Charlie (Jack Warden), who takes his workers back and drives them hard. Charlie has an intense reluctance to black man T.T. (Poitier) with the same position. T.T. calls on Axel to work with his team; Axel violates Charlie and does it. Axel finds a place to live and communicate with T.T., his wife (Dee) and their son's white teacher (Kathleen McGuire). When a tragedy strikes, none of the loading blocks tells the men about the police, and Axel has to deal with his values, what he represents, and the meaning of friendship. <br /> <br /> This is really a great black and white film that is not strangely black and white! It's really about the boundaries that one himself puts and knowing who you are. Charlie is a bigot and hates that the black man has a good position in the dock. T.T. teases Charlie and gives as good as she can. T.T. and Axel do not come with time or T.T-son, who has a white teacher with whom the family also socializes. What the individual Axel is difficult to receive, friendship or coercion - the things he learns through TT <br /> <br /> Poitier stands out "at the edge of the city" - he is warm, energetic, loving and intelligent, a person who is a real enthusiasm for life, fears something. Cassavetes is great and plays a completely different character - hiding in the shade, chronically depressed and always nervous. Whatever he does, he is now a different man.
