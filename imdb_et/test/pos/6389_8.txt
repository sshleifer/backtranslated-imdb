Psychopath (1973) Memory Card Outing. I saw this movie for years in black and white. Children's Rabbey showcases the brutal abuse that parents bring to their childhood fans. Mr. Rabbey (who looks like he is always on the verge of losing it) finally splits and decides to go hunting. Beware of bad parents, because Mr. Rabbey is clever! Next is invaluable. But finding this movie is quite a chore. <br /> <br /> This film is remarkable for the fact that Joe "Maniac" Spinell made a short promo roll for this movie. In his unfinished movie, he plays with Mr. Robbie, p. Clown (who looks like Edward James Olmos in the form of a form) who unlocks the abuse of the children of his young fans after his parents. Unfortunately, Mr Spinell was never able to find the means to complete the project. The film was titled Maniac II: "Mister Robbie". The similarities of Rabbey or Robbie are too comfortable. Pretty Violent P.G. film. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
