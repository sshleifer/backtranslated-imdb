I think Crewes did his evil part very well, he should have won the prize. Anything Dunne has turned on is salvageable because Dunne is a great actor and can pull something, even a weak script. That is why I would only like this for that reason. This film may be a little better from time to time, the chart may be more acceptable on these days. <br /> <br /> During Hollywood movies, it was meant for entertainment or teaching. deal with the times. This scheme seems to be different from this profile. But again, I have to say what Irene Dunne once was, at least "good" because she made things so plausible! The only other actor I can say was to think that it was perhaps Deborah Kerr. Look at the silver cable if you have the opportunity to "act" if nothing else.
