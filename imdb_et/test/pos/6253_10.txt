"Tourist Trap" is a really horrible low budget horror movie that will definitely satisfy horror fans. It contains a very strange atmosphere and has some rather irritating moments of all fear and fear. Some scenes are strange, for example, one scene when Chuck Connors is sitting with dinner, where the mannequin lives and starts chatting with him before his head falls off. There is very little gore, but the violence is quite strong for a PG-rated horror film. David Schmoeller returned to several other genre films including "Crawlspace", "Puppet Master" and "Netherworld". "Tourist Trap" is definitely his best horror film, so if you want to be scared, give it a small pearl out of 9 out of 10.
