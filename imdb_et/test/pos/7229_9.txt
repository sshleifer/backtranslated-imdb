The lonely punk named Tromeo (Will Keenan) has little friends on the streets of New York somewhere saturated, but all they do is tattoos, piercing and just a party. He falls for a beautiful rich girl named Julian (Jane Jenson), who is also worried because her father is a very malicious son you know, but as our title characters meet and fall, they become quite magical. Unfortunately, their fathers are with each other because Julia's father wants to take over Tromeo's father's movie studio, but could really love them all and stop this trouble? <br /> <br /> Funny and harsh horror comedy drama from mad and disgusting people in Troma is a great day in William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. It appeared in 1997 in theaters and got a good idea that it is a dark humorous satire that is the legendary story that all started, that is, some good laughs, piercing, graphic violence and gore, such as a head broken by a fire hydrant . For me, this is the third best Troma movie next to the immortal "Toxic Avenger" and "Troma War", and secondly, if the actor can be a bit bad like some Troma clips, but the above things do it and it must see the movie if you like it horror comedies, Peter Jackson and Troma or if you want to see a beloved story of the comic version, BTW are also looking for a couple of fun performances The Toxic Avenger and SGT. Kabukiman NYPD. <br /> <br /> Also recommended: "Toxic Avenger", "Meet the Feebles", "Ichi The Killer", "Re-Animator", "Terror Firmer", "Nuke'Em High Class", "Romeo and Julia (1968 and 1996) "," Pieces "," Troma War "," Citizen Toxie: toxic avenger 4 "," Basketball "," Riki-Oh: Ricky Story "," Demons "," New Nightmare "," Freddy vs Jason "," Cabin Fever "," Nightmare on Elm Street "," Battle Royale "," Pink Flamingos "," Perfect Blue "," Rabid Grannies "," Surf Nazis Must Die "," Hostel "," Evil Dead II, Serial Mom, Dead Alive (aka Braindead), Street Trash.
