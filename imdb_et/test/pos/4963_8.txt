This film is directed by Julie Taymor, who plays and performs productions and masks. No one can match their imagination with the modern stage of operation. Since making this film in 1992, he has made great strides in film making and music management. One can only hope that he can be persuaded to return to the opera. I would love to see the cycle he was driving. The current Covent Garden in Rheingold has giants whose hands are too big, like the characters in this movie. ENO's current butterfly uses the Japanese Puppet Theater. Perhaps coincidence or evidence that Taymor's effects are widespread. Red ribbons are a recurring theme. They are used as a umbilical cord when Oidipus is born, they hang down from the eyes of Oedipus after he has blinded himself, in a breathtaking sense they are used as the intersection of killing the sons of Oedipus' father. <br /> This neo-classical opera ballet from Stravinski enjoyed a legitimate ambiguity until this film brought life. Music is uninspired, but inoffensive and Philip Langridge, Jesse Norman and very young Bryn Terfel are using it. Singers are quite immobile according to Stravinski's wishes. Min Tanaka is an Oidipus dancing to Langid's Oidipus. This creates some confusion when the eyes of Oedipus are dancing in Oedipus. <br /> <br /> Libretto is in Latin, but don't worry if your Latin is a bit rusty. It is a useful narrator that introduces and describes each scene in Japanese.
