In the outskirts of New York, when Z-Boys was in Dogtown for history, I had only a glimpse of what was going on. I had a P-O-S Black Knight skateboard with a clay wheel. It's long gone and the ashes of my personal life. But I never forgot. It's like watching long lost brothers and friends and it hits me right where I live. I can't watch this movie enough. Every time I look at it, another aspect goes up, some other angle becomes sharp. Vintage footage, incredible photos, current personalities were associated with the brightly lit up bright shadows of the past, the cordial and not too-made narrative, all of which were nicely edited to give a true passage to the true passage of American history. Glen Friedman's words - "It was f-ing incredible."
