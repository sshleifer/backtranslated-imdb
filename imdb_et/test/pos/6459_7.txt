Highlighting the presence of Sidney Poitier and the presence of John Cassevetes' screen is a highly observable film from the fifties of the city of Edge, directed by Martin Ritt. Black and white are excellent on-the-go photography and stunning. <br /> <br /> Poitier is the joy of his career here and Tommy Tyler, his playful character is happy and outgoing. He interacts with Axel Noordman, who plays in Cassevets, a young man with a bad self-esteem and a past that he wants to keep going. Black man, Tyler brings his friend out of his shell and introduces him to his family and new girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Tyler and Noordman are working in New York docks while workers were expected to carry the line if they knew what was useful to them. Boss Charles Malik, played by Jack Warden, with his many difficult roles, becomes the focus of dissatisfaction leading to a climatic showdown with Noordman. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, we are left with mixed emotions. But the two main characters have left the public story of friendship between two different men in a hostile world.
