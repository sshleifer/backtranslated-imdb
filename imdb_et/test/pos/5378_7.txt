I had no idea what I saw when I decided to watch this movie and, surprisingly, it's just a very well made horror film that is easily one of the best of the 1970s. The film is, of course, a low budget, and it is a great example of how the story and style of the movie creates chills, not special effects! Strother Martin is an actor of all-time great characters and has a rare headquarters, and Martins is also a good friend of L.Q. Jones and "Green Acres" by Alvy Moore. Jones and Moore also helped produce this film. TV veteran Charles Bateman is a star and "Enter the Dragon" beauty of Ahna Capri is his girlfriend. Capri is in the beginning of the movie in a bikini and she's just wonderful! The film does a terrible job of storing the story, and the addition of counterfeiting is not a good end, and I liked how the film ends. Great atmosphere, interesting story and well-run Bernard McEveety. Martin's performance is also top-notch because he doesn't stop at all and really throws himself at Doc. A good and undervalued film!
