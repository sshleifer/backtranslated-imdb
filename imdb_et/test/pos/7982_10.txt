Every Batman fan knows how big the movies are, they have been a great success. But Batman Returns is the best movie in the series. The combination of excellent control, brilliant operation and settings makes it worth watching at night. great work. Danny Devito (Penguin man) is a man who has inherited the characteristics of a penguin as a child and has grown up to become outrageous and ugly ... a thing! Michelle Pfiffer plays a sleek and very seductive Catwoman after the cats have bitten her genes. The result of both character changes is great and both the kitten and the penguin man play a very important role in this great movie. Mysterious Catwoman is very fun to watch - her classic speeches and the funny part of jumping with her whip in the jewelry store adds such fun to the movie. Danny Devito also does well, his ability to induce some strange creature was vital and he adds an excellent atmosphere to the film that brings us back to the dull sewers where he lives. <br /> <br /> You can't forget Batman though. Micheal Keaton once again excels and shows Batman differently. His affection lets go when he faces Catwoman at the end of the film, and his meetings with him when he is a normal person, Selina Kyle, causes her bullying in her home. After leaving it is a wise part and the film is full of great scenes. It is worth noting that Bruce Wayne's Bat-Mobile is not used as much as other Batman films, because this movie is a close fight and a story that speaks. <br /> <br /> Gotham City was created in winter. most scenes are set at night and the city is full of snow. So if you watch this movie in the summer like me, it doesn't feel the same. Best to watch in winter. <br /> <br /> It's generally an amazing movie. The whole credit goes to Tom Burton and the majority, they have done incredible work.
