I've read every Asterix and Obelix adventure at least 5 times and I'm also a "Les Nulsi" and "Les Robins des Boise" and a Jamel fan so I waited a lot for this movie. I was satisfied. Unlike the first adaptation of Asterix on the big screen (Astérix et Obélix contre César), which was not a real success after Laetitia Casta's appearance, it is really a comic spirit (and we get the beautiful Monica Bellucci). In the first film, the director tried to be too realistic about the time the story was set and killed the whole spirit that made Asterix fun. It has all the clothes, the way of talking and all the work that Goscinny and Uderzo do ... more, it really stays next to the original story that we know pretty much everything that happens, but Alain Chabat gave us some surprises at the end. I really enjoyed this movie and every time I see the first sign of boredom, Jamel comes in and makes us laugh like crazy. This movie is a great mix of all the humor I really like, and even if it may be too much of a mess, I can't like it. So, if you like the humor of Asterix and all those young talents who started "Zero part Ailleurs" (French mix today and SNL), watch this movie.
