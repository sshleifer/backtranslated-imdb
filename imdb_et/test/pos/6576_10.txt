almost 4 years after the events of 911, when asked what comes to mind from this day, most people would probably comment on things like seeing planes that fall and the collapse of the twin tower, the number of deaths from the mixing of terrorism and heroism, and so on. Everyone who lived at this time will never forget this day. But most of us don't have memories, though they're moving, not on a personal level. now there is an extraordinary film that gives everyone who has not lost a friend or family member the opportunity to participate on a personal level just what we lost in 911. This is a movie that must be seen.
