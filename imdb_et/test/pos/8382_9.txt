Brad Pitt sticks to Diane Kruger's leg wound with his finger and keeps it there until he gets what he wants. Funny, terrible. The invented yarn takes "The Dirty Dozen" and sometimes abandons other films. A lot of fun. Even "Paris as it sizzles" is mentioned happily in organic dialogue. I was delighted by the character of Christoph Waltzer and his sensational performance. Brad Pitt creates a real original. I love the lack of an actor. Brad Pitt is pure in nature. Tarantino visits the new universe, but. luckily his hand. his brain and heart are visible all over the place.
