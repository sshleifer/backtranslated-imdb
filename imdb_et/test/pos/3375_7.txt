I do not lie. To say that this movie is confusing is like saying that the sun is hot, but not really. And if you have seen previous film by Richard Kelly, "Donnie Darko" and "Southland Tales", you know that it has to mean something. When I saw this movie, there were about 50 people in the theater. About one-half of the audience had already gone out for an hour before the film. In the end, there were only 15 people who didn't know what the hell they just saw. I can only understand about 40% of what I saw on the screen, and even then it can only be called interpretation. Why did I give this movie a generous seven stars? For one, we get some spectacular performances (Marsden great and Langella returns to a familiar horrible character), and most importantly two, because it's completely original and Richard Kelly, no doubt one of the brave directors in life, uses his creative vision to tell a story that dares to be different. Frankly speaking, it's ONLY the way - only Kelly's unique style will make it a story of how it is designed. <br /> <br /> Finally, if you don't want some serious thinking to spend on an intelligent movie (and even then it can all go out), stay away from FAR. But if you want to look at the profound, rich, complex and thoughtful predictability of spirituality, existentialism and human nature, then look at it. Be prepared for longer discussions with your partner. <br /> <br /> * Note: If you have read this review by accident, have taken my recommendation, seen a movie and STILL believe you have wasted 2 hours of your life, I would gladly share your views on the full meaning and plot of the movie. Look, that's why I liked it so much - it encourages discussion! As far as it is, I try to put it together, paraphrasing a rather depressing quote with the character of Langella, who explains the importance of a simple box to the employee: "Your house is the box where you live. , you are sitting in front of a moving picture box.
