NOBODY (1999) is a fantastic Japanese noir. It is about three salaried employees who get into their heads when they are innocent; If the three mysterious strangers who are much more deviant, even if the film doesn't know, we can capture one of our "heroes" living daylights, decide in favor of the trio - but they accidentally kill one of the other boys! The other two mercies will then systematically destroy everything that these bad scores cost, including their rapidly decreasing peace of mind. Phaedra Video DVD Sleeve is a critique of the quote, calling the movie "paranoid street crime freakout!" or any such, and the term more than here applies. Beating, tight, very violent and low-key (but still quite slippery) was largely shot at night with many deliberately vague moments and character motivations that keep the audience properly with finite protagonists (who deserve to some extent what they deserve)!). I'll give her 10.
