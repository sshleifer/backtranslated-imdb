I read all the negative comments about "Anna Christie". You know the handles about static camera, obsolete operations and scenario verbiage. But when I looked at it yesterday, I found it remarkable and enjoyable. Yes, Clarence Brown's camera is mostly in place and I'm pretty sure one of the microphones lies in the light of the ship. Yes, there are many dialogues and no remarkable sequences of action. It is the early language of primitive technical aspects. But ... then Garbo, Marie Dressler, George F. Marion and Charles Bickford, all of which prove that the great actor is timeless. <br /> <br /> I believe that "Anna Christie" is still one of Garbo's most iconic performances. And this is a wonderful power of divinity in the role that is very atypical to him. Yes, we have seen that Garbo is tired and almost beaten, but never with sackcloth or whiskey. Garbo played so many (pleasing) costume tasks that modern woman is exciting to see her game. She has not considered heavy dresses or makeup. This presentation looks pretty raw from Garbo. <br /> <br /> After a plot from O'Neill's game, Anna, a former Swedish prostitute, is tired of her reunion with her cozy sailor. Anna had enough difficulty with every 20-year-old girl, as she talked about drunk, slovenly Marthy (Dressler) bar. He finds that he lives at sea and romance with a tough but cheerful fisherman (Charles Bickford). But his past threatens to destroy it all. <br /> <br /> Charles Bickford has been overlooked by Garbo's long (mostly worse) leaders. He is one of the actors who can share the screen with the screen and his magical presence cannot swallow it. The couple has great chemistry and seemed to work with each other. Dressler can never be blamed for underfilling, and again, we are dreaded with his old tricks, but he is terrible and convincing in his role, never annoying like a terrible "dinner eight". I've never heard of George F. Marion ever, but he was as wonderful as Garbo's father. <br /> <br /> This is a preconceived code and, according to MGM standards, is rather rough and dark. I really enjoyed it, and although it may tend in some places, it's still wonderful.
