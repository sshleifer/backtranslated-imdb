Like most sports movies, it is not surprising that people who know something about sport find mistakes in it. As a football referee, I have not yet seen a movie or TV show that is suitable for showing the game. "Forever" is a good actor, but I found that Sean Astin is a bit young as a young prison administrator. I was very grateful that the plot did not include a token that turned my countrymen into rugby players and took both Flagstaff and Highland. What's Believing: The police unit's car happens just when the flagship people are burning with Rick Penning. Even if rugby is not a nationally sanctioned high school sport, the team is a school-based club sport - like a rodeo. This means that I find it hard to believe that high school officials would allow students to play with open wounds: this is simply not done with AIDS and hepatitis that day. I don't care about the tradition and the macho image. Nevertheless, it was a cool movie that teenagers had to behave like adults (and sometimes actually). Unfortunately, there are too many trainers like Flagstaff - or worse.
