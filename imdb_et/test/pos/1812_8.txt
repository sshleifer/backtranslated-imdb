For the most part, romance films were once my tea. But Valley Girl is one of the few romantic movies that I could not only sit but really enjoy. Nicholas Cage is in a big role in his first role and Deborah Foreman is out of faith. There are some side effects that tend to become confusing, but not enough to reduce this movie.
