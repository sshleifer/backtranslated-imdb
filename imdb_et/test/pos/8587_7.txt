In Lumumba, we see faces behind the monumental shift in Congolese history after it has been returned from Belgium, and we see the motives of those who were raped and the hungry country fell. <br /> <br /> Lumumba is not a hypermass film; it requires the attention of viewers to raw, truthful, and complex, packed dialogue. The little main plot is shown in action, it is based almost exclusively on words, but it is a recurring strand that is just action, and it is a genius that makes the film an enlightening and vigorous contribution to the tense political struggle that Congo's independence has created. <br /> <br /> This movie is real. It is a raw material that depicts images in power and streets. This is when you open content. And it moves in the passions and emotions of its perfectly portrayed characters. Whether you are a fan of history, a movie buff, or just like good stories, Lumumba is a must-have.
