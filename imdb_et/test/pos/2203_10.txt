Although video technology can be dated, this is a classic music game that is now on DVD, Sondheim's most important and polished work on Broadway. If you have never seen SWEENEY TODD, you need to buy this DVD. I saw this production in the Kennedy Center in Washington in November 1980 - and I fell in love with the "Murder She Wrote" Angela Lansbury. In the following I tried to find all my works, including: MOVIES: "Harvey girls", "Dorian Gray picture", "Manchur candidate"; CDs: "Mame", "Dear World" and "Gypsy"; and many others. The remaining majority is also flawless. All in all, this wonderful DVD gives the final version of Sondheim's opera!
