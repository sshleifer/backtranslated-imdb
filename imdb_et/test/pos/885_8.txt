I have to say: all modern martial arts films are worth it. It was not as epic as Musa-The Warriors and did not develop characters, but it had many nice ideas. A simple story: an elite soldier thought dead, will return after years to end Japan's rule in Korea in the Middle Ages. Her colleague was the best friend she had before with, and now she's in for her. Fighting scenes are all swords or different weapons and great fun to watch. Number motifs are first discovered close by. To get all the connections better, you need to look at it again. And I personally ... I loved the end. I can watch it over and over again. Maybe a little pathetic, but a real story of a freedom fighter .... People can be killed, but not the ideas they stand for.
