The only complaint I heard about this movie was that it was slow. Although this may be the point. Two characters are inconsistent and the collapse of the collision is alarming. Complex and subtle gestures and minimal dialogue give a tension to a point where the otherwise normal argument will shock the audience. Istanbul and suburbs are dreaming, fascinating, and the scenery is fascinating - not in this "look," the hero blew another car and now rides his motorcycle. I had my back when the characters entered each other's spheres and moved out and looked at the mist.
