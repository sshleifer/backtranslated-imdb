I saw this movie several years ago and it has never left my list of the best movies ever. When I first looked at it, I just started on what has become lifelong justice. It gave an interesting perspective to the death penalty and also gave me some things to think about. <br /> <br /> If you have such a majority, you have the right to assume that this is nothing staggering. This is by far the best role I've ever seen when Sean Penn plays (with me Sam). He adds a role, does not do his activities as glamor. He manages to maintain the opening level of the whole movie, which I thought was very important. Until the end, he is not trying to be more than he is. He's a sick man who regrets his past, but he's sorry. He comes to the ability to redeem his self-worth as much as the convicted (and guilty) murderer can use Susan Sarandon's character, sister Helen Prejean. His character taught me a good will against others without forgetting how terrible human activities could be and without apologizing for them. <br /> <br /> Top-level support was also cast. I was surprised to see Jack Black's small fire in this movie when he's a funny man today! I loved this movie for personal reasons and just because it was cinematography. And I think this is one of the rare exceptions when the movie was out of the book.
