Read this: <br /> <br /> BOYZ N HOOD IS ATTENTION, ADDITIONAL ATTENTION TO MOVIE. <br /> <br /> Two friends in the hood, one is focused on intellectual and the other is athlete. A friend who is an athlete participates in wrong people and kills. (The athlete is back from Washington "Welcome back, Kotter".) <br /> <br /> It makes me crazy that people don't know it. It always blows in my mind when I go to a video shop and Boyz's Hood is in the "Drama" section, while Cooley High is in "Comedy". It's embarrassing shame. This movie is so funny and more dramatic than John Singleton's hanging. At least Singleton might have been dignified to say that his film was a tribute to Cooley High, but he never said a word. Guys 2 Men, however, named their hits after their film.
