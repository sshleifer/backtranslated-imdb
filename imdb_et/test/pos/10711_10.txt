I just love this movie and I have a TV programmed to turn it on on November 2nd. It's really a pleasant love story with twists. The movie that is being played at the end of the movie is what you don't think it would be a big hit, but it is a song that will remain on your head and I will try to find it now so I can hear it and play it. I really don't have the style that I see, or the songs I want to hear and there I am pretty open to see new things open. I would like to say that there are some parts in this movie that are not meant for the whole family. This film shows the skin. It's like a lifetime movie for women, women. I say I watch the movie and it may be just as pleasing as I did.
