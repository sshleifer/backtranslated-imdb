This movie is my favorite comedy of all time and I've seen a lot of comedies. First, I shouldn't write this movie. Just a storyboard. The dialogue is almost entirely written by the actors. hsyterical.The cast is one of the best comedian ensemble you will ever see. The story is about Mayflower dog exhibition in Philadelphia and some contestants on them. Parker Posey shines and is absolutely great! It is one of those films that most of the laughter results in the absolute patience of the characters. ***** / *****
