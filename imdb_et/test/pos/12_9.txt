I was pleasantly surprised when I found this movie that showed a hidden preview in my local theater. <br /> <br /> We've all seen this plot line before (Top Gun, GI Jane, Officer and Gentleman), but a good script is still working. This story is basically a few side story about Coast Guard rescue training. Kevin Costner plays a very successful rescue team member Ben Randall, who has been forced to lead a training team after a difficult mission. In the film, we are going through the training process and the personal stories of a lawyer and Jake Fischer, a lawyer played by Ashton Kutcher. I am pleased to say that Ashton is great in this regard. <br /> <br /> There are no big surprises in this movie and you probably understand what's coming long before it arrives. But using humor, studying the strength of training, and the fun of watching Ben Randall "make your thing a trainer," kept me riveted and thoroughly entertained. I really enjoy watching a movie that makes the whole audience laugh out loud, despises here and there, and at the end created a film of respect. <br /> <br /> We all had a good time (in spite of a couple) in difficult moments in the movie) and I think too.
