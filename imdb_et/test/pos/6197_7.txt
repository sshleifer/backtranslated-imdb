If you look at this series, you will get an interesting 10 chapters on the story of the sleeping chamber and on each character. And more intense with FBI infiltration. The final is wrong. You are waiting for ten chapters, hoping for a great final (it doesn't matter if they fulfill their goals or not), but ... well ... I don't think so. This is a small final big series. I also hoped for more characters for characters. <br /> <br /> But I repeat, this is an interesting miniseries. If you don't want to wait for large series (22-24 chapters), check it out. I give 7 out of 10.
