Jenny Lewis plays an uncomfortable girl named Jade. She smokes and drinks. He doesn't have many friends and has a cheering mother (Beverly D'Angelo). Jade is getting closer to her mother's boy Billy (Rob Estes), maybe she's interested in her. Of course, I don't have to tell you what's going on after that. <br /> <br /> This is probably my favorite TV movie. This movie shows that sometimes everything is guilty. This film also has the best action I've seen in TV movies. Beverly D'Angelo really does a nice job like sweet and loving but careless and blind mother. He didn't see what was happening under his own roof. Rob Estes is his best as a sleazeball. Jenny Lewis is special. He seems to be just like his character. <br /> <br /> Everyone seems to love this movie!
