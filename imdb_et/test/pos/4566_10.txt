I went to the movies to see Claudine and loved it on a cast and sound track every minute. Diahann Carroll was never better in this role. We saw Mrs. Carroll lowering her because she saw her naked, smoked a cigarette, drink beer and cursed her. When this movie was shown on TV and finally on cable, I would call my friends to watch it. Only from the beginning of the film is fantastic, thanks to Gladys Knight and Pips. We saw a black woman struggling with raising her children, dealing with teenage pregnancy and everyday life, meets a man she learns later. Finally, it made a movie on a DVD and deserves good.
