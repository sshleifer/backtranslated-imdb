My favorite story about "insidious". Brion Jones was born to play a part of the manic forest game, the ax succeeded the crazy Steve Dixon. He saw him earlier in Tango & Cash, so I can say that this actor never got what he deserved. The jealous husband takes the interest of a young man who is offensive to his wife, whom he has just recruited. And you know when Dixon discovers you have to pay! Young worker Ted (Billy Wirth) will be beating forever for Dixon, leaving him blind. How should a blind forest owner work? A tribute to black humor, once there was one! Together, the stars do a good job of supporting Ted when Dixon has his initial doubts about his wife who wants another man. Dixon's behavior makes the bond stronger among colleagues. One even noted that he became a married man when he married. Though Ted should have done wisdom and left when he could!
