At the beginning of the movie I found myself laughing, trying to keep quiet, so I didn't wake anyone up in the house, it didn't stay so much all over the rest of the movie, I couldn't find everything completely "laugh out loud" funny, but I found some things pretty funny. At first I had to laugh when he fell under his sleeve with a very insidious hand. Then there are scenes where you just smile as Barber falls through the roof of someone's apartment, I see that it is pretty funny, but today and at a time that has done quite a lot, it didn't look like it was at the time, I'm sure was. I loved Hynkels (Hitlers) who had a brilliant English translation of frightened German. <br /> <br /> The final scene will be discussed wildly, as it is completely true and very intelligently designed. Although the film is sixty-eight years old, the last scene is still relevant today, if it doesn't show how big the writer Chaplin is, then I don't know what it is. Especially in this scene, it was quite good, Barber perfectly transcended the message and understood the serious nature of the movie, while enjoying the humorous side. <br /> <br /> Another element of this movie is that it was such a brave film that almost seems to be ahead. Of course, Chaplin, which happens after 1940, was unaware of the Holocaust (probably), and he has also recorded that he didn't know he'd made this movie. The fact that this film is so against Hitler is interesting that it was more interesting that it was not a fight against Germany, which would be very easy at those times, Chaplin made it easy to propaganda, but did something more. . <br /> <br /> I recommend someone who is interested in this movie to see it, as well as those who have learned or are learning Hitler and World War II to watch this movie. The most fun thing to say is that it has no annoying outdated feeling that some of the time movies did. Unlike most "comedies," this movie has a message that it tries to bring you to watch this movie, it's better than you've seen it.
