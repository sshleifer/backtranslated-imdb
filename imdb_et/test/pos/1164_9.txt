This was my late movie's favorite movie. I'm sorry he didn't live long enough to get a video because I'm sure he'd throw it away. What can we say? A great romantic story and pushing two big men, Raisul and Teddy Rex. Sean Connery and Brian Keith are big in these roles. But even though Connery is her usual sexy sex, it's late Brian Keith, who gives us a solid result as Mercury Teddy Roosevelt. The backup is provided by Candy Bergen, who is proud of her early 30s latent American widow. A great backup is also coming from the great John Huston, like Teddy, which is embedded in SecState, John Hay; Geoffrey Lewis, of Clint Eastwood's films, is a great hesitant US ambassador to Gummere; Late Vladek Sheybal with her demonic devil is great because Beshaw and others are Steve Kanaly and Roy Jensen, whose faces we have seen on many backgrounds. All in all, it is a movie full of wonderful romance, aware of the long lost time. Mindless Story? Not at all. The question of the great nations who are pushing themselves to their smaller interests is today as true. Too romantic? Not really - certainly not maudlin in any way. Fun to watch? You wish. I own a video and watch it over and over again. I suggest you do the same.
