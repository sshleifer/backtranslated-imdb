Focus is another big movie starring William H. Macy. For the first time, I discovered Fargos Macy and I've seen some of his films and he hasn't been cheated yet. Macy's archetypal "nice guy to hide". In Focus, he plays the loyal and hard-working role of Lawrence Newman, who carries his disabled mother at home. The scene is set after World War II, at the height of McCarthyism. Newman is a human resources manager in a company that is basically antisemic. After having accidentally hired a Jewish woman, she is asked to buy glasses to improve her vision. <br /> <br /> It is unbelievable that the simple effect of buying glasses has a big impact on his life and Gertrude Hart, his wife (played by Laura Dern). When opening the film, Newman begins to see a whole different world where the Jewish nature is like an animal. <br /> <br /> Film is a disturbing way of racist being something quite normal. Cooling thought it was still in some places.
