For a record, I'm a curly fan out and out. But I have to say that actually Shemp was not that bad. Yes, he might have missed the way Curly was, but in his own way he was fun. At least he wasn't as bad as Joe Besser. <br /> <br /> BRIDELESS GROOM plays Shemp Music Professor (Stooge? Professor? Yes, Better), who recently spent half a million dollars from a pretty dead set, and Moe & Larry has to prepare him for a woman's wife at night, or without money. <br /> <br /> It was one of Stooges' first charts with Shemp before they started their recycling. material. Perhaps it is not surprising that Shemp was part of Stooges before coming to Curly's picture, so he seemed naturally in it. Dirty evil is fun, especially this one scene with Moe and Shemp in the telephone booth. Important Stooge short to be honest.
