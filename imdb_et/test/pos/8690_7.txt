With a vision that can kill, and a willingness to show off his charms, Paget's sensuality does not cast doubt on where his assets are located ... <br /> <br /> He plays with homeless and innocent 13th-century princesses who suffer their people from being saved Egyptian ambition of the powerful Bedin (Michael Rennie) and joining his troops with the Baghdad Caliph son (Jeffrey Hunter) to save his trembling throne ... He also takes time to fill many exotic dances ... His delicate legs make him hard to forget! <br /> <br /> Emphasis is not on the plot, but on the visual entertainment of a large number of beautiful girls in sensual technical costumes ...
