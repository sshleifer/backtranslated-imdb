Shtrafbat - a punishment battalion is mobile and mostly honest, looks at the life and death of Soviet soldiers who were convicted of washing their crimes during World War II. It can almost be called the Russian equivalent of the highly recognized "Brothers of Brothers" mini-certificates. <br /> <br /> In July 1942, on the eve of the Stalingrad battle, punitive battalions were formed into consumption units and suffered terrible accidents (sometimes up to 90%). GULAG prisoners (political prisoners / concentration camps), desserts, soldiers captured by Germans who managed to escape, soldiers accused of violation of the protocol were given the opportunity to join Shtrafbat and prove that there were no "Emmanal leaders" "of their lives. Those who injured and died in battle It was considered to be rehabilitated and restored in the eyes of the law. <br /> <br /> This minium sees one of Shtrafbat led by Tverdokhlebov who was captured by the Germans, left behind and left dead, with a colorful and diverse group that pulls into the situation, authoritarian but respectable criminal boss Antip "Kulak" and his little-left unregistered criminals, a young Jewish intellectual who hit his anti-Semitic officer, his father (orthodox priest), who steps into the battalion when his parish is destroyed house, political prisoners who hate the regime condemning GULAG, but who are still v alms to fight for the last time for their people and nation, all must find their courage and reasons to live; Keep on fighting. <br /> <br /> Although not every episode has been set during the war, they are not really in combat, in fact these fighting scenes are often chaotic, casual and short - this was probably the director's intention. . Sometimes mini-systems focus on different relationships between casting, their backgrounds, thoughts and tragedies. Rape of a young woman by one Shtrafbat soldier and then executed, expected AWOL, boredom on the march, finding a German bunker with (and champagne) food (and the ensuing consequences), a moral promise of a dilemma for officers who can't save their men from their superiors , husband cheating and other situations. The camera is insecure - it does not turn away from the ugliness of the war and the disgust of human nature or the raw human emotion. Dialogue also does not censor fear. <br /> <br /> The actor is great and deep and the script is also well written. Everything from rage, fatigue, resignation, joy to hanging on, is almost flawless. One complaint may be that some Russian language and cultural heritage may not always be understood by someone who does not know the language and culture. Because it is a certain historical drama, some viewers may lose some terms and situations (military rank, mention of other battles, certain historical references). This understanding is not necessary for a profound enjoyment of Shtrafbat, but these references are a touch of nice authenticity. The second complaint that may be required is from time to time anachronism and bending history to suit the plot, but frankly, it is a moisturizing mini device that is likely to give them mild failures.
