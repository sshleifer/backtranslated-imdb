I like this movie very much. It's not very fun, but it's odd and stunning pictures! No dialogue, only some background sounds and noises. If you are something completely different and original and you enjoy hidden and bizarre ... then you might like this work of art. Ik looks like a film made with the first camera ever made, when strange human beings live and fulfill their strange habits. God has killed a razor and gave birth to a mother. Mother's land impregnated with God's sperm after condemnation and the son of "Muscle Bone" is born. The following are the inhumane acts of ritual torture, rape and murder for purposes we do not know ... or do we?
