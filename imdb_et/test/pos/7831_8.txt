Ladies and gentlemen, we have won here. Actually, we don't do that, but the boy is the movie that is often a fun and always entertaining smelly. Poor Alma (pulling Julia Ruiz) suffers from the curse of ancient Mayans, causing deadly poisonous snakes to grow inside her body. Alma and his abducted shamanist Brujo (Alby Castro, who uncovered feverishly flowing eye-catching intensities) stopped by train that was tied to Los Angeles. Of course, they are losing a lot of deadly tricks so they can terrorize the dirty choice of passengers. Mallachi Brothers, working on Eric Fosberg's absurd manuscript, treat the ridiculous assumption straight, thus creating a wonderfully frightening dancing cheese. Crude CGI Effects, Poorly Growing Gardner's Snakes (The soundtrack is accompanied by a scary rattlesnake noise that affects them in a weak sense with otherwise non-existent threats), a tortuous tempo, a complete lack of any tension or momentum, an obviously dirty post-train train set, and especially just surprising "You have to be crying for me!" The excess redundancy is absolutely terrible with their very jaw-dropping inconvenience. Better yet, we also got a game (as flat), acting as a non-cast, nice smidgie tasty free woman's nudity, funky hum'n'shiver score, and lots of extremely gross and grotesque make-up f / x. Bonus points for being a symbolic irritating cutey little girl eaten by a great reptile and stoner engineer who can be caught smoking a crack out of a hollow lamp (!?). Absolute intestine of goat's waist.
