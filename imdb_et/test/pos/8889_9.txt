If you had a mother who described it to you, you might just want to look for her self-destruction. How Danny DeVito knows Anne Ramsey is how to implement the plan. <br /> <br /> And his creative writing class, taught by Professor Billy Crystal, gives him an idea. This and watching Alfred Hitchcock's classical alien train, which gives DeVito the idea of ​​exchanging murders with Crystal, who hates his wife, Kate Mulgrut, who not only deceives him from the idea of ​​the book he wanted to write, but also continues Tony Ciccone's wolf. <br /> <br /> Throw some train on the train as strangers on the train, because DeVito seems to have ended his murder scheme. But Crystal has a problem that makes Ramsey even with Danny's help. This woman may need to be killed, but she will take it a lot. <br /> <br /> The only academic acclaim that has been thrown out of the train was the nomination for the best supporting actor for Anne Ramsey. Ramsey lost Olympia Dukakis to Moonstrucki, but the film turned out to be his best hour. Ramsey already had a sore throat that would eventually kill him next year, but look at the list of credits he'd managed to collect even after throwing a train, he worked until the end. <br /> <br /> I have seen interviews with both Throw Momma's train, Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito, and both have been happy to announce that Anne Ramsey, the mother of hell, succeeded in stealing the film and stole it under them. Recognizing them with Ramsey's talent and performance is the best possible tribute. <br /> <br /> When Marion Lorne was on a foreign train here, like Anne Ramsey, Farley Granger would be happy to join Robert Walker. Throw the mother on the train is one of the best black comedies out there, shouldn't be left out.
