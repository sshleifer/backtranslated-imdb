S. Epatha Merkerson shines in Nanny's eyes on this lively and vibrant look Rubeni Santiago, Jr. (Marcus Franklin) during his life as he grew up under the babysitter. The film is a good character for both Nanny and Ruben and, unlike so many of the memories made for the film, can realistically capture the ups and downs of life. The supportive majority adds many sparks and many recognizable faces appear in smaller roles, including Mos Def, Macy Gray, Terrence Dashon Howard, Rosie Perez, Louis Gossett, Jr., Liev Schreiber, Jimmy Smits, Ernie Hudson, Delroy Lindo, and Patricia Wettig. Loses a little steam and vitality to the end, and the final order leaves a little bit of feeling. But in general, this is a great film with a truly prominent Merkerson performance.
