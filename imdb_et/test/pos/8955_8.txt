There are, as many reviews have observed, a strong dark stripe on this movie. The director I am most reminded of is John Landis (yes, go ahead and let me understand what I am a peasant). Arcand has a gift to explore frivolous things in a dark, gray form, then turning around and exploring the horror of life with light vision. <br /> <br /> Cast is exceptionally above average. Thomas Gibson, like David, is a prominent and moody center around which the rest of the characters rotate. He speaks of good nihilists, but his actions reflect more love for his character than he is willing to admit. Gibson was already a strong and exquisite actor in 1993. It was hard to see her and see Greg Montgomery, not to mention the Criminal Minds agent Hotchner. <br /> <br /> Perhaps not the best scene, but what I enjoy most, my "recall scene" is the part where Candy is waiting for the visitor and one of the uninvited people will appear after the door. As Candy's interpersonal environment moves forward and further, David is growing as a banner, perkier, and more enthusiastic, like the Gen-X "Tigger".
