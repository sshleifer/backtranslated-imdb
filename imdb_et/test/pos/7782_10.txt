very rarely do i sit to comment on the movie ... but this movie !!!!!! oh my holy god !!!!!!!! ...... and never came to the movie better than this ...... it's the king of all comedies ..... <br /> <br /> amir khan is arguably the best COMIC actress in the Indian film industry ... Although it is funny to say that because he is a class act, not a comedian ... but what he has done in this movie is probably the most fun performance performed by every Indian actor in the racket. .. <br /> <br /> salman khan has never been a good actor for my eyes, but this movie got the best of him ... he was innocently comic ... ever the term was like this .... just that what the doctor ordered as far as his role in the film was concerned ... <br /> <br /> rajkumar santoshi I do not know why, did not try again in comedy. ... he led great ventures like Bhagat Singh and khakee legend, but he was unable to re-create the magic of Andaz Apna Apna. << br /> <br /> I don't care why this movie was bombarded in the box .... although I feel sad that the movie like "hum aap shark beautiful" was the reason why it couldn't ...... now i hope the rumors will come true ..... there is "andaz apna apna-2" what they say ....... we as the audience can only say AMEN !!!!!
