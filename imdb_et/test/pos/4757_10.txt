"The Seven Tops" seems like "The French Connection", which appeared two years earlier. Both late Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco perform as well as Bill Hickman, the leader of the stunts. <br /> <br /> But we are not dealing with French drugs; Instead, we are dealing with hoods and criminals confronted with war if a policeman is brutally killed by Hoodlum. We see the unpleasantness and the beginning of the 1990s in New York. <br /> <br /> I love watching this movie because it's exciting to see this action and it's a reminder of a cooler time. This means that when comparing cars, Hickman's participation in the three was the most comparable: the film, Bullitt and the French association. Every chase scene has its own features and it's just great. <br /> <br /> And I'm glad that this title has seen the daylight on the DVD.
