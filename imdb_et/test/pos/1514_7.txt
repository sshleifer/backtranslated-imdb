Lucio Fulc's cat is in the brain is an inventive and somewhat egotistic story about the director's decent crazy. This director is Fulci himself, who marks the film. Fulci has become a horror fan everywhere known as "gore godfather" and for good reason because he has given us some nasties and the toughest films that have given the silver screen grace; "Zombie 2" movie eyeball violence against a man who was killed by death with "The Beyond", a disc up to the full-length festival "New York Ripper"; if you want gore (and let's be honest who doesn't), Fulci is your man. But all that is meant for you and your similar gorehounds has taken Fulci's mental state and he's quick to get crazy from what he's filming. Fulci's problems do not end with his mental state, because his psychiatrist, who has seen his problem, has assumed a hobby by using Fulci's films as plans for murder. <br /> <br /> I have to say that acting in this movie is totally cruel. Especially there is one scene that includes whore and it is just a laugh, it works as well as stupidity. Fulci takes the lead in the film (probably). She is not an actor and it shows, but her performance is the best in the film. It's even safe to say that one whole, acting is a bad Italian horror movie. Of course, nobody is going to the Italian horror that awaits good action, so it's somewhat forgiving, but I think Fulci could have hired some better. Also, poor duplication does not help. But something that helps is that the horrible action is offset by a lot of gore and it is extreme to say it's the least! People can cut their heads, the woman is killed in the shower (and unlike Psycho, here we see it), people are hacked, fed to pigs and there are many and many cinemas best known. which delighted me any end. The amount of Gore is overwhelmingly overwhelming, giving the film something "junk", but Cat in Brain is obviously the tongue on the cheek. <br /> <br /> It would be difficult to make a movie about yourself and not to meet, because it is a bit big head, and Fulci has really come across this movie a bit big. His name is often mentioned and he is almost always on the screen; it is not too much different from "New Nightmare" in the ego bets, but it is obvious that it was a good time to do it, and one of us had fun watching it so we can forgive him some egotism. The end of the movie ends it - I saw it stay a mile, but then didn't really think that the film would take that path, but I was wrong; it was unfortunately. The end was cold for me and it is better to watch the movie when you turn it off just before the last two minutes. However, although it is an expired and terrible operation, Cat has a lot of fun and wants some end to Fulci enthusiasts, and that's why it's recommended.
