WARNING: PLOT SPOILER <br /> <br /> David Cronenberg's always abnormal movies are definitely a taste. The fans of his earlier films probably like "eXistenZ", but it is definitely not strange. All the common elements are here. A leather shop (backside), blood buckets, a bone-made weapon, and a manic mechanic whose name is just a few. The result is good in parts, some bad and in others just strange. But one thing the film has undeniable originality. Despite excessive use? Strange it proves that virtual reality games can have a dangerous effect on some people. In a movie, a person plays a dead person, claiming he is "annoying" (assuming he was still in the game). However, this leaves the question whether it really happened or when it happened in this stunning life-like game. "eXistenZ" leads to a conclusion that can be answered in many ways. <br /> <br /> Despite some extra gadgets and gooks, it was just your classic `it was all a dream? or it was twisted. This is a smart surprise and answers some questions, but bringing the whole movie to that moment is a bit of a disappointment. Only 97 minutes could have gone a little longer. In a special way, the film raises moral issues, but responds violently and in a rather inappropriate manner. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Jason Leigh is here in her first major role for some time now. But her character doesn't have enough features to jump on the screen or even give her a pleasant character. Jude Law, on the other hand (equipped with a hidden American accent) is good if your average Joe sucks into this abnormal world. We see the movie through our perspective. <br /> <br /> `eXistenZ 'is by no means flawless, but it is definitely a memorable movie experience. There are tons of strange features that match David Lynch's similar styles (what's next? - what's the question mark?!?!?!). Certainly it is not for every taste, but it is enough to recommend. My IMDb Rating: 6.2 / 10.
