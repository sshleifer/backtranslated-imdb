How can someone DARE say something like this? Pardon Mel Brooks is a brilliant comedian and a filmmaker that is funny every time he watches. <br /> <br /> For the first time I saw it, I cried so hard to laugh. All this is funny. <br /> <br /> Although "Robin Hood: Men's Tights" is not my favorite comedy ("Real Genius"), it is up in my book. So look at it! If you don't laugh all the time, at least you spend all the time on Cary Elwes.
