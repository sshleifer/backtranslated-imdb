I started to wait for it in the worst situation, I was happy that the film turned out to be enjoyable, partly partly confusing, as when all the righteous started to sing. This gave me the opportunity to see Daniel Wu for the first time, he is a better actor than I thought, sometimes he seemed a bit inappropriate. I thought the purple storm deserved to release its Hong Kong legends, because it differs from most other HK films, it is a kind of emotional struggle that stands in front of memory loss, it may seem like a runny nose, but when it finally does what and who it really is it makes the movie really interesting. When you get to the movie, you'll find that it keeps you busy, because if you miss a little bit, there's a lot of movie meaning, for example, I missed a little at the beginning and recommend it to anyone who watches it won't miss any of it. So I can say that this movie was remarkable and grateful to me for enjoying it.
