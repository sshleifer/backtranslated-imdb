Greystoke is undoubtedly the best tarzan movie I've ever seen. Christopher Lambert depicts a very unbelievable man who tries to return to the world of mankind alongside fantastic Ian Holm. John's struggle in the jungle and the monkeys who brought him up are quite confusing. Some very memorable scenes where Lambert makes the jungle voices a romantic interest, and a scene where he knows his father's death. Tarzan's feelings for both worlds are well developed and really know him. <br /> <br /> A great and underrated movie.
