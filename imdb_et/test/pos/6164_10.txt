Absolutely one of the best airline films of all time at so many levels. Hardware junkies casts the biggest single flying Spitfires massaging outside of the British battle. At least eight flying Spits are available for very precise ground and air lines. <br /> <br /> Those who admire air travel and get blurred in the eye, noting the high flight, the freedom of respect for central characters will be quick, free and high in their Dark Blue World. Warn: Romans and even dog students are treated very emotionally in this film. The main message is what many beasts share, because their best lessons, their lifetime, when they felt most alive, were actually everything when everything else was sad and gray. <br /> <br /> The plot is for Czech pilots fleeing their country when the Nazis invade and join the RAF free Czech stadium. There are some subplots, all of which are attentive. It's just an ordinary old great movie that loves even the toughest romantic love of anti-hardware (hold Kleenex at hand). Beautiful photography, first-rate action, accurate information on RAF life during the Great Britain battle. Just a candidate for every aviation enthusiast's DVD collection.
