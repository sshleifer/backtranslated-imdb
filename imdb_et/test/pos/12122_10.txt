Just got it by mail and I was positively surprised. As a big fan of the 70's, it doesn't take me very much when it comes to these valves. Despite the obvious low budget of this film, the actor is generally good and you can already see why Pesc had to be the greatest actor ever. I'm not sure how this movie is authentic, but it's sure it will contribute to the mobile genre .....
