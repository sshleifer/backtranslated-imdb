The DVD jacket, in which this film came, is described as "exhilarating and humorous". These are not the words I would have chosen - not a long shot. I would choose a word like "sombre", sometimes even "frustrating". That doesn't mean it's a bad movie. In fact, it is a pretty good movie with good results, whose uncertainty is rather uncertain about what happens at the end of what you look at. Uncertainty stems from the structure of the film - it seems to turn around Ellen's memories of her mother's slow cancer because she is questioned by DA. So we know from the beginning that there was something suspicious at the end - the questions are "what?" and who? "<br /> <br /> Renee Zellweger was great when Ellen - a somewhat frustrating daughter who has to give up her life and work in New York to return to her sick mother home. other character - when he learns to deal with the strengths and weaknesses of his parents. His relationship with his father (William Hurt) is quite interesting. My initial impression was that they were quite close, but the warts in the relationship will start to show after some time. effective as a separated spouse - he did not leave without impunity, but in the sense that he was unable to cope with what would happen to his wife, and in search of different ways to escape. Finally, Matel Streep, as Kate, was very convincing in this role, trying to to live out what is in his or her life in the most perfect way, he is concerned about the anger he feels for the growing weakening. lu me a little "ordinary people", although this movie was much less emotionally intense. So, not "resurrected and humorous" (all with respect to who wrote the DVD jacket summary), but in a very own way. 7/10
