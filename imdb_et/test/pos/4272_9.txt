Great show! Around time, the reality TV show that closes the generation gaps will rise. Competitors reach the age, some seem old enough to watch the movie for the first time. And others, it seemed so young that maybe parents or teachers gave the film hope, hoping it touched their lives as it ever touched. Fat has indeed become an American icon. Fat is a fun and entertaining film that young and old can communicate with. "You're the one we want", we're sure we'll get even more fat followers. The only thing I want was more character history, then again it is nice to leave some of that 50's nostalgic imagination. Don't wait to watch the next show ... and then on Broadway !!!
