Some time ago, we read the results of some newspaper sportsmen polls. The questions asked were only two and were short and correct. <br /> <br /> Question number 1 asked the respondent to say who was his beloved college football team. Question number 2 asked the fan to name their most hateful college football team. The answer to both questions was simple, Notre Dame! ND is the top of both lists! Yes, love or hate, but certainly not ignore it. The unique position of this unique college football amplifier is found in one's life and career. , an adult, a small immigrant Norweigen boy in Chicago, named Knute Rockne. The 1930s crash. It was about 10 years after the movie was released. This would mean that the initial work on the project started about 8 years after the great loss of our nation on Mr Rockne. <br /> <br /> His similarity and voice were well-known from newspaper, radio, and moving picture news rolls. Both Knute's widow, Bonnie Skiles Rockne and the University of Notre Dame had the approval rights to choose an actor to play the lead and play the script correctly. We think they would not have been able to do the job better. Pat O'Brien looks really part and was himself a college footballer. Ronald Reagan is cast by George Gipp **, a free spirited student who goes to the heart of the Notre Dame Baseball Fellowship! He was a football player. <br /> <br /> Cast runners are full of talented players. We have Griffith Veteran, Donald Crisp as Fr. Callaghan, C.S.C., President of Notre Dame. Albert Basserman on Fr. Newland, Chemistry Prof and Rockne Mentor. Gail Page appears like Mrs. Bonnie Skiles Rockne. Owen Davis, Jr. is the Rockne cohort, Gus Dorais (past historical ND vs. ARMY game at West Point.) <br /> <br /> Kane Richmond, Nick Lukats, William Marshall and William Byrne are cast in four Horsemen. Real Life Big Time College Coaches Howard Jones, Pop Warner, Bill Spaulding, and Amos Alonzo Stagg appear in Congressional Probe colleagues for sports and add authentic touch. <br /> <br /> As for the biological, KNUTE ROCKNE ALL-AMERICAN !, everyone can say that it hits the ground and did not slow down from start to finish. There is also no wasted time. The entire screen time is used to move the story. <br /> <br /> Notre Dame's Choir, the University's own, and all of this Brass Band's money-making march music use all the ads to feel really staying there. *** <br /> <br /> * that day, even though their basketball team and other sports teams compete at the Big East conference, Notre Dame NCAA football remains independent. This means that The Fighting Irish has actually played a national schedule. <br /> <br /> ** There was no such agreement with the George Gipp family. A few years ago, the trial took place over a young scene depicting Mr Gippi, which gave the famous "Win Onr for The Gipper Speech". This KNUTE ROCKNE ALL-AMEICAN television printout was minus the speech death bed scene. <br /> <br /> *** The other Notre Dame films were made over the years. NOTRE DAME SPIRIT (Universal 1931) performed as a coach similar to Rockne by J. Farrell McDonald. It also had Lew Ayers, Andy Devine Nat Pendleton, as well as members of the real Notre Dame Championship teams who had four real horsemen. Then, of course, RUDY (Tri-Star 1993) with Sean Astin, Jon Favreau, Ned Beatty and Charles Dutton. They also talked about an unacceptable film that criticizes Notre Dame, named GOLDEN GLORY, but nothing has materialized, is it? (Let me know, Dear Reader, THANX !!) <br /> <br /> **** Warner Brothers were always very good at opening music and casual music. In this Rockne movie they have added NOTRE DAME FIGHT SONG. Together with this, STEP NOTRE DAME and NOTRE DAME ALMA MATER, premiered in 1930 at Rockne's funeral in Notre Dame's basilica.
