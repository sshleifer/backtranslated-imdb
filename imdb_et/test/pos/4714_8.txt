I found this movie on TV. I had never heard of it before and almost changed the channel, but it grabbed me quickly. <br /> <br /> The story of the Burmese people's struggle for military dictatorship was provocative. The difficulty that some are willing to hold is hard to believe. It makes me grateful to live in a country where the government cannot shoot people on the streets. <br /> <br /> The story of Laura Bowman was a good thread for political struggle.
