From the very beginning, I like Sam Elliott's character (Falon): a reliable partner who is very loyal to his partner. But too loyal and too revengeful when he sees his partner dead in shape, because he kills who thought he was an attacker before giving him the opportunity to explain. The Falcon is an alcoholic and tends to deviate from self-control, although he is able to direct his attention to those who are really behind their partners' death. He is also a newcomer to his new partner (which seems to be too often seen in the film), but Esai Morales does well in the accompanying Sam Elliot, though the amazing pieces begin to fit, where Morales begins his own research on Falon; he wants to find answers mainly because Fallon doesn't let him put the whole story in and he doesn't like what he finds. There is no last-minute show who is a bad detective that's okay; and they cannot let Fall in their joining, leading to a dramatic end. Fine is all the way, with a sense of humor, Paul Sorvino, the captain of the detective. This is a good movie that makes you see many times; so it qualifies as a good vision and a good addition to movie collection! (Filmed in San Francisco)
