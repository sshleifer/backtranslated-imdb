Alfred Hitchcock has done a lot of brilliant thrillers, and many of them have gone on to be greeted as the greatest films of all time. One movie that tends to lose some of it under Vertigo and Psycho is the film; Strangers on the train, the most impressive movie ever made by Hitchcock. The story follows the tennis and Guy Haines, who is soon to be the senator's daughter when she is divorced from her current spouse. One day he sees his wife with mental instability on Bruno Anthony on board the train and soon gets to the murder plot that he can't stop or stop; and what might end up paying for his life. <br /> <br /> Inter-train conversation between Bruno and Guy is one of the most intriguing and thoughtless provocations of the cinema all the time. What if two people exchanged murders, thus solving all suspicions of crime and making their motive irrelevant? Would this really be a perfect murder? What makes this movie even more intimidating is that the events that Guy drives can happen to every ordinary everyday person. Everyone has someone with whom they would like to get rid of, so when you met a crazy man on a train, what makes you murder and forces you to do it? Its chances are unlikely, but it is the idea that everyone can be a murderer who is central to a foreign train; and in this situation someone can. <br /> <br /> Is there an actor on earth who could have better described Bruno Anthony's character as Robert Walker? The man was just born for this part. He succeeds in capturing the right mood for his character and commanding absolutely every scene he is. Bruno's character is crazy, but he's not crazy; he is a computational person and Robert Walker makes this character credible. His performance is extremely malicious and small enough to hold the character firmly within reality. Unfortunately, Robert Walker died just one year after the release of the stranger train, and I believe it is a big hit in the cinema. Someone cast does not look as much as Walker does, but it is worth noting is his co-star Farley Granger. Granger has never impressed so much, but his performance is good and he has his own Walker. It is also remarkable in his performance that he depicts his character as a very normal person; and so it should be. Ruth Roman is Guy's wife. He's not really in the movie to make a lasting impression, but he does the best he can. Patricia, the daughter of Alfred Hitchcock, takes the final role of four central roles, such as Barbara, the sister of Guy's groom. She is lovingly in this role and she tends to steal the many scenes she has. <br /> <br /> Alfred Hitchcock's direction is always sublime, and it is very much in this movie. In particular, there is one shot that sees the murder of a film in the reflection of sunglasses. This is an absolutely brilliant shot that creates a great atmosphere for the scene. Hitchcock's direction is always moody, and it is very much like the film's noir style. The climax of the film is both remarkable and exciting, and I don't think anyone except Hitchcock could have drawn the big influence that the film showed. It's really overdone and out of the rest of the movie; but it works. There is a reason why Hitchcock is often called the greatest director of all time and that is because it does not only use the script to tell the story of the movie, but also uses the camera to do it. The strangers on the train are one of the greatest thrillers ever made. His story is both intriguing and thought-provoking, and certainly a cinema fan. Masterpiece.
