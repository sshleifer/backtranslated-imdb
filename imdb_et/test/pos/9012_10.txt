I've never been forced to write anything, but seeing such a bad overview of such an innovative exhibition made me say something. First, people just have to overcome the fact that the votes are different. When you look at an episode, it will never ever come to mind. Humor is original and, though yes, some jokes are overwritten, they are delivered fresh. Some of this is even reminiscent of Shrek - self-expressing humor. Many of these jokes are aimed at teenagers or original fans of the film as much as twenty and younger. Patrick Warburton and Eartha Kitt are both fun because they repeat their roles, as Kronk and Yzma and their Annie Award candidates were well secured. <br /> <br /> This exhibition takes time to love, really enter "things, so to speak. If you ignore the terrible song song (which really shouldn't guarantee that the way it is, it's just 30 seconds the whole product), this exhibition is ridiculous fun and does not lose the spirit of Emperor New Groove.
