This is a great movie. When two different backgrounds and social status people think they have nothing to offer and eventually they need what the heart knows what the heart knows. Sometimes we think why one man is a woman or vice versa, and external appearances say one thing in our eyes, but what they offer to each other is that we can't see it is amazing and inexplicable. When the Name thought Matthew had nothing to offer him and if Matthew was just looking for an escape (because he had an open marriage with his wife Jenny), they finally realized that they couldn't and did not want to exist without the other. It was worth them that they correspond to what the family and friends thought and what the society said was together. This film restores my faith in love.
