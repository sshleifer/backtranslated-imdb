I'll make it short and sweet. It is not surprising that you did not benefit from this movie. This is the story of the power, beauty and opportunities of meaningful education. Based on your pathetic comments, I see that your own education has been horribly neglected ... or worse ... completely wasted. Your comments are the comments of a truly unknown person. I would advise you to do something about this condition ... but in your case, I feel it's probably too late. I hope you do not intend to go to the profession of a teacher (especially in film education) because you cannot only do harm. Oh ... one last tip. In the future, if you intend to write more opinions, you should really correct your work. It makes people take you seriously.
