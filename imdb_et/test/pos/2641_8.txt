While I keep my predecessor as the "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" standard, which should be compared to other teen comedies, "The Wild Life" is one of the smaller known movies and worthy of the time when you can name it. I believe that the label says: "FTARH manufacturers, something faster." That certainly applies. Although it may not be the first to deal with, for example, the first dates, teen sex and abortion, "Wild Life" is still a big flick. It's pure chaotic fun, especially thanks to Chris Penn's ultimate character, Thomas Drake. If Spicoll had high coke instead of weeds, he would be Drake. Eric Stoltz is excellent in his first important role as it is a straight-line Bill Conrad. Two characters work well with each other. Think younger, Hyper Odd Couple, with 80's gloss. Outside these films, it's so worth mentioning with this film. Lea Thompsom has never seen petting, especially when she was working in a donut shop. Jenny Wright is just cheerful and fun to watch. Rick Moranis plays a big joke / pervy who dies in pants. The friends of Thomas Drake wrestlers are hysterical, especially Benny, a little Puerto Rica boy who says some memorable features. Especially that she screams out at night in the striptease club, I had the first floor when I first saw it. It says something! Finally, one of the best 80 scenes in the movie ends with a movie. Pay attention to Ron Wood's special performances from Rolling Stones, Leo Penn (father of Sean and Chris Penn) and random Michael Jackson. Throw anything other than a man himself, Eddie Van Halen, and you can't go wrong. For Van Hagar fans, keep your ears open for reefs in albums such as 5150, OU812 and illegal meat knowledge. <br /> <br /> If anything interferes with the film's flow, this small sub-block is involved in Randy Quaid's burnt Vietnamese vet. It just seems to be inappropriate and unnecessary. Moreover, it is almost perfect. If you are a meaningless but fun fan of 80's movies and have not seen it yet, you are something special. RENT IT NOW !!! <br /> <br /> p. -Credits say Cameron Crowe has one policeman as a movie. Has his back been turned during his scene because I haven't found him yet. Someone please help me.
