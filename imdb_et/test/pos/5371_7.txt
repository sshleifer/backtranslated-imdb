Not everyone likes this movie. It's still one of the best "you have to think about" movies ever made about Satanism. The fact that it has no MTV jump or gore every seven minutes is irrelevant. They also speak of someone who actually knows what Satanists, the film (spoiler warning!), Part of, where brotherhood exchanges their old bodies for those older children who have a truly scary scene. The section where (the second spoiler message) Strother Martin arranges the transition is almost hyper-real as it uses very few special effects that are a feature of this movie. McEveet was rarely given a big budget, but it was often effective. He also worked in this case.
