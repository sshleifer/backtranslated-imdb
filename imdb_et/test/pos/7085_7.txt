"One real thing" puts Zellweger in the middle of a family crisis as an adult journalist who returns home to take care of his dead mother (Streep). Somber and plodding, the film explores the adult child reaches the adult view of their parents as they slowly turn out to be something less than ideal he grew knowing as a child. Excellent character training and little effort, "OTT" offers three of the best actors from three top actors and some reflective thoughts about life and death.
