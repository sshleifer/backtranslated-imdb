It was seen at Hong Kong International Film Festival more than three years ago. I went without hopes because Christopher Nolan was not a name at that time, but it seemed interesting and turned out to be one of the best things I saw at this festival. It worked well on the big screen, where the scenes were cut out sequentially, adding mood. Mr.Nolan gave a good overview at the end of making it, so he turned someone into a filmmaker! I liked it better than Memento, though it was perhaps because of lower expectations. And the fact that it was rather an art house movie.
