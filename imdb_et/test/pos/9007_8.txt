New voices scare me! Kuzco no longer has to repeat to become Caesar again! It's the same thing again and again, isn't it? It's a children's show, right? Yzma makes Kuzco like a stupid animal. He is learning a lesson. ALL IS THE SAME !!!!! David Spade and John Goodman never returned ... Nothing changes because Disney does nothing. This is probably one of the slowest shows! The first movie was so damn better! Malina is probably the only person I like. Kuzco is so funny! The crown has slowed down! And Yzma slowed ER (if it's even a word)! What would I say is ... How do you, Disney ... why?
