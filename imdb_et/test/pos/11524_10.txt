Serendipity. I thought I had started off badly by taking the wrong DVD for "The Intruder". Rental Workers! So I didn't want to see this movie, but I'm glad I did. Probably the film I had chosen would not have been as nice a film as the delightful and delicate taste that both the US and European independent can do. Seven years after, two heroine sisters start a fantastic journey through the student demo in the early 1970s / Baader-Meinhof Europe. Excitedly fired in Algarve in Portugal; In Berlin, Paris and Amsterdam (reminiscent of the exterior feelings of Paul Verhoeven's early masterpiece "The Fourth Man"), Brewster, Diaz and especially Christopher Ecclestone have acted intact. capturing the ephemeral emotions of their characters when faced with these relationships and seeing each other and their ideal images. Film with high precision and taste. Not for Arnie Commando fans, which is probably the reason why the top assessor is so wide in their brand that it is a girly movie. Daft Criteria. False too. It's worth a try.
