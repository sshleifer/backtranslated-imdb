It's obviously inspired by Se7en and sometimes even tougher; more bloodshed and very graphic details (a bit too much for my taste). Great script and action (especially impressed by Ken Stott and lack of weaknesses). Good cinematography and very realistic stereo sound. One of the best thrillers I've seen for years. Although it was planned in the BBC in three parts, I looked at Messiah to watch one video. One critic point; the motivation of the villain was not very convincing.
