The "big dictator" is undoubtedly one of Charlie Chaplin's most famous films. It is infamous for Adolf Hitler and the blatant satire of Nazism. Until I saw it, I only knew its fame. Now I know how much this film deserves. <br /> <br /> The film basically shows somewhat clumsy, ambitious, short melting and impressive dictator, Tomania, with Adenoid Hyn; and with him, his close and dear staff: Field-Marshall Herring and Herr Garbitsch. It also involves the use of amnesia, an emotional and often clumsy Jewish hairdresser, a veteran of the First World War. <br /> <br /> I want to say that this movie has different features that make it both unique and wonderful. Although comedy is decisively verbal as well as shock-proof and casual, the whole film shows how seriously Nazism or aggressive nationalism takes on a different interlude. The magnitude of Chaplin's impeccable ability to act is far from the movie and he continues until he just explodes. Paulette Goddard's position as an ambitious Jewish revolver and Henry Daniell's nose, calm-death-serious-like-a-heart attack gives excellent viewing. <br /> <br /> Next, one aspect of the movie is what makes it so special: it doesn't pull the strokes. It is not "hidden", it has no hidden business. It's so obvious, blatant, your face, and the obvious light of Hitler and Nazism. <br /> <br /> In short, look at it briefly. Look at it, you see it.
