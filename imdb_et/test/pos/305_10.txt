Movies seem to fall into two categories: films that strengthen existing social values ​​and beliefs and those who challenge them. This film is a 180-degree shift from idealistic rhetoric, featured in offers such as "Longest Day" and "Green Berets", which seem to be compared to Disney's fantasies. "Apocalypse Now!" project, production and performance film, "The Heart of Darkness", a renewed psychological horror story of postmodern diversity of late 20th century. The cast and the team who worked on it might have been related to the terrifying human minds can achieve. This is the original character of Joseph Conrad, Kurtz, who came to the literature in 1901, and later referred to the "Eliot" Hollow Men (Mistah Kurtz, he died) in 1925. Although Conrad's "Heart of Darkness" does not speak directly. (1901) or the first experience of Vietnam, "Apocalypse Now!" is a masterpiece that pushed the envelope of cinematographic potential. "Apocalypse" does not only mean the "horrors" of war itself, such as the "attack" and "deer hunter", but the darker feelings of human nature, which are manifested through the crude and degrading confrontations of violent conflicts. Apocalypse now! is not as much observed as experienced. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie is trained by a secret wage assassin, Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen, tour-de-force show), a boat on the US military that travels through an unnamed river in the heart of Vietnam and Cambodia few westerners are changing. His mission is to stop Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), an officer of the Army Special Forces Division, who was expensive in the US military until he went to AWOL and renegade in the deep, uncharted jungles of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. The official classified report is that the colonel has gone crazy, but when the events are playing, something has happened to him that is more frightening than just madness. Sheen's mission is to make the Colonel's American public smarter. <br /> <br /> Film is rather episodic. The ride on the river is made up of several vignettes, such as Sheen and his team, with different independent "aspects" of war. The 1970s American audiences probably had never seen such a film before, except for "The Deer Hunter" released last year. The first and most notable is the helicopter battalion headed by Col Kilgore (a Robert Duvall Oscar-nominated performance) who crosses Robert General Lee and Richard Wagner. He loves to play "Valkyry's Race" from Wagner's "Ring" when he cheats helpless villages. His line "I Love Napalm's Smell in the Morning" is one of those quoted lines of cinema timings. Other meetings include an amphitheater where entertainment is offered by Hugh Heffner and Playboy bunnies. <br /> <br /> Despite all the production catastrophes that prevented it from being shot in, the remarkable aspect of this movie is its pace. The original edition (not the latest version of Redux) makes the building work fine until the viewer is emotionally prepared to deal with the climate conflict between Willard and Kurtz. The strange discourse between Willard and Kurtz is worth the entrance price. And some Sheen and Brando shots in some places are some of the tougher and more horrible movies ever made on film. Even Clive Barker, Wes Crave or David Cronenberg do not like Coppola's terrible image. Brando Kurtz in one scene is so frightening that most other horror movies seem to be comparable, due to the fact that horror is not without, but inside. <br /> <br /> Without too much Coppola's solution to the climate image is one of the most innovative film art manifestations. According to the documentary "Hearts of Darkness", Coppola feared that the inevitable final scene would expire in the melodrama and that the darker tones of the film would be in danger. He was not sure how he could do it until his wife encouraged the director to witness the sacrificial sacrifice of the bull, practiced by local people, with whom Coppola used as an extreme in Kurtz's "his" village. After viewing, Coppolal was the end, and it is one of the most disturbing and beautiful sequences in American filmmaking history. Love it or hate it, no Western viewer is the same after seeing the same scene. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for every taste, as Conrad's original novel is not what is read on airplanes. It's not just violence and the pointlessness of violence that most American viewers absorb. It is the naked revelation of the aspects of the human being that seem so far removed that this film is difficult for the average filmmaker to handle, which should be. Coppola didn't make a family picture. But if the viewer understands your bigger point, you can get a lot of Apocalypse Now. If you are looking for a movie experience to confirm the already existing attitudes of American sensitivity and heroism, it is better to stay with John Wayne. But if you're ready for those places you've never had, even outside the "war evil" rhetoric, "Apocalypse now" takes you to a world you thought you had never been to before, and the disturbing part is that you you can recognize it.
