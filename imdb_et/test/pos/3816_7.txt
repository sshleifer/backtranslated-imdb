This film had to look at my interest many times. There are holes in the plot, but managers are working on it. <br /> <br /> Catherine Mary Stewart (Julia Kerbridge) does an excellent job for a 37-year-old woman who has sacrificed everything else to become a doctor. He worked for years to earn money to go to a medical school. She fills her home perfectly and is almost ready to take her exam and realize her dream. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Julia's sister and brother-in-law are murdered, and the closest living relative is forced to take her niece Amanda (Arlen Aguayo-Stewart) to prevent her becoming a congregation. Amanda is about 7 years old in appearance. Amanda is so traumatized by her parents' murder that she is silent. Needless to say, Julia's 16-hour days take care of Amanda. <br /> <br /> Rob Lowe plays Kevin Finney, a charming neighbor in his apartment house, who is making his way into the lives of Julia and Amanda. She's always with a trick or joke to help Amanda solve her stress. Amanda really starts to warm up with Kevin as the film progresses, perhaps more than her aunt. Julia starts to rely on Kevin to take part in taking care of Amanda when she tries to handle her case load and prepare for her board trial. Kevin is always where Julia's crisis breaks out. <br /> <br /> Chemistry of Robi and Catherine Mary was great. You look to see them gather before the movie ends. The chemistry of Robi and Arlen was also good. Arlen managed to make a lot of use of the words. On the plot Julia and Amanda were gradually warming up to each other. You see, the movies are developing in relationships. <br /> <br /> We discover that Julia's sister and brother (Meyers) were involved with industrial espionage. They stole the microchip of a very valuable prototype from their employer. They had three associates who wanted to share the revenue from the theft. Julia discovers that Meyers is going to skip the country's presumed identity. It is unclear on the plot whether Meyers wants to double his associates or was baptized twice. <br /> <br /> In any case, Meyers are killing two former associates in their homes. The killers did not attempt to kill the microchip location before Meyers. Killers are looking for a home and can't find their prize. They leave their criminal witness, Amanda. The killers then kill the rest of the movie, making terrible attempts at Julia and Amanda to extract a microchip that has no idea where the prize is. In the end, the killers abduct Amanda in the hope that she knows something about the location of the microchip. <br /> <br /> Finally, Julia discovers the truth about Kevin. He is a researcher recruited to restore a stolen microchip. After some harsh moments in the relationship, they manage to save Amanda and send the bad guys. The predicted end is the three forming families and happily moving together in the future. <br /> <br /> What hit me on this plot was big holes. Kevin moves to the same apartment building as Julia and Amanda on the day after the murder of Meyers. How does he know that the microchip is not already in the hands of the killers? Killers leave their fingerprints clean at the place of murder without knowing their identity. The killer, pretending to be a psychiatrist, appears to Amanda on the red remnants of her footwear murder picture. At the beginning of the movie, he was not shown in the murder scene. There are many more to mention. <br /> <br /> The film could have been much better if the script had been improved before filming. Filling the holes in the plot would have added little cost and significantly improved efforts.
