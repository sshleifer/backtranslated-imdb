The only reason Duke Is Tops, one of several "racial films" made during segregation, is worth mentioning today because it made the debut of 21-year-old singer Lena Horne. He plays Ethel Andrews, a singer who has to leave his producer's mentor Duke Davis (Ralph Cooper) to film for a long time. However, Davis must fake if he has taken money for his services, so he will not regret it. Then the team, along with Dr. Dorando (Lawrence Criner), has a whole range of drugs all over the south. Meanwhile, in New York, his new producers have been bombing a lot of time because they made the whole show, not just a specialty. Davis finds out about the radio and offers his service as a producer and band leader to bring his line of other professional activities, many of which make one of his little or only film performances here, so his chance to stay with Ethel at great time. theme. Guess what happens? Although the plot is what you have seen in thousands of musical music during this time, it makes this audience one of the most exciting features I've seen in this month of black history. Mr. Horne's song is here with a good display and it is interesting to see that he is so young before his professionalism takes his career later. Among other supportive players, IMDb is unverified, Lillian Randolph's appearance, Annie in my favorite movie. after not being treated for Duke's medication before explaining Duke, he explains it to the feet! And like a long-time resident of Louisiana, I would like to mention two of the players here: Joel Fluellen Monroe as a toner and Marie Bryant from New Orleans as a sexy dancer who appears near his musical climax. So only Lena Horne alone, Duke is Tops at least once worth it.
