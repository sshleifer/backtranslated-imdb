I was very happy to see Rock Star because I'm a big fan of Mark Wahlberg. I was surprised that I liked it more than I originally thought. The script left something unwanted, but movie shows for that. There were a few moments when Spinal Tapi's visions rushed back and I can't help but I think this movie would have been better than a documentary. But I ground. <br /> <br /> Wahlberg continues to showcase her talents as she plays a regular man with credibility, whose greatest dream comes true. It does it with a miracle and innocence that makes you not only believe it, but also make you truly caring for your character. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Aniston, who has never impressed me in movies, is a surprisingly good girlfriend / leader. He shows more real emotion than I've seen in his latest films combined. <br /> <br /> But first and foremost, this is the music in the movie that really attracts you. - Bon Jov would have an 80-seat music fan who praises his location, the movie really tends to go with the original Steel Dragon songs and Wahlberg's results. <br /> <br /> I plan to see this movie again, but first I hurry up and buy a soundtrack!
