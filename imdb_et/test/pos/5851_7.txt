Rating: 7 out of 10. Director Barbet Schroeder. If you like Hitchcock's "Rope", this movie likes it. "Numbers murders" stars Sandra Bullock is a psychologically disturbed but brilliant police detective Cassie Mayweather. His partner is Sam Kennedy, a non-discriminatory detective played by Ben Chaplin. Teenage killers are secondary school students Richard Haywood (Ryan Gosling) and Justin Pendleton (Michael Pitt). These young psychotics prove their superiority by making a perfect murder and escaping it, but the closeness of capture is exciting and exciting to at least one killer. <br /> <br /> Supporting characters are the police chief, the district commissioner, and the high school caretaker you kill. The film reminds me of a variety of Hitchcock films that go beyond the "Law and Order" TV show. We see fair police work and it is really interesting to see what clues the followers follow and what they are not. <br /> <br /> Another movie movie story is related to Cassie Mayweather's past and imprisonment ex. Most viewers found this aspect of the movie unnecessarily and slowly, but I found this story in the most intriguing part. <br /> <br /> "Numbers of Murder" is a nicely designed movie, if you are looking for a safe, or should I say dangerous, mystery of murder. Try more excitement and tension for "Se7en" or "Dial M for Murder".
