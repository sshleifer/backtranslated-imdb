Another black comedy that won the Oscar for the best scenario. George C in Scott's starring role redefines the phrase "tearing up new $ $ holes". In this case, the goal is the American Medicare and grand hospitals system. Patients and doctors die throughout the hospital because their names and recipes are changing. Scott screams, screams, and breaks his staff and bosses as they fail. His comment on Dachau to one of his many superiors is definitely a laugh. She even wins and rapes hippie three times. It has to be seen AND heard as monologues and soliloquies are the main points of the film.
