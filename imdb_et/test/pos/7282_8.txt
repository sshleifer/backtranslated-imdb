I was pleasantly surprised to find a very enjoyable movie that keeps my attention all over. I'm a horrorist and I see almost everything in this genre, but Dead Line was able to get me out. The speed is very smartly set and Andr√©s Bagg is making good despair. What is the main plot? Journey to madness. How would you do that? Martin Sanders asks him if he sees homeless people talking to him on the street. At the end of the film, Aaron Mandel's character asks the same question when he sees the other homeless doing the same thing; still unknown that this homeless is Martin Sanders, answering the question about the beginning of the film. Two-piece broken glasses are a clear symbol of personality breakdown and division. The end is the jaw dropping and you just know you have to make a sequel.
