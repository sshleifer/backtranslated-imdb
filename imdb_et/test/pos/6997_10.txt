I really enjoyed this movie. It was nervous without a sociopath. Vin Diesel brought Riddick's character to life and made you feel good and bad on different levels. <br /> <br /> I also saw that Iron Giant and Vin are perfect. (Snowmobile movie - oh yeah, it's called "Triple-X" or "xXx" - was a weak example of his work.) He's a hero playing in Pitch Black. I don't think you win a mistake when Vin stands for a movie. Unfortunately, Hollowood can write an adventure movie - wrong! I think the "XXX" script was weak, for which Vin couldn't do that. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Pitch Black is a great scifi - look at it! <br /> <br /> - Zafoid
