As mentioned earlier in one of my great reviews, FLASH GORDON's Universal Pictures trilogue should not be classified with other series. Because these three have indeed made a sort of celluloid-electronic mythology for the World War in the mid-twentieth century. They stand in the minds of many people as an example of what was the angle of inclination. <br /> <br /> We can remember that Buster Crabbhe is a guest at NBC late night, TOMORROW, organized by Tom Snyder. It was around 1979-80. During the interview, Mr. Crabbel was asked about his personal fitness habits. She wore weight training and swimming with some healthy eating habits that included vitamin and protein supplements. (And would you believe that he smoked several cigarettes!) <br /> <br /> Of course, Snyder got the theme of his portrayal (and strong identification) in the nature of Flash. Buster noted that he had read and enjoyed the original media, a comic that belongs to the qualities of King Hearst. He noted that he thought it wouldn't work when he was transferred to the screen! Fortunately, he was wrong. <br /> <br /> For the first series, it was a very good fit to adapt the original consistency from Sunday Color Comics. The world is about to end, because the impending collision is Planet Mongo. It depends on Dr. Zarkov, who is working independently, to change his natural planet. He releases Flash and Miss Dale Arden's help, the newly-familiar paratroopers from the plane, landing on Zarkov's property. </p> <p> </p> <p> <p> Serial has a thrill and succeeds in feeling that there is always some other danger that just hides in the frame of the movie. The costume and furnishings are varied, ranging from the novel to Orientalen to Art Decco. It would be easy to assume that this was due to universality, but again it was loyal to the visual concepts of the creator, the cartoonist Alex Raymond (see the old bands in multiple collections). used before JUST IMAGINE! (Fox 1930), a fantastic musical comedy. Other research laboratory equipment was provided by Universal's proportional departments, being the top Hollywood company that makes Horror and SciFi. <br /> <br /> The cast features are Jean Rogers (Dale Arden) and Priscilla Lawson (Princess Aura) who get into good girls with a bad girl's battle over Flash. Charles Middleton depicts Ming's kind of melodramatic villain, but makes it work. Zarkov (Frank Shannon) has been tinted by the mad madness he suffered as a result of his appearance on newsprint. (By the way, always wonder how Zar-Kov has a brogue?) Richard Alexander makes a fine, powerfully built Prince Barini, who is once helpful and so noble. <br /> <br /> Comic actor Jack "Tiny" Lipson is a surprise cast, steal scene after a scene like lecherous, Henry VIII as a scoundrel turned ally, King Vultan, ruler of Hawkmen. Among others, the best known is Jim Pierce as Prince Thun of Lion Men. Pierce, like Crabbe, also depicted Tarzan in the movie, but later married with Tarzan's creator, Edgar Rice's Bourroughs daughter, Joan. <br /> <br /> FLASH GORDON and the two sequences, FLASH GORDON TRIP TO MARS (1938) and FLASH GORDON CONQUERS THE UNIVERSE (1940) have been the main juvenile ticket for generations, first in film houses, then on television. Like good wine, they were better at age. <br /> <br /> We are all so happy that Mr. Crabbe was wrong.
