The word impossible has led many to choose a particular view of an incredible task. In 1927, it was believed that no man could fly the Atlantic soul. Many had tried but failed and some even gave their lives to their efforts. Nevertheless, this had to be done because each challenge must be satisfactorily resolved. This is the heart of this "Holy Spirit of Spirit" film. The actor chosen for this historical film is nothing more than American's own James Stewart, who is convincingly playing Charles Lindbergh. Although there are many facets of Lindbergh's life, the emphasis here is on his efforts to be the first person to fly across the Atlantic. The story is interesting and for Stewards fans who are very convincing. In an effort to provide sufficient resources to build a special aircraft, a fateful decision to start a journey on May 1927, "Luck Lindy", when baptized, suffered enormous risks in this great movie. Other signs that helped believe this movie are Murray Hamilton, who plays Bud Gurney, Bartlett Robinson Ben Mahoney, Arthur Space, and Charles Watts as O.W. Schultz. The total sum of this now famous movie is that, despite its bad debut approval, it has become a classic right. Well done! ****
