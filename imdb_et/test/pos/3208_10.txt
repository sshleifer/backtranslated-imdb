Gilmore Girls is one of the funniest, brightest, sharpest, sarcastic and heart-warming TV shows I've ever watched (the second only to my favorite TV channel, F * R * I * E * N * D * S). Fast pace and many pop culture references can confuse some viewers, but if you catch up on Gilmore's roads, you're committed to life. Just some random comments, I recently (finally) started watching Season 6 and wow! This is one of my favorite seasons so far. I love Luke-Lorelai's affair and all the drama in different episodes is (as always) inspiring. The only thing I am not so fond of is the surprising bad attitude and the reckless action that Rory has suddenly "accepted". Unfortunately, I don't find it very realistic and I hope it is not just a way to boost the drama to keep the season strong. Everything is in great season and I can't wait for the next !!!
