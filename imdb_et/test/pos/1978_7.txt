Now, being a sci fi fan, this movie trailer also saw a little how to do it, Hollywood. But after watching it, I can happily say that it has impressed me. Jude is a class actor and Miss Leigh pulls it better than Delores Clairborne. It reminds me of movies like Matrix, 12 Monkeys and The Cell, which may not sound, but it's really one of the best movies I've ever seen.
