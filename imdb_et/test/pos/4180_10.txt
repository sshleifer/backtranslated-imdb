In less than 90 minutes, he will succeed not only in the age-capsule, but also in the full-length experimental function that breaks time, space and agreement so that only the underground films of the sixties can. recording these films. No matter how Monkeys seems to be, this is a film that every filmmaker should see, as it will open up the endless possibilities of the film as an artistic tool.

Learning to edit a movie is much more important and exciting than what is actually on the film, and there are some great things (big songs, great cinema, etc.). It should be seen after midnight for maximum effect because it is a general dream. In 1968, the time of social unrest and the call to change were changing (hence the title of the film "Changes") and HEAD reflected this time.
