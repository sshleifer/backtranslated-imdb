This movie was played continuously on Disney Channel when I was a little younger, and I really remember it. But I wasn't very delicious at this time (not to say I'm doing it now) so I can't take good care of my nine-year-old. The film was probably 7/10, but he had great music so I gave him an extra point. Yes, it's worth a look. I know some fans of this movie know what a particular song is - what will appear when it is in a car accident. The song is "Love Love Song" by Jaguars and it is very difficult to find and get. In fact, this movie is also. I can't find it anywhere on the web or on DVD or VHS. I'd like to see it again so I can evaluate if it was really a good movie. Oh well.
