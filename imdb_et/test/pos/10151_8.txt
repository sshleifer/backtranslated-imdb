One of the finest films by Alfred Hitchcock is the story of America and his family (James Stewart, Doris Day and their young son) who are resting in North Africa. Stewart is a doctor and the day is a world famous singer. They meet a Frenchman who speaks the native language and helps them get out of the local bus. Later, the Frenchman whispers something in Stewart's ear when he is attacked and dead. The rest of the movie is a puzzle because Stewart tries to save them and solve the mystery. The film is mysterious and strange from exotic locality to odd events. You never know what's going on in this movie, why people appear, until the end, and even then you're not sure. The last scene takes place in Albert Hall and is one of the most famous films that lasts for 12 minutes without dialogue. Hitchcock had originally made this film in 1934.
