An excellent action can best be rewarded with a melodramatic script that truly enhances the human spirit. Take heart to all those minions who are attacking every day! Your patience is virtuous. Probability is your patience and dignity, in a way you never see. This is your big story. I don't think you can look through the moisture in this hardened eye. Or can you? For me it wouldn't be ... the story is relentless! Idealist, denied his charge. Does anyone talk? Ah! but you have to see yourself! Watch the school teacher with your prime minister, without notice and an observer, who is definitely waiting for the observer. And why is he continuing? Yes! you have to watch O'Toole's performance for you! I can only want it to be "printed" yet, then I will give my friends my belief in their faithful lives.
