I really enjoyed this movie. It is rare to find a star who can convincingly persuade the physical aspects of a sports / dance thematic film and make a first-rate job. In this movie you will find two stars that bring along. Both women offer warm, touching and sometimes humorous performances. The film also touched on a number of topics ranging from racial issues to sexual identity. And yet this approach was not difficult. For the small budget movie, the production results were also the highest. I saw it at the Philadelphia Gay & Lesbian Film Festival and saw it for the second time. It was a real crowd. Everyone I was talking to seemed to enjoy this movie.
