Hunt for Justice is about setting up Slobadon Milosevic for his trial in The Hague. Although it was a little clinical in the presentation, the subject would be very frustrating very quickly. Canadian Judge Louise Arbor becomes the Chief Prosecutor of the UN International Criminal Court in Yugoslavia. He struggles to pull the evidence sent to Milosevic for trial. There is no bad docu-drama for class A management and production. "Evidence" disrupted the shift of facts, happily did not go too far and lack true torture images.
