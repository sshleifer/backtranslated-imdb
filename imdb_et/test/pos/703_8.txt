Probably because it is Columbia's first color film, colors look different indoors. They seem to be stronger, sharper and the result is a bit unreal, but very pleasant. Randolph Scott is a sheriff, a good boy, but the real star of the movie is a very young Glenn Ford who is the law that wants to change. Evelyn Keyes is a woman who starts to fall Ford and Claire Trevor is the countess who drives the cabin. Nitro is a funny sign that doesn't mean to blow it before. Especially I liked two moments of the movie, one of which was a huge horse, and you see thousands of horses, at that time there was no computer, so I assume they have to collect all these horses, not an easy task. The second moment is the final shootout, technically very good. There's also a pretty fistfight there. Seeing that this west coast was made with such amazing scenes in 1943, you will be sad to find that they are no longer doing them. Could they, if they wanted to? I have doubts.
