I really enjoyed watching this movie for the first time a few years ago, and whenever he ever blows up somewhere (which luckily happens from time to time on European cable TV), I experience the same thing, I move, entertain and wish all of these movies were out there. <br /> <br /> Everyone is working with Leo (Kevin McKidd) and his group of friends who live in London, Leos as a homosexual man who follows a friendly New Age group of men and goes straight to Brendon playing James Purefoy who is not after all, so straight. The badges are equally great for Tom Hollander and Hugo Weaving, whose side story is worth watching the movie, Simon Callow as the leader of the group of men, much more than ever. But it is really hard to choose some people here because every character, women like Jennifer Ehle, Julie Graham and Harriet Walter have also worked fine. Maybe even Kevin McKidd looks a bit pale compared to his co-partners, but it will benefit a somewhat modest character. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​this movie is simple: never just black and white, classifications are difficult and may not always be a test of time. <br /> <br /> Leo celebrates gay but also falls for a woman who turns out to be her teenager and Brendon for a long time. Brendon starts straight, but you know that gay can be more than just an opportunity and bisexual may not be so bad. Darren and Jeremy (Hollander and Weaving) are gay and love it, and even straight people like Angie, Leo's female companion, get a fair share of love and funny moments until the end of the movie. Comedy Bits (especially Tom Hollander, who is just fun) are funny and on the spot and emotions are plausible, as confusing as they may appear in reading this summary. <br /> <br /> What I really like about this movie is a really positive concept. Whether you're gay, straight, bisexual, or just not sure, this movie leaves you feeling it's not just sure and "not sure" can be worth what's alive! Sexuality is portrayed in this film as fluid and none of the main characters seem to be a real problem, except for all gay / straight camp struggles that are sometimes fed into other gay themes. I can only fully agree with the subtitle of a movie that what you are certain one day if you think you identify gay, straight, anything that can be very different from others. I've never seen (what to call?) Bisexuality, or maybe just that there is no need to separate sexual classification from such a heart warm and alive. <br /> <br /> This movie dares to go there, with a few movies, gay or straight films, that they don't play with labels and a stereotypical assumption of sex and rely on it. It goes further and assumes that after recognized classifications there may be sexual life, and I think these times are more than ready and other movies that study postmodern themes like this! <br /> <br /> And for all the others who don't care about it, it's hell, it's just a funny comedy to watch the rain on Saturday night with some popcorn. Try it! <br /> <br /> Loved It!
