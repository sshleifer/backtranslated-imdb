The New York murder is one of the best Chani mysteries and I've seen it for the first time. <br /> <br /> Charlie Chan is visiting a police convention in New York. At the same time, people involved in aircraft plants are being murdered and decide, with the help of their help, to do research with his 2nd son. These murders are the result of aircraft sabotage and Chan helps to identify the murderer ... <br /> <br /> Charlie Chan is well played by Sidney Toler and the rest includes Sen Yung's number 2 son and Marjorie Weaver. <br /> <br /> I liked this mystery and it's worth it if you like this thing. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 and a half stars 5.
