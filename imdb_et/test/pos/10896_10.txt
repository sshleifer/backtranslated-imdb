Since I have been allowed to play Goldeneye again, this has not been possible. I'm surprised I could have gone without it. This is undoubtedly one of the greatest games of all time. I've never played any other shooting game, but I know it's a rule. Most people blame it for too much violence, but I find it ridiculous. There may be some graphic antics, but there is much worse. <br /> <br /> The most important thing is fun. With awesome weapons like the RC-P90 and the classic Golden Gun, you can perform multiple challenging levels in the movie by completing important targets and repel the swarms of guards. There are tons of fantastic scams to get and even two secret levels that you only earn if you have the real skill. Goldeneye is also one of the largest multiplayer games. You can select multiple characters from the movie, old 007 movies (Baron Samed, Oddjob, May Day and Jaws) and guards in the game. It is possible that you and your partner (s) are laughing as hard as you hit each other so that you look like Bart and Lisa Simpson, watching the episode of Itchy and Scratchy. <br /> <br /> So if you don't have a game, don't rent it: just buy it. It's too good to be true. For cool Goldeneye stuff, check out the GoldStock website of Detstar.com. Every James Bond lover digs this game for a long time.
