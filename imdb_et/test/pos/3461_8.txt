I was surprised and touched by this emotional film that was very strange to me. I was confused, sad and happy at the same time. I think too few people are paying attention to this film. But I hope at least some will see it and get something. The story of two friends associated with people with physical disabilities who (as a team) beat the medical pricing system and fight for their rights. This movie shows a side that some of us do not understand, not too exaggerated, but emotional. Hopefully, this film will better understand their desires and understand the importance of having a friend in the world, especially if you are almost unable to express it.
