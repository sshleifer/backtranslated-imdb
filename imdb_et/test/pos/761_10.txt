I thought this movie was smartly written and worked very well. This is a film that is much larger than originals and pleasures than other movies. Rupert Grint played this part wonderfully and has a general skill to act. The almost obsessed mother added a lot to the plot and had a character that could be almost instantly relieved. It somehow reminded me of the divine secrets of the Ya-Ya sisters. Not the actual content of the movie, but also the overall tone of the film. "Driving" is an age history that many can easily associate due to the powerful mother, the lack of freedom and the discovery of oneself.
