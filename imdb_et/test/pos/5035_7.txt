I caught this movie on TV and I watched it again. I told myself that I was watching this movie for a long time, so why not. And this movie repeated me again. It's so simple, so observable and so human that I don't know why some people don't like it. <br /> <br /> John Travolta shines like Michael (his dance and every move), an angel who can hardly relate to this word. He smokes, drinks and eats like some savage, but he has a big heart. With his help, Michael helps all the people he meets. Dorothy Winters (Andie MacDowell) sang and found the right person. Frank Quinlan (William Hurt) himself as a good and decent man. Michael even helped the expensive old Pansy Milbank (Jean Stapleton) - that the last scene is beautiful on the street dancing. Andie MacDowell is so beautiful and pleasant, William Hurt is great, as usual, late Robert Pastorelli shows his talent. Jean Stapleton and Teri Garr are also good, but my favorite supporting actor in this film is Bob Hoskins as a tabloid owner. attractive cast. Just don't take this movie seriously and I can guarantee you have fun.
