I want the series not to end so quickly. Although action may not be the largest in the world, it ends with a positive sign and teaches morals and values ​​to viewers. Hilary Swank did a good job of showing college students who had lost their parents, etc. Miyagi was great like last 3! If you are not in a happy ending, this film, like the previous 3 series, is not for you. The day we live doesn't see enough that bad guys get what they deserve, and the good guys are coming over. The Bible teaches that good always wins over evil. That is what happens in this. This is a great family film. Please see if you haven't already.
