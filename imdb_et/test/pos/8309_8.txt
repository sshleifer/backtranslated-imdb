CONTEXT is all about going to a movie. The time it takes to make this movie is to be considered. We didn't really know what the inside of EARTH was like these days, so you can't dress too much for a movie (based on a much older book). For this era, this top-notch special effect and the quality of production was excellent. I watched this movie in a masterfully restored HD master. At a time when makeup and effects almost make boys in rubber costumes plausible, they are a monster thing. It is a pure film band with bad rubber suits, models and creepy costumes. AWESOME. PS Doug McClure ROCKS!
