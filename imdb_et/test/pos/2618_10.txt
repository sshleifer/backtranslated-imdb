Right at the hospital scene with Holly and Shannon, it was great when it started with Piper On. Happily injured injuries, races him in the resuscitation room and they move him from the gurney to the bed and Prue keeps his hand at this point, it is obvious that Piper has breathing difficulties and his lungs do not work because he turns to Prue for not leaving him when his gaps does not do. Don't I love you and then his pulse falls and he goes to the heart stop and the monitor shows a clear flat line and the nurses go into trauma mode and bring the defibrillator Prue steps back from bed in horror as doctors are desperately trying to get their dead sister heart attacked but no response is a tragically pronounced dead well-good scene for well-made girls
