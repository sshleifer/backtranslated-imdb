The balls may not collide with their chest, but Lone Ranger was a symbolic icon for me as my second childhood hero, Superman. He represented the truth, justice, and the American way in the classic TV Western environment, living on the principle that he would never use his weapon to kill, while cleaning the western part of America with his faithful Indian companion Tonto to bring every single law to justice. The appearance of televisions provided an excellent opportunity for the post-war generation to find it an ideal mysterious disguised man standing in law and order, while providing unparalleled entertainment for five seasons, reaching almost eight years. <br /> <br /> Today I was able to see for the first time the end of the three complete episodes of origin without standard opening and closing schemes to interrupt the story. For Ranger's fans, this is a big daddy of all Western swords, saying that how Texas Ranger John Reid survived the Butch Cavendish Gang's shadow and how he was greeted from childhood in India. Tonto (Jay Silverheels) declares his companion as a "trustworthy spy" and calls him Kemo-tail. I have read different terms about the origin of Kemo-sabe, but I am satisfied with Tonto's explanation. Too much reading reduces the story, like the Spanish 'tonto' translation, which I do not publish because it is simply better not to know if you can help. <br /> <br /> I thought it was pretty wise how the story of origin was created by Lone Ranger's mystery, like the sixth tomb that created the illusion that all the Ranger died in the canyon of the box. You will never see the face of the person who turns into Lone Ranger because it is always turned away or concealed to conceal its true identity. Even the origin of silver is considered to be excellent; The story of the narrator's voice describing the characteristics of the wild stallions. Is it, for example, a pound, silver? I got the biggest out of it. <br /> <br /> Of course, looking at the Lone Ranger episodes over time will see how imperfect the exhibition was outside the story of origin. Some of them are almost embarrassingly goofy, especially when it comes to the Lone Ranger showdown when he fires in the middle of a crowd of bad guys to knock the gun out of its owner's hand. And how about the small wave it gives to Tont when they start to hide the bad guys - it's always the same gesture, but Tonto always knows what it means in different situations. Then you have episodes where Clayton Moore takes down a different disguise from Ranger's mask to create a story about serving another. He even went down once as an actor who depicted President Abraham Lincoln to expose the villain, the hat and everything! <br /> <br /> Few fans I come across know that actor John Hart replaced Clayton Moore in 1952. The 53 season contract dispute that Moore had with the show's manufacturers. If you ever saw this "Happy Days" episode where Fonzie idolizes your boy's hero, you notice that it was John Hart in credits. It's hard to really say whether you're watching a Hart episode or not, the key is to listen to the voice; Moore's is so distinctive that it's a dead giveaway. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to try some of the latest seasonal color episodes, you're ready to treat. The editions seen in VHS are absolutely proud, although I don't know if commercial printouts are available. Most black and white episodes have been redirected to multiple distributors in different configurations, so getting them should not be a problem. Of course, it must be of three origins and if you don't look at it, it will give you all the taste and excitement you need to capture the imagination of one of the most famous heroes in the West. Hi-Yo Silver, Awaaaay!
