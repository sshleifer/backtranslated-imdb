I looked at this program as a young boy in Australia in the 1960s and enjoyed it again on the DVD as a 50-year-old father of young children. Although bad guys are mostly low characters and there is a violent component, I am very happy that my 6- and 8-year-olds are watching it, because the central characters are deep, kind and respectful, Japanese culture is out, violence is not nervous, no one in it not glitter and the program is beautiful to look at. It does not promote nightmares, but shows that much of the culture that must have influenced the design of the Jedi Knights mainly in Star Wars. <br /> <br /> The quality of DVDs leaves nothing to be desired. Video perfectionists do not like it. It resembles something that is kept on a 16 mm film and projected on a wall in a basement ... what it may be. The audio track also lacks the quality we know in the home theater. But my kids only noticed that it wasn't colored, and I suspect they only noticed that because we had recently talked about how old things are often like that. Mt Fuji's beauty is obvious even in B&W. Something in the 17th century environment makes the atmosphere a quality part, as if you were driving the past through some time window. <br /> <br /> In general, this program is better than most things in the air and far away from better advertising on Japanese television than Pokemon, but you may find it marginal if you hadn't seen that experience in the 1960s. My score 8/10 takes into account your age.
