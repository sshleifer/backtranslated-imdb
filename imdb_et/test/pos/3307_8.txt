You can't take this movie seriously ..... the plot is predictable and tritical, often up, dialogue is ridiculous; but it all adds a lot of fun! Three "career girls" in the late 1950s find the way to the city of BIG and all the evil and temptations that their mothers probably warned of: married men, alcohol, asses, abortion, etc. <br /> <br /> Then there is Amanda Farrell (Joan Crawford) who succeeded professionally, but whose personal life is at the door of that office. <br /> <br /> This movie can be credible 50 years ago, but now it's just a lot of fun! Rent and buy and enjoy.
