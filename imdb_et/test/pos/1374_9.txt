I got it the second day from the DVD Creator. I saw this ad in a free magazine, while the family stopped at the hotel, it had never been heard. After reading it was filmed on Balmedie beach, which I just had to buy. I took the children to Aberdeen, always staying in the dunes of the movie. <br /> <br /> 1st Off Im is not a big Sci-Fi fan (limited to Star Wars). what they were doing at the location of this movie was surprised at the moment. It didn't turn out to be a common Sci-Fi, more than a combination of sci-fi and survival fear. <br /> <br /> There was a good story that was different, the budget has a great special effect that it was produced with 8,000 pounds. For a low budget movie, it was better than average. How they have changed the whole coastline to feel like the dry desert site they are in was nice. <br /> <br /> The weapons in the movie were realistic and the creatures were as cool as the predator in the invisible mode. First of all, I buy the future publications of these invitations, which may be the next fear (Hint Hint). The DVDs were very informative about giving backgrounds to the manufacturers, and I would like to see some of them being short additions to the DVD the next day. <br /> <br /> Great work continues
