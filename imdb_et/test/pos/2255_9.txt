This film reminds me of the "uneven sun of eternal mind" and "the kingdom" not of content, but because it is one of those films that you do not hear except for word of mouth, or when you read back in a DVD video shop and think "why not". Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised (like the movies above) how good it was and how much I enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> The best vision for a little movie knowledge and just the intrigue that really monitors you. Also best to see someone else or if you know someone else who has seen it - you want to talk about it !! This is a beautiful movie that will keep you well tracked. It is also an intelligent watch that requires little effort to figure out the parts themselves. <br /> <br /> Just enjoy :)
