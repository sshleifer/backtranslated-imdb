From today's point of view, this film is 18 (or X in the US) quite ridiculous. The film has a sexual but ultimate erotic story, but the pictures are quite innocent. Throughout the film, you feel and see the spirit of the late 60s and early 70s in fashion, in dialogues and in typical experimental cinematography and light. And that's exactly the part that makes it worth it.
