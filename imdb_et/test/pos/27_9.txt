Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are excellent as Sir and his Dresser. Of course, at first the game is great and nothing can be compared with the theater exchange and collegiality, and I think you listen better in the theater; but on the screen we become more intimate, we are more than close to the theater, we see forms of expression, we see better and listen. Both the game and the film are wonderful: the movement of the company, the historical context, the two main characters and the parallel signs of "Lear" itself, intelligent, enlightening. If you can't see it in the theater (I can't imagine it being produced much these days), please do yourself a favor and get a video.
