If you forget the fact that the plot has been made several times, it is a fun and fun to enjoy Looney Tunes comic. Animation is wonderful, the backgrounds are so detailed and many terrible colors. Writing is sharp, and eye-catching eyes, especially Daffy, are instantly timed. I really loved Daffy and Bugs arguments and Bugs wins every time. I also love Daffy's really greedy and nasty at the same time funny. I prefer him when he is mania, but here he is also very fun. The bugs are still her charming and dirty suicide, and Elmer is too funny and too stupid. In short, it is absolutely brilliant and actually my personal favorite for hunting history for entertainment value. 10/10 Bethany Cox
