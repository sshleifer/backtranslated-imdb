Once "Karate Kid" would continue without Ralph Macchio! Hilary Swank did a great job playing orphan Julie Pierce. Pat Morita, who plays Mr Miyagi, worked with Julie quite differently from Daniel. Both Daniel and Julie preferred karate. Unlike Daniel, Julie was the most unpleasant person in Miyagi, who was ever challenged. And there were no tournaments there to compete. And there is some humor in this movie. I liked the part where, when Julie came home from school, Miyagi went to check her and saw that she was changing clothes in that process. It was very funny! And the classic "Wax is, Wax off" scene was also different. It was funny when Miyagi says to Julie, "Uh-oh, missed the spot". The set in Boston was far from California. The Militant group of this group was like "Cobra Kai" in Boston. And Michael Ironside's Colonel Dugan was not John Krees. Her group left her practically behind when Julie attacked a serious ass. They all paid the price when they blew from the classic Oldsmoblie. Which coward works. At least they find Dugan's poison. This Karate Kid sets some sort of morality, unlike the last three, which were spoken of "Respect" and "Respect". Hilary Swank is superbly hot in every movie and everything she does. Movie 9, Hilary Swank 10!
