"Rififi" is an amazing hero film and since then has been the latest films. Jules Dassin had the feeling that the poor underworlds where these thieves were living could not find Hollywood's "Ocean's Eleven" here. Rifif robbers do not rob the excitement and they do not play the game. They kidnap to survive, pay for raising their children, prove to themselves and others that they still have something to offer to the world. A lot of praiseworthy thunder-scene is a jet that has been filmed in virtual silence. I had the feeling that the plot went a little longer than necessary, but the high-speed line that gave the baby to the mother to finish the movie is classic. - This film is very grim. But it is also very good. <br /> <br /> Rating: A-
