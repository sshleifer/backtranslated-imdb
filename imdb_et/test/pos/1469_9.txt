Going 'Down To South Park is a 1-hour documentary from South Park, where interviews take place with Trey Parker and Matt STone and all other people working with South Park. There is not much to say, it shows the history of South Park and what it takes to make one episode. It shows the different goods that the south park has done (it was really the center of comedy who put it out). It also shows the contradiction caused by South Park. It also shows a lot of funny clips from the show. It's a pretty funny documentary. All fans of South Park should check it out. You'll find it on youtube. <Br /> <br /> 9/10
