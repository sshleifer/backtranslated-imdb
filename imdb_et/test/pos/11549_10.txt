I've been trying to match so many bad comments on this movie, while most reviews are rated between 7 and 10. This may be due to a movie that is difficult to describe in a positive review, although some have done it quite nicely. This film is confusing, frustrating and has no happy ending. I gave Pola X another 10 ratings because it is basically a film for me in literature and art. It's really my favorite movie. I've only seen two Caraxi movies: this and Mauvis Sang. Like this movie, I'm somewhat pretentious when I call it Carax's best movie, but I'm. Carax has a minimalist style. If this type of movie doesn't like you and is boring, it would be better not to look at it. But Pola X was less minimalist than Mauvis Sang, so he was very intense for the thriller - at least for my taste. I found it quite interesting and absorbing. Two leading roles did a great job. (I mean, the leader and the young woman he thought was his half-sister.) Catherine D. is always great, but her role was not very big or important. But everyone did a good job. I thought the cult thing was great. It may not be very plausible, but it is rather abstract. There is a lot between the lines of the movie. It's a very Freud psycho-thriller.
