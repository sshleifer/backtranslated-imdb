First of all, if you are not a fan of the low budget horror genre, don't worry about it. You really have to be a fan to get a paw. <br /> <br /> The movement is basically about snakes .. on the train. There are many of them. <br /> <br /> There is an ancient ancient curse and a crazy end that I am not breaking. Goreefect is full and real icky ... but the film is mainly one big dwarf bumblebees who scare hell out of the trapped people. <br /> <br /> The break is well structured and has some memorable and well-composed scenes ... some actors are a little hammy (see surfers), but it's not really a point ... Give this movie. Know what to expect and you will not regret it!
