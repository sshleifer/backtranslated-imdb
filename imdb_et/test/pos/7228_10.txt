This movie is amazing. This is such a great movie. Are some sick scenes (not nearly as sick as Terror Firmer or Citizen Toxie) naked, and this was a penis monster debut on film! It has created a scene for many Troma movies, a very tromatic film. It mixes comedy, romance and my favorite HORROR / GORE! Not so much in that flick, but enough to satisfy. This is Shakespeare's Romeo and Julia's best adjustments. Much better than any other version. It makes it look so fun and fun. And we have Debbie Rochon ... hey ... I like it. :) I have to say that this is a great movie, very funny and Lemmy is a good host for it. Operation is good and Kaufman always steers in style. Must See All TROMA FANS!
