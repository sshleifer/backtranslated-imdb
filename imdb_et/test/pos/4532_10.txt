this film may not seem to some people, but it was all I was looking for in comedy. fall into the funny moments, accompanied by a moment or two in a serious moving scene, big actors and pretty much everything a good movie should be. despite David playing his usual snobby character, he played this role as an unusual performance that I don't think he had ever crossed until he hit the screen with Joe's dirt. Regardless of whether some people were fans of Chris Farley, I saw this movie when it came out and my friends, and I'm talking about it ... 11 years later. this movie finally told me that Chris Farley was the real thing. he's the best comedian I've ever seen in my life. In some words, it can be clumsy, clever, funny, serious, crazy, sober and moving or frustrating at the same time. not the same words, but the message is all that counts. one of the real great actors of our time and the real great comedy of all time. with a good example, good story, fun moments, serious scenes that sometimes brought me tears. This film stands by the hordes as a film that marked the beginning of a brief domination of the recent great Chris Farley comedy world. no actor who is not before or after, has not been detained ever since. because no actor has added so much to his films before or after. this movie is worth the time if you haven't done that time to rent this movie next time.
