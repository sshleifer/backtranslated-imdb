It's fun to watch the young James Cagney's thing. He plays a man of weight and measure, taking his job very seriously, stepping on the toes of a group of curved politicians. He is offered to the world but keeps his honesty. He's beaten and set up, but that's a problem. We never know if he's really in danger. They say he is on the ground but still seems to have a carte blanche to move and do what he needs to do. Sometimes it is so harsh that it doesn't protect itself much. His allies are in the police department, but almost everything else is corrupt. He continues (almost too good to be true), and we pull him. The problem for me is the lack of permanent mid-term review. It would have been much better if he had to delete his name. He never loses his depth, even if his wife has rejected it. It's still fun with the bad guys. Look at it just to see Cagney when she wants her tough boys.
