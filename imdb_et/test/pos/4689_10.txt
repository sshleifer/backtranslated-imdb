I remember this series with excitement, every Saturday night. It was a highlight of the week. I loved all this, the location, the costumes, the actors and the wonderful music of Clannad (I still have my Legend album). I loved how they solved the problem of Michael Praed leaving another Robin, this time Huntingdon Earli. I believe that in the Middle Ages there were legends from several Robins. The other thing I loved was that it was full of young actors, I'm sure Robin and his men would be young after all the people did not live these days. Others Robins always look too old (Kevin Costner looked like Robin's grandfather with his ridiculous accent). The only sad thing was the end, it is a shame that they could not at least make a special special to tie all the loose ends and give her a happier end.
