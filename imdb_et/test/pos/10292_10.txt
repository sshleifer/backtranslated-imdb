This sad romance is incomprehensible, because the director decides to break his story and offer the perspectives of each character. So, there are a lot of setbacks, the same scene from shooting again. But it would be an extraordinary cinema time to put all the fragments up to see the result! <br /> <br /> And it would be worth it because it is just one of the best French movies ever made! <br /> <br /> It's all: <br /> <br /> Cast: Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel's First Steps! Such a presence and such voices, even for hard hearing! It's symbolic so they're in love with this movie! <br /> <br /> Targeting: His camera is bright, alive, playing with sets or may be a mysterious long-term "Ã  la David Lynch". Cinema: Light is beautiful, between gold and rust, like their love! <br /> <br /> Ever seen in Paris: this is Paris's more specific, occasional composite of many regions! Huge search here! It looks like Gotham City, modern and old at the same time! Music: Not a big orchestra, but perfect for framing. And Charles Aznavour's song made me discover this great singer! <br /> <br /> Ah, ?? story! As I said, this is a love story, but rather a tragic one: saying that love can be something that does not make all people happy or is not a guaranteed sweet ending is great because this message is often not spoken! Love is a passion derived from Latin "pain." You can suffer a lot if you are in love! Why ..?, Endless waiting, lack of courage, indecision. <br /> <br /> And if you can ease yourself, fate, destiny, god (?), devil (?) can pull you back, just because you come too early or too late and above all because love means 2 billions in the world! There may be many things and so many songs can be written! So, what is love? <br /> <br /> I personally lived a few moments: expensive in one car. His mobile rings and you know that his "special friend" whom he can say goodbye to (and not you, even if we are always together). So, you want to get out of this car so they leave together to not hear the sweet but bold words, but you can't, because the amazing hard rain just started! I found this movie to represent moments of tragedy like someone else!
