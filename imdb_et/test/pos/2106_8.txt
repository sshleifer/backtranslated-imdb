I've just remembered this memorable little bit of cinematic madness from my early days, and I must urge you to ask for it to be stolen or borrowed. <br /> <br /> The story begins with the double-minded Shaolin Priest and our cable-maker Abbot White, without saying that Abbot White strikes a Buddhist ass and, with the help of his new ninja allies, unhindered his campaign against Shaolin (a golden clad who fights with a golden ring , a black clad who is fighting a spear, and my favorite, who fights with knives who can disappear and appear as a flying carpet). The rest of the story concerns the training of Abbot's white killed Shaolin monks, one of whom is Alexander Lo Rei. Although we are treated with punitive training sequences, two young avengers must go through to learn Abba White's invincible armor technique to eliminate the necessary Shaolin Finger Jab technique, seeing some ways our villain keeps shape ... mainly using Taoist magic to extract naked ladies. We all know how it ends, but this is a psychedelic journey that we are here for. To sum up, this is a good example of what Taiwan did when Hong Kong became a martial arts movie and it is increasingly making unheard of martial arts films. This film is very choreographic, it has a little nudity, some gore and enough ball with the gimickry to keep even the most bowed viewer entertained. Visit the local Beewise today! <br /> <br />
