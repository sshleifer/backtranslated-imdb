I like this movie a lot. Animation is ultimate: it means that they struggle to animate animal and human hair and fur. And being an amateur in graphics and animation (self-teaching through books. For those who are curious about the same subject, I use a discrete Gmax program. It is a high quality free program that can be downloaded from the Internet). The quality of animation shown here is high. <br /> <br /> The plot is good. Although this film lacks character development, this story is still understandable. In general, I believe that this movie should mainly be watched by people who are fans of the game because its plot monitors the game. As for me, I do not play games and therefore I do not have the power to influence the fans. <br /> <br /> For those who like the game, I recommend this movie to you and if you haven't played, I would recommend this movie to you.
