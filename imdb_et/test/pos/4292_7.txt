The old man rides his bicycle along the village walk when the car leaves somewhere, kills him and drives. The rest of the film will be spent discovering who hit him, why he hit, and what the consequences will be for the rest of the village. Private Lies is really a very British film. I am not saying that accidents are a particularly British phenomenon, but how everything responds to this tragedy is very British. Tom Wilkinson plays James Manning, a hardworking and respectable citizen with a "stiff-top" attitude towards the tragedy. Her husband Anne (Emily Watson), twenty years younger than her husband, is more emotional, impulsive and more prone to drama. <br /> <br /> The man who really lives in this dreamy village is the Playboy Millionaire William Bule, played by tasteful Rupert Everett (most American audiences will remember him forever as a gay friend of Julia Robert who stole my scene from my best friend wedding). In separate matters, Everett is cruel, cold and selfish, but he is an absolute shot on the screen. No, it's not that exciting movie title (Separate Lies? How did they end up with this flat and forgetful title? Didn't they just have a marketing team? Did they just take care of seeing this movie?) But beside the title is a heartbreaking drama about the power of forgiveness.
