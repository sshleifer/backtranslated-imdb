One of the best movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The performance of Louis Jouvet is fantastic. He really does play his part and it's wonderful. He is such a good actor that you don't think of anyone else who is taking part. <br /> <br /> And both Suzy Delair and Bernard Blier are good French people who are trying to defend themselves in the fight for the murdered ... <br /> <br /> The story is breathtaking and well-built. You can feel the atmosphere of Paris during this period (about 1930-40) between the two wars ... Clubs, old small buildings, neighbors. <br /> <br /> All these things contribute to a great movie.
