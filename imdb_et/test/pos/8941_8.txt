This film had a special Woody Allen, because if you are not a fan of dry humor, dark humor or humor with your back, you may find something else. But if it is, it is unique, with some nice and natural dialogues. <br /> <br /> The story itself is quite tempting, not quite like a train wreck where you can't turn off your eyes. but close. I mean it in the best possible way. There are many intrigues, the twists are enough to turn the senses fully on, and the characters are completely loved. <br /> <br /> I had a great time with this movie. <br /> <br /> It will appreciate 8.3 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
