I saw it with short films in Accent Underground. I found the movie from the first bored and old-fashioned one and turned it off after the first hour - I was a bit drunk and tired. <br /> <br /> I went to sleep and I didn't joke that I had a nightmare for this movie and sleeping after an hour. I couldn't stop thinking about why, so I got up, turned the TV back on, downloaded the DVD and saw the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Well done Alex Frayne sir, you managed to implant your movie into this old, cynical movie visitor who does it. So 10 out of 10 against you. <br /> <br /> I can't say I love this movie, but it has made a lasting impact due to mistakes and a low budget.
