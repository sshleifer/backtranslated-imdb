Remember Greg Bunny? This exhibition started on the Independent Film Channel, but became Fox's inflatable sitcom. My cousin and I thought it was pretty funny, far from what I was supposed to do with the dolls taking the TV-PG material. Puppets Who Kill occurs in a similar universe where dolls live in the same world as humans, and like us, take on jobs and life. Let's just say that if you couldn't do it, don't worry about PWK because this exhibition is a profile of four dolls that fell out of the good graces of society for drug abuse, hedonism, and violent rogue, but only ended in half-way houses. There's a lot of violence, sex and bad language (so it's never going to be US network television). As sociopathic dolls would not be enough, the fact that this is happening in Canada makes it even more troublesome (btw, government pays for it) and I think every American television viewer would require more such demented cable TV feed. I don't know where it gets in the US, besides satellite TV, but I would recommend it. Really funny stuff. (It takes place in Comedy Network, Canada)
