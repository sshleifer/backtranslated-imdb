Yes, I'm a FF7 fan, but how many people watching this movie are NOT? And so, I look at it from the perspective of fans of FF7 and regret it. (I don't know how to watch the movie enough if no one has played the FF7 game.) <br /> <br /> Visuals - 10/10 I loved the Advent children. It's a sensory joy - full audio video overload. The visuals were breathtaking: some punches have been achieved so that I simply would not have thought of the animated feature. When the scene of the events arose, they were a roller-digger because of the lack of a precise word. What is a dramatic camera movement that ranges from range to smoothly integrated bullet-time effects at crucial moments, up to the level of accuracy - it's all difficult to break. Animation looks like a big budget, style and images are fantastic, and the effects from time to time forgot me to look at animation, not live action. I could repeat for hours that I repeat the fantastic quality of visual images, but it just doesn't do it in justice. <br /> <br /> Sound - 10/10 Sound was fabulous. The voices of all the characters were not disappointed (no one heard foolishly) and the sound effects were bold and sharp. Music - a game that (in my opinion) was the best soundtrack for EVER, was delivered to the film nicely. Most of the memorable topics in the game are in the movie, although often different tools are used to better suit what is happening. From time to time, somewhat bolder rock and light metal music took place in very intense activities, but it all worked well with the situation of the film at the time. <br /> <br /> Story - 7/10 The story and characters would be the main mistakes of the movie. Both aspects were not just equivalent to the game - but then again, the game can spend 40+ hours to develop these points - the movie only takes about 90 minutes. When the story goes, the plot was neither bad nor anything but just as ambitious as expected from someone who played the game. In fact, the plot seemed relatively weak. The game was so extravagant with the complex plot revolution and progress / development that the film could never compete in the same league. Instead, the film made more sense - to expand the activity and try to place so many inside jokes and themes on its own, instead of trying to undo the massive story factor that was originally the driving force of the game. The lack of use of material also led to contradictions - the film's story decided to use little (but not ZERO) Material and instead many supernatural abilities and skills. I hope that if it continues, it would involve much more extravagantly and more importantly in Materia. There was also a lot of plot holes in the movie - everything you can forgive when you think that Advent children are a casual anime, but it seems ridiculous if you understand how it is based on a game that performed the plot very well. Characters - 7/10 Characters, although everything is in one form or another, may not necessarily show its true potential. There's not really enough time to spend a movie there. So not all of their background and abilities have been fully outlined and in some cases hardly ever (Red and Cait Sith leave no real lasting impressions). Even a cloud that is the centerpiece of the film, I feel that I don't use enough familiar abilities in the game. The matter of matter is its strong cause. That said, it is a joy to see a return, even if it is in a role that does not make full use of it. The new characters were the ones that caused me the most controversy - the Bad Guy trio and the boy called Denzel - there was no explanation about them. Anyone who wants to use his or her imagination is likely to be able to fill in some sensible and workable blanks, but, objectively speaking, the question is still commentable, and that's why it's a little disappointing. <br /> <br /> Value - 10/10 The playback value of this movie is great - I want to see it bigger and louder again - the bigger the screen, the louder the volume. <br /> <br /> Enjoyment - 10/10 Regardless of the bugs in the movie, they were just not big enough to block my enjoyment, and I think it's the same for most people. I enjoyed the Advent children enormously and encouraged FF7 fans to see.
