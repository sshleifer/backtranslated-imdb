Shahrukh Khan and Yash Chopra's films are never disappointed. Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge is a romantic classic class. Hai To Hai was fresh and perfect for viewing. Mohabbatein will never be my favorite film. And Veer-Zaara was magical. Darr, though not the best, is a romantic thriller that is different from the above-mentioned movies, but it's definitely worth a look. And the SRK, who blew me up with a great performance at Baazig, repeats the cable boot. And this time he will be experienced by Juha Chawla and Sunny Deoli to support him. This is a writing that congratulates a great actor. The story is thrilling, but the characterization is what it looks like. The comedy trail goes well. But the film tends to move romance too much. The viewer loses interest and you do a couple of horrors. But the movie is still good. <br /> <br /> Shahrukh Khan is excellent in his role as a contributor. Shahrukh Khan is once again meaningful and cruel. You are bound to cry at the end. Driver Chawla is decent. His screaming is certainly annoying after a while. But it is great in facial expression. But his final scene, which he is great (although he was overshadowed by the SRK). She has a role supported by the author, which makes her very pleasant. Sunny Deol is enough. His character was very pleasant, but too perfect. And after a while it gets boring. However, he does a good job. Anupam Kher is really funny, but his role seemed a little inappropriate. Tanvi Azmi works well. <br /> <br /> Songs are enjoyable and come in time. Jadoo Teri Nazar (Magic At Your Sight) is my favorite song and the presentation is 90 years old. Tu Mere Saami (You are in front of me) and Likha Hai (written here) is a nice love song. Darwaza band Kar Lo is also a decent song of love. The instrumental song is danced perfectly and the naughty wedding song Solah Button. The film may not be perfect, but it's worth your time, especially if your favorite actor is in it.
