I didn't know this movie until I watched it. It seems to be the teenage's horror less known since the 1980s. What struck me was how it differs from so many other films of this era. <br /> <br /> The first thing I noticed was how slowly this film builds. It does not make a typical setting that indicates that characters are being murdered one by one. Building up the story takes time, leaving a little secret about what can happen. I almost started thinking that no one could actually hurt this movie. But in the last 15 minutes, everything leads to a climate sequence and then it becomes quite graphic (it was a bad time to take snacks - I almost couldn't finish my seal when it started). <br /> <br /> The characters also look a little bit more three-dimensional than many cheap teen scare shocks. Conversations were mostly refreshingly flat, as opposed to surprising stereotypes. For example, the popular, nervous, queen bee, who is always insulting to everyone, is unable to doubt and pay some attention to others. <br /> <br /> So, in conclusion, I felt that this movie was somewhat original compared to what was expected and also a little better. It pulled me in, kept me interesting and let me do it. As I said, it's pretty funny during the finals, but almost the rest of the time it's family friendly. I don't have to own it, but I'm glad I discovered it.
