Francis Ford Coppola wrote and directed this amazingly personal story of the wife's flight from his wife - and the reality that his younger youth's joy and excitement is behind him. We learn little about this woman's marriage, except that she has felt a delay in her independence; She has also recently learned that she is a pregnant woman who has further aggravated her heart (she doesn't want to be a self-satisfied husband, no matter how her mother speaks to her husband on the phone). He will meet with his two men on his journey: a former college football hero who has left a permanent brain injury and a sexy, striking motorcycle policeman who has many difficulties in his life. Clear, clean landscapes (photographed by very talented Wilmer Butler) are reasonably realized, just like the characters. Shirley Knight, James Caan, and Robert Duvall provide strong, engaging items to everyone, especially as they are not very popular under normal circumstances. Some scenes (such as Knight's first call from pay phone or his first night with Caan, where they play "Simon Says") are almost too intimate to watch. Koppola toys with reality, turning their characters into jagged memories as we have done. He promises to play scenes, but editing is pretty tough and the film never gets too heavy (there are at least two or three very bad moments). This is the main endeavor - so much that the picture is still displayed at festivals almost five years later. Some may hinder the uneven rotation of Coppola's events to emphasize the finale with bitter irony, but the power and retardation of the image almost overcomes its drawbacks. *** from ****
