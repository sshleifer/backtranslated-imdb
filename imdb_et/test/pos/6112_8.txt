First, John Waters was introduced to IFC's "Woman's Problems". I was disgusting, but for some ill reason I enjoyed it. Then I took out the Pink Flamingos DVD in the John Waters box. The film is about Babs Johnson's "The Filthiest Person Alive", who lives with a Maryland trailer with his obese egg that is obsessed with her mother, and her spoiled son "Crackers". In the film, you can see sick sights such as sex chickens, drag-queens, people who eat stools, torture and all other random humiliation. The film has soundtracks from 60 rock-roll artists. The only problem is that some parts of the movie seem to be dragging and getting a bit boring. I found "Woman Trouble" a little more fun. Rated NC-17 for explicit sex, violence and disturbing images. Enjoy.
