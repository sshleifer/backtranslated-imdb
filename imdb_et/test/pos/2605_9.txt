I have to admit that this is one of the few Lou Costello films I actually saw in the theater. Most of them are now visible on T.V and I have to admit that Lou is really enjoyable and she's got a girl. It was my first time I saw Dorothy Provine's performance and of course I fell in love with so many others that day. I've seen most of the work he has done and enjoyed. His performance with the Great Race is one of the reasons why I first bought this album! <br /> <br /> Every comment about this movie says it's one movie Lou Costello made with Bud Abbott, which is true, but if Lou had lived, he would have done much more. She really does a good job and doesn't have to rely on her old routines to laugh. I apologize to the little man from Patterson, N.J. couldn't get this done. <br /> <br /> I hope it will appear on the DVD for a while so I can add it to my comedy / sci fi collection.
