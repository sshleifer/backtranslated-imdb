I've seen both movies and I no doubt saw that it's the best, I know many people don't agree with those who have become original fans. was well thought out and certainly scary, it was so good that I see it tonight again, the original pulled me out because they kill the kids, I mean, who does it in the movies anyway. children have at least half the chance ... The only bad part of this movie is when the babysitter (Jill) walks the sounds he hears and drives into the shrubs to control someone, probably no one is doing their right. that during childbirth, so this is the only thing I found wrong with the film, and even then they probably had to build up there, I don't want to give too much to all those who haven't seen it I suggest you do it instead to listen to all the people who say this crap and worse than the original watch a better movie for teenagers because it shows things that most of us are afraid of, but when I was in the movies, there were at least 10 adults over 70 years old and enjoyed it when they enjoyed it it is my opinion! I'll give him 10 out of 10!
