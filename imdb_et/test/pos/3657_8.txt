Hari Om talks about the impossible love between a French tourist and an auto-rickshaw driver who agrees to take him with his indifferent bosses. Some of the world's third world film, which takes care of a lousy comedy comedy, is characterized by Vijay Raaz's stellar character, who has become Mira Nair's Monsoon Wedding Planner for India's established actor. In the interview, Raaz is quite unaffected by her success, answering quite carefully and retrospectively. He discovered love to act and joined a big theater group at university, but for one who had so much formal training, he is surprisingly insecure about his craft. He speaks of honesty and purity as the recesses of his approach, and his desire to communicate with the authenticity of the audience is clear. On the screen, Raaz conveys emotional integrity and dramatic confidence, raising her character to an extraordinary level, and the director Bharatbala has cast and directed her perfectly. She has a wonderfully expressive face that the camera delights; close-ups of this face are just as compelling as Camille Natta, the French woman's Father.
