Black water, led and written by David Nerlich and Andrew Trauc, is very simple and efficient in its implementation. The film is a low-budget Australian film, which unfortunately does not receive this recognition because it is one of the best in the functions of beings. Setup is quite common; Grace, his wife, Adam and his younger sister Lee, travel with mangroves in the Northern Territory when a seawater crocodile throws his boat and leaves them on trees. The whole movie is about their survival when the crocodile is waiting below to find a strike. Unlike Greg McLean Rogue (the second killer croc film that was released earlier in 2007), Black Water is not that the audience should have fun thinking about who is eating next, hoping and praying that three people will get out safely. <br /> <br /> Three unknown actors are doing a good job with quite difficult roles, given that it was filmed with a real crocodile instead of CGI. Characters are realistic in the situation and the dialogue seems natural and not forced. The whole movie is structured, we don't see a lot of beings, but just knowing it's close is terrible. It is on your seat and highly recommended when you enjoy original and (most importantly) scary horror movies. <br /> <br /> 4/5
