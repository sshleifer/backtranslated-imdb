One of my favorite movies. Great cast, led by Jonathan Silverman and Blythe Danner. Serious drama situations with brilliant comedy. Accurate blend of character and story. Real people with real problems, and everyone has a different relationship with each family member. Sensitively moves gently into a funny little fun. Read quotes. This is the best adaptation of Neil Simon's game. <br /> <br /> If you want to see more of Eugene's control, Biloxi Blues (starring Matthew Broderick, who played in both stages) is OK, a little darker. Remove Broadway Bound from TV.
