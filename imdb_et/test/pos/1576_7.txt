You just finished this impressive nut affair, and although I can't say it was as good as I was thinking about it, it was still an effective and sometimes pretty nasty piece of the brain that had been twisted and misogoned in the J-bin. His story speaks of a bad Galician who is looking for his sister who is finishing for rape and rape of Yakuza scumbags, and a helping lady who is trying to get her, doing it after a similar rape and stunning. Oh yes and there is a bit of direct sex, unfortunately its all the soft kernels, like Japan's condemnation below the belt nudity, but the pixelation is minimal, in fact it is really noticeable in fun jobs. Although the writer / director Kazuo "Gaira" is not able to create a particularly convincing story, it is at least quite puzzling, diving into the early slag well, which has quite an amazing rape (which is aggravated by the fact that the gal looks young, although I'm pretty sure he was aged). It is also mostly a professional look, perhaps not stylish, but it has a certain affection and the content is handled fairly well, especially for the spirits, avoiding the use of pixels in many ways. Things are mostly about sex / rape based on about two-thirds of sharp running time and it's quite traceable if you make such a ticket price, after a while it gets a bit dull, but ladies are simple and occasionally relatively harsh. Music from YÃ´ichi Takahash is sometimes effective, though hardly any part of this exhibition is perfect in some places, but in any case it is enough to notice it. The most important are the consequences of Nobuak Koga, which provide impressive splattering when they appear, contributing to the lunar nature of clan shenanigans. Things are even pulling to the curious endings, certainly not funny or anything, but for a movie as long as it is, it's pretty enjoyable. All in all, this is a rather entertaining deviation for the average spiritual landfill fans, especially those who have a taste of Japanese rape adventures. I could really do a longer vengeance and more gore, maybe more points / brains, but hey, it kept me looking and it's pretty nicely equipped with memorable moments. So if you die of such degenerate spam, probably worth your time, just don't expect another outcome.
