I write this after seeing the last episode in the UK and it has to be a hard job for me to follow the standard. The last episode, called "Blink", has elements of a Gothic horror, all related to shapes that are not exactly what they seem. Doctor and Martha don't look much, but it doesn't diminish a well-designed episode. The general standard is built on a high level and the last three episodes, two partners with "The Family", and the latter have been the best I've ever done by the current team. <br /> <br /> It's not just David Tennant keeps it together, the whole supporting week, the week also helps. Waiting for the third series abroad is worth it.
