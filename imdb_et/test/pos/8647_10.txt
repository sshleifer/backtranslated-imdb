The Lost Highway has a sign that says: <br /> <br /> * MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD * <br /> <br /> (but you knew it already, isn't it?) <br /> > Because there are a lot of people who probably didn't get this movie, I would like to give you an interpretation of why the plot is perfectly reasonable. As others have pointed out, watching one movie is not enough. If you have a MD DVD, you can "cheat" by watching David Lynch's "Top 10 Tips to Unlock MD" (but only after the second or third view, please.);) <br /> <br /> First of all, Mulholland Drive is absolutely brilliant. Masterpiece. It's a movie that refuses to leave your head. DVD comments are often not very accurate, but Vogue's "It goes with your head and is there" really hit the mark. <br /> <br /> David Lynch deserves praise for having created a film that has not only a beautifully stylish look - cinematography - is a great actor (primarily Naomi Watts), a haunting band of the Badalament, and a quality that is so dreamy about it - but besides, the viewer can also be involved in some of the films before. (After all, when is the last time you saw a movie that just didn't leave your mind and everyone felt compelled to speak and write, regardless of whether they liked it or hated it?) <br /> <br /> Allright, enough of all this, it's time to justify those claims. <br /> <br /> Most people who have tried to assemble a plot have come to the conclusion that the picture is an illusion / dream. <br /> <br /> Of course, it is too bad for anyone trying to understand the movie, waiting for "traditional" methods where the story is put on time, logical and linear for the viewer. But for those who expect it, I invite you to check the director's name and come back. ;) <br /> <br /> MD is the story of Diane Selwyn, another actor, Camilla Rowles, hopelessly in love with a female actor. Thanks to Diane's little talent, he is constantly promoting his career and feels unable to meet his and her parents' expectations. Realizing that Camilla is never her (C. is dealing with director Adam Kesher), she hires a blow to get rid of her and then has to deal with the guilt she produces. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with what may seem like a strange opening to such a thriller; which is about the 50's dance / jitterbug competition, where we see the main character Betty, who gives a great result. We see an elderly couple with us (which we see in the movie two more times) and praise him. <br /> <br /> No, wait. This is what most people see for the first time. In fact, there is another very important fact that has been given before the credit - the camera is moving the object (though blurry) and the scene fades quickly. When you look closely, the object is actually a pillow that indicates that the following is a dream. <br /> <br /> The main characters on the first side of the movie: <br /> <br /> Betty: The imaginary self of Diane Selwyn, used in the first half of the film, a "dream series" - a successful, aspiring success young actor (Diane's full opposite). "Betty" was named because it is the real name of Winkies Writer. Note that in the dream version, the name of the reporters is "Diane". <br /> <br /> Rita: The fantasy version of Camilla Rhodes, which has become an amnesia with Diane's dream and imaginary car accident. It makes her vulnerable and depends on Diane's love. He is then conveniently placed in the luxurious home of Betty / Diane's aunt, to which Betty is allowed to stay. <br /> <br /> Coco: In Real Life, Adam's Mother. In the dream section, there is the woman responsible for the Betty apartment complex. He is mostly a strong authoritative figure that can be seen in both films. <br /> <br /> Adam: Director. We know on the other side that he is dealing with Camilla. His only goal in the first half of the film is just a punching bag for Betty / Diane as he develops such hatred against him. <br /> <br /> Aunt Ruth: Diane's real aunt, but instead of being out of town she's actually dead. Diane inherited the aunt's money and used it to pay for Camilla's murder. <br /> <br /> Mr. Roach: A typical Lynchia character. Not real; appears only in Diane's dream order. He is a mysterious and influential person who manages the chain of dream events for his wheelchair. He largely serves the same function as the twin dwarf (which he also plays) in Twin Peaks. <br /> <br /> Hitman: The man who is murdering Camilla. This sign is basically the same in both parts of the film, although it is a bit more glowing in the dreams (more below it). <br /> <br /> Now that you've found different versions of characters, we'll be able to dig into the plot. Of course, I'm not going to go to every little detail (neither chronologically), but I try to explain some important scenes in relation to Lynch's "Hint Sheet". <br /> <br /> As I mentioned above, Camilla was re-introduced as an amnesia through the unlikely survival of a car accident in the first 10 minutes of the film, which left her completely vulnerable. What's very intriguing to me about MD is that Lynch continually gives clues about what's real and what isn't. I've already mentioned a camera that is moving in a pillow, but you notice how two cars are approaching the limousine. <br /> <br /> Only one car hit the limousine; how else? Even if they were left out of the accident, would they not try to help others or at least ask for help? My theory is that because it is a dream, the existence of another car is simply canceled and forgotten. Because, as Rogert Ebert says beautifully, "Like real dreams, does not explain, does not end its sequences, lingers about what it finds to be exciting leaves unspoken promising lines." <br /> <br /> Shortly after Rita climbs out of Mulholland's dragon chamber and slides into the mountain and hits her aunt at Rutd's apartment, Betty arrives and we see this horrible old couple riding, staring at each other and smiling at each other and smiling at themselves and the camera . This is the first sign that what we see is a nightmare. <br /> <br /> Although the old couple seem to be unknown to Betty, I think they are actually his parents (because they praised him for the jitterbug competition). Maybe he didn't know all these things well and they didn't have a good relationship with them as he wanted, so the couple is very pleasant and helpful in his dream. They also represent his guilt for murder and Diane's unknown execution in relation to his unfulfilled goals in his life. <br /> <br /> A pretty long and fun scene is about Hitman. It seems that Diane sees her as the main force of the campaign that tries to force the director to participate in Camilla's film (second half of Adam's film), and therefore has a large part of her dream. Thanks to his guilt and regret for Camilla's murder, some of his will wants him to stay so he turns him into a foolish criminal. <br /> <br /> This scene, in my opinion, is also Lynch's attempt to completely screw his audience, because they have been given the wrong idea of ​​watching a movie. <br /> <br /> I have to love the "Something just a little bad for me" line. :) <br /> <br /> The next interesting scene is that of two Twinkies who are talking about how one of them keeps the man who he sees through the wall outside the dinner they are sitting on with the recurring nightmare. After a little talk, they go outside and continue walking in the corner of the fence, accompanied by excellent music that matches the mood of the scene. <br /> <br /> When you reach the corner, an angular face appears around the corner with a hidden face, frightening a lively crap that is a nightmare. This nightmare exists only in Diane's mind; he saw this man in the canteen when he paid for the murder. So, in short, his record translates this poor man's nightmare. The ball also marks Diane's evil as can be seen later in the movie. <br /> <br /> Cowboy is (with a dwarf) one of the strange characters that are always present in the Lynchia landscape - Diane only saw him for a short while at Adam's party, but just as our own dreams can give the insignificant people we hardly know in dreams so he gets an important part of his dream. During our scenes, we are also given additional hints that what we are seeing is not real (his unexpected disappearance, etc.). <br /> <br /> A cowboy is also used to mock the director when he meets with him in an odd location (the lights here clearly show that it is part of a dream). Notice how he says he will appear one more time when he (Adam) does good, or two more times when he's bad. Throughout the film, he appears twice more, showing Dean that he did bad. He is also the one who awakens him into reality (this scene is probably an illusion that suits his demands, which appears twice), and soon after, he commits suicide. <br /> <br /> Espresso scene with Castigliane brothers (where we see Badalament, composer, Luigi) is probably due to the fact that Diane was an espresso just before Camilla and Adam announced the other side of Adam's party. At the same time, it can also be a Lynch statement. <br /> <br /> At the time they enter Diane's apartment, the bed in the body is Camilla, but you notice how she has taken Diane's sleeping place; Diane sees herself in her dream, but her face is not her, although she had the same wounds on her face as Diane herself. This scene is also full of real Lynchian creepines. Because Diane didn't know where (or when) she hit Camilla and ended her, she just finished her home. <br /> <br /> In real life, listening to Diane was bad for the film. In her dream, she offers perfect listening, leaving the whole team ecstatic for her performance. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting that the money used in real life to pay for Camilla's murder now appears in Rita / Camilla purse. This is part of Diane's frightening action when he has been given money back because the murder has not happened now. <br /> <br /> When his neighbor arrives to get a piano-shaped ashtray, another hint is given; she takes ashtrays from her desk and leaves, but later, when Camilla and Betty meet on the couch, we see the ashtray again when the camera is placed over the table, indicating that Betty's meeting with her neighbor was fantasy. /> <br /> The episode of "Adam", which listens to the actors, is "She's a Girl"; which is exactly the same words that Diane uses to continue to shoot the cameraman Camilla. <br /> <br /> The blue box and key represent the main turning point of the movie and is where the real characters are clear. There are many symbols here; The box may represent the future of Diane (it is empty), or it may be a sort of Pandora box (hit laughs when he asks him what the key opens). In both cases, it is associated with a murder with a blue key (located next to it after the murder). The box is also visible at the end of the film in a hidden upright position. <br /> <br /> Silencio is a clean little add-on that reminds the viewer that what he is looking at is not real. It also means that Diane wakes up to her reality (her reality is a nightmare that she can't escape, even in her dreams). <br /> <br /> At the end of the cool scene where the creepy old couple reappears, Diane is tortured to see suicide as the only way out to escape the screaming and avoid bullying her fears. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's $ 0.02. I hope this can help people bring out this movie and call it "the worst movie" or something without realizing the plot. <br /> <br /> As usual, Lynch is about creating irrational fears, and he will get it with this picture. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
