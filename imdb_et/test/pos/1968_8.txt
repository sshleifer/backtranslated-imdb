A fair and enjoyable little science fiction / horror fantasy thriller for well-known video game designer Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh) whose latest game - "eXistenZ" not only drives people who want to try the game, but who almost kills him (and his game) ). Because he was forced to stay out of sight, Allegra is stuck with Ted Pikul (Jude Law), his bodyguard, though he only has a weapon made of meat and bone and weapons. are teeth. Director David Cronenberg has made good use of some bits of his earlier films ("Videodrome", "Scanners", "The Fly", etc.) and placed it in certain parts with some good timing. The law and Leigh are well here and some supportive pains (Ian Holm, Willem Dafoe, Sarah Polley, Christopher Eccelston and so on) with an international twist. Dafoe is nothing but devilish than gas, a misleading garage mechanic. One of the best scenes in the film is to witness Ted's eating (fish and frogs) and build a weapon and testify to Allegra - "I can't help myself." "eXistenZ" can show that he (Cronenberg) is in front of his old tricks and it still works like a charm.
