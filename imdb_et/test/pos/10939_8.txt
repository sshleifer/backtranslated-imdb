I watch a lot of vampire movies. I know vampire movies. Hammer Films has always been my favorite. Christopher Lee is always the best Dracula. <br /> <br /> Vampire Effect is a fun movie from start to finish. Duplication is not great, but I also like Godzilla movies, so I'm used to poorly dubbed movies. Anyway, I really liked this movie. SFX is great. Although Jackie Chans has nothing to do with the film and seems to have been added to sell the film, he is enjoyable. Fang's job is great. Operation is not great, but it can be related to poor duplication. Maybe it would be the right language for the film if I understood it. I'm sure the movie "Gone with The Wind" sounds worse in another language. <br /> <br /> I own this DVD and do not participate. I have it on my shelf next to my Hammer Films DVDs.
