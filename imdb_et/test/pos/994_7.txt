This movie was unhappy in the UK and it doesn't deserve it. The trailer of this film is a bit misleading and I think it misleads critics and the public to think it is "reconciliation: part 2". Although it was marketed to take advantage of the success of Joe Wright's BAFTA winning film, it is very different. It focuses on depicting the life of Welsh poet Dylan Thomas during World War II, the writer of the warfare propaganda films and the subsequent return to Wales. Director John Maybury quickly introduces Dylan (Matthew Group) childhood sweetheart Vera Phillips, played by Keira Knightley. He was Dylan's first love in his homeland, but the moment has passed and singer Vera only wants it as a beautiful memory. Or is he? Vera is unexpectedly waiting for a close relationship with another woman in Dylan's life, "Queen of Ireland, Love of My Life, Mother of My Child" Caitlin Thomas (Sienna Miller). Three forms of war-torn London trojans, but Vera then falls to a dirty soldier William Killick (Cillian Murphy). They're getting married fast, with Killick. Frightened Vera persuades Thomas to return to Wales, but these three are facing the realism of Vera's birth, William's jealousy and crust after returning home, and Caitlin realized she couldn't share Dylan with her best friend. , it's more of a mood than anything else. It works best when you realize that some memories and feelings need to be rewarded, but not renewed. Especially extraordinary is the performance of Sienna Miller (unfortunately, paparazzi reduces the point of being a talent), and Knightley and Murphy are once again very good. The decline is Rhys as Dylan, who, although the Welsh poet himself was not a bed of roses, has no charisma and makes us wonder what these women see in Dylan. Writing is very clumsy, some beautiful moments confused. Definitely worth a look.
