I adore the Phantom's Ln Chaney version and I appreciate the Webber version if I only want a growing interest in the book, I would like to see a more mysterious slant from the romantic aspects. I do not approve of the fact that Andrew Lloyd Webber interacted less with Raoul and Christine. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, it's just comic short with Erik and Christine. barely with other signs. <br /> <br /> I thought I was still waiting for another version to match Loni's performance. I was dead wrong. Leslie Nielson is fabulous as Erik, though it's naturally junk. It's still brilliant. <br /> <br /> I especially appreciated that Erik seemed to be a victim of a living body rather than an accident. I still have such a Phantom, except Loni. <br /> <br /> But I don't recommend this short if you don't like fraud. Because it should never be taken seriously.
