The film is a BBC series of 1956 entitled "My Friend Charles", and like such galops through the material in a relatively short time. I found it fast, enjoyable, and modest. where was John Mills gased? - Manufacturers probably decided to exclude scenes - maybe censorship - but notice when he was sitting behind a flat window, deep breathing followed by similar scenes where the car window was open. Francis Durbridge's serial numbers seemed alive in the same universe, in the case of inexplicable events, people are not as they appear and the offender is close to the hero / victim. Predictable universe in some way, but one with its own rules and rules.
