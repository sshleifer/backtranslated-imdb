this is an ok comedy about an aging father (C. Aubrey Smith) who decides to gather his grown children around the world. Davies works as a choir girl in New York when he gets the news that "Dad" wants him. Hmmmm, it sounds familiar. Davies' remarkable talents as comedy will otherwise save it as comedy as it disturbs the British countryside, where his American American personality is. Not as sharp as some other Davies comedies, but still worth it. Ray Milland plays his long-lost "brother". Doris Lloyd, Elizabeth Murray and Halliwell Hobbes are also fun.
