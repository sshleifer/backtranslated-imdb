SPOILER ALERT !!!! It was my son's review of the movie he wanted me to post. He wrote it, I swear. <br /> <br /> With Malcolm Middle Frankie Muniz and Nickelodeon Amanda Bynes they can show business. They're with actor Paul Giamat. He stole Jason Shepherd's essay from Big Fat Lia and puts it on the film. Jason (Frankie Muniz) and Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) have to go back. Jason's father doesn't believe he wrote this essay. So every time they see each other, Jason asks Wolf (Paul Giamatti) to give Jason a call because he wants his essay back! Wolf doesn't make a movie, but the business president does it. Finally, the family and Kaylee see "Made by Wolf Pictures" and are based on a real stage written by Jason Shepherd.
