In 1929, director Walt Disney and animator Ub Iwerks changed the face of animation with the release of his first "Silly Symphonies" series "The Skeleton Dance". Iwerks and Disney have been collaborating since the early 20th century on the Disney's "Laugh-O-Gram" cartoon series; but their friendship suffered a tremendous blow when Iwerks accepted a competitor's bid to leave Disney and start their own animation studio. It was the birth of Celebrity Productions, where Iwerks continued to develop his style and technique (and where he created the character of Flip the Frog). Although his work was as high, it was not very popular and by 1936 the studio was closed down. Later that year Iwerks Columbia Pictures and Iwerks hired to return to their old skeleton for another dance, this time in color. <br /> <br /> The 1937 "Skeleton Frolics" is basically a 1929 remake of the classic "The Skeleton Dance", a movie that will make him famous and lucky. Like this short film, it is placed in an abandoned cemetery where the midnight creatures live and play. The dead booms of his coffin, ready to be shown as a group of skeletons, have formed the orchestra and will play with a happy voice. Now it is not easy to be just a bones musician, because some of the members of the orchestra have problems with their parts of the body, but the band can be a good example and another group of skeletons will dance. The lovely couple of them are facing the same problems that disturb the orchestra: it is difficult to dance with open body parts. Everything ends at dawn and just as the sun rises again, the skeletons run towards their tombs. <br /> <br /> Director and animated Ub Iwerks himself, "Skeleton Frolics" follows the exact "" Skeletal Dance "years ago, though with a significant difference: Iwerks made the entire film at Technicolor. Light tones enabled Iwerks to create a more visually more attractive film and use he also had many new techniques he had practiced after Disney's departure, creating even better effects of depth and dynamism than he had previously imagined, which is certainly a more experimental film than The Skeleton Dance, although unfortunately this does not mean it is necessarily a better movie For starters, the movie is virtually identical to what it did with Disney, the only difference is the music (more later) and the color effect. It looks pretty, no doubt about it, but it certainly looks kind of unigiginal. <br /> <br /> However, the one-off nature of the movie, which actually hurts the movie (after which Iwerks will do it) is not a great opportunity), but the fact that Joe DeNat's movie is The musical melody created for the band is quite uninteresting and lacks charming elegance and fun for Carl W. Stalling's "Skeletal Dance". In other words, while DeNat's setup is effective and appropriate for the subject, it is quickly forgotten, while the Stalling song has a unique personality that makes it unforgettable. Being a musical film, this is very important, so the mediocrity of music reduces Iwer's flawless animation work. Personally, I think the better musical accompaniment would remind us that "Skeleton Frolics" would be pleasantly like "skeletal dance, even though it is so groundbreaking because it's still a fun movie to watch." <br /> <br /> It's kind of sad that most of the works Iwerks did after forgetting Disney's departure due to his bad success, but it must be said that when Iwerks did not have the popularity of Disney or Fleischer (Disney's main rival), he had no quality. It was probably just a bad luck that made the one who gave life to the Disney mouse, for the first time from Disney's failure, despite his shortcomings, "Skeleton Frolics" is a very funny and visually breathable film that, although not exactly the most original and freshest movie (one can't think of "Skeletal Dance" at the time of viewing it), it certainly reminds us that Iwerk skeletons are still here to tempt us and inspire us. <br /> <br /> 8/10
