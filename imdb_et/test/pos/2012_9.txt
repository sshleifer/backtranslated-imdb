I liked this show, it was in Britain, but not in peak hours, and they seemed to be moving over magazines so I couldn't look at them all. I was surprised if he didn't return and I had no idea why I still don't know, but I think it doesn't matter. <br /> <br /> Great performances from two leaders, they were very credible as friends. Two supportive actors also added well. I think it was part of a lifestyle load where friends were obviously the main ones, but the sex in the city came a few years later. <br /> <br /> Characters, take coffee, drink in nice bars, kind of stuff, a little woody allenish way.
