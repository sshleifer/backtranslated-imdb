Beautifully filmed, keep in mind the study of Roma culture in the context of your music. Travel across the continent, experiencing the amazing musical styles of different Roma groups. It is sort of misleading to say that this movie is not spoken. It is masterfully narrated by itself, growing melodies and subtitled words speak the story much better than the narrator. Watch this movie.
