I went to this movie, waiting for slasher, and although Mute Witness influences the style of filmmaking, it is much more than just your average slash. There are a number of thrillers that focus on certain trees - darkness is more common (blind terrorists, wait until darkness, Cat o'Nine tails to make a name for a handful), but the effects of such a thriller, as it is well illustrated and in fact an integral part of the plot Because the fact that the wiring is unable to speak is often the reason why it finds itself in dangerous situations that someone else could escape. Our mouth witness is Billy Hughes, a make-up artist who works in the Moscow studio to produce horror films. He finds himself locked in an hour and after trying to get help from his sister, he first stumbles on making illegal sex dragging, but soon it turns out to be a sniffing film! He tries to convince the authorities of what he sees, but finds that nobody believes in his story ... <br /> <br /> Recently, the hostel has made headlines to show off the making of films abroad, but this movie did it first and actually does a better job. It may not be as disgusting as Eli Roth's opus, but gore is more effective, and as director Anthony Waller (who led one of my favorite "The Guilty"), enjoys a good sense of humor, Mute Witness is so nice and fun to watch. The director is definitely a talent to drive the excitement of strangers because it has never stopped. Implementation of the plot is fast and Waller is constantly introducing revolutions of parcels that give a great help to the overall value of the film. Acting is not bad for B-film, young performers Marina Zudina, Fay Ripley and Evan Richards are showing good results. The atmosphere is sharp and Russian locations are inappropriately unfriendly, which helps keep the film in a predictive atmosphere. In general, Mute Witness is a much better film than you think it is. The plot flows well and the atmosphere and tension are on the ground.
