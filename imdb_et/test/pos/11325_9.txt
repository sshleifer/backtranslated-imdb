It lasted for several years, despite the late hour. <br /> <br /> Like many of the 80's criminal dramas, it seemed cold. Both physically and figuratively. It's not bad. And the (obviously) low budget actually worked. Dirty when the "slip" was. <br /> <br /> Allan Roy's surrounding segments as a news writer gave him some edge. <br /> <br /> The only participant I remembered was Scott Nylands (Earthquake) and Tony Rosato (SCTV). Hardly known was a good thing because we saw the group as a whole and not as a bunch of people who supported the "star." And yes, it's a young Clark Johnson (Homicide) on a recurring spot. <br /> <br /> I hope the DVD will be in the future. Does anyone out there want to do that?
