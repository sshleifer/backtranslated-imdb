Symbolist Robert Langdon (Hanks) is invited to Rome to help explain the secret behind Illuminati before a new scientific experiment blows up the city. <br /> <br /> The Da Vinci Code broke high scores in 2006, but most Dan Brown's followers who didn't make their award-winning books fair, and although they ran good for two and a half hours, seemed to have a lot. <br /> <br /> Having read the book, I was one of the few who enjoyed Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou to try to solve the mystery of the Louvre's murder, but for the angels and demons, the weights were lifted again as the leader letter and the director came back. give preference to angels and demons for Da Vinci code for entertaining reading, and it seems that critics and fans, though not yet fully justified, prefer this latest adaptation to the 2006 edition. <br /> <br /> This Howard image is definitely more clinical energy and workout than unlike Da Vinci, Tom Hanks' Robert Langdon h only for one night to solve the mysterious activities of the forgotten Illuminati in the Vatican and due to time constraints, action and despair excitement that definitely captures the Da Vinci code, but it also creates many twists and stunts An interesting factor in this 2009 release is the legitimate elements that are legitimate for the murders. Earth, wind, water, and fire are all covered in drastic and powerful sequences to pronounce the feeling of general power. <br /> <br /> This justifies a thriller label with constant tension and sharp drama. questions and beliefs that gave the full work again. <br /> <br /> Just like 3 years ago, there are a number of discovery and symbolic discoveries that are believed to have disappeared forever and Langdon is once again a key person to show everyone the light in and other contradictions between other urgent circumstances. <br /> <br /> It's fair to say that Dan Brown is a sophisticated writer; He definitely loves problems and dramas among his actions and exciting sequences. In addition to the discovery of the Illuminati, there is also a new Pope Selection scenario, which is once again linked to a new scientific experiment and the power of religion. It is all interesting to discover and listen to the occasional dialogue and dialogue, but since there is so much in the novel, it was always likely. <br /> <br /> Ron Howard, who honestly kept Da Vinci's normal way of rolling, is returned to the worst way. His jerky constantly moving camera style does not help to keep the pressure down and we can never fully accept what is happening on the screen due to its honestly depicted style. He's definitely not Paul Greengrass and that's not Bourne. <br /> <br /> Slick and stylized it is faster and more interesting than Da Vinci
