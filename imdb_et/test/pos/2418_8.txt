I thought this movie was great if you didn't take it too seriously. Just sit back and enjoy Hilary Swank in all your greatness and laugh when the monks go to Boston, MA. I also think this film has a great message about self-control and inner strength. Plus Myagi was so cute, I wish she taught me karate!
