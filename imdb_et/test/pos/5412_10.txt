Wow. When I went to this movie at the Toronto Film Festival, I had no idea what I was. This film takes you to the emotional skater in the best sense of the concept. Sigourney Weaver was better than I have seen him over the years; Emile Hirsch was great and Jeff Daniels broke my heart. I can see how this is not the tea of ​​every human being, because sometimes it deals with the harsh things that can happen to the family. Don't make me wrong - it's also very funny - my screening exploded the audience's applause again and again. I think if you are open to studying your life, Imaginary Heroes sincerely touches you. I can't wait until it appears in theaters.
