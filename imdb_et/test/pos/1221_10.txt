This movie was great! Tangi Miller and Flex did a great job. They both look good and they both pulled it out. Tosha Smith was a cousin, like a cousin, and he couldn't survive his business. Aloma was sweet and played with dear grandmother, she reminded me of her grandmother. And Oh, I can't forget about the forgotten man, he had found it and I didn't know if I should look at his eyes or smile he would reveal his sexuality on the big screen. he was good! Tang seemed flawless and sexy, and he stepped up after Felicitys. There was a lot of actors and actors in the A-list. It was funny, sexy, crazy, touching, loving, emotional and wonderful. This movie must be visible! Go to the DVD now if it isn't!
