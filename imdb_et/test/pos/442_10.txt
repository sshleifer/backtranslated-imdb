This is my favorite Renoir of the fifties. This is the story of how Henri Danglard built and launched the Moulin Rouge nightclub; we see on-the-job workers to get ongoing work and dancers training. Finally, the revenge of the evening opening and the long sequence of Canaan's dance. Financial problems and ego representations by performers have been described. <br /> <br /> Gabin is in great shape as a simple Danglard - see that he is humorously engaging with Nin's violent boyfriend. Gianni Esposito moves as a spiritual prince who treats Nini. Maria Felix, who is with this Amazon body, is like egoist Lola, Danglard's first lover. Finally, Françoise Arnoul, like Nin, is just a stunning washing machine that dances to Danglard and becomes her girlfriend; His love and magic will win you over. <br /> <br /> Bonus: We get Edith Piaf, Patachou, André Claveau and other stars that play back a century ago who ruled over Moulin Rouge.
