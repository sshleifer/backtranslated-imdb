Vidor looks like Judith, the only truly strong and compassionate member of a strictly patriarchal family. His brother, David, is so weak in their father that he is surprised that he can even tie his shoes instead of asking his dad to do it. <br /> <br /> Other reviewers have already drawn, so I'm not going to repeat it; However, I note that Nan, who is pregnant with David, is also married to him. This is not a marital pregnancy that would have been terrible for the 1921 standards. These two are secretly married, but Nani's father, who was paid by David's father, tears his marriage certificate. <br /> <br /> The scene of Nan's death, in which Judith participates, is a truly heart-shaped experience and highly accused of emotions. This scene alone is worth watching a movie, but there is much more to it; Why does the Earth have no contemporary movies that are made with the same attention to the story?
