I'm not quite sure why I ordered "Fingersmith" from Netflix - probably because I enjoy the BBC drama, it was on the list of recommendations. I had no idea what I saw. On the plot I only describe in general, so as not to spoil it for anyone who sees it after reading my review, there are more turns than the mountain road in the rocks, the type that usually appears in the "capricious". movies. They are very unusual in the drama of the period. If you haven't read the novel (and I'm not going to do it), I was completely ready for the surprise that completes the first segment of the DVD and will surprise you with the next turn. However, these two young directors (Sally Hawkins, especially Sue and Elaine Cassidy as Maud), and the main support role of Imelda Staunton's mother in the early house, and Charles Dance are a rich uncle who collects pornographic material and rescues a young Maud from his mad house. lived as his secretary. The Lesbian affair between Maud and Sue is the "big news" of the movie, but not really her centerpiece. The central part is the plot that steals a fortune that Maud will hold on his 21st birthday. Plot revolutions and twists add tension to the film, though not much reliability. However, no viewer is likely to doubt that Maud and Sue will somehow come together - unlikely - as the role of credit. While one is raised as an ady and serves a pornographic collector and the other is a handkerchief that represents a woman's servant, the author obviously means that they live together. It's a little hard to swallow, because everyone has agreed to cheat on you. Despite these reservations, I liked the movie well enough. It does not deserve the praise that others have sought for it. The most frightening and interesting scenes are in the madhouse, where one of the two young women is limited until he is able to flee and return to London to bring the story to an unexpected conclusion. Sally Hawkins (Sue) is a very impressive young actress who is able to convey the casual and changing emotions of her character with her facial expressions and eyes. No doubt we see him more. I certainly hope so.
