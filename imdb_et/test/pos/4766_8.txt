One of my favorites. As a child who grew up in the NY subway area in the late 1960s and early 1970s, I was often given the opportunity to visit my grandfather or father NYC when they were doing business there. This city, especially in winter, is a sharp, lively, human, reality left with me. <br /> <br /> This movie hits the NYC's winter season with a harsh, cold, factual experience, while revealing the region's infamous crime and police work. Great picture of the moment and culture. <br /> <br /> And car chasing is just amazing. At least parallel to "Bullitt" and crossing "French Community". I can look again and again when the suspension stays with the Plymouth Fury policeman who is heading towards the GW Bridge, as it pulls into this sharp right curve, bouncing and scraping into the upcoming zone. The stunt-ride coordinator of this scene was made by "Bullitt" and "French Connection" as well as many other noticeable movie clips. Good functioning and a good plot line. The music point is nervous and convincing, and cinematography and direction are top-notch. Great than the underrated police book of the 1970s. Farmer. Not yet on DVD. <br /> <br /> Comparable style and content: French connection and Super Fly. In the early 1970s, police dramas were in the dark in NYC during the winter months.
