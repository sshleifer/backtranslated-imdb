I consider this loving and sensationally written story one of the real masterpieces of the screen. After seeing the film, which was originally on the silver screen with her mother, in Los Angeles, California, when it first appeared, it took many years before I had the chance to experience it again. The beauty of the film, the silent simplicity of elegance and the peace of mind, set it apart from many others. Yeah, tears come to my eyes when I see it, and I hear it repeat in a lifetime song. maybe still my first beloved movie. I hope that this classic love story will be enjoyed and appreciated by our future generations.
