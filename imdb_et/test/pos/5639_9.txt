Okay, so I'm a good documentary importer, especially when he talks about the story of Don Quixote today. Warning: I met Mark Borchard 1995/96. In winter, when he was still working in Coven. But I'll save this story later. The American film, which started production for a long time, depicts exactly the person I knew, even deeper than I expected or believed. It is a very funny and very sad film that has been executed at the same time. Mark is overcoming his own worst enemy: his childish ambition and optimism - which I admire - are undermined by his obvious artistic failure and his strange fiscal policy expectations. But he is also a charismatic man. His loyal Sancho Panza tie is just as pleasurable: loyal when it comes to the heart. Like the Don Quixote, the American film is often an ineffective aspect of the ignored freedom - that people are drawn to the professions to which they are not particularly well suited, regardless of repeated failure. This is a great movie.
