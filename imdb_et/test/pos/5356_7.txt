Mis-ho! This is good. I say cheerful good, ol 'lap. Or should I say "ol" oa? My British terminology is a little dusty. Anyway, my biker boots and I walked into this screening without any previous experience with Wallace and Gromid. I'm happy to say that my boots and I were happy to meet you. <br /> <br /> Although W&G is not available to adults as Toy Story, they still manage to be smart enough to provide small, humorous youngsters who will surely get over the youth who are too busy when they are a rabbit they have a clue that something is wrong. I highly recommend that you pay attention each time you see books or words on the screen because there is a quick glimpse of what you forget if you do not pay attention. My favorite is the book of monsters, which refers to the monster of Loch Ness as a "tourist trap". If you have ever said I say, "I can really relate to Kevin Federline," or if you are just illiterate, not only will you miss these jokes, but you should probably learn your time instead of reading movies instead why. Consider this as a public service announcement. <br /> <br /> The most remarkable aspect of W&G is its clay animation. Thanks to the tedious process, it took five years to finish the movie! According to the press releases, it was a few days when the optimal target was just a 10-second movie. People, sometimes I find it difficult to find motivation to stop receiving some emails or add captions to pictures (a point that the lack of images in this review proves); so I can't even imagine the patience needed for that. <br /> <br /> I really like the quality of harsh practical features. The fact that clay has fingerprints is a nice and personal touch. How can you not impress a clay sign that shows more expression and emotion than Paul Walker and Keanu Reeves? The curse of suffering is when the director Nick Park calls it, the world's first vegetarian horror film that should provide entertainment for both children and adults. Based on this (and if a man who boasts his shag with hair, in a cool, bearded masculinity, I use this word without hesitation) cute (oh man, I shouldn't use that word), loved characters, not obsolete M.C. Hammer references, W&G is proof that DreamWorks can create entertainment animation when it chooses cheap jokes.
