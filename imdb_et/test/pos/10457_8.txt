It looks like an impressionist film; if there is such a thing. <br /> <br /> The story is well told, very poetic. well-developed and well-functioning characters (or interpreted by the actors)). <br /> <br /> The film sometimes rejoices in its rich emotions and works well if you don't know such emotions in movies - that's not the case with me. <br /> <br /> This is a very humanistic film. <br /> <br /> The landscape and even the displaced chef are extraordinarily exceptional in themselves. <br /> <br /> Well done. <br /> <br /> A good class for every good movie collection.
