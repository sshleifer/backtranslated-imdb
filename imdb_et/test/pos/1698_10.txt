Is it a full moon today? Oh! It doesn't matter if they can change if they want this medicine! What did I mean when her full moon tonight? Geez <br /> <br /> I like this movie, it's romance, intercourse, horror and hot stuff; . It was really cool. This movie is set in a city of love in Paris, France. The cemetery scenes are nice, it gives you chills that don't know what's going on or who's behind the walls. The scenes that make the jump from your seat are really cool. Even they got me the scene. His friend, who died, and the girl he died in the cemetery, but still showing himself as a leading character (sorry that I forgot my name), was really funny. The actors did a good job and the craftsmen. The part where they all celebrate in an abandoned church cannot believe that people are doing it, because although it is an abandoned church, it is still God's house. I bought this movie a long time ago and I don't regret buying it. I'm a horror-movie-lover. I'll give this movie 5 stars out of 6. Give people who are open and love such movies a try.
