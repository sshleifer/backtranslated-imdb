I really liked this movie ... but the ads I saw, and one of the published reviews, actually said this movie was "lightly touched". This is very misleading for me. <br /> <br /> There is really a lot of humor: eccentric, subtle, sometimes slightly twisted humor: a kind of humor that I am very tempting in general. But most humor is one that always seems to be deeply serious, deeply sensitive, even deeply painful. The film collects past and present, perception and truth, memory and activity, life and death. The whole film is influenced by the history of European anti-Semitism and especially the history of the Holocaust. <br /> <br /> How can humor and horror be combined into the same movie? The review saw Absurd humor. I don't think this is the case; at least not in the whole sense. Instead, I think this film is a great tradition of Jewish / Yiddish literature and theater. I do not claim to be any expert in this field; but what I have seen humor is used in this cultural context as a means of coping with the terribly tragic experience of this people; and humor is also used as a means of restoring "divine" to men and women who choose the path of faith rather than the way of despair or absurdity. See "Fiddler on the Roof" for the humor that is used in both directions in this rich tradition. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood (Jonathon) Wood carries horn-lined glasses that really look at him, weird: compare with Sin City he wore the same type of glass with a cooling effect. In this film, it is easy to see how glasses become a metaphor for both the search for it and the struggle between perception and truth. Eugene Hutz (Alex) and Boris Lesking (Alex) are both really wonderful. Jonathon and Young Alex are from the same generation, but they look so, very different; and then find that they are not so different. And the way the obvious narrative voice gradually changes from Jonathon's youth to Alex's stage when Jonathon's planned discovery journey turns into a discovery for both young Alex and old Alex ... is so touching to me <br /> <br /> Current and surrounding area (which has been spoken) are some wonderful scenes and panoramas that stand for the Ukrainian story. Everyone feels very authentic and seems to give a great place; although I have never been to Ukraine and can not be proved by the first-hand experience. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you are looking for a light comedy, I wouldn't want to recommend this movie at all. On the other hand, if you are interested in a wonderful, delightful and deeply moving movie, please watch this wonderful movie.
