The March 1947 article in the New York Times described Crossfire as one of the first Hollywood films in the 1940s to "face issues of racial and religious prejudice, which is more direct courage when the audience is used to waiting." Although RKO produced Crossfire, Twentieth Century-Fox made Gentleman's agreement, the second on anti-Semitism. RKO won many "ballyhooed" foxes for theaters, releasing Crossfire several months before the Gentleman Agreement. In July 1947, RKO traveled to Crossfire for various Los Angeles religious groups. In addition, several studies were conducted before and after the screening of the film to evaluate the audience's prejudices. Crossfire received both praise and criticism for depicting anti-Semitism in America and was the subject of many editions. Crossfire was named the best prize in the Academy Award but disappeared from the Gentleman Agreement. It was also the best actor (Robert Ryan), the best supporting actor (Gloria Grahame), the best director and the best scenario (customization). In September 1947, Crossfire was named Cannes' best social film. In December 1947, Ebony magazine gave the African-American edition of the film an annual prize for "improving interracial understanding". Loved this movie. If you have the opportunity to watch it, look at it.
