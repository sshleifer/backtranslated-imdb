The very embarrassing giallo of the director of "L'Anticristo" (1974) begins with a wonderfully handled sequence involving a priest, a little girl and a broken doll. But the main story is maniac (David Warbeck). getting married with traumatized exhaustion to kill him for his money. The plot, though not original, is really tense, acts good and has many skillful and gory murders. The Francesco de Mass score is quite effective, some of which may be somewhat effective. to hear Lucio Fulci's "The New York Ripper" (1982) .China recommended for Italian cinema fans!
