I saw this movie in the hidden preview and it's nice. Cinematic art is unusually creative, the actor is good and the story is fabulous. If this movie doesn't work well, it's not because it doesn't deserve it. Before that movie I didn't know how wonderful Shia Lebouf could be. He is a great, independent work leader. There is something wonderful about him and it makes the film even better. Other actors also do a good job, and the film includes moments where there is a really great relationship, more than anyone can expect from a golf game. Sports films are about a dozen dots, but it stands out. <br /> <br /> This is one I would recommend to anyone.
