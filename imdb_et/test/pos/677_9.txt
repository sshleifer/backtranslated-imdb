When I first saw this movie, it was around 1956, and although I saw it recently, I haven't changed it. I think it was Robert Ryans' best film because he depicted someone like my father and he was schizophrenic (my father) in real life, though he didn't kill anyone but was more affected during World War II, which made him worse. Being humor with her just to get and get through the day was so fit. (My mother and brother had to do it) When I saw Robert Ryan representing these types of people, it was a very good type of indicator of this type of people and I was impressed.
