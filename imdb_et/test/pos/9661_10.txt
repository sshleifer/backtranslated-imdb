My teacher made this movie. This is a new beginning. Look at it and you won't notice it's a Romanian film. The old boring style has gone. Now there's something else. Post-revolutionary film. It uses the latest imaging technology and mostly unknown artists. They are unique. You don't even know that you are looking at you just over the screen and you know every frame. Don't ignore this, pay attention to the plot, but don't ignore the details. They make a difference between this film and other Romanian films. At some point you will hear music. It is our part representative, but it does not represent us. Please keep your head straight and leave your body free.
