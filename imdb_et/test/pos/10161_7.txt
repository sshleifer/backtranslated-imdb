"The Man Who Knew Too Much" gets into this Hitchcock centerline, which featured many of his films in the 1950s: in no way a masterpiece, but an amazing number. <br /> <br /> James Stewart and Doris Day are playing with a resting couple who will come to the invading intrigue with a heavy plot of land. The famous climatic scene takes place at a classical music concert where someone is murdered during a cymbal collision. Reasonable Hitchcock allows us to know what this point is, so that the race to end the assassination becomes a cymbalist to attack the nail. <br /> <br /> So much of this movie reminded me of the 1978 Chevy Chase / Goldie Hawn comedy "Foul Play", which I have to believe the film is inspired by. Neither movie is a big deal, but both are easy to enjoy. <br /> <br /> Rating: B +
