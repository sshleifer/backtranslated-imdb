I acknowledge my ignorance of the existence of this movie until I saw it in the advertising of the cable outlet. I was very impressed with the innovative structure of the film. The film that is in a language that I do not understand seemed to me with intelligence and nuance. I think it's talking about the quality of the movie. It was visually stunning. The action took place visually. Chinese theater traditions used to promote dialogue are so convincing after watching Western film, where participants traditionally focus more on dialogue. The action of this movie comes just for you, without much explosions to draw your attention. It is human activity that is so affective. The additional advantage the film taught me about history as one of the world's largest tourist attractions was China's first Qin Emporer funeral army very impressive. It seems to give the film's international importance outside the major ethical issues of the film. This is a movie that I can comfortably recommend to a variety of friends and acquaintances.
