The word Ghilli actually means a small sharp wooden toy that is used in a game called ghill dandy (Cricket's predecessor) in India. The use of the word as a nickname for the main owner is stylish because it means it is sharp, fast and can be rubbed in the wrong direction. <br /> <br /> Ghilli is one of the best films of Vijay and it is unmatched at its pace and action. The film will never let you stop for a moment and will always keep you entertained. The film is set in Madurai and Chennai and its story is simple. The rich landlord tries to lure a beautiful girl in her city, and her undisputed power and authority prevent the girl from seeking justice. The hero is trying to save him and most of this movie is a week when it all works. <br /> <br /> A very exciting movie, and although the story is nothing new, the director and the actors get a full-blown action.
