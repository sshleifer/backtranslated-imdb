It is so refreshing to see such a movie with a real mood and personality, not just a bunch of tricks made by CGI. This is a great horror fight that has real chills with truly amazing sets and performances. His laughs are fine but rich. Since there are very few or no CGIs, there is no need to shake the camera violently to conceal hidden effects. This makes the movie tremendously traceable compared to other camera-man-must-sh- # @ ing-his-pants movies that have appeared in the last decade. <br /> <br /> Much more enjoyable than the big budget Hollywood will release today. <br /> <br /> Look at it.
