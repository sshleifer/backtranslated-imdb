As already mentioned, the first music video could be considered a short film "Every Sunday" (1936). It was a happy accident caused by the need for MGM to draw a variety of short films for the show with its long material. They had a couple of fresh young singing talents (Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin) and they basically created a mix of musical styles in the park at Norman Rockwell's usual concert. <br /> <br /> Who would have dreamed at that time that they would be the best picture collection in Eisenstein's "Odessa Steps". <br /> <br /> This is a Sunday, where small wooden bands sitting in the park are surrounded by remarkable people, while the tired-looking ensemble plays Strauss. Events will open and Judy and Deanna will record the next Sunday. The operative Deanna sings "Il Bacio" (The Kiss) and Garland in contrasting "waltz with swing". The climax connects the two styles nicely to the "Americana" duet. <br /> <br /> A must see. <br /> <br /> Then what do I know? I'm just a child.
