Magical. Terror. Easy boredom. <br /> <br /> The fact that "born" has been acquired for flavors is, without a doubt, just not looking at it when your friends are not real buffs of art houses. You must dig odd, macabre, odd. You must dig cool flicks. And you need to dig to find diamonds. <br /> <br /> "Started" is one of the most visually dazzling and mysterious films ever. The visual part is something to anticipate, something that nobody can prepare for you. But since the film lacks any kind of dialogue, the visual part is pretty much the only part. The film tapes created for the film are magical and groundbreaking, but still .... its sight .... <br /> <br /> God makes suicide in a particularly cunning scene, then his mother rises from the body of the Earth who impregnates with God's sperm and gives birth to meat bones, slowed baby. Then he will give up on him, and he will torture the pagan beings. Is he and his son murdered by terrible beings. <br /> <br /> Film is about the pointlessness of life and the fact that we come to this planet to suffer and die, and that if something dies, something else is born. Nihilism. <br /> <br /> The quality of movie # 1 is, of course, visual, device, worshiping images, the rest of the world. You've watched, you feel like an alien. This is what is mesmerizing. <br /> <br /> If people say it should last 30 ', not 70', they are right. It's just that everything happens at such a slow pace. In fact, the summary of the schemes I have presented is all that happens in the movie, like no jokes. So far, that's .... I don't know .... Glorious ... <br /> <br /> ... As the flame burns from darkness ...
