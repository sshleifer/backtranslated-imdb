This movie was one of the best I've ever seen. Just the other day I was reminded of this movie on TV. It came back to me like a dam flood. I've never touched the movie more than that. After the movie ended, I couldn't cry for about 2 hours. No movie has changed me so far. I was 15 years old and haven't seen it, but I hope to find a copy for the purchase so I can always look at it. If anyone wants you to see this movie together, GO ... you don't have to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Peggy Fries
