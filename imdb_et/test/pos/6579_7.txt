I just wanted to say that I liked this movie, but I also want to ask for something. Does anyone know the name of an artist / song of a song that a young boy (who doesn't remember his name right now) plays with his cd player when his father and 2 men come in and take a TV and a cd player ??? this song is so cool even though i don't understand the word they say ... send me the artist / song name at hpn_x@hotmail.com, thank you so much in advance! =) --------------------- repetition -------------------------- --- I just wanted to say that I liked this movie, but I also want to ask for something.
