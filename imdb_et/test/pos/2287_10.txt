This is a great, little-known film. Tom Selleck does a great job with Clint Eastwood in Japan. I'd like to see if this movie has come out on the DVD, there are some places that are clearly cut. Hiroku (the interest of Tom's love) is clearly partially cut. It would be interesting to see more movies from Japan. Baseball sequences are by far the most realistic of baseball films, I'm pretty sure most of the participants were current or former baseball players. I love loading this tape tape at least once a year. The best scenes are the lack of hats after Tom plays in a big game and Tom has an intense sensual scene with a hot bath with Hiroku. Dennis Haysbert is also doing a good job, it is good to see that he finally gets recognition, not just in baseball films (he was also in the Major League).
