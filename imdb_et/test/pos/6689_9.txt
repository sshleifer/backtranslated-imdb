Personally, I think Kevin Spacey is one of the greatest actors of his generation, perhaps the greatest. This, together with another amazing actor, Jeff Bridges, can't be bad. And that's the movie! "K-PAX" is one of the most pleasant surprises of recent years. First of all, the film has a great story. It's part of what makes the movie so big. Another aspect that contributes to film size is the actor. The Spacey-Bridges combination really works. <br /> <br /> It was the second time I saw the movie and I'm sure it's not the last time. K-PAX has it all. There are moments that are extremely funny, parts that resemble a real thriller and others that resemble a high-level drama. I think this film deserves a much higher rating and a lot more prizes. Great movie! <br /> <br /> 9/10
