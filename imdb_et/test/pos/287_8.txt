Anyone who criticizes "Jacqueline Hyde" as more than a playful and undoubtedly erotic romp he is going to play just doesn't play in full pack. It is clear from the title that this low budget horror comedy is not meant to be serious ... it is a language as well as a nymph French kiss, and just like that. Female cast members are all great and fun to watch. Check it out, Rolfe Kanefsky is the prince of the horror of the soft core. Unlike most soft-core horrors, it is fun with all charismatic and exceptionally attractive actresses. The film does not even try to follow the classical style of Robert Louis Stevenson, but instead tries to find every opportunity to create a sight and erotic situations. Blythe Metz, a brunette femme fatale, depicting Jacqueline's sex and killing, is a real drop. Watch and enjoy!
