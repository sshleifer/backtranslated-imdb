This movie is so loved that you want to be part of it forever. Flicks are straight, but not malicious, the goods are transparent and the criminals are barely there. Even the "cabaret" is so naive that it makes you dream of something that is available on the TV compared to nostalgia. Blier is good as a little one-sided. Louis Jouvet is perfect, you just can't get better copper. He has the best line: "My dad cleansed other people's dirt and I do the same". Susy Delair is intolerable, but in part it is songs, wardrobe and hairstyle. Simone Renant, on the contrary, makes a big femme fatale a bit quiet. I didn't know he might be a lesbian, like IMDb's dbdumonteil user and others are rightly suggesting.
