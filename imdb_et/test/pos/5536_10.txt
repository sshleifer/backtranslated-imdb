Married Mob was one of the first VHS birds I had with America and fat. After all these years, I still like memories of this movie. Hell, I have this VHS movie still in good condition. <br /> <br /> Story: Undercover policeman Mike Downey (Matthew Modine) is sent to the spy of killed Angela De Marco (Michelle Pfeiffer). Mafia Member Frank "Cucumber" De Marco (Alec Baldwin). Later he falls in love after he realizes that he is innocent. Not only does Angela have to deal with unwanted advances in mob's superior Tony "The Tiger" Russo (Dean Stockwell), but also has to deal with jealous husband Connie Russo (Mercedes Ruehl). <br /> <br /> Married Mob is funny and still interested if he doesn't want to be funny. I like the tiny little ones in the life of the mafia (jealous mafia wife, mobboss who doesn't understand that she's not a chick magnet, etc.) and you like the characters of Angela De Marco and Mike Downey. It was Johnathan Demme's last funny stage before he became serious and gave you precious stones like Philadelphia and the silence of lamb (the best slow thriller). If you're in the mood for comedy, Married to Mob. It's better than the current contemporary comedy (Epic Movie, Date Movie, Meet the Spartans, Disaster Movie, etc.).
