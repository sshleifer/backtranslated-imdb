You can't see the same movie if you didn't grow in France (or you spent at least 10 years there, like me). I don't know if it will ever do it outside of the French cultural sphere (here is Belgium and Luxembourg). You can't translate such fun - every name is a joke (how many people outside Paris would understand "Couloirdebus", the name of one Roman legionnaari?). But Monica Bel (l?) ​​Ucci is so beautiful, I almost forgot to breathe when I saw her.
