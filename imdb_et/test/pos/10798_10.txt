If you think "Oliver Stone" is a memorable movie, its greatest and most controversial, such as Platoon, JFK, was born on the fourth of July or natural born killers. Talk radio usually does not. This is actually a very small movie. More than half of the films take place with Barry Champlain in their radio station, who talks about his mike. But believe me, this is one of Oliver Stone's biggest films and MUST NOT be overlooked. <br /> <br /> This is especially a character training. Barry Champlain is a rude, self-destructive, risk-taking, talking radio show that says too many things and is struggling with his boss, his lover (s), his fans and even some Nazis. She doesn't like her audience and callers, and many of them don't like her (eitor, she does, but she doesn't know why). But in the end, he says at his exhibition, "I think we're stuck with each other." <br /> <br /> See Talk Radio, even if you don't like Oliver Stone. You may be surprised. I'm sure it was. <br /> <br /> My rating: 10/10
