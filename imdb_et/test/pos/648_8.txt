I found this movie on Netflix and I had to add it to my queue. I wasn't disappointed when I got it so funny when I saw it in a local ride. <br /> <br /> It rests well on the climax when you see a glimpse of different characters when they start their journey across America "Honky Tonk Freeway, America on wheels." It was a strange comedy role for William DeVane because I remember him on Kennedyna's 1974 television film "The Rockets of October" and I felt that no one could have pulled this dramatic character so well. <br /> <br /> It reminds me a little about Dick Van Dyke's "Cold Turkey", where Van Dyke was a local minister, DeVane's role as mayor, minister and activist was typical of small towns, making his character fun and real. > <br /> Howard Hessman and Teri Garr as the kidnapped family in the RV were also targets by that time. Anyone who has traveled with small children (are we still there?) Will appreciate these scenes. /> <br /> Small town scenes that try to survive have reminded me of a small town where I grew up, but they acted with charm and humor that you often only saw in small towns. The cities disappeared due to the road system, and it gives a realistic, humorous insight into what they were supposed to survive. (Used by zoo animals anyone?) <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a light comedy with no special message but humorous look at America in the early 80s. It is worth checking out if you just need a little joy.
