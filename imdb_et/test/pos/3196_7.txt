This short was in the "Short Cinema Journal" part four - a movie I rented from Netflix, but which seems to be a monthly film series for people who like mediocre contemporary short film AND love that DVDs are full of ads. So far, I've tried two magazine DVDs and I felt terrible that the viewer had to watch the movies. Talk about superfluous and overly complicated ways to do it! Although I have and see as many trousers as possible, I really doubt whether I worry about these magazines because of these factors. <br /> <br /> Now it may be because I didn't like much on the disc that I didn't like the short Portuguese animation. This is certainly possible. Even if that is the case, I think the other reviews were too positive about this simple film. Some works of art were really nice - I liked how simple black and white drawings suddenly became a three-dimensional environment when the camera went bored far from the fire and dove down the city. It was lovely and took some work. But like the story of a cat who wants to go to the moon, it didn't make me anything. <br /> <br /> IMPORTANT UPDATE - I saw this movie again on DVD entitled "Cartoon Noir" on July 5th. / 09. It was a pretty unpleasant collection of art films. But this time I saw KATU AND MOON STORY with a completely different sound track and the boy made the difference. With Portuguese subtitles, he was a French accent narrator who spoke English in the Noir style. Although I usually hate duplication, this time it made a movie. The Portuguese version of the narration leaves much to be desired if you do not know the language or understand the nuances. If you don't speak the language, try searching for another version (assuming you understand English).
