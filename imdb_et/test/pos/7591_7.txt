Canthony is right that this little short is just an excuse to hear a very young Judy Garland (fourteen years old!) Singing a little older (one year) with Deanna Durbin. But I have to disagree with everything else he said, including runtime - which is only about ten minutes, not twenty (one reeler). <br /> <br /> The song is not his best, probably; but it's enjoyable and definitely worth ten minutes to see Turner. Duett Durbin is quite interesting: two contradictory styles that still fit quite well. <br /> <br /> The short is just thrown away, but it's not as bad as the other reviewer did. Honestly, I enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Dafydd ab Hugh
