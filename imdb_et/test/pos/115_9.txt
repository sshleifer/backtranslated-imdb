Its a very sensitive image of life that is innocent or finite. What do you want to do with rigid norms in culture and society? One spouse finds a migrant sales point - because immigrants are not or have not been admitted, they do not have to satisfy their wishes. The other spouse is seeking solace in spirituality and trying to empty his desire. It fails - of course - and it breaks the last scene for several reasons. Sita was still caring enough to find that she didn't know she was not responsible for her abandonment. Her mother still couldn't find the strength to destroy her myth. She sees her as a child who predicts her lust, but should she give her the opportunity to eventually grow? Both women find courage and unity through the rejection of their common marriage. <br /> <br /> But the last rejection was by grandmother - she couldn't get rid of her rotten mindset to accept Sita's desire. Ten years and more of care could not be enough to break the chains of its culture. <br /> <br /> It seems to have been the easiest thing for a household to have its desires flowing - because it is terrified by its culture. the bottom of the hierarchy. Because there is no respect and expectation, it can also be a taste of sin.
