Recently, after catching James Earl Jones in the title, they are caught. It was better than I expected. Of course, it's pretty old - in the early 70s, but it's really a good drama. It runs fast 90 minutes or so and shows good performances by James Earl Jones and Diahann Caroll. The plot is commonly common, but speaks of a black woman in terms of well-being with 6 children and trying to solve all the permanent problems. It changes the interesting view ..... also the fact that the script was not too sentimental or overpowered - it's almost like looking at parts of the past. All the 70's styles are many. The end is sort of kooky, though .... would probably be better without the theater.
