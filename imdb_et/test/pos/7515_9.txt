Read the story of George C. Scott late and learn why he was so gifted. The interviewer asked him what his secret was about each character. Scott replied, he possessed the burning fire that led him. Unfortunately, in one of his last interviewers, he showed that he had lost the race. It wasn't like he was in the hospital. In this offer, he plays the talented doctor Bock, one of the best hospitals in one country. But life has given her some difficulties, such as losing her husband to divorce, alienating both her promising children and worse, believing she is physically impossible. At this point, he is now becoming self-satisfied, bad and often fantasizing about the various ways of committing suicide. To add to his growing list of personal obstacles, his main reason is his hospital has been restricted by students and neighborhood demonstrators, incompetent doctors such as Dr. Welbeck (Richard Dysart) and mysterious MD. who kills both patients and doctors because he believes he is "Lamb's Wrath". (Barnard Hughes). There are few choices left for Bock. One is the promising doctor Brubaker (Robert Walden) whom he trusts, saying, "If there were an oven, I'd put it on the head." The other is a lush young woman named Barbara, attracted by Bock, because she acts as a wounded bear. Paddy Chayefsky wrote the screen, and Arthur Hiller did an extremely good job of guiding this dramatically interesting story of darkness, but still a vehicle lit by the fire of George C. Scott. ****
