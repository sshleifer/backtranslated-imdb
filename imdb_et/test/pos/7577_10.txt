I never remember reading Sarah, Plain and Tall at school, but when my son told me about it and said they were watching a movie in class, I wanted to see it. I borrowed a video from the library and watched it as a family. It was a great story. But I did not know a few months ago that there were queues. I finished watching this week. I discovered one small victim: in another film, Skylark, Jacob remembers when he was a boy, and says to Sarah "my brothers and sisters and I would dream ...". At the end of winter, they are not "brothers and sisters" in the conversation between Jacob and his father. But this is a very small oops and I only looked at it when looking at the trilogy, the second time. A great movie, you have to see a good healthy family.
