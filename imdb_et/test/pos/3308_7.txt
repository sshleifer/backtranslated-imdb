Rona Jaffe's best-selling screen version of the best-selling pot-boiler, which deals with (and of course loves) attempts by women's groups in one way or another in New York publishing. Director: Jean Negulesco, quite recent "Three Coin Fountain" success and "Sex and City" in terms of similar prototypes, except that there is sex all over the screen. <br /> <br /> The bright young women of the day (Hope Lange, Diane Baker, Suzy Parker, Martha Hyer) are all nicely cast, while Joan Crawford opens up as a queen mother to an editor who could probably eat Meryl Streep's Miranda priest and spit out; absolutely no effort he steals the movie. Men include Stephen Boyd, Louis Jourdan (if it wasn't Rossano Brazz, it was Louis Jourdan), Robert Evans (before he decided wisely to go behind the camera) and Brian Aherne. There are more oils on the screen when you find your average laundry, but if I like "Desperate Housewives", not to mention Carrie Bradshaw and the company, you probably love it. Very innocent pleasure.
