Could this be one of the first color films? It's actually another. This is a very beautiful film produced by Thomas Edison. It was one of many of his other films. <br /> <br /> I think this is the most beautiful of Thomas Edison's films. This shows that the girl is dancing and moving her dress that turns red with the film. It's just beautiful. <br /> <br /> You look at it by looking at history. You look at what started making movies of the day! It may not be a plot or something very interesting, but it is another color film ever. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to everyone, especially if you teach students filming or something like that, you have to show them what started with the color films!
