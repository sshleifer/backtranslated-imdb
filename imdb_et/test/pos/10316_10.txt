There are one or two other Shemp-era trousers that I like more (ie SCRAMBLED BRAINS), but I think that without a big argument, Shemp gives its biggest comic book after returning to Team 1946. <br /> <br /> Scene scene, this episode hardly shoots: Professor Shemp Howard's soundtrack with glass-dragging Dee Green, his pointless attempt to win a glory hand in marriage (this is your little snooker ... can you marry me * click *) for a frightening finish, it won't miss I'll never sew me. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't like to mention this immortal scene with Miss Hopkins (always lovely Christine McIntyre). Btw, is he not dressed enough and in love when he welcomes the man he thinks is his "Cousin" Basil? Who knows, perhaps Basil was a "very" distant cousin, which makes it legal in some countries (as far as I know). >: -]
