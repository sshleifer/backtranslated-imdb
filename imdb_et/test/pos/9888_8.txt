I saw this movie last night at Phil. Film Festival. It was an interesting and funny film with some loving and moving scenes. Peter Falk was great, as was the rest. They were credible and played their role. The film may be a bit long and the conclusion was fine. Audience laughed at the right place. The family dynamics were terrible and, although it was a Jewish family, they could have been Italian, Irish or other, including Greek. I recommend this movie if you are interested in smiling on a subject that is often not handled in this way. IOT thinks about the consequences of your actions and how they affect others in your life and those who are not clear in your life.
