A nice combination of a giant monster and a samurai genre. Huge monster Majin, the god of the hill, is a dropping and forbidding figure, very similar to the Old Testament God, destruction and punishment in the harbor for those who despise their holy land - but it is interesting to note that what ultimately awakens him is not human suffering but a sharp and personal insult. It is beautifully captured, with strong effects, with excellent miniatures, and an excellent result of Akira Ifukube. Majin is not a 400+ mouth monster like Godzilla - he is 2 1/2 times normal size, so the evil samurai he lands, looks at his despicable eyes when he puts his fortress down and crushes it to the forges. There are not many add-ons, but it's nice to see this forgotten minor classics rescued and restored to the digital format.
