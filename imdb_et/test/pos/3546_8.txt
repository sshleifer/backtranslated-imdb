Definitely worth a look. <br /> <br /> Ten different directors represent each segment based on their favorite copy of aria. You don't have to be an opera player to watch this movie. (Although, of course, if you hate opera, you have a really bad time with it!) <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, the segments are great and fair. Most noise seems to be over Godard's contribution - whether you think he's great or pretentious, his segment doesn't change his mind. <br /> <br /> Some pieces have a clear narrative; others are assembled images. <br /> <br /> No more than 10 minutes; If you are not satisfied with what is on the screen, wait for the next segment and think about how much culture you do. <br /> <br /> Keep your eyes open for open performances by Buck Henry, Beverly D 'Angelo, Elizabeth Hurley, Briget Fonda, Tilda Swinton and John Hurt. (The Buck Henry segment alone is worth the entrance price). <br /> <br />
