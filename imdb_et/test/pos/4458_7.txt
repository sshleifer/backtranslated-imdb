If you like this-dun-it, this film, considered to be the best Italian detective story (giallo), has been made by Fulci. <br /> <br /> This isn't Mickey Spillan. There are scenes that are designed to disturb anyone. <br /> <br /> Many would have been offended by the local beauty that is trying to attract a 12-year-old boy. He was joking, but he was still naked, and he would have jumped on the bones to jump. He also tries to tempt the local priest. <br /> <br /> Young boys are lost and there are many interesting suspects. You have to look carefully to find the killer. Can you? Don't jump to the first man, it's too early, and it's too obvious. <br /> <br /> Anyone who knows Fulci can measure who died at the end of a violent death. What crazy crazy thinking he had.
