SOME MAJOR SPOILERS WHO HAVE BEEN STORED <br /> <br /> I saw this movie yesterday at the Venice Film Festival and I have to admit that it was a fan, it was really impressive. Great graphics, great music, great duplication, great sequences, etc. EVERYTHING movie was held exclusively for the players who have loved it, and so they can enjoy every reference, character, joke (you should see jokes about winning music, which is especially comic) and so on. The FF obviously sees the size of the technical part, but is NOT able to see the inner satisfaction with seeing, eg Barret appears and captures Bahamut FULL. He asks himself, "Who is it?", And I can't blame him. He can't even understand what a player feels when OPENING OPPORTUNITY is the opening music, Nanaki runs in the canyon with his two sons, worshiping Midgar ruins and then "498 years ago ...". Almost all the characters have appeared or quoted (including Reeve, Tseng and Elena) and Reno & Rude were really fun and comic, but the last impression that the movie stayed with me was "the hardcore player's final dream, but much less the MOVIE fan ... ".
