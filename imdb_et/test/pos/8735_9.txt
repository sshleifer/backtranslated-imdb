Everyone told me to see a cactus flower, and I finally did. What a wonderful movie - the perfect choice for Sunday night / scared Monday morning. Matthau and Hawn were good, but Ingrid Bergman really did the movie - it was about him. Really great actors can do something and Miss Bergman proves it. He shows us - in one film - a whole series of careers. The dance club scene was as hysterical as it touched. Even if the film drew its obvious conclusion, I found myself happy with Miss Dickinson as if she was a Boston Red Sox. Fortunately, he made much better (not intended). ;)
