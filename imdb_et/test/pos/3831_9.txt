I agree that this is one of the best series - my only bad thing would be Mark Lenard as Romulan's commander. My reasoning is that if you hadn't been to this episode for the first time, you know Mr. Lenard as Sarek, Father of Spock. For the second generation Trekkie (or Trekker - your preference), it will first take you out of the scene. Yet he is a great captain and the opposite of our captain, and this episode is all written and well-acted. Both sides are making great points about the cost of war and the price of peace, and will certainly remind them of some of the films from the Second World War and later. These are not my favorite genres, but I would definitely recommend this fan to watch this episode through this filter. You see it up. I never understand why Sci-Fi gets so little respect - the best drama comes from placing ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.
