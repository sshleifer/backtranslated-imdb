This is another pearl for Daniele from Thompson's pencil - in fact, in the same year (1999), he wrote and directed La Buche, the first of three writer / director credits. Belle Maman is a French language first, which means that it is, of course, different things for different people. The premise is simple: on the altar where he marries, his brother, Vincent Lindon, gets a glimpse of his first mother, Catherine Deneuve, and bears what French is called a coup that we know as love at first sight. Theoretically, the story is either 1) then right and there assuming he called the wedding out, or 2) just when he passes through the wedding and thus lives the lie until it is solved in one way or another. Thompson drives to # 2, but does not hit us with an odd subspot along the way, such as Line Renaud, a lesbian mother smoking a Deneuve cigar (in real life when someone cares, Renaud is in long-standing relationship with Stephane Audran), staring at the stars, and throws in a luxurious craftsmanship at a wedding competition which is a fun song and dance. To compose a writer that he is Thompson, he also leaves a comedy with drama, such as a glorious climate design, where Vincent finally casts out his Deneuve feelings during his family movement, while breaking the joint. This is the one you enjoy. Again and again.
