I heard about this incident, but I didn't really pay attention to all of Fuhrman's smash when writing a book, Skakel was arrested, and so on. But this film did an excellent job, specifying Marta, Skakel's brothers, murder, involvement of Mark Fuhrman and the results of his investigation. I especially liked Martha speaking to her last summer. An actress who literally played her, lived life and made it even bigger that the real Martha was probably so. This made Martha rather than a victim. I strongly recommend that you look at it.
