Tia Carrere was the reason I decided to watch this movie, because neither the title nor the cover would have been enough to spend that time and money on this film? which shows me and everyone that a DVD should not be rated by this cover. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** The film felt that it was bouncing, not really anywhere? Paul Faber (Zak Orth) discomfort about girls who are almost too embarrassed to look, and otherwise an attractive schoolbook for Kirsten Beck (like Alexondra Lee). When were they really fashionable in 1995? <br /> <br /> The relationship between Vicky Mueller (Tia Carrere) and Todd Boomer (Jason London) was incredible from the start! This first meeting across the lake? magical. What a beautiful coincidence they should meet again, as he has behaved like a full moor ("Boomer, two O's like morale?") In front of Alexondra. It is a shame that we, as a public, knew who Vicky Mueller really was. (Well, the title gave it away, don't you think?) <br /> <br /> What really surprised me was the actor. Especially where Vicky gives Todd a metal version of his ego-ego (dog character) in a small white jewelry box. Did the actors really be able to regain the first kiss of the first kiss? point where Todd and Vicky are not coming back. It is a shame that the film ends with a focus (after Todd's fathers have passed the Harvard race) on his reunification with his friends. Can I imagine a brand new movie? following Vicky New York? there must be a good art university where Todd could participate?!? <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, a movie that does exactly what we want for Hollywood: entertainment for us during the movie's lifetime. Did anyone else notice how no love in this movie is happy? Todd's mother is a little crazy (by phone 24 hours a day), her father can't find her attractive (any longer?). Todd's teacher is obviously his wife and vice versa? Todd himself enters a wonderfully erotic and bold relationship, which is nice, but it would be really difficult to maintain it (age difference, maturity difference, etc.) and Alexondra & Zak can't get together because Alexondra is not mature enough (-> his reactions to a condom respect, cheating, Zaki advancements, etc. are all very immature and often accompanied by them) and Zak himself, a poor man? there is too much best friend / brother who even takes Alexondra. <br /> <br /> Think good movie! I gave it to 8/10. Great results from the actors who bring the script to life.
