America's next top model is a good show, it helps people in their careers, but lately I'm bored with it. <br /> <br /> Cycle 1: Yes, I am lucky Adrienne won, I wanted him to win Cycle 2: its too bad, I think Mercedes deserves it. <br /> <br /> Cycle 3: I didn't like Evale, but I didn't like most girls in this cycle. <br /> <br /> Cycle 4: Kahlen should have won. I don't know what they saw in Naimas, but I know for sure what they saw in Kahlen. <br /> <br /> Cycle 5: Like Cycle 3, it wasn't a big cycle either. but from all girls, NICOLE as a winner? Cycle 6: I liked Sara and Joanie, but Danielle is fine. <br /> <br /> Cycle 7: Caridee will definitely deserve it. <br /> <br /> Cycle 8: No, I didn't want to win Jaslene. I didn't like him. I saw other girls in this cycle who definitely have more potential than her, although I didn't see much of this cycle. <br /> <br /> Good show, I saw it too much to please: D
