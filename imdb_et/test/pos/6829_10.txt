The second episode of the new "Lost" is exactly what his fans lacked - a fair amount of riveting. From the first scene you will still see new features that you did not expect. This is the best proof that the series is still alive and hard hit in its 4th season. <br /> <br /> Although manufacturers do not surprise us with more flash procedures this time, the return is back. more than satisfactory because it leads to some shocking facts. Returns show some fresh characters and acquaintances are surprising. <br /> <br /> Fresh characters dominate the entire episode and I can't say it does any harm. Their scenario parts and their actors do very well, offering us a pleasant feel - right after the episode, you realize that the exhibition needs just such people. And here they are. <br /> <br /> "Confirmed Dead" is full of engaging activities and highly written dialogues. I'm sure I will quote the best scenes of the episode for a long time - they are just so good that they will remain on the spectator's mind. The episode is fun, smart and perky. You like "Lost," you have to watch it. My voice is ten.
