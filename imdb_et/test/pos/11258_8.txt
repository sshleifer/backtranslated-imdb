I wasn't going to waste on seeing MTV preview, but since I didn't have anything better to do or look at Sunday night, I watched it look. a very good movie that made this MTV. One thing that drew me to see was Pheonix, who was the sister of the late and wonderful River Pheonix. I think the talent runs in the Pheonix family because he was good and so is Jaquien, though niether is a river. Nick Stahl also gives a great advantage to junky. There is not much else to say about wasted. It was a dark, frustrating and insightful look at the life of three small town junkies. I recommend it to those who like this topic. 8/10
