One of the fun things I say to the top is whether I'm the biggest Suzuki standing fan. I've actually seen the right number of his works (thanks to a retrospective film festival) and I found his films just to taste Yakuza. So, I went cautiously to Princess Raccoon, what I saw. Boy! I was out! Raccoon is Suzuki's musical experiment using Japanese opera elements mixed with many modern elements (both Audial and Visual). Leading actor Joe Ogdari proves that he is one of those days for the hottest participants in Japan. I have to admire that younger Japanese actors are still taking roles that take place in feudal times in Japan. The story itself won't get a little confused if you don't really follow it, but even if you don't, prepare yourself for Princess Raccoon's fortunes.
