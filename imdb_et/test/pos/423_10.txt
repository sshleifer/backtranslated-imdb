I like "Hack". Think of the "Lone Ranger" reintroduced as a 2000s cab driver, a decent, but inadequate guy in Philadelphia, doing its best, trying to work out problems from the past and having a summary. David Morse is almost perfect than Olshansky. He helps people, but instead of riding in the old west of "Silver", he drives the cab through modern Philly avenues without silvery bullets. The support form is first-rate and above average. Sometimes the spiritual dialogue reaches the level of the almost 70s classical "Rockford Files". This exhibition deserves a return, hopefully at a better time than on Friday 9th (East).
