Years ago, when I first read the world of John Irving according to Garp, I was surprised that most of the younger adults I had contact with did not like the book when I loved it. I began to understand that it was age and experience. I experienced some déjà vu when I read some of the comments made on this site that were clearly written by younger viewers. Enjoying a separate gateway is definitely an age and experience. <br /> <br /> In this film, the viewer sees the seemingly happy top middle class pair - he is a successful lawyer - he is the perfect wife of a successful lawyer. They have a town house in London and home. Everything is fine, until you enter the shelter of the richest male boy. This man seems to be "Cad" from "Go". He is disdainful of all and everything, including his own children. In the traditional form, the nice guys who are finishing last, are dealing with the bounder of the lawyer's spouse. You see, the lawyer is really a nice man, but organized with the perfectionist's marriage killing feature. Though he really loves him, he is bored with his wife's death. A bad boy is much more exciting. <br /> <br /> All of this is confused with the death of a man in the village and death, where all the facts indicate that the buck is the driver of the vehicle. <br /> <br /> It's easy to make sure this movie doesn't make a happy ending, but it will lead to a very satisfying end that man and his wife learn and grow from their experiences and are likely to be able to carry out their personal life more successfully. <br /> <br /> The main characters in this movie are three great actors and this is a performance that makes the whole thing a joy. Tom Wilkinson is the perfect man. His portrayal shows us a kind man who has so much control over his emotions that he has lost the world. Emily Watson shows us a woman who is so relaxed in the role of such a perfect woman that she has almost lost her sense of passion. This passion recovers from the character that Rupert Everett has played. <br /> <br /> When you have reached this point where you realize that everyone has legs and everything - even intelligence and opportunity - makes many wrong decisions, you will probably enjoy those great actors who create the lives of three people . It has worked nicely and aimed at adult film realistic adults.
