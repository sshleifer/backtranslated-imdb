This is one of my favorite comedy films. Chris Farley is cheerful as the hero of the accident and David Spade plays the perfect man for Farle. <br /> <br /> The dialogue between the two is excellent. The scene in which two of them are in the car, which are sung by the Superster by Carpenters, is classic. <br /> <br /> Chris Farley was a great comic artist with amazing potential. /> <br />
