Although this series is ideal and fictitious, it has a lively quirkines, a sultrine, and a good sense of heart. <br /> <br /> For a few years I lived out of Hawaii and found some fun, original and fun people in some distant (non-tourist) areas. <br /> <br /> Every time I see this series of attacks, I compare my memories of experiences outside the Hawaiian journey with the depictions and fiction depicted in Key West. <br /> <br /> This series is not a reality TV. I hate real television. <br /> <br /> Right from the time people were still writing creative TV shows. Give me a "young writer" who inspires every day "the angels of sprays, the wizards of palm trees and the seagulls".
