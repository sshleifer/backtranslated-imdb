Just one of the best shows ever made, and it just gets better with age. <br /> <br /> For me, one of the main reasons why David Weir made an English adaptation. <br /> <br /> A Japanese friend once told me that his original language exhibition was more fun and fun, that we all know this version. <br /> <br /> The fact that the exhibition resonates so strongly with its non-Japanese fans is, in my opinion, largely thanks to Mr Weir's inspired efforts and some winning vocal assignments. <br /> <br /> Well done, sir!
