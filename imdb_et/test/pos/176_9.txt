Having just seen Walt Disney's The Skeleton Dance on a Saturday morning blog that is linked to YouTube, I used these same sources to view the remake of the Technicolor made for the Columbia comic book and animated by the same human Ub Iwerk. Colors, compared to previous black and whites, are really imaginative here and many new gags when one of the skeleton band's players reaches the wrong side continuously or if a person loses his head and takes another one or when he goes off. dancing with the other part that others have gone as funny as the previous short. It's going to end a bit repetitive. Skeleton Frolics, however, is worth seeing for any animated film that wants to compare it to the earlier Silly Symphony.
