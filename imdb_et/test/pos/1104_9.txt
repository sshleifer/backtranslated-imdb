I saw it in the BendFilm Festival on Friday, in the midst of a peaceful crowd that was not helped by the bad decision of the event planners who chose the upcoming totally inappropriate short film. And it drew the audience when Modern Love came after a light, vivid short (name I forget). <br /> <br /> People !!! It was really stupid to mix this short with contemporary love - this is a serious drama movie. Movie. <br /> <br /> So the audience gets a tedr that is comedy and then ... Modern Love. Hmmmm. Contemporary love, despite its reservations (strange end, a bit too tangential), needed a short film that was in line with its strange oddity, so my suggestion for next year's programmers is more careful planning of the sample. People who look at modern love just didn't know what hit them - they were led on the road and it is not their fault. <br /> <br /> Modern love are some great performances that play well against the tangential slant of the movie - a movie that seems to have been "loudly" out of the maker, not what is done in the usual way when the film is scripted and captured. <br /> <br /> The audience was too badly informed. Wrong screen layout, wrong short film, wrong approach with good-intentioned programmers who, despite their good efforts, have to watch more movies and travel to another festival.
