All Risto Jarva's movies are worth it. Some like "The Year of the Rabbit" and "The Holiday" are the best films in their genre and have reached the classic status in Finnish cinema history. <br /> <br /> Most people have impressed actor Antti Litja through Jarva films. Litja played a leading role in Jarva's three films, all of which were successful in cash and movie review. <br /> <br /> It is nice to see that the "Hare Year" idea still lives in advertising (I think it was the addition of Sonera TVs, where Litae walked in the mountains, fell to her feet in Lapland, Everibody, who has seen the movie What I'm Talking About.) "The Hare Year" is a beautiful film with great actors and good movie spots - like the famous little town of Lappland, Sodankyl√§, where the world's best film festival - The Midnight Sun Film Festival takes place. I recommend that everyone go there in June - I remember the warm clothes and the raincoat :)
