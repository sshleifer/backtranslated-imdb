Residents are a band known for their strange performances and strange musical styles, so obviously their music videos are not exactly normal. In fact, these small videos are abnormal and odd, but they have a tremendous artistic value. The atmosphere is built with illumination and thoughtful visuals. This is a great viewing experience. <br /> <br /> Basically, Icky Flix is ​​made up of many people's music videos made for their songs. Music ranges from stone to synthesized music that sounds like it is an 80's fear film. What does not change is the quality of these videos. They are great! <br /> <br /> All fans of art films love them. They are so original with their visual images and the corners they film, and the lighting makes them so interesting. The music is creepy and memorable and very original, and these short films are mini-classics that deserve a lot of watch. It's almost a perfect collection of short videos. <br /> <br /> My rating: **** out of ****. 56 minutes.
