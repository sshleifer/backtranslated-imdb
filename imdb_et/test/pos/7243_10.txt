I totally agree with another poster. NEMESIS is one of the best Christie adaptations with a superb primer and cast. This undervalued woman was a story in British films from the 1960s that never got a break in the mainstream in US films. Check her as a friend of Julie Andrews in 1964. EMILIAMERATION. for Marple's work. Shame on them! And dig the lesbian CID agents! :)
