In every sense I was a child I loved this movie. I've always been a fan of Joseph Mazzello. The child had a clean talent in this film as well as in Jurassic Park. I've been looking for a DVD or VHS to buy in a store near me. well anyway a great movie. If anyone knows where I find it, contact me at wrp24@adelphia.net. Also, someone can really explain what happened to the bob. was he real or was he fake and was he an imaginary friend and his escape? lol i'm helpless. my favorite thing was to be where they made the monster juice and hit the whole kitchen in their funny but also sad part, because what happens to the bob is confusing. face because he played his part pretty good. I think my mother was a big actor, I think her name is Lorraine Bracco or some sort of name, as it is. Well that's all please contact me <br /> <br /> wrp24
