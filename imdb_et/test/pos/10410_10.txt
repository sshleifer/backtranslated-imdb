www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html Excellent TV series that should be recorded on DVD. It was an exhibition that I rarely missed. I found a statement to bring it back to the DVD. I remember one example in which this obese lady wore a pair of glasses gave her food to talk to. Needless to say, she couldn't eat her friends so she died. Another episode was an accountant who visited an underground sewer and a subway security company. The accountant wanted to close the financing of the project. As it turns out, the security feature was underfunded to fight against cannibalistic creatures living in the dark. www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html
