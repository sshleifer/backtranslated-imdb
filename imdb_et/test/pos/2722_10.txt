From "36 Chowringhee Lane" to "15 Park Avenue", Aparna Sen has indeed come a long way. If the first goes to history as a purge of a dutan, it will definitely be a special place for a "mature" movie. Until you see the 15 park areas, you can't imagine the feeling being excited and moving at the same time. I'm excited to see that the director's ingenuity and agility pose serious challenges and move the film's sensitivity. This is not a film that simply makes you feel "tchh tchh, how hard life must be for schizophrenics", but makes you ask a much deeper question about the reality you see and believe. Sen has done an excellent job highlighting the supreme fact of our existence that we have all been trying, in some way or another, to live our own incredible world, trying to ride after moora, called happiness, peace, satisfaction. Together with a misconception of mind, Seni Magic has brought forth many small nuances in human relationships, as they support stress and tension. The fact that from time to time we all lose peace, disintegrate, wrong choices, bully the guilt, behave selfishly and so on, is covered by extreme witness Seni. He showed a cruel dilemma that Shabana had to deal with all his life, must choose schizophrenia between his sister and normal life with his wife and children. And whenever he is always next to his sister, always being a strong person, providing support, deciding, and so on, he unknowingly cut off some of the oxygen his sister needs to flourish. Isn't it a very harsh truth that sometimes, when we try to do something best, we strangle their self-confidence and hurt their self-esteem? Of course, the action of Konkona and Shabana deserves laughter, because always, because the ingredients were not so good, the dish would not have been so extraordinary. Aparna Sen once again made the film's masterpiece for those who crave some "mindset". Bravo!
