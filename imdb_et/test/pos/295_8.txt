Here you can find an anti-war statement without too hard to look at; this layer is hackneyed. Or you may find a valuable neutral comment on war madness ("judgment"); this layer is completely uninteresting. <br /> <br /> Or you can watch it for the fun entertainment value of one of Duvall's liners, but it's just a cover for commercial mastics. Try to look at it as a "realistic" Vietnamese war film, but ask any veteran and he will cast it down - most veterinarians say it smells. or is he not a moral game - there is nothing rich there. <br /> <br /> Where I found that value was great in self-expression. Coppola needed a container (war) of the required dimensions to fit the size of a qualified multi-dimensional actor who played the "big man". character. The studios were uncomfortable with their way of doing things, but they had always excelled and won prizes; "Generals" are uncomfortable with Kurtz's "insecure methods", despite his strategic genius. <br /> <br /> So Coppola makes the movie all about Brando's size. For hammering a point, he places himself in a movie (like Hopper, a manic photojournalist loaded with multiple cameras) that he praises his praise. Brando himself is visible only in semi-light and silhouettes - Storaro's excellent cinematography, which only enhances the actor's power. And he goes out like a sacrificial roll to complete the narrative equation. Oh, yes, "horror ..." <br /> <br /> Other topics of interest: great use of the camera's viewing angle, including "firing" long before "private Ryan"; Dazzling the use of sound, especially the threatening flanges and the sound of acidic trips. <br /> <br /> Don't cover the outer layers; The rich part you would leave out of it is the brilliant core of sound, vision, and self-expression.
