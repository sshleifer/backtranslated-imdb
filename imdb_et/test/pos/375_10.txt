When Alfred Hitchcock made STRANGERS for TRAIN, a large part of the film was in front of the public that he was at the top of his form. In 1946â€“1950 his films were not successful, but his contract with David O. Selznick ended. In fact, he made some very good films during this period, such as NOTORIOUS, SPELLBOUND, CAPRICORN, ROPE and (my opinion) STAGESTRUCK. But when I liked GAME AND SPELLBOUND, Hitch's attempts to interrupt the audience had been interrupted: his Salvator Dali's use of the SPELLBOUND was acceptable, as did psychiatrists. However, the long-term attempt at ROPE confused the public (ignoring the advantages of this film) and Hitch's readiness to deceive the audience by the wrong character spoken by the leading character - I didn't like it much more - STAGESTRUCK. BASED ON THE BASIS OF THE REASON (it appeared just like the scandal of Starring Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rosallin), it was a bad time that seemed unsuccessful (it wasn't). PARADINE CASE was another failure - and one that was really small. <br /> <br /> STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, Hitchcock abandoned the special tricks that attracted him in recent films. Instead, he focused on his favorite themes, which were shared guilt and mistaken identity. Based on Patricia Highsmith's novel, there was a story about how a professional tennis player Guy Haines meets his - Bruno Anthonyi, a playboy fan who rides at the same time as an athlete. Bruno is jargon and crazy, and Guy sees him as one of the typical fans he's encountered ... as a little eccentric, telling him he wants to be on the first rocket into space. But Bruno knows all Guy's personal problems. She is married to a small woman named Miriam and is in love with Senator's daughter Anne Morton. Bruno knows that Miriam is not leaving her successful celebrity husband. Bruno mentions how he gets compassion - he hates his stepfather who constantly criticizes him. Then Bruno (a kind of cuff) mentions that he has about two men - technically strangers - who exchange murders against each other and then put two perfect, insoluble crimes instead of blaming them. Guy listens to the idea - and agrees that it is an interesting idea. The train arrives at Guy's destination and his last comment is like validating the idea. He just doesn't understand that "eccentric" Bruno is a sociopath, and he believes that Guy has just agreed that two will kill each other's enemy! <br /> <br /> This is a wonderfully simple plot. Bruno, of course, kills Miriam, but she is completely waiting for Guy to commit murder agreements and kill her stepfather. Guy is scared - and worse, he thinks he's the first suspect in the police department. When Bruno Guy mentions that he has the lightest (he pulled it on the train) and is able to plant it on the murder site, Guy finds deeper problems - how to avoid the police and how to control (if possible) the crazy crazy Bruno? <br /> <br /> Hitch always designed his movie shots carefully so that from the beginning we can see our heroes on their feet so they can meet each other on the train. The film uses continuous cross-contacts to show how the two men pull each other's orbits. It's like a destiny that puts them together. Yet, both have their own personality - and Hitch, with typical twists, makes Bruno mad more attractive. His scheme can be cruel (it can kill two people, and he has an agreement with Guy), but he has a lifeblood. One suspects that if Guy had one, but his marriage failure, along with his now socially prominent wife, has made him more cautious and boring than it was. <br /> <br /> Cast is also good. Robert Walker probably had the best role in this film (only one year before his death). It was far from the boy-son door, RECOMMENDED AWAY or CLOCK. His vision also saw quite a few stories in the stories. As Guy Farley Granger acts in his co-crusher cousin ROPE, especially when the circumstances make him more suspect to the authorities (since his earlier role made Jimmy Stewart increasingly suspect). As far as women are concerned, Kasie Rogers is well sliding like Miriam - it allows the audience to be killed (in the famous order, which is photographed in her spectacle reflection), so they really rejoice in Bruno's evil deeds. Patricia Hitchcock appears as Anne Parent (Ruth Roman) who is close to Miriam and accidentally puts Bruno down socially. He plays this rare role well. Ruth Roman is Granger properly supportive, but his role is limited because he is behind him and somewhat low. Other contributors, Leo G. Caroll as Senator, Marion Lorne (usually comedian) as Bruno dotty's mother and Norma Varden, unexpectedly as a receiver of Walker's violence, are all the best - all in the hands of the captain.
