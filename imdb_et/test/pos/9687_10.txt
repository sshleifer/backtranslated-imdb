If you are a fan of Jackass, Viva La Bami or CKY videos, you already know what you are. But this is one of those rare cases where the sequel is better than the original! And a person makes this movie pack from a low-average shot. But I mean it well. This is the same type of anti-death, intestinal, madness that we all have known and loved, and we look forward to Bam, Knoxville, and Co. But this time even more laughs than ever! Johnny Knoxville's mad tolerance for pain, Bam Margera's love for harassing his friends / family members, and Steve-O's gross output, you have one funny movie of hell. The Jackass team's tricks, skits and general chaos bar have been raised. Jackass 3? Suspicious because it is almost impossible to improve with perfection.
