One of the best sitcoms working on Indian TV with Dekh bhai dekh and Idhar udhar. Excellent action, good pace and extremely fun script made it a truly memorable series. The fun-filled opening montage (which no one else is immensely Kishore Kumar) gave a very accurate picture of what to expect. I borrowed it from my local video libraries many years after Doordarshan stopped it. I would like Indian television to return to such serials as those of the asinin booty-bahu soap and reality television, which is good for these days. Anyone who has found a really good comedy should go and get this series. You can also enjoy a couple of Pakistani sitcoms, such as ups and downs and Aeg Aur, which are definitely the best in India.
