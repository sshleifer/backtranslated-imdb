I recently watched this movie and fell in love with it. I loved the story and the actors. There's little about it. I finished this story completely. There are so many surprises on the way. I highly recommend it. In fact, I loved it so much that I ran out and bought the book. I felt I had to read this to evaluate the art behind the film. I also wanted to make sure I didn't miss anything from the book, but stayed away from the movie. I recommend to people who love to read a movie book because there is a lot of difference in the book, especially in another episode to read it. It has become my favorite movie. I am now a fan of Sarah Waters and Elaine Cassidy!
