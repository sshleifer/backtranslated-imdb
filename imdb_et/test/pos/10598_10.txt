"Haggard: Film" is well written, well-managed and well-acted. There's a lot of laugh out of moments and some terrible roller skates with Margera. West Chester, PA scenes are filmed beautifully and the script is just totally funny. What I like about the film is that instead of being another happy love story or another version of "Jackass", it takes a somewhat funny look at breakages from another perspective. Most of the broken films have a naive woman who has been cheated by a man. He then finds Mr. Mr. and finds that he is misleading. This film takes a look at the emotional skater of a rebel man without taking himself too seriously. Ryan Dunn is doing a great job as a fooled man and Bam Margera and Brandon Dicamillo as your best friends trying to help you through this harsh times, how can you take something too seriously? It is obvious that Margera and Co are incredibly talented behind and behind the camera. Look forward to their future movies and aspirations.
