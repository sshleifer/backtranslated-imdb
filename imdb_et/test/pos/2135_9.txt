So many of us who are dedicated to the "art" of cinematography, ignore or forget that films are also business. Mostly, they are too expensive to be anything else. With that in mind, it often seems to me a miracle that really big ones get every time. For some time, filmmakers are going to spend a lot of time in making a film, so that the business people responsible for financing the business are financially bad and become very angry about it. I would like to know exactly how it happens that it has often led to "shooting" of large studio centers as well as some of the big critics when the latter is released. Dreadful expectations arise and people often expect to see a cloud of their perception of what they are looking at. <br /> <br /> You see this phenomenon as imperfect at work, but a great '62 redefine 0f Bounty 'and you can definitely see the reaction to the "Gate of Heaven." Cimino took too long and paid too much money to United Artists to take this picture The company was fatally wounded by her superfluous and undoubtedly powerful people who saw her reputation forever, when this strange, mammoth epic was finally released. There are always many filmmakers who do not like long, compelling images. Like Stanley Kubrick, Cimino often chooses not to specify the specific statement he makes with the scene, rather he pulls it out so that the viewer feels like they are living at the moment, giving time to his imagination to participate deeply in what is being presented. Many people do not respond so well to this approach, they want the story to move quickly and clearly ing these movies would just become impatient and confusing. Undoubtedly, these factors contributed to the failure of Heaven's Gate box control. <br /> <br /> I am deeply frustrated by the nature of the film's two problems. Here and there, the scene is obviously too long and can easily be cut off without damaging its effectiveness. Then, at the end of the picture, we reach the massive, drawn-out battle scenes. If they are, the clarity of storytelling is indeed damaged. If you liked the movie until it emerged, your perception of what should happen is probably unclear and it is really disappointing. If I didn't see all the harsh shots, I can't tell if there would be any real reuse, or if some critical plot elements had been re-edited carefully for a moment. Considering the time and money spent on this picture, it should have taken more care and thought. <br /> <br /> There are other problems, sometimes with poor performance, some dialogue that doesn't speak right, but these are really minor problems. The reason why I am so concerned about the above-mentioned problems is that, like many of these days, I also feel that all "Heavenly Gates" are so big to see and deal with great historical, political and sociological problems. just a little masterpiece. Despite its drawbacks, it is so dramatically and visually powerful that it is head and shoulders above most other Hollywood films. I would like to mix a lot of sound again. I would like to redirect and edit Ella's killing scene, but the size of this image is such that these considerations really become trivial compared to the value of the total production. I would like to add that this must always be seen on a gigantic wide screen to achieve the brilliant effect that it can offer.
