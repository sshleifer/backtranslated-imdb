"Imaginary Heroes" is a 2004 film starring Sigourney Weaver, Jeff Daniels, Emile Hirsch, Michelle Williams and Kip Pardue. </p>) commits suicide. <br /> <br /> "Classic People" are often mentioned in this movie; it is a kind of "ordinary people" with a role change. In this case, mother Sandy Travis (Weaver) is more accessible than her father, Ben (Daniels), who has been clearly destroyed and managed to cope. Like "ordinary people", the film also focuses on younger son Tim (Hirsch). <br /> <br /> For me, the film was amazing enough to watch it, but it has a curious release. There were some wonderful relationships - mother and son, mother and neighbor, brother and sister (Williams) and some good moments. What never clicked was Ben, any part of that family, or who had chemistry with Sandy. This seems to have been the goal of the director / writer Dan Harris. In a grocery store on one scene, the cashier assumes that Sandy is "about 30" and gives him his phone number. In almost the next scene, Daniel asks Sandy whether he wants plastic surgery for his birthday. Weaver was 55 years old when this film was made, in fact, probably 54, and seems phenomenal. What does Ben look at? But there is something about Ben's complete separation, because the viewer does not really see how Daniel was ever related to this family. <br /> <br /> At the end, there are a couple of twists and some very touching scenes. Everyone is very good because Weaver and Hirsch are standouts. <br /> <br /> There is no huge dialogue in this movie and many stars. The script might have been sharper. But "Imaginary Heroes" is a good effort.
