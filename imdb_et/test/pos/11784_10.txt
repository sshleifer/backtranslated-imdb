Nothing is holy. Just ask Ernie Fosselius. These days, everybody has a camcorder and the film is barely turned off before the spoofs begin to fly, quickly write and shoot and are often posted directly on the Internet. Cheats are hot these days and we're going to get out of the way that filmmakers can't get out of their own importance. 25 years ago, when the first Star Wars was made, it was a different world. Making the film was chosen by a few playgrounds and the spoofs were very rare. Then God gave us the hardware wars. It was shot cheaply (or was it just cheap?) And the sound was obviously recorded after that. Does it take from experience? HECK NO! That makes it so big! It was raw and non-polished and endlessly hit some of the most terrible moments of the original film. From Fluke Starbucker, who came up with a torch instead of a flashlight (I did that I was young)! a phenomenon like any actual Star Wars movie. Rent it. Buy. Hire it to a friend. And Farce can be with you. Always.
