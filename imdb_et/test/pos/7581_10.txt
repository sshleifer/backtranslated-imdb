Anderson's animation rivals easily with Pixar and goes beyond what Disney does. While some say that this story is a bit too abstract, I think it is a thoughtful and refreshing change of exaggerated characters and animated shorts. This is the CASTAWAY interplanetary version! Anyone who has left home from a safe harbor and has gone to an independent, frightening place will easily detect this lost microbial. Great work, Mr. Anderson! <br /> <br />
