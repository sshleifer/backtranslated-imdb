Yeah, I think this movie is a bit boring compared to other Pam Grier movies. The plot is too familiar, the dialogue is smart and some actors are not too good. But it is worth seeing the long stretch near the end of the movie, where we see Mrs Grier's sexy blue wetsuit, with the zipper half open. Yes, it seems to be a frivolous point when discussing the actor of Pam Grier's talent, but she is also a very proud woman and on that day she had a body that didn't give up. It is nice to see that it is shown in dense wetsuit. Rent a DVD and tell me I'm wrong. Can't you? Because you know I'm right! :-) And yes, I gave 10 just for the moisture scene! ;-)
