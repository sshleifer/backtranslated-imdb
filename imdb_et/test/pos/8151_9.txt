I love a lovely heartfelt movie with a happy ending. This movie can be read as drama, two characters who understand true love, but the story is so touching and so cute that I think it is romance. Supported that the actor is not so big (it didn't give it to 10), but they do the job and they don't move (thanks to god) plus they are cute, but the story is powerful and just divine (some u pansies kicks up) !! !!!! this is a great love story for watches, but if it's homophobic, CONTINUE! to everyone else, I loved the movie, its sweet! i felt it was on a small scale ... but happy to finish .... so enjoy !!
