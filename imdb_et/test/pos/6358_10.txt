I was very impressed that this movie comes from a newcomer, Dir./Writer Jose Reyes. The cast was great. "Jorge Cordoba" was powered by a powerful <br /> <br /> and shocking force as "Rafa" leader. It is inspiring to see independent films at this level of talent. <br /> <br /> Making a high quality movie requires talent, courage and determination. <br /> <br /> I admire everyone who can go from idea to idea and go to mile. <br /> <br /> People can judge young filmmakers more easily, but I praise "Jose Reyes" <br /> <br /> and talented contributions to their successful efforts.
