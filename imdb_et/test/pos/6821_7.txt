Joseph Conrad's timeless novel, Heart of Darkness, is depicted in a 1994 film. I have read Conrad's novel and I have to say that although I prefer the novel itself, the film was a great idea. The set and costume designs brought Conrad's novel to life when we followed Marlow's journey. Actors also brought characters to life through characters, voices and personalities. After reading the novel, I suggest you watch this movie. If you haven't read the novel, it may be harder to follow the film. The heart of Conrad's darkness is too perfect for action, emotion and film that is just over half an hour long. So if you haven't read the novel, the plot in the movie can follow. In general, I gave this film out of ten out of ten. Large sets, costumes and actors brought out the novel's basic piece. Nothing can replace the original work of Joseph Conrad.
