A fantastic movie with a great Aussie talent. Director Mark Lamprell addressed a potentially inappropriate topic in a humorous and refreshing way. The 2000 Brisbane International Film Festival is sure to be. Australian filmmaker Sam Neill was like Frank always a unique professor and a new talent Matt Newton gave a performance that says, "You know, Bert Newton, Matti's father!" Go out and watch this movie !!!
