Time out is somewhere in the Johnny To cannon, in a "good" category. As a criminal, it's not terribly original or overwhelming and action scenes won't let you down, but he has something else. This is Johnny's movie after all, it has to be. <br /> <br /> Andy Lau lives for 72 hours. He decides to play a strange cat and mouse game with HK police hostage negotiator, played by Lau Ching Wan. This is a drawing briefly. In addition, layers of layers and twists sink that keep the procedures interesting. From time to time, it becomes too complicated for its own benefit, but it does not allow it to get the best. But like Johnny To give a slippery and well-done crime (which, to be honest, is a bit dozen), he slides into bits and pieces that lead to a time-consuming full-fledged emotional experience that gives the soul and heart a well-oiled skeleton. <br /> <br /> Here is a great impact on the concepts of synchronization and minimalism (the clips of his work). Always fine, letting the pictures speak for themselves, giving them time to evolve with long duration and slow tracking, exemplary scoring, all here. The little love story on the bus between Andy Lau and the girl is one of the most important topics in the film and the "heart". So simple, but so powerful. League and Lau Ching Wan for car scenes and bowling show shows. <br /> <br /> But something is supposed to prevent me from being an occasional way out of a masterpiece. In order to get all the power and craft up to the notch, he may be too capable or sometimes blissful. If he is good, he is REAL good. There is even a distinct, pure glow moment, which is just a good TOO for your own good, leaving more aftertaste for the rest of the movie. I'm convinced that when he puts his heart on, he can make a really great movie. This is another of his films that are faulty but enjoyable. Under the style of stylish HK, it is this black humor and a cordial drama that makes it a compelling film. Worth a look, for sure.
