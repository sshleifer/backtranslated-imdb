Now, before people start to break this movie (those who play rugby anyway), this is the movie! It has been given Hollywood treatment for people's entertainment, and therefore those who play rugby (themselves) will of course pick holes in the film's choreography. Together, this is a decent film and draws attention to the morale and ideas of the rugby game. <br /> <br /> The film is based on a real team, a real trainer and his work that will help the children to direct the direction to be better people in the future, and also based on real people who have played the highland team. It is just a typical sports movie whose character is wrong and eventually finds its way through the center of the rugby. In general, there is a good film that is enjoyable but has drawbacks of playing the game. but, as I said, this is a Hollywood movie.
