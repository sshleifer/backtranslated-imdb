Spoilers in this review! Despite some very unlikely scenes, including boys in PE who measure their scores at the competition and some mandatory teenagers trying to vignette, this film reflects the painful nature of high school in the way that a few teenage films have ever been made. It does this not only with friends' trio, Gary, Dave, Rick, smoking, drinking, still walking, but also with the nature of friendship because these three friends have been tested. This film is the moment when childhood ends. For the shy romantic Gary when she sees cute Karen for the first time she falls instantly in love. Gary's awakening-emotion is great on the screen and she proves her love for her when she loves her. This love with Karen is a sign of the end of Gary's innocence, because the ties with her two best friends will be tested and interrupted during the story. A solid lady, Rick, is a high school person we all secretly want: beautiful, cool, and always impossible girls in sweat. Rick turns out to be a shot, but you have to remember that his character is only 17 years old. He made and makes a bad decision. From the point of view of Rick, the story is also about finding one girl in one's dreams, a bad interruption, and then at the end of uniting. Rick's face as Gary looks and sees how Karen can see Rick shows that she finally understands her best friend and she loves the same woman. As in real life, you don't twist, because your friend is in love. This is the tragedy of the film. Rick is not a villain and constantly reminiscent of the film, reminding Gary and Dave of their best friends. But Gary's presentation is a story in the heart. Lawrence Monoson is a beautiful loser. She does everything right, her heart is in the right place, and she is consumed by love for Karen. Yet, Karen, Gary's commitment and goodness do not move. Karen represents all the people in the world who do not take back their own ego in a vacuum and never stop to understand the emotional damage and trauma they cause to others. This film is brutal in its statements about love and friendship, but it makes it unique among teenage films. It ceases to be a comedy and turns hopelessly into a romantic film, although it has come to a tragic conclusion. Anyone who has ever found a dream girl and has not won her will understand. The heartbreaking breakthroughs of the high school are as real as the emotional strains of adulthood, and this film reminds you of this bold blow. Gary's final overturning, when he's wearing a dress, is as tentative as a cinema. After watching it, it feels like it's really made of two movies. The first part is the silly teen sex movie, and when the story begins, it is a dramatic effect. Amazing movie. It should also be noted that the soundtrack was early in the selection of many rising stars, including Police, Cars, Devo, Oingo Boingo, The Plimsouls, Waitresses, Gleaming Spiers and Phil Seymour.
