This movie is considered controversial today, but it is still very funny. Racial stereotyping is done with humor and not with hatred. This film removes and shows how corrupt politicians were already in the early 1930s. This film proves that it started before 1970 and after it accelerated in the United States. Lloyd is still in his typical genre, although his character was raised in China. The meaning of cat paws in this case is the person who works in the political office, but what the political machine used uses to promote his agenda. In other words, they think this man (Lloyd) is harmless during his career. When he is elected, he will surprise them. <br /> <br /> The same topic will be used later in James Stewarts movie, Mr. Smith goes to Washington. Stewarts is more famous and has a stronger message. This film is smarter and finer, which is the trademarks of Harold Lloyds. <br /> <br /> The romantic comedy hidden in the film facade is still close to heart, but today's mainstream viewers still appreciate political humor, and the end is absolutely invaluable. I wish someone could win today's political system in this way. I was surprised how much I enjoyed this movie and found that I wanted Harold to do more in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> At least we have it. I think the person most mentioned in the movie is the fictional Ling Po. I always thought Confusicus was smart, but it makes me believe that China's wisdom is not limited to it and it is a huge area of ​​comedy Lloyd, which is being mined in this film.
