**** SPOILERS THROUGHOUT **** This is a very strange film - especially for this time - in every sense. For six years, American films have shown American soldiers as a sons, brother, and father. <br /> <br /> In films such as the best years of our lives and the end of time, our hearts are drawn from the difficulties that sweet returning soldiers have adapted to peace and their families. In the same year, this movie shows soldiers as people who are rather worse than the viewer - one message from this movie is "lock your daughters." <br /> <br /> Even good soldiers, who have a lot of time in their hands, play gambling all the time, get drunk, and are totally indifferent to having more women. And their reaction to the police investigating the murder is to blame them. <br /> <br /> Mitchum, the most sensible soldier, says things like "I don't know if my wife wants to go about it after the war hasn't seen her for two years. Do I care? Not really. Maybe we Let's do it, maybe not. "<br /> <br /> Another soldier is unusually sensitive because after years he wanted to see his wife again. <br /> <br /> Later, when that soldier in the police station says he spent the night in the whore's home - without knowing his wife was sitting just behind him, there seems to be no doubt that his wife is good. Indeed, he is - I think it's "Hey, soldiers are soldiers". <br /> <br /> The police detective played by Robert Young, who is trying to break the murder case, convincingly and infinitely tired someone's account of their activities that night, <br /> <br /> "Do I care? No. I don't care anymore, I've done it too long, I think. " The man comes to the whore apartment. He says, "I'm just a man like you who is interested in whore. Then he says," No, it's wrong, I'm his wife. I would like to be in the army, I was previously rejected. "T <br /> <br /> He says," No, that's why I would like to be a soldier? "When the police ask him who he is, he goes through The second wrong series until the end of the movie we have no idea who he is or why he's there! He is one of the strangest characters in the history of movies! The man is standing with his girlfriend at a bar where four soldiers are talking when a clumsy soldier strikes his girlfriend. to change the clothing - and there is another behind him, there is no problem. But the man does not leave his girlfriend - who just disappears - but follows one soldier when he leaves to go to another bar area! Then the man extrapolates from the minimum information he learned from the soldier - philosophically about the troops' return problems - and immediately calls the soldier home because he is drunk and sick. This is a strange thing. <br /> <br /> Similarly, a sentimental soldier is irritated by a girl who wants her true for dancing and dinner. But she's dancing with her - and giving her a home key now! <br /> <br /> In the late 1940s did people always call soldiers to their homes after their meeting? <br /> <br /> Robert Ryan kills his master, a stranger, when he's angry that the Jewish host is trying to get out of his home. Reason for the murder? "No Jew says how to drink". "How to drink?" Ah? What does it mean? <br /> <br /> This movie is always totally deliberate, so soldiers consistently act in full law and all characters are as cold and harsh as any movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> And this movie is completely captivating! You just have no idea how these people are going to act - or what new strange character will appear - without anyone thinking that human activities are the least strange - for example, a woman's behavior. <br /> <br /> The actors are the best I've ever seen - from Robert Young, Robert Ryan, Gloria Graham (who won the Oscar nomination), Paul Kelly, and other players I never heard of. <br /> <br /> I've never heard of this movie - and it's a joy that I've discovered what I want to see again and again. it is really weird but impossible to watch because you don't know what these creatures will do next.
