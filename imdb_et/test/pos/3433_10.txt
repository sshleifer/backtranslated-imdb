First of all - I hardly see Swedish films, and it's really my second time in my life when I watch a movie in Sweden! That's why I believe this is one of the best Swedish films ever! The combination of excitement and humor is OUTSTANDING and sometimes you don't even know if you should be scared or just laugh! The plot is about the man, the writer who wants to go to Germany after the Second World War and help the Germans start. On the way to Germany, he is trying to help his friends on the train, which is still a bad idea. What a clumsy jerk! And bad Robert Gustafsson - wounded soldier - always on his way ... OUCH !!! But he still got his good mood. Positive man. In recent years, Robert Gustafsson has made some less great films and it is really relaxing. He's great in this movie. After all - this is one of the best Swedish films and Peter Dalle has done an excellent job! Congratulations!
