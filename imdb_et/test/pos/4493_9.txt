For those curious that this episode is based on the Pirandello game, "Six characters in the search for the author" and Jean-Paul Sartre's "No Exit" game (as is most obvious by its title), but of course with the Sterling twist. <br /> <br /> Five very different people find themselves in a circular room who has no idea who they are but their clothes. The clock is alternating (perhaps with the Hemmingway hint?), Increasing the embarrassment of their imprisonment. The group's newcomer, big, has decided to escape while others have left their fate. <br /> <br /> Unlike Pirandello, they don't even have a story. They have nothing but the space of their consciousness space, and no one knows their non-existent story, so their position is even more hopeless than the Pirandello piece. Unlike both Pirandello and Sartry, there is no relationship between the characters and thus no real conflict between them, although the subject of personal responsibility and apathy is prominent in this northwest. <br /> <br /> Although it differs significantly from the authors mentioned in the title, Sartre and Pirandello (and many other authors of the twentieth century) have absolute clarity. This is obviously a piece of a postmodern perspective in the Cold War era. It also emphasizes issues of personal importance. <br /> <br /> This is just one of the best episodes I've ever seen and is still extremely important for the current experience (like Sartre and Pirandello). Exactly what makes classic writing good.
