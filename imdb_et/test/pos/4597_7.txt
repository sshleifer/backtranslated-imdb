As a social satire, Idiocracy is as good as Office Space, but with a wider scope. To make this film critical, a perverse sense of humor is, in my opinion, a point I think. Definitely funny jokes etc, but they are not really meant for the audience funny - they exist to define the "culture" situation in the 2500 AD that Joe visited as the backdrop of the odd state in which he wakes up. The true humor of the film lies in the many views and attitudes present in this future society, which is just a shadow that we face in our daily lives and which should be a warning. My personal favorite is portraying Fox News. The subtle brightness of the film lies in the fact that it also digs "smart" people and average Joes as protagonists. Notice the times of the film when Joe and Rita are almost unconsciously responding to the idiots around them, and you realize that idiocracy is not created to be chosen for any group of people, but for an idiotic culture in general. I don't know what to say about Fox's "film-making theory" of the release of this movie, but if it doesn't play in your local theater, demand it. We all have to see this movie, if not with social commentary, at least with jokes ...
