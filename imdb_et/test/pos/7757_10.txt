The 2006 online survey of Japan's top 100 favorite music TV series, hosted by TV Asahi, placed this series in fourth place. It tells you everything you need to know. So go see it.) I'm not commenting on the story just because I don't want to destroy anything. I only invite you to look after the first episode. Animation is really good and over TV medium. The best part of this series is that it is finally something new. I mean, this is not a breakthrough, but it still offers fresh new ideas and pleasant signs. You will not regret entering Suzumiya Haruh's world. <br /> <br /> And the best thing the movie will be coming soon
