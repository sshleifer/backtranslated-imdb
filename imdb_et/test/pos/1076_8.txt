A very interesting documentary - definitely much more than the lateral, pseudo-wino drama - where the capitalist conspiracy appears in all its greed. According to a documentary - and this was confirmed by a recent biography of Parker - only two men determine the nature of world wines: Robert Parker from Massachusetts and Michel Rolland, a French wine industry expert in Bordeaux and also known as a "flying wine maker". The director is wise enough to include interviews with local wine producers in many different regions of France in Sicily, Argentina, and interviews with major industry players such as the Mondavi family to discover the globalization of winemaking and marketing. Must be visible to anyone interested in the dark side of the industry. After looking at these well-made documents, drinking water production is not the same political and commercial act.
