I first saw this movie on the 80s cable and it shook my heart. It appeared on television again about six months ago. <br /> <br /> Filmed locally, black and white cinematography graphically depicts the 1950s New York City as a sharp "city jungle" at a time when there was much more industry and port activity in the city, especially in Manhattan. <br /> <br /> John Cassavetes always had a special intensity in his actions and is an excellent military dodger. His short 1959 TV series "Johnny Staccato" is also a pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> Sidney Poitier and (later film) Ruby Dee bring freshness and vitality to their roles. But this is Jack Warden's great action as a witch, brutal exchange leader who grabbed my attention. To get an idea of ​​Warden's versatility, check out this movie, then watch the 1962 episode "Naked City" titled "Rose Street Gang Specter" (available on video). If you're a fan of the movie, it's black. Enjoy!
