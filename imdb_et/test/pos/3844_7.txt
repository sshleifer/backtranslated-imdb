The Queen and her three kittens enjoy a high life with their devoted man, until the malicious butler Edgar, who has eyes with great heredity, decides to blink them and take them out of the picture. How can these fragile beings cope in strange rural areas and the middle streets of Paris? Only when you met an irreducible pilgrimage cat, O'Malley, is his romantic novel in his heart. After receiving the taste of a wide-ranging dangerous world, he drives them home and Edgar gets his only desserts at the wrong end of the horse. As always, it is really a voice, not an animation that is the heart of Disney's magic: Phil Harris is brilliant than O'Malley, Eva Gabor as Duchess ... well ... Eva Gabor; but perhaps the most memorable turns are Pat Buttram and George Lindsay, who turn old dogs to Napoleon and Lafayette for a couple of southern baking. Their scenes with Edgar and Scat Cat and his bay bands are classic. The most conspicuous vision of The Aristocats is now how profoundly Disney's animation style has changed since it was top-notch in 1970. (loss) and animation and overall pace are much less frenetic (sometimes relief) than recent efforts like Aladdin.
