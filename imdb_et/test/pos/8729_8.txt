I'm surprised by the relatively low rating of this movie. This is a comedy and romance movie with a screw that someone rolled along with Billy Wilder, but it does a really good job and even won the Oscar. <br /> <br /> This is Ingrid Bergman's first film in the United States since the 1950s and even though he is no longer among the young bombs he had in his early films, he pulls a complicated role quite nicely. This film proves that he had several good talents outside his good prospect. , love them and leave them with Walter Mathaw. Goldie is delightful in the sense of the role that made him an incredible career prize. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a real deep, but is a gem that has stood the test of time very well. Not sure why this average is as low as I give him a strong 8.
