It was a strange film. I liked this adventure, although it seems to be aimed at children. (SPOILER AHEAD) Ironically, the main character kills a federal official. Then he has escaped. Later, they blasted their house and then finally suicide. It would seem that they should have made this film for a more mature audience or make it more family-friendly. <br /> <br /> It was a strange film.
