I saw this movie for the first time at random when I visited my uncle in Adam about 3 and 1/2 years ago. The VHS print was a little faded, but I was looking at what I was looking at. Did it all make sense? Well, honestly, no. But this is a film that requires more than one view to understand all aspects. A pretty tragic score turned me off and the odd pictures looked impressed. <br /> <br /> Well, when I found out that Anchor Bay had released this weird DVD, I immediately started it. I was very pleased with the handover, though I felt that the attachments were missing. Although the film touches on the "O" and Sir Stephen characters, he has nothing to do with Pauline Reage's original novel or the 1974 film "O. story". . "O" decides to prostitute Sir Stephen in the violent 1920s in Hong Kong. His task is to prove his infinite dedication and love to his master by giving his body to other men. Of course, Sir Stephen enjoys him during his unpleasant sexual shelters and even finds himself a mistress. However, the tables are turned when "O" really finds love with the young men's admirer. Suddenly, Sir Stephen feels threatened ... <br /> <br /> I feel the deep meaning behind the film (including the tragic result and the artistic direction) makes the movie really classic. The viewer is introduced not only to the life and past of companions of "O" companions, but also to the confusion of the 1920s in Hong Kong. Like the political situation, all prostitutes need themselves. Nobody is happy in the film, even if they believe they are. (But "O" finds happiness with his young admirer.) One prostitute remembers tearfully how his father behaved like a dog when he was drunk, which naturally led to fetish because his clients are acting like a dog. he can't treat this vision. He treats his clients as co-stars and even swears to hear the piano by the river. <br /> <br /> As for "O", he has a setback for his father leaving him in a chalk ring. He will leave, he will feel abandoned. Of course, Kinski will be his father with the same setback. I had a very, very disturbed picture of that picture. I really felt the "O" movie at that point. it is so big that he sees Sir Stephen as his father and sees his daily demand to prove his love. <br /> <br /> Another curious aspect is the child (childhood) who sells happiness in the box. a casual character, but somehow it adds a sense of loss and emptiness to the film. At one point, the director even uses painted cardboard to paint people. Now, if it's not a symbol for you! (Laughs) <br /> <br /> All in all, I love this movie. I think this is a very deep and somewhat moving experience. It has erotic scenes, but the scenes aren't really meant. Like the lives of the characters, sex acts are empty. These are movements, but there is no feeling and tenderness. (Again, the only delicate scene between "O" and the young man. "O" believes he is in love and that humiliation is an honor, but he finally finds that he has choices. He can also be his own person and continue his happiness but he also has the opportunity to stay in the circle his father drew. The director leaves many unanswered questions, but some things don't need answers. The viewer makes the decision that works for them. <br /> <br /> I have to say I want I think it would be interesting to hear his opinion about the film and its message years later. It is a shame that the soundtrack was never published. This movie has a really haunting and heartbreaking pound. which sends out my spine, I feel the feeling of loneliness of the film by listening to music.
