It was a bold movie that hit Indian cinemas when it appeared. The first film that may seem to open lesbian tendencies among Indian women. The leading actor of Indian cinema Shabana Azmi added her hot passionate scene to Nandita Das. <br /> <br /> The film is sexual and the director used sex in the best possible way. Sex was not for erotic purposes but was in the context of the film. The scene where Nandita Das loses her innocence to her husband was the first of its kind in Indian cinemas. <br /> <br /> All actors, especially Nandita Das, acted in the middle of criticism of the Indian public.
