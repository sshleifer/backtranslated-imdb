I love SRK in general as a cable (how can you not do that?) And I believe that SRK and Driver fit perfectly on the screen because both are actually more beautiful. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great look, although it has some big flaws: <br /> <br /> 1) Good Boy (Sunny) - Not only is it so much less attractive than Shahrukh (which he thinks it is so important that Bollyfilms is), but his role has no character - it would be much better if there were a conflict between two strong personalities, instead we have a conflict between personality and the middle soldier. 2) Kiran's and Sunil's responses to Rahul's actions are incredibly stupid and naive even for Bollywood production. <br /> <br /> But it's not as important as the wonderful melodramatic atmosphere, great songs (really really big) and (say again) Shahrukh as a villain, I just love him if he is so <br /> <br /> Black (with Anjaam, Baazigari and Duplicate)
