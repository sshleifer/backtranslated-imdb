It strikes you in the stomach. There are other more convincing characters, more realistic stories, and perhaps even more profound political appeals. But most of them are not led by Peter Watkins. Perhaps a true genius artist from the 1960s, Watkins, has made quite rare films that capture the spirit of the foreign aesthetic world - the world of political events, social problems, and government solutions. So his work is probably less film-like than political, some of which may be called the weakening of his natural artistic quality. Then, why shouldn't art allow you to get used to it? Watkins dares. And succeed. You don't feel well. You don't feel happy. In fact, it doesn't like film; it is uncompromising, honest, direct, shameless; In short, your face. You can't get angry, you can't resist what you see what you see. That's what Watkins films are doing so well.
