When HOPPITY IS TOWN TOWN he discovers something bad about his little insects neighbors Lowlands. Is it honest, good-natured grasshopper to save your sweetheart, Miss Honey Bee, the evil C. Bagley's Beetle mechanics - and also your friends into a safe new home - before it's too late? <br /> <br /> Although HOPPITY is not one of the biggest animated features (a very new art in creating this movie), it is an enjoyable movie that should delight critical viewers. Technically, it's well done, generally animation. The main disadvantage of the film is that no symbol really has any "heart" - they don't come as "live" as Jiminy Cricket did PINOCCHIOs a year earlier. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, it is unfair to compare Fleischer Studio's output to Disney. Max & Dave Fleischer had to follow his star; their contribution - and that would be significant - would be for one-off comics. With their POPEYE and BETTY BOOP series, they have created alternative realities that would be viable like any other cartoon. HOPPITY was their second experiment with full-length animation (after GULLIVER's TRAVELS in 1939) and later spent their energy on a short topic. In fact, the highly recognized SUPERMAN series was first released. <br /> <br /> The story of HOPPITY owes much to Frank Capra, where it is energetic to become a powerful social force. Indeed, the original title of the film was MR. BUG GOES TOWN, which brings Gary Cooper or Jimmy Stewart and their Capraesque adventures to mind right away. <br /> <br /> Jack Mercer, Popeye's voice, speaks here of two very different characters, old gentlemen. Bumble & Swat the Fly. Cinematographers should get Pinto Colvig & Mae Questel, both veterinary voices, both of which are not credited. <br /> <br /> The movie has some nice songs from Hoagy Carmichael & Frank Loesser, of which "Be My Little Baby" Bumble Bee is the most familiar. "We are a couple of the castle" is a subtle romantic tune that deserves rediscovery. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that the movie's original animation, which is wiping from heaven and beyond. The depths of the New York skyline are hidden behind the credit.
