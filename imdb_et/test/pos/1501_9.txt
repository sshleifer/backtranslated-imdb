At the end of the 1940s, a series of short films "Flicker Flashbacks" took place, with a smile of silent dramas similar to Mary Pickford and Blanche Sweet. Scratched clips of outdated old films were redesigned, predicted too quickly, and were given dug out music and flat quips. The attitude expressed through this brutal behavior was largely merged from the very beginning of the century into the Hollywood perspective: the silent cinema was considered hockey, delicate, slightly embarrassing and only good. In the 1950s, this attitude gradually changed for several reasons. James Agee belonged to the quiet clowns of Life Magazine in 1949, but the television played an important role in reviving silent films. Indeed, the TV networks sometimes dealt with the material sharply as "Flicker Flashbacks", but the higher-tone series such as "Silents, Please" dealt with movies with respect. Another milestone was the compilation function of Robert Youngson: KOMEDI Golden Age, which turned out to be a surprise to theaters at the end of 1957. <br /> <br /> I don't know if Charles Chaplin was aware of Youngson's movie or his progress at the cashier, but it was around that time he decided to launch the three best short comedies of the theater, DOG LIFE, SHOULDER ARMS (both made in 1918) ) and THE PILGRIM (made in 1922 and published next year). These three films worked well with the trio because they contrast well with the drawing, theme and settings. In addition, all three are familiar with the face of Chaplin, some of whom play multiple roles in each short group. During the restoration, the films had not been publicly reviewed for more than thirty years, so perhaps Chaplin was worried that he retained his reputation for a new generation of filmmakers, especially since his best work was rarely shown on television in the early days of new media. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Chaplin apparently came to the conclusion that the films slid too slowly at the old silent projection speed, so they decided to "print" them, meaning that every other frame was printed twice. Maybe he wanted to avoid the appearance of "Flicker Flashbacks", but it wasn't the best way to do that. Aesthetically speaking, the results were terrifying and virtually destroyed the motion of the movies, but nevertheless the THE CHAPLIN REVUE theater appeared in 1959, a version that was released on video and available in Playhouse Video in the 1980s. . At that time, I bought a copy of the VHS movie and was very frustrated with the nervous, stop-and-start rhythm of the films. <br /> <br /> This is particularly gratifying that David Shepard's Chaplin compilation is restored (originally produced in the form of a laser disc) as a major improvement over the Playhouse Video version. In most cases, the projection speed is adjusted. "Stretching" has always disappeared, although the activity seems to be somewhat dragged off from time to time. For example: A DOG'S LIFE Edna & Charlie's Uncomfortable Dance At the Green Lantern Cafe, Edna's bare hands seem blurred; At the second moment, SHOULDER ARMS ditch scene, when Charlie is released from conviction, seems to have staggered for some time, but this may be due to the maneuvering of film directors to cover a bit of decay. First of all, the picture quality is fantastic considering the age of the films themselves. <br /> <br /> Other bonuses: REVUE begins with rare scenes taken at Chaplin's studio. It also includes pictures of the apparently staged, joking trial procedure where Chaplin is decolerated by actor Loyal Underwood, as well as Charlie's scenes on her dressing table, which puts her makeup and cuts the famous mustache. These scenes are accompanied by a Chaplin narrative, which is presented quickly. Chaplin also produced a new musical score for his compilation, and I think his themes were his best compositions for REVUE, especially in the cafe series A DOG LIFE. The only exception is the song written for THE PILGRIM, the pseudo-Singin 'Cowboy number called "Bound for Texas", which was sung by Matt Monro in "Fifties-style" (sounds rather like Gene Autry), which is annoyingly insecure and inappropriate. Otherwise, music will be perfect for action and atmosphere throughout the rest of the version. <br /> <br /> The release of THE CHAPLIN REVUE seems to have in some sense been a long delayed debut by presenting these classic comedies as they had to be seen all the time. In this form, REVUE Chaplin is the most durable and enjoyable work.
