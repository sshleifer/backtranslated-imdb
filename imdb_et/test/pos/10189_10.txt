I recently visited Magic Kingdom as an adult with her mother, her best friend and an adult sister. Disney World is often perceived by children, but when you see quality exhibitions like Mickey Philharmagic, you realize that Disney's magic is for everyone! It was such a big show that we left the theater and turned around and got back on line. And then the third time. It was absolutely breathtaking. I would encourage someone who goes to Disney World to look at an exhibition that is not just an exhibition, but a world wind, a fun ride with Donald when he once again lets him get in trouble!
