Flash Gordon was first class. I know there were a couple of goofi, but I didn't see it because of errors. Buster Crabbe is Flash Gordon. He was not a trained actor, but he gave very good and convincing results. Jean Rogers is beautiful for 20 years. old was, in my opinion, a pretty good job. Charles Middleton as Emperor Ming is great. In many other films, she was quite versatile, she could sing and dance. His portrayal of "Ming Merciless" in all three Flash Gordon series was top-notch. The other majority also did a very good job. Well, boys and girls, some popcorns get calmed down and you enjoy. John R. Tracy.
