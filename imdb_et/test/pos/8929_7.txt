"Eighteen" (2004) speaks about Pip Anders, a depression and an extremely cynical young man who is alienated from his insecure upper / middle class family and lives on the streets of Vancouver. On his 18th birthday, he receives a tape tape and player from his recently deceased grandfather, who associates his 18th birthday memoirs with a British army in France, trying to help a wounded comrade prevent the occupation from being captured by the Germans. When Pip listens to the tape (Ian McKellen gave his grandfather a voice), we see what he describes as setbacks, alternating with the daily scenes of Pipi's life, as well as the latest setbacks that fill in the dark secret why Pip left home and finds it impossible to trust anyone who it is pleasing to her. <br /> <br /> Ambitious second film by Richard Bell ("two brothers"), who has a polished look, excellent photography, well-developed non-stereotypical characters (equally homosexual and straight) and commendable efforts emotionally physically demanding roles of some talented new entrants (especially Paul Anthony as Pip and Brendan Fletcher as grandfather at 18). Alan Cummings has also turned to a priest who tried to help Pipi and a small supporting role played by Thea Gill ("Queer As Folk"). The tricky story - the director's own words in the commentary on his DVD - is meant to drive the "twist of emotion" that pushes Pipi to his breakpoint, and it will surely achieve it. My only criticism is that the overall effect is too "schmaltzy" or artificial, so that the audience can be truly identified, a large part of the supporting dialogues (and the end) are too designed and predictable, and the direction must be sharper in order to limit the sloppy excesses. some scenes. I recommend it, 7 out of 10, including extra points for considerable effort.
