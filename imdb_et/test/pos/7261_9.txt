I've seen previews everywhere before viewing it. And what you know, I really liked it! It has a new twist in the 18th century England. Although the music of the dance picture is clearly modernized and also the colors of Liv Tyler's clothing (although it is pretty beautiful!), It fits perfectly perfectly. <br /> <br /> If you just want a good time, you should check it out. Very different from other 18th century detailed films.
