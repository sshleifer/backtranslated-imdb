This movie was in my house in a dusty video pack before we watched it. We knew it was - every time someone wanted to watch the movie, it was suggested. It became almost a joke ... "I know, let's see a mole of a train" ... I don't know why it was always pushed down, it was just. Little did we know what we lacked. It seems to me that it took us so long ... It means he is celebrating Danny DeVito, Billy Crystal and Ann Ramsy (whom we called "The Lady from the Goonies"), which are all the stars that should have turned all in my household. But it was almost ten years. Until one day it was recommended and we couldn't get it any more ... <br /> <br /> It was like finding a King Tuti grave ... <br /> <br /> No movie ever made me laugh so hard, and I doubt every film is ever. I had to roll back almost every row because I was still laughing at this upcoming line and lost the ability to hear or pay attention. Not just easy to laugh, whether ... laughs, consuming more energy than running cold ten miles. Such a laugh that you can't control, which causes rolls and spasms and tears and gets caught in your face because it's just funny. When I learned the film from the heart, I say that this effect has decreased, but I don't think I'm tired of looking at it and finding new quirks. I think that's all I can say. I'd like to recommend this movie to anyone, but if you don't enjoy it, don't let me know, I'm probably offended.
