"Manna From Heaven" is a pleasantly convincing film. <br /> <br /> In the changing middle-class paradox of American values ​​up to 40 years ago, the plot speaks of the range of Damon Runyonesque characters of concern and hopes. <br /> <br /> Their struggles with moral dilemmas, "what might have been," still hopefully meet youthful dreams, romantic longing, and "big hit", the most fun movie. Instead of relying on direct sexuality, the growing relationship between Inez and Mac / Bake is classically fine but clear. His canvas is prominent in his gallery and his heat in the poker game. One of the few films I've ever seen twice when I opened, "Manna From Heaven" definitely requires national distribution. <br /> <br /> Conrad F. Toepfer
