I didn't see a movie where the creators put as much heart blood into their work and for a long time turned their attention to the finest details. <br /> <br /> Everything was well thought out and perfectly realized. The work, editing and composition of the camera worked together so well that it was just amazing. The headlines were so fun and so wonderfully choreographic. <br /> <br /> This movie just blew me away. <br /> <br /> "Showdown" could have been reduced to 10 or 15 minutes. br /> <br /> This is an almost perfect respect for the early silent deed.
