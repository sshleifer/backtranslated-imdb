Bluff I think this movie is very good. <br /> <br /> Is the Colombian film a different one? It's fun and the actors use a local expression that has so much money to listen to. <br /> <br /> It shows a different face o Bogot√° and I think it is very important because Colombia is a diverse country and we have to show that the world is the first film by director Felipe Martinez and I really think it The film is a great career for a novice director. <br /> <br /> We must continue to support the film industry in Colombia, because this film and other good films are great.
