Despite all the horses associated with the TYPE OF HEIGHT episode, TERROR BALANCE may be just the best episode of the series. And although I've always loved some of the activities because it's so much fun, I really have to vote because this Romulan episode is the best. <br /> <br /> The film, interestingly, is really like the WWII submarine movie that it bounces back and forth between the hidden Romulan ship and the Enterprise, as it tries to destroy Romulans before they sneak back over the neutral zone after the RAID federation outposts. In so many ways, the exhibition is similar to the film ENEMY BELOW, where the American captain (Robert Mitchum) and the German captain (Curt Jurgens) are shown in the opposite direction, as they both try to be better than others - and in the process they are created to honor their enemy. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, there is only a short episode on the planet - and it's amazing because the ship's episode could easily have been static and boring. But since the writing was so fantastic and the main characters were written and acted so well (Shatner and Mark Leonard as the leader of Romulan). Strangely enough, they find Leonard the same actor, who later played Spock's father, in hard trekkers. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that it is just a great and extremely interesting episode that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
