I am free to admit that I haven't seen the original movie, but I've read this game so I have the "original" background. If you remove it from being a remake of the old classic, this movie is smart, witty, fresh and fun. Yes, election decisions may seem strange, but they work. <br /> <br /> I am a feminist, and this film was not the least for me - no matter what other women might say. It's not a movie for men to see (so please, ladies, don't drag your men to see you, it's just cruel); women get jokes, situations and relationships. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised by the depth that Annette Bening brings to her character ... she did a great job. Debra Messing was divine and Candice Bergen was fantastic. I was less impressive to Meg Ryan ... he brought emotions to the table, but his comedy took it less. All female casts are strong, and this is definitely a ridiculous comedy. I enjoyed this movie thoroughly and planned to see it with my mother again. Women understand.
