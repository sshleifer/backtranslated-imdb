If you've been waiting for years for the movie you've heard about grape vines, are your expectations obvious? f ** k yeah! But when that little child fell through my door, do I know what the visuals would have attracted to my TV and distort my fragile spirit. First of all, Karim Hussein is a film fan, like all of us who grow up in Argento / Fulci / lynch et al., And it shows this movie in a good way. Although I really didn't know what hell I was at my first watch, I was just surprised by visuals, lighting, and of course all the Karim-related performances that he really believed he was going to raise the boundaries in filmmaking (which trusts me to do) and that he is a hard work that persuades participants to do the same ........ <br /> <br /> I tell you about "subconscious cruelty"? Well without breaking it .... this is a deep understanding of the human psyche with violent and sexual madness images that get crazy ..... a truly unforgettable experience ..... .. <br /> <br /> Karim keep an eye on With Hussein, he can only go for the better things ..... <br /> <br /> I watched the full-printed print of unconscious cruelty on double-disc DVDs from Infliction movies, loaded with extras ..... please note that there is censored Hong Kong release there to prevent this version.
