Text taken from 2001 at Melbourne International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> Devil's Name The title is the reference to the deliberate misrepresentation of the leading actor Fabian Stratas, Falkland, reference to the setting of the film, and less of a subtle hint of the secret agenda of this protagonist. <br /> <br /> Fabian is an Argentinian, amateur player who is going to be a tourist who will visit Falkland shortly after his reopening for his people. His overall plan is to win the ultimate struggle by fascinating and impregnating local women, starting with the delicious Camilla, so that she welcomes the whole generation of Argentines. Fuckland creates an illusion of documentary and retains a fish-eye perspective that gives the film voyeuristic elegance and intimacy. (ARGENTINA)
