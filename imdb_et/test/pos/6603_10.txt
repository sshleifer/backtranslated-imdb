My son, an avid skateboarder, sat down and watched me follow him. In love with documentaries, it didn't put much pressure on him. The whole amazing story about it - a bunch of dirt-poor kids drifting around and breathing something revolutionary - well, more of wood, wheels and no waves - that floored me. It's still there. I didn't think I'd enjoy it the way I did, nor did I think I'd beat Stacey Peralta's tear over Jay Adams's fate. And just looking at Jay Adams himself ...... child skating and adult remembering shoulders. I looked at it again last night for the tenth time, and I still get goosebump, watching him fly down the hill when Jimi Hendrix's "Freedom" plays in the background. And I'll tear up again. Not too many films have the same effect on multiple views. Brilliant.
