Finally! Third time happy. This movie has always been in my mind, but my first look at it was forgotten and I only got to the other side. Then just a few months later, I had a second chance to watch it, so I decided to save it. Only to find out that my timer went late and again, I missed the first half of the flick. I didn't allow it to happen again. So when I came back on television, I thought I had to wait for it to start, so I'll save it. And that was a good choice. I would have just watched the movie, but they always put it overnight. <br /> <br /> After an accident in your crowded cell, nine prisoners escaped from their captivity to track the universe key that a prisoner known as a fake king said he was hidden. They think that this key could be the openness to the hidden looting of counterfeit invoices. On this journey, of course, they see this opportunity to live their lives before they were busy. While things do not come out as they intend, most criminals are going to get lost. "9 souls" is a perky spiritual journey by the Japanese director Toshiaki Toyada who pulled the viewers into two completely different sides. In the first half of the story, the psychological comedy plays with the bonds of criminals and the situations where they are the point of sale, but everything that makes the moral and consequences of the drama packed on the other side, where the real problem starts with some rather disgusting and bloody moments that replace football tone. When in the first half of the road there are quite amusing, screwing doodling and attacking. But it is a really strange last side with the peculiarity of the events that strikes you with such hard, surprising touches that make you truly sympathetic to these very human characters. Even if they are not really innocent of their crimes, these first half of these carnal characters would get stuck, so if you see them spiraling into your fall, you know it's dramatic dramatic when you become dramatic. Nine characters get enough time to truly understand your personal story and what weakness would eventually be under them. The way the plot works is that Michiru and Torakichi are the guides and we see it mostly from their point of view. The escapism story is undeniably an enthralling nature study that is clear in its purpose and raises many questions about society and the path you decide to escape from life and get rid of these restrictions. <br /> <br /> Although the symbolic story is full of clarity and vividly said. The visual element will not go unnoticed because there is only a dreamy and trance-like vibe that directs itself to a unique atmosphere. What largely contributed to this factor and gave the film a lift was a large-scale, fanciful instrumental rock soundtrack. The gentle atmospheric gel he was able to create in many scenes left me breathless with the eternal emotions he was able to provoke. Just beautiful and just powerful control in front of it. The momentum of such a long film (2 hours) seems to be a breeze, and editing has been done quickly, because we are just all together. Hypnotic photography is detailed. Although cast performances of odd criminals are of high quality, everyone offers enough personality and peculiarities. <br /> <br /> I found "9 souls" a pleasant and amazing surreal movie that awakens emotions and then smokes you into the almighty wall as it changes direction. Highly recommended.
