Despite later claims, this early talk of melodrama has little in common with "Citizen Kane": it is a biopsy of a ruthless but human-fancy plutocracy, which is historically spoken. Scene from Preston Sturges does not show any of his later gift sparkling dialogue and none of Kane's cinematic innovations are evident. Still, it is very observable, young Spencer Tracy (her old man's makeup makes her look like old, old Spencer Tracy), showing her depth and authority, and Colleen Moore - a little past her prime, not physically well-matched - playing a diverse woman-behind man. Helen Vinson is also one of the most deceptive females in the history of the film, sending the reverberation of the last third ecstatic soap opera. The surviving print is nervous and has missing tracks and some cells are left open (how would he know whose son was when he was sleeping with both?) And the music is terribly hockey. Because everything, I was quite fascinated.
