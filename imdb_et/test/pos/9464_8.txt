At first I thought it would be a funny movie. But after that I was quite surprised. Amanda Bynes was convincingly funny with supportive pain (especially what the "Bullet tooth Tony" played from Snatch. What is the contrasting role of these two films!). Now I'm not saying if the actor is good or not, but his act was particularly enjoyable. Even if the plot is divided into a semi-nice boy-lover triangle (though very funny), I think it shouldn't encourage what I think the movie is really: just fun. So, if it happens to stumble, be it a DVD or a theater, I'm sure you enjoy it.
