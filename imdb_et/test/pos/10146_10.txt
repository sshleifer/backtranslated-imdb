Some people say that the pace of this movie is a bit slow, but how does it differ from all other Hitchcock movies? They all move very deliberately and have dots and dots through points and excellent assembly. This film gives us just the right amount of comic relief that makes temporary scenes more sensitive. Albert Hall's scene is one of the best examples of Pure Cinema in the Hitchcock collection (most probably almost all of the "rear glasses"). For Pure Cinema Hitchcock, it usually meant small pieces of film that fit together without dialogue to tell the story visually. This is, of course, the main function of the Albert Hall sequence, as well as the shorter sequence of stairs at the end of the picture. <br /> <br /> Not many Hitchcock slip-ups here and the actors are great especially for Doris Day's rather surprising serious role.
