8/2008 When I first wrote my comments, shortly after the first vision of the film, I took a critical opinion, feeling that Lemmon and Matthau were basically "ringing" their performances that tied them so many times before. <br /> <br /> But when he saw it again, it seemed different, especially since neither of the two major mega stars lived much longer after it was released. <br /> <br /> Except for Spiner, all eight principals are performers with remarkable experience and also inevitably much longer in teeth than we have seen in many of our other movies and TVs. But not nearly everything? <br /> <br /> Watching this again, although it is certainly not considered a "class" of any of your careers, it is a fun movie with many interesting landscapes as well. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this reminds me that many movies, plays, etc. can often be seen from a very critical point of view or instead of seeing a lighter side, without waiting for the movie "Citizen Kane", "Casablance" or (for two wire), the other original "Odd Couple". It also gives a piece of nostalgia for Lemmon and Matthau as well as other cast parts.
