"Side Show" is one of the strange horror movies ever made from Full Moon Pictures. Very sometimes in some places but not as shocking as Trailer puts it out (the trailer of this movie shows all the parts). Also, functional and visual effects are well done. I would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 <br /> <br /> Fans of such amazing movies should check Puppet Scientist, Skinned Life, Slumber Party Massacre, Sleep Away Camp, and other full moon pictures blink.
