For documentary films, the question of realism always increases. How much of the movie is real and how many filmmakers are filming? LITTLE DIETER TO CUT IN NEEDS Herzog is too much absorbed to tell a story about a person who tells his story to deal with even realism and formality. The role of Herzog as a storyteller is obvious from the beginning. Fortunately, he is a master storyteller. LITTLE DIETER is the best, most interesting documentary I've ever seen. Dieter's story is appealing, and Herzog's efforts in reenactmentis, which brings Dieter back to his story while reviving his movie, are very effective. The story that Dieter tells is real, but Herzog is constantly present, breaking the realistic absurdity. This film is essential for documentaries and / or students at Werner Herzog.
