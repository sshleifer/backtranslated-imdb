This movie was delineated in raw humor .... I can't completely believe that these people can give up. Johnny Knoxville did not cross the line ... he was worshiping it! It was better than the first ... ALL THA WAY! The thing I found about the first movie was that the Shenanigans were somewhat like they were in vv. to show. NOT ATTENTION !!! they made a full 180 degree valve ... the whole cast is so prominent what they do, and not the stunts crazy ... but the music basically fits every situation ... GOOD WORK !!!! When you go, be sure to look at it before you go to the theater, use the bathroom, hold your stomach and throat to keep your nose out of your drink.
