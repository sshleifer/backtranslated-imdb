I went through my local library, browsing VHS birds when I saw a movie that fell into my mouth - Waterbabies. I have hoped to see this movie again - it has been over 22 years since I saw it (cable movie channel 78-79). I remembered many details - especially Grimes. My son, who is 4, and I watched it. <br /> <br /> He agreed with me that Grimes was "not nice" and the best way to describe it was that he didn't love Tom. He accepted it. It was amazing that I remembered some more songs. They were 22 years old in their heads, which means they had to be memorable, did they? <br /> <br /> This is a good child movie that has parents' instructions on what children had to ask to pass, which was not the address / time of society. This is what all the children experienced each day (except for some lucky ones), and while we try to make movies on the Disney coat, making them more children's computer, it does not mean that cruelty does not exist - or even not. I enjoyed the animation. It wasn't Disney, no. I don't think Don Bluth touched the brush on this movie. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, there are many. David T plays two roles! (I like him!) James M too. The watercups themselves are lovely. You know Tom and her. Then Billie is extraordinary when she plays - it's like her eyes ARK magical! I am WoO, TLW and TW a big company and company (and I'm looking for HP!) And I presented it with these movies. Yes, he jumps in the water, but not because of suicide. She jumped because she trusted the black woman - she had appeared to her all the time. <br /> <br /> I think it's a good movie! If you have children, take a copy for yourself. If it happens to find a copy with a purchasing power, let me know where! Ian liked it! :) <br /> <br /> Dee
