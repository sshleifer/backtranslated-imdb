I think this film was born in the year. To believe that people are still deprived of their constitutional rights, now under the name "internal security". I think this film was deliberately banned from the American public. PUNISHMENT PARK deals with the United States political gap better than any movie I've ever seen. Would it have been more generally looked at, would it have changed anything? Such a film is so polarizing that it can cause unrest. It shakes you and forces you to take the parties. This will bring you into question: are you disagreeing with the rights of the people during the war or if the Constitution is undermined by "national security"? The government forces the protagonist to compete against the American flag in a game that undermines the ideals under the flag. Operation is absolutely convincing. So much, I don't see any action here at all. If this is a scripted documentary, it is more convincing than the reality of any television. PUNISHMENT PARK is probably a film ever made. It really makes you think.
