OK, I'm a mammal. I love it. I had no expectations and they were all fulfilled. It was a terrible movie. I love it. I have managed to take advantage of the surplus DVD. No one understands your obsession. I can't tell the truth. For those who have seen the film, it will not come as a surprise, but I asked the secretary in the video store whether I could buy a copy and I could because there were two in the store and only one had reviewed and over half that time had been for me. <br /> <br /> Now this movie is terrible. Special effects are terrible. Operation is terrible, but I loved it. The actors are stupid, the fools of the plot, numerous numerous - as can be seen through the monsters, "Aratshns" looked like they were made of a plastic garbage can (maybe they were), there was a light land, TNT wasn't You shouldn't be sad, etc. <br /> <br /> You really need to love B-movies to get that pleasure ... alcohol helps enormously others.
