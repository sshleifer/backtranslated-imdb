One of the films I did through the collection of criticism and as usual changed at a pace. It turned out to be a big decision. I was almost caught up in the quality of the film, the story told about it and how it was said. The almost minimalist feeling of the film with rarely dialogue and almost constant music adds the whole level of recognition to the film. It's really a great movie to spend time and enjoy.
