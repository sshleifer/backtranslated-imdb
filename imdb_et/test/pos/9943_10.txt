Although many have Argento's last day's giallo-thriller confusing feelings, this is another proud proof of Argento's cinema shine. <br /> <br /> A young opera singer will perform for the first time and unexpectedly find himself obsessed with a mad maniac. <br /> <br /> In a sense, Opera is like today's giallo, taking over the opera Phantom, mixed with all the brilliant style and color that Dario Argento has to offer. Argento uses terrible camera technologies, repetitive symbols (like these slots!), Gothic atmosphere and truly merciless murder systems. Especially one scene (which includes a peep hole and a gun) knockers out of place! Of course, the film has also succeeded in some strong tension and great atmosphere when Claudio Simonetti gives a great music score. <br /> <br /> Some satisfying performances are cast. Cristina Marsillach is good as our leading lady. Late Ian Charleson makes a nice move as a director, as well as researcher Urbano Barberin, Marsillach's agent Daria Nicolod and Marsillach's bad lover William McNamara. <br /> <br /> Opera is the last day of Argento and perhaps the last of his great works. This is definitely a pleasure for fans and even some new ones. <br /> <br /> **** out ****
