Diora Baird is completely hot in hell in this movie. But really all the characters are amazingly fun to watch. <br /> <br /> MINOR SPOILERS As usual, the main character B is a bunch. B has this crazy idea of ​​setting up his own college if he is rejected from all the colleges he applies for. He is known for making fake IDs. so the approval letter is not a problem. <br /> <br /> Since B's father is hard @ $ $ and this university is suspicious, he has never heard B get his friend Sherman University website. Sherman has been accepted to a large college and is afraid of being arrested for fraud. He's very quick with a joke, but his mistake is that he wants to accept too much socially. <br /> <br /> Glen, Hands and Rory have three Bs following. Glen got zero from his SAT and has no thinking process. She constantly offers battle chambers, but she's very good at making smoothies that will get her a lot of hot girls. His hands were a great footballer who did not get the scholarship he hoped for and turned to handicraft to cover his lack of athletics. Rory was preparing to go to Yale from Grade 1 and was not accepted. He spends his time with meditation. <br /> <br /> Uncle Ben was my favorite character. Picture Lewis Black plays itself. If you have no reason to see this movie, look at Lewis Black and Jonah Hill. They are amazing. <br /> <br /> Monica is a B love affair. As most of these stories go, he is more popular than him and doesn't even notice him on the side of the movie. Unlike many other stories, B actually gets him and keeps him up. Monica is actually a good character, but of course she is adorable for B. <br /> <br /> The university has more supportive students who are fun to watch. A.D.D. the name is self-explanatory and funny that it reaches the meditation class. Kiki is a hot ex-stripper who falls on to go to school and finally gets to Glen. Maurice is a former military idiot who got his G.I. bill and wants to learn rock n 'roll in college. The ultimate guy is only known as Freaky Student, who thinks he can blow things with his thoughts. You who have little faith, wait until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, the villain is the dean of the opposing university, the president of his university student body, the president's friend, and their group of friends. <br /> <br /> Every character is lovable. I believe that this film has a good plot and is well done, despite what many people say. Even thought the overall story was predictable, the characters keep you away and make the movie big. Watch this movie. I'll give him 10 out of 10.
