I love this movie. This was done before the LA punk scene became worse. It maintains the mood and attitude of this time and place perfectly. I really feel lucky to have been in Fleetwood for four ensembles. The only part that doesn't fit well is the Catholic Disipline and their socio-political comments. I didn't see too many people at all. The rest of the movie shows attitudes that I felt a lot; people who are engaged in serious lives or leap in the music industry and / or in fear. I do not believe that I have seen a documentary that captures the covered subject both authentically and personally.
