With unlimited raw energy and uncompromising vision, Talk Radio excellently examines the public's affection for reducing the privacy problems of strangers through radio entertainment. <br /> <br /> Eric Bogosian is sensational as Barry Champlaine, rude on your face talking on the wireless network. He is natural for such a role and tune in one of the most impressive, most interesting radio personality I've ever seen on the screen. The timing and delivery of his insults to his various callers is a shock to the gene. <br /> <br /> Alec Baldwin also looks like Barry boss. He demonstrates the same explosive cynicism he later showed to Glengarry Glen Ross in 1992. But a truly prominent supporting role is the stony, seemingly brain-dead teen played by Michael Wincott. You must believe it. <br /> <br /> Oliver Stone and Robert Richardson do an excellent job of photography, which is almost entirely limited to one broadcast space. The claustrophobic feel of the film fully reflects its tone. After all, one of the main points of the movie is to use people's private moments to lead the audience. Stone shows that these moments are often too private for the whole world to experience. <br /> <br /> Talk Radio is a film that has a strong emotional and brain effect that rarely resembles today.
