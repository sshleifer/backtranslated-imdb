In the golden period of British films, this is my voice the most funny of all time. Yesterday, I was surprised how well the comedy was going on (made in 1950!). It really is the timing of the experts and the unrivaled playing of the two best actors from Britain: Margaret Rutherford and Alastair Sim. John Dighton's game is adapted to the farce by Frank Launder. The plot is simple: the ministry's mistake is caused by the girls 'school boys' school. I always laugh when I think about this movie.
