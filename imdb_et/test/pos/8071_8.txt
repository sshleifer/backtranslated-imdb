Some argue that Argentine director Esteban Sapiri La Antena is an anachronistic void; that when the silent films to which Sapir was honored were at the top of the movies, they were outdated today, leaving La Antenna strange. <br /> <br /> I disagree. Carefully. La Antena combines silent movie practices with 21st century technology, making this postmodern movie the ultimate in training. <br /> <br /> The film is set to timeless "City Without Voice", so, because Mr. TV, dictator / media mogul whose hair is painted, has become a word. The city resembles Fritz Lang's metropolitan (1927) title, perhaps 100 years before the film. It is all expressionist skyscrapers, TV antennas and animated billboards. <br /> <br /> Citizens are inspired by La Voz (voice), the only person with a gift of speech. La Voz is forced to sing on Mr TV's television network when his face is constantly surrounded by a hood (which is also kept naked). But when Mr TV plans to steal a written word, La Voz and his unconscious son join forces with the renegade family to restore people's freedom of speech. <br /> <br /> La Antena is nothing but pure cinema. In order to understand the silent film conventions, Sapir has to rely on pictures to tell his story. Leo Sujatovich is sure of almost constant scores. This provokes the best silent movie music, as well as the liar of the movie, such as tweeting car craze or the rhythmic rhythm of the crank. And the whole film is based on familiar intimidation, as if it were shown on an ancient projector. <br /> <br /> There is also a lot of dialogue. However, instead of using the title, Sapir has characters that appear in the frame. They are larger or smaller, filling the screen or venting the air, depending on what is being said. Think more of Night Watch (2004) about subtitles. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, words do not miss out on images. In fact, it is very happy, because La Antena has some of the most creative and original pictures we have seen for a long time, all captured by Cristian Cottet's gorgeous black and white photography. Expressionist city paintings are. Hooded singer and his blindfolded son. There is an abandoned air in the city that looks like the broken debris of some colossal spiders. And there is a sinister Dr Y, whose mouth is shown on his face-mounted TV screen. <br /> <br /> La Antena has been criticized for supporting too many of his images when he is allegorical. But again, I disagree. It is true that the sudden appearance of a swastika-like control device or a seemingly crucifixion boy crucified with David's star seems inappropriate; it is the upper part of a fairly well-designed fairy. but the lack of obvious symbols (two previous examples aside) works in favor of the film. It allows us to shape our thoughts: to decide whether to derive a political meaning, to see La Antena as an allegory of fascism, the risk of capitalist monopolies, and the power and responsibility of the media; or just take a movie of nominal, visually stunning adventure through a world that is simultaneously unique and familiar. <br /> <br /> An explicit depth victim for unique images may seem like a compromise. But really, if the film looks as good as it is difficult to take care of. There is more imagination and artistic work in every frame of La Antena when Hollywood can shoot the derivative. Raising some 100-year-old movies may be pointless, but in doing so, Sapir can show us what is missing in today's movies. He can tell us it's time for another artistic revolution. And he may be right.
