Living just from Hwy to Georgetown, Co ... I remember this movie well and thought it was great! The story seems to be something John could do in real life, but there is something I remember most about the movie. For those who do not live in Denver ... on every Christmas in Denver city, the Denver Center City Civil Center places fabulous lights and decorations. Well ... it happened, during the filming of the film, delivery was necessary. So ... it was borrowed from the Civic Center screen ... unauthorized, by the way! Someone had forgotten the power to advise and was stolen! In a few days, a fierce search began with law enforcement. Finally, someone spoke to the team of Georgetown for lending it! It was returned and put back where it belonged! As it turns out ... there wasn't so much in the movie ... you can hardly see it with children during Christmas. However, it caused interference ...
