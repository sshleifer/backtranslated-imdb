I've been waiting for this DVD (and its follow-up {Woman Prisoner Scorpion: # 701's Grudge Song}) for some time now. I was very happy with the first two films of this series. After watching this movie, I have to say that this is probably my three favorites. <br /> <br /> All three of these films were staged by Shunya Ito. However, it is good for them that although they all have the same token (Meiko Kaji's great play), they are all very different from others. <br /> <br /> The first movie (Female Prison # 701: Scorpio) is more or less typical of Women in Prison. But the character of Scorpion is very intriguing - it reminds the heroes of many Western spaghetti heroes. And the director often used very interesting and unusual visual approaches to the material. <br /> <br /> Another movie (Female Convict Scorpion: Jailhouse 41) is a real training force. Not so much a WIP movie as most of the movie is Scorpion and six other escaped prisoners sheep. <br /> <br /> This movie (female prisoner Scorpion: Beast Stable) is the third and last one to be led by Shunya Ito. It plays much more criminal drama. Once again our heroine has run. But this time he has managed to maintain a certain amount of normality in his life (relatively relatively). She works, she finds she lives, she makes friends outside. But, of course, everything must finally be disconnected. FPS: Beast Stable has a more straightforward story that is more peaceful than its predecessors. But I found it involved from start to finish. And don't worry: there are still many ailments in this movie! But I think these films exceed most of the exploitative materials, because more distracting elements are played in more straightforward shades than it is used only for the value of their face shock. Yes, there were definitely moments in this movie where I was really upset. But I didn't feel they'd made a tale of value (well, maybe time or two). One of the things I have really felt about these films is to continue to gather Scorpion's myths. This entry is much more extensive than the previous two. We see that he is much more than just a cordial heartfelt joke! <br /> <br /> As I mentioned in this review, the fourth film followed. It also has Meiko Kaji as Scorpion, but he had a different director. Without giving anything away, I would like to mention that FPS: Beast Stable ends in a way that makes the sequel completely unnecessary. The fourth film is still pretty good, but it seems to play an underscore footnote to the desperate trilogy. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in traditional movies. FPS: Beast Stable can be enjoyed as an independent piece (as well as the first two movies), but I would also recommend watching others if you haven't done so yet.
