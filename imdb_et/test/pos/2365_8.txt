Great Comic Comedy of the 1980s in England. This is the story of sex, drugs, shellfish, and seafront murders. Partly by Adrian Edmondson, French and Saunders, Nigel Planer (fun) and Robbie Coltrane. Dennis (Edmondson) is trying to impress a girlfriend because she is involved in a multi-million pound drug store. This causes complications with fun results. I'm trying to find the original picture ratio for this movie, but it doesn't appear under "Technical Aspects" on IMDb. I saw a DVD in the store and it looks like a 1.33: 1 (full screen) format. Was the film in this relationship or was it initially a widescreen movie with a pan and a scanning DVD? It would be useful to know when I hate panoramic and scanning films. So come IMDb. Can you tell us?
