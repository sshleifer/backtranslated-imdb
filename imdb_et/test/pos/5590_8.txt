Who won the Best Actor Oscar in 1933? It should have been Laura Hope Crewes for her superb imagination, which is never really a mother. He's really one of the greatest actors of all time. He played "Camille" (1936), a lightweight Prudence Duvernoy, and his most memorable role is Aunt Pittypat "Gone with the Wind". <br /> <br /> Irene Dunne was the official star of the movie, but Laura Hope Crewes' scenes were dynamic. <br /> <br /> David (Joel McCrea) is based in Heidelberg when he is offered a job in New York. Her husband Christine (Irene Dunne) can continue her studies at the Rockafellar Center. Their first stop in America is a visit to David's mother, Mrs. Phelps. The claim that Laura Hope Crewes dominates in each scene is a subtitle. His first entrance - a frantic effort to greet him "big boy" - has all the attention to him. Even sitting down the road at the desk when he forgets Hester's presence, even if you forget how he takes his way, you know that something is not right. (Hester has lived there for some time.) \ TFrances Dee is completely sweet and as true as Divine Hester. His performance in this film, especially the scene where he has hysteria and succession, proves how little the actor he was. <br /> <br /> All the young people cast are excellent. Eric Linden is a wonderful Robert, younger son who understands that his mother is terrible, but can't do anything to escape his mother's spell. Joel McCrea says at one point that "he painted roses in baths - it's more of your style". Robert's sexuality film has a very fine suggestion. <br /> <br /> Irene Dunne is great, no matter what movie or genre she was trying.
