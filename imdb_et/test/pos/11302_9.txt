It's great for a child's movie. An adult and a mother enjoyed watching a movie with their daughter. There's a lot in this movie. * Can * be considered a * spoiler * ... Barbie learns courage and learns not to rate other movies so quickly. He also learns not to give up hope and to lead his anger. I loved you seeing Barbie's teamwork and her sister and friends solve the puzzle. There is nothing in the film that I found offensive or inappropriate for young viewers. In fact, I felt that the movie's moral messages were excellent and well done. <br /> <br /> Animation was pretty good. I really enjoy skating scenes and I think they were very well done. There are many actions in this movie, so I suspect that most kids would enjoy it ... not just the ones that really are in Barbie. My daughter chose this because of Pegasus. She loves horses. But he enjoyed the movie a lot. My daughter is autistic and was able to sit and enjoy the whole movie. She really liked the scenes of activities and the parts related to horses. One thing I thought was that many people are against Barbie (and Ken) because they are so beautiful. But I think children like adults want to look at beautiful people and things. It's natural. Like adults, we also enjoy watching beautiful movie stars. But it is wonderful that the Barbie character and her "boy" have a lot of personality. Although it is fun to look at real people, it grows old when there is no substance behind the face. <br /> <br /> In general, I would say that this is a great movie for kids and parents will enjoy it. :)
