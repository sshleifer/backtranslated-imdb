I have nothing else to add to all the other comments except this: it seemed to me that the movie seemed like a quiet movie that was slowly adapted to sound. The text boards that lead to the story strengthened this impression. Along the way, the actors promised to leave a left-over theater-like exhibition; Marguerite Churchill looks very like a typical early silent film hero at the beginning of the film, but at the end it is allowed. The Swedish Gus reminded me of Shakespeare's game comic, and Windy sounded like an early Donald Duck. <br /> <br /> It was really surprising that everything was filmed out, on the spot, and although the dust of all wagons, horses, and cattle would hide the view that must really be for real settlers! It was also clear to me that many of these Indians must be real and I did not discover any public racism about them. And John Wayne seems so incredibly young! As a person who became John Ford's cavalry trilogy a true Wayne fan, and thought Stage Coach was Wayne's first lead, this film was a revelation. The plot is very simple, again reminding you of a silent movie, but it's very real! An amazing film made with this technique and under these conditions in 1930.
