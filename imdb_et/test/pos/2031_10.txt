If you like the 80s stone, you should definitely see this movie! I've seen it recently and fall in love with it! <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is very entertaining, giving you excellent rock music and not finding a one-second movie boring! It was a great idea that some real-life musicians were in it, doing what they do best. I was pleased that Zakk and Blas Elias showed that they all gave solid performances. I tend to agree with many people who say the first half of the movie was much better than the other, especially in scripting. It could have worked a little right, but not a big biggie. One thing that bothered me a little bit was Jennifer Anistan's performance. I thought he was not the right person for this role, I just didn't see him as a rock star girlfriend. But when the film goes on, you realize that it did a good job with it. honesty and sincerity that he offers that just doesn't live you cold. To sum up, a good and funny movie that doesn't go deep into the symbols, but offers you a fun, nostalgic feeling and of course Jeff Scott Soto and Mike's powerful vocals Matijevic!
