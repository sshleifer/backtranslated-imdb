It was a wonderful little movie that was really creative and fun - you see it too rarely in movies. The film begins in Russia immediately after the fall of the communist government. As a result, society seems to be in chaos and life has improved as the old regime is gone. Dirty cities, crime and lack of housing continue to cover poor people in St. Petersburg. <br /> <br /> In this darkness and uncertainty scene, an idealistic music teacher arrives. He is among those who do not have a home, and he will finally receive a letter from the government who tells him he has a small room in a nearby apartment. When he arrives, the place is confusing, but people seem to be friendly enough to have a nice party. In the middle of the night, they wake up to the old lady who walks from the giant wardrobe in the room (I was half waiting for Lucy and the other kids to come out of LION, WITCH and WARDROBE, but they didn't.) They are too shocked to do something first, but decide to look soon. Instead of being just a wardrobe, the wardrobe opens in Paris! How residents of the apartment react to this magical gate is really intriguing. Some, like a music teacher, are excited and frightened. Most of the others are more pragmatic and are mostly related to Paris before the attack closes everywhere before it is closed. These Russian thieves are terrible people - greedy, coarse and crude, but deep - VERY HULG - are gold hearts. I like how it is a metaphor for a nation that is now on the edge of capitalism. At first they run everything they can, and only later do they have some depth - but mostly they work like JERRY SPRINGER SHOW! The film has many turns and is both funny and mesmerizing. The only downside is that because of some harsh languages ​​and naked scenes (though very funny) it is not a film for children. It's a real shame, as with some very small edits, it would have been a great family movie.
