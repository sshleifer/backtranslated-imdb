The success of SCREAM gave a whole new horror wave. I am pleased with it as a big fan of horror and I liked most of these new horror movies. BOC is one big horror package. Colorful, fast paced and original. I see this movie in the opening of a new trilogy (similar to Episode 1 and Aliens: Resurrection) because it arises with new twists. Instead of focusing on small boy-killer doll relationships, we have a twisted film about couples. We have sweet young lovers, unlike the killer crazy doll size. Very resourceful!
