It was one of those movies that I always met (whether it was on television or on a cheap DVD), but never hit me to hit it, because I thought I didn't have much. It was one night and I thought it was good? why not. A good decision, too, because I'd hit myself for so long to get access to it. For me, I was impressed because it is there with Burt Reynold's best qualities ("Deliverance", "White Lightning" and "Boogie Nights") and comes back to those 70s / 80s silver, baked city crime thrillers that weren't afraid to be Unpredictably hide and go out of the way to put characters up, pack it realistically with brutal force and connect local places (Atlanta here) with a grounded photo. In some shades, it reminded me of "Dirty Harry," but it's loose. But this is a disgracefully bluesy blues score with glowing momentum, funky shifts, and unrestrained sounds, and I thought a lot about Lalo Schifrin's pulsating score for "Dirty Harry". However, the soundtrack of the music hits or skips. <br /> <br /> Sgt. Tom Sharky was an Atlantic narcotic before the bust saw him as a vice-work. Together with their new team, they meet a prostitution cycle that is keen on their interest because it is a master of one of the hard-to-track and guilty crimes. What they dig is related to an outstanding government figure and a professional girl who can give them important names, but they must reach her before she has set her target. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynold's deeds, but also driven by a sparsely strong and muscular way that would fit his laconic hard blunt and Gerald Di Pego's thematically hard and tense scenario (adapted from William Diehl's novel). Well, he shows that among these armor there is some conscience that includes a truly capable British actor Rachel Ward, be it stake-out scenes when he looks at him from another building (and slowly luring him) when they finally come together, but these last interactions slow down the momentum but give him the same blow. The performances are quite accurate with the preparation of Reynold's excellent report with extraordinary actors Charles Durning, Earl Holliman, Brian Keith, Richard Libertin and Bernie Casey. Shameful embarrassment and clever dialogue between these boys was a blast. As for the corrupt villains, Vittorio Gassman builds strength and strength, but it is Henry Silva (who seems to have been born for these roles) in a permanently insidious and unstoppable turn that makes the show. When his appearance seems to bring what needs to come and help them put in place. Plus, his adrenaline-filled and violent climax of cat and mouse with Sharky and his team has been perfectly done. <br /> <br /> Exciting sections of action can be quick and dry, but remain deadly violent, as is the tremendous sequence of tooth grinding. Some comfortable, old-fashioned filming techniques add a touch. The intriguing material keeps it quite tactical, but if we think its smooth sailing offers up to blunt surprise or two, with some intense confrontation.
