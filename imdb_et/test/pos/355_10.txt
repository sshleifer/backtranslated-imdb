I've been a Mario fan for as long as I remember, I have very memorable memories of playing Super Mario World because this game has brought a lot of these memories, adding something new. Super Mario Galaxy is the latest installment in the amazing Mario franchise. There are so many other Mario games in this game before it is still breaking Mario's biggest elements. The first noticeable difference is that the story takes place in the room. <br /> <br /> The story begins a lot like every other Mario game, Mario princess Peach's letter inviting him to celebrate his castle king. Upon arriving at Peach Castle, Mario Bowser and his son (Bowser Jr.) will attack the castle with their airships. Bowser robs Princess Peach and then lifts her castle into space. In the midst of space, Mario slips down and lands on an unknown planet. Mario is found under the name of Luma and is returned to Luma's home, a floating space device. Here, Mario meets many other Lumas and also meets their leader, a woman named Rosalina. Rosalina tells Mario that Bowser has taken away the Power Stars station and scattered them in the universe, it is Mario's task to help the lumens find and save Peach, so the adventure begins. <br /> <br /> You play this game by flying from a space station to other galaxies, each galaxy consisting of several planets that Mario moves through these levels using these star stars to load Power Stars. Mario can walk the planets several times without losing weight, some planets are small and others are big, many planets resemble classic Mario environments. The best thing about the game is controls, all things like jumps and such are still the same, but wiimot is used in this game in many unique ways. You shake the mario Mario makes a spin that is used for the game's main attack, and also activates the shooting names. You can also point the remote control to the screen and use the cursor to shoot the stars at enemies or environmental objects. Then there is the graphics, these are the best graphics of the Wii, it's just so hard to describe how big this game looks like, you may almost say it looks as good as some 360 ​​games. <br /> <br My only small handle is that the upside-down effect takes some habits and the story is quite weak. The worst part is that you lose all your life when you turn off the game no matter how much you had when you finished when you start 4 lives again. Still, these little problems go away, this is a great game that is very fun and very challenging. This type of game we're waiting for on Wii. <br /> <br /> Perfect for 10 out of 10!
