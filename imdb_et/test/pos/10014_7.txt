French star star Brigitte Lahaie of star-shaped stars. In fact, many of its slow moving cast members were porn makers during their frenzied filming. This film is definitely different from Rollin's usual lesbian vampire cuts, but it is not as memorable as "Lips of Blood" or "Fascination." The cut plays amnesia who doesn't remember who he is or where he came from. Most of the film takes place in a modern apartment complex, where Lahaie is ruled by a medical group that cures several people with similar conditions. Anyway, he escapes from the monolithic office space where the victims are kept. On the road outside the city, he meets a young man who stops and picks him up. "The night of hunting" offers a lot of nudity, unfortunately, this pace is very slow. The atmosphere is terribly sad and the relationship between Brigitte Lahaie and another asylum seeker, Dominique Journet, is well developed. th e Hunted is too boring to be completely enjoyable. Give it a look only when you're a fan of Jean Rollin's work.7 out of 10 and it's kind.
