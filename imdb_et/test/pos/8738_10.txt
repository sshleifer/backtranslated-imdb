The cactus flower is what I call "pizza movie" - a personal favorite that is never satisfied. Ideal for home evening with pizza. Knowing all the lines (and what lines!) From the heart only enhances pleasure. <br /> <br /> Since so many others here have sold the plot again, I just add the correction that Bergman's character, Miss Dickinson, was a sister-administrator, which means she was a qualified nurse and therefore an educated person - not "just" administrator. <br /> <br /> Bergman's production in this movie - and the film itself - was largely unpunished at that time, but his choice is admired by today's audience; not only impeccable comic timing, but the ability to make us believe our character does not know our feelings, exposing them so clearly to Toni and us. Although the overall plan goes to reliability, Bergman's performance is convincing: honest and completely credible. <br /> <br /> Jack Weston's performance with Matthau's old friend and conspirator, Harvey, is also special. No one was able to offer zinger such as Weston and I.A.L. Diamond script gives him a lot. For example, "It's so big, dirty, rotten wrong that he has a class." Weston was an eye-catching character because he published the heat that allowed you to forgive the mistakes of your characters. <br /> <br /> The film is a fairly straightforward customization of the Abe Burrows game (customized by the Barillet and Gredy French game). On Broadway Matthau's role was played by Barry Nelson. Bergman is Lauren Bacalli and Hawn's Brenda Vaccaro. It took place in 1234 performances (three years) and was nominated for two Tony Awards (Vaccaro and Burt Brinckerhoff, who played Igor). <br /> <br /> For me, the film's score, written and adapted by the legendary Quincy Jones, is another highlight. The main theme (Time for Love is Any Time) takes place at Sarah Vaughn over initial and final credits. It is also in a different place inside the film, especially under romantic piano music, which emphasizes Berman's speech at the store in Hawn. Jones also created covers for popular songs for night club scenes (Sir Sirge with love). As with all film elements, there is an enormous amount of talent, taste and professionalism. In my opinion, some classic romantic comedies can hold a candle on this classic. It's nice that it's finally available on DVD. Time to call the seal ...
