My relatives and I have barely watched this movie. I do not know exactly what this film is, but we agreed to this pleasant movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories. <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend this movie completely and absolutely who loves good healthy family movies, because that is what it is. The things the four children find themselves are completely fun to watch. It's an old movie, but doesn't let it fool around. This is one of the best movies out there that shows such a strong bond between the brothers.
