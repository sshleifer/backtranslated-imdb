The film is not as bad as people want to believe you. <br /> <br /> What is the reason why so many people hate this movie? Is it because it is Laurel and Hardy's last one and is not their best? Or is it due to the lack of regular Laurel & Hardy? Or because it's not done in Hal Roach's studio apartments or in the 20th century Fox? It is certainly true that this film fails to revive Laurel & Hardy and bring them to the 50's. It is certainly true that the film is far from being the best, but to be honest, the film is still very entertaining, making the film far from its worst. Not the most valuable goodbye to a movie that can be imagined, but interesting and goodbye to say goodbye. Both left the films after finishing the movie. <br /> <br /> The film still has great exciting moments and the chemistry between Laurel & Hardy is obviously very high. This also makes this film better than the 40's in most of its films. Quite surprisingly, the slapstick humor is still working as much as it has done, since the days of the "30s" have been the days of tiny comedy. could have been and it has too many sidekicks and signs, resulting in the film losing focus on the guys sometimes. Shame because they are the ones who really wear and make the movie. <br /> <br /> Sad to see in what poor form Stan Laurel was in the movie. She really seemed sick and old, of course she was. He was already over 60 years old. But after the operation he got back completely and lived for another 15 years before he died in 1965, 8 years after his good friend Oliver Hardy. Hardy and at the end 3 decades of fun, humorous, high quality entertainment movies that people around the world watch and love. <br /> <br /> 7/10
