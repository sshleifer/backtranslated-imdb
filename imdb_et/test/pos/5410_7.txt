"Imaginary Heroes" is difficult to judge without the fact that director and scriptwriter Dan Harris is only 25. You can't believe this movie, which is not only mature work, professional and profound, but also some of the routine shortcomings of older managers. <br /> <br /> This is an American suburb that is too familiar with American Beauty or Desperate Housewives. As in American Beauty'the suicide, but here it happens at the beginning of the movie and we're leaving to look at a middle-class family who is going to cope with the death of a talented athlete's brother and son. Emile Hirsch plays the younger brother, Sigourney Weaver is the mother, both are excellent attempts to deal with the loss to find a reason and motivation to survive. Harris rides his actors with a firm hand, and the first two parts of the movie (four in total, like the seasons) build great tension and reliable dilemmas and real issues. It is the second part of the film that disappears a little, it seems too tired and normal, and I suspect that the producers might have intervened in the work of a young script writer and director trying to bring him closer to the Hollywood Convention. This is not a trivial version of "American Beauty" with a different focus. However, I am sure we will hear a lot about Dan Harris in the coming years.
