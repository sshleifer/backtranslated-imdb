With the recent release of Carlos Saura 'Fados' in the United States (the album is only a release of a limited art house), it is high time to re-publish this fine documentary from Amalia Rodrigues. This movie is on Amalia's older movie portfolios and on American television, as well as on a variety of other movie clips, including one of her and her mother, who can easily cut down on the most macho man. I first saw this long documentary when he got the unjustified release of the "art building" (it was much better). Fortunately, Amalia has the best recordings in various "budget line" recordings (which are generally available in places like K-Mart or Best Buy), or if you are looking for a little, some of the original publications can be fine-tuned either on E-Bay or some priced European imported CD -de marketing services. There are at least two versions of this documentary (the original Portuguese version, without English subtitles and the US version with English subtitles, except for the European version, most of the USDVD players cannot play the PAL color system). Not rated by MPAA, but contains nothing to offend.
