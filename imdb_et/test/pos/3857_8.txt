I have to say one big reason why I thought AristoCats was so big that I love cats !!!! I love cats, which apparently gave this film a great score on me, but not only that it was definitely a good movie as well, and I love where they set the movie. This is one of my pet movies, although it is animated, and I really love how the actors actors did not hear so unprofessionally behind the voice of the animals. It seems to me that this movie looks classic, but I think IMDb is not it because it is, yes, I mean too low rating. You look at all the other "ORIGINAL" Disney movies and they have a much higher rating despite this is AristoCats one of the best animation films, and I can enjoy it again and again!
