There are movies that make a career. For George Romero, it was night life; Kevin Smith, CLERKS; Robert Rodriguez, EL MARIACHI. Add Onur Tukeli to this list with absolutely amazing DING-A-LING-LESS. Making a Flawless movie and being as confident as any of the above-mentioned movies. I'm not that hard because I saw the plenary. (And even then, I don't think I smiled at it hard ... So to speak.) Blocked talent is remarkable: DING-A-LING-LESS is so full of double offers that one should sit with this script copy and do it line-by-line to fully evaluate, width and width. Each shot is beautifully designed (a firm hand with a firm hand) and performances are everywhere (there is no overwhelming landscape of chewing what to expect from such a movie). DING-A-LING-LESS is a film that has come to a time.
