RAINBOW BRITE AND STAR STEALER, in my opinion, is a great masterpiece. I felt all warm and mysterious when Rainbow Brite (voice of Bettina) and Krys (voice of David Mendenhall) went to the princess (Rhonad Aldrich's voice) for revenge. When you ask me, the princess was absolutely harsh and devilish. For me, he deserved Rainbow Brite and Krys to seek revenge. But I liked his castle and the rest of the place. In addition, I thought Lurky (Pat Fraley) and Murky (Peter Cullen) might be hellish. Before I licked it up, I would like to say that everything was completely cast, the direction was flawless and Disney has hit a lot. All in all, I recommend this great masterpiece to anyone who hasn't seen it, especially TV series fans. I guarantee you enjoy it.
