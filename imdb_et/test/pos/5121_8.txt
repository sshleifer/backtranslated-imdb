This movie was not a big cinema, but definitely a good movie to see with your family, especially children aged 10-15. In this film, good discussion topics have been raised, such as bullying, the environment, and working to make things right. Jimmy Buffet's music was a plus and the scenery was wonderful ... Young actors were great, and this is a movie I hope to see on the Family Channel or Hallmark Channel. Except for a few words in the dialog, the high school can show this movie to start discussions in the classroom. Hopefully this will be shown in the Drive in the summer so more people can see it. It followed Carl Hiassen's book well, and it was fun to see her in a camel message.
