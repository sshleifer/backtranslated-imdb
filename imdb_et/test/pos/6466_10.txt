This is one of Cassavetes' best performances. The whole cast is outstanding, as Martin Ritt is extremely underrated. The wrath, anger, and desparation of city labor battles are perfectly spoken in a way that is neither intrusive nor patronizing. In a sense, it is timed, but in many ways it is glorious from time to time.
