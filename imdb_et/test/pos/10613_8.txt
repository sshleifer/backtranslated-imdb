This is a unique film because it gives us the only chance to see Noel's coward in all of his ironic glories. Because he seems to be so reserved and inseparable that he fits into an unbelievable frame that actually uses all the people around him. But in the last deadly (not with the red intent), when Coward has to do like Flying Dutchman, he is much less comfortable. <br /> <br /> But his way to the epigram is equal and Hecht & Macarthur has given him some gems (Macarthur, really - he was a pair). <br /> <br /> The film has been superbly illuminated by the great Lee Garmes, but he has little camera movement off the storm. Hecht and Macarthutr took care of one thing - getting a dialogue on the screen. (NOTE: H & Mil is a flashing-and-you-miss-'em light on the flophouse scene). <br /> <br /> One of the most important contributors is the one and only Alexander Woolcott, the notorious Broadway, both the Macarthur and the Coward columnist, and a close friend who appears as one bitchy author, has always been waiting for the publisher Coward's reception. <br /> <br /> Curious that Woolcott agrees to make a film that clearly captures the legendary algonquin roundtable, of which he was the founder, and Macarthur something auxiliary. <br /> <br /> Scoundrel won the Best Story Oscar, although this victory is probably more due to Coward's presence than the shine of any plot. It's a coward, Woolcott, and the dialogue you remember ...
