This movie, with only two characters, brings you closer to those two people, the interrogator and the prisoner, when most movies take you to every character that is still well-designed. <br /> <br /> The confusion, the fear, and the pain that Madeleine Stowe's character is going through are deeply disturbing, as is Alan Rickman's sadistic but charming interrogator. <br /> <br /> This movie is too possible and relies on a shocking climax, the effect of leaving the film as a whole, you sit quietly at the end. It haunts you for a long time.
