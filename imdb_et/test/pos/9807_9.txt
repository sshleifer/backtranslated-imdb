You got it right! Bobby was Mike's imaginary friend throughout the film, even at the beginning when he was on his way to California. His mother knew Bobby and did not discourage Mike from leaving Bobby because the imaginary friends are common with young children. <br /> <br /> That's why they both got stomach pains at the same time. That's why the boys were so close. <br /> <br /> At the end, Mike went to Bobbi. "King" was arrested. Mike could go without Bobby. This is also why Mike's mother didn't seem to be disturbed when Mike received a postcard (Mike was written and posted) from Bobby Ol 'West's tourist stop and other postcards all over the world. You noticed that Mike's mother turned the first card and looked at the postage stamp. What a great mother does the best she could in the late sixties. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 for me. Bringing back memories ...
