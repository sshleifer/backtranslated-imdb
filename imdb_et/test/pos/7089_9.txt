"One True Thing" is a film where the audience is inspired by highly inspired performances. I do not necessarily mean that the film is exaggerating because it is not. In fact, the film is down to the bottom right under pressure. I am trying to say that for the film it takes a lot of emotional tears from the participating crowd. powerful movies. The characters were completely cast. The performances are all guaranteed for the Oscar candidates, especially Meryl Streep, who portrays Kate, who is dying, very well. His acting alone was enough to recommend the film and gave him a new position. I also thought that Renée Zellweger was a realistic, free-riding woman who had to take care of her mother. Other cast members, including William Hurt & Tom Everett Scott, were also excellent. The script for this movie was really fantastic. It's kind of funny, how the film's concept relates to controversial events in my local area. You see, I live in Lansing, near Michigan, and now the big problem here is the assistant suicide officer Jack Kavorkian (sorry if this is so) how the roads are just banned. The public will vote for it according to its convictions in November. After looking at "One True Thing", it changed my perspective on this subject, even though I've always believed it. Without revealing the end of the film, I just say that suicide is a distant subject of this film and I think it fits exactly with the gorgeous story. In general, this film really has more emotional impact than Titanic, Saving Private Ryan or any other tearjerker that has appeared in recent years. I think this is because the main idea of ​​this movie is that it happened every day, so it's better connected with the audience. And really, that can happen to you.
