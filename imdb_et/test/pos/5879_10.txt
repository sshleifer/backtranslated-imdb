I was blown when I saw "The Best Years of Our Life". Actor, Script and Master William Wyler's Direction (Best Director Winner 1946) is brilliant. <br /> <br /> The film is about three veterans of World War II who come home with the plane and all live in the same city at random. They are all reunited with their families. <br /> <br /> First Person Al Stephenson (played by Fredric March in his Oscar winner role) must adapt to his wife Millie (played by Myrna Loy) and children Peggy and Rob (played by Teresa Wright and Michael Hall), which differed when he left the war. <br /> <br /> The other man Fred Derry (played by Dana Andrews in a great role) must find a good job and he had only been left for 20 days before getting married. He starts to find out that he is not the same. <br /> <br /> The third person is much harder to adapt to. Homer Parish (played by Harold Russell in his great Oscar role) He has lost his hands in war and has to deal with his family and groom Wilma (played by Cathy O'Donnell) on the reactions he has in his hands. All these men and their families are reunited in the film. The stories of these men are intertwined beautifully. <br /> <br /> This movie really defines "classical" meaning. This unforgettable drama (winner of the best picture of 1946) is a movie that everyone should see. <br /> <br /> If I was asked to select a favorite movie, I would choose one. <br /> <br /> Of 10 I'd give "The Best Years of Life" and 11. <br /> <br /> So the next time you rent a movie, rent it for what you don't regret.
