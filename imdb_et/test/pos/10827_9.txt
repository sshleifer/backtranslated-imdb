On this surface, this is one of the classically fun action / comedy / romance movies I've been seeing for a long time, reminding me of the nice old "Saturday-afternoon" movies that had just the right balance between unexpected twists. timed humor and integrated action. Nevertheless, our knowledge of the context of this film is our knowledge. It has the same elements of "Casablanca", but it has been set just before many characters really understand the seriousness of their countries (and the world) and the consequences of their own behavior. It adds irony to humor (we realize that one female character has radically changed her hairstyle in the future). This is a movie you don't doubt.
