The people of Aardman have been kind, cute and wild in their short films about Wallace and Gromid, just like a man and his dog, inventors who seem to have more intelligence (or practicality). In this case, they have invented a machine that can capture all the bunnies that eat crops in a quiet English village. Especially for Mrs. Tottington (or "Totty" for those who are "intimate"), a lot of Victor Quartermaine's fear, who just wants to kill all the rabbits with his trust stone. Wallace and Gromit seem to be successful with their machine, but Wallace has a mix: the machine he has done to make more food suddenly baptize with a rabbit - the curse is on! <br /> <br /> A lot of this kind of heartfelt fun to ask for a child's film, but it also implies its oldest tradition in the classic Cup: Looney Tunes, which in turn owes much to the quiet comedy and vaudeville. Aardman's boys (Nick Park and Steve Box) have more material tricks and tricks. It is never less than amazing to see how they use the stopping movement, even if a joke or a gag may be a little funny "ho-ho" is not a funny "ha-ha" side (tired of criticism, but I am telling it. The curse works for the audience on all fronts so well that its relaxed story and exposition (on a standby ball is a golden bullet) is in the park and the box and the company never loses sight of the material. br /> <br /> It is fuzzy and warm-hearted and completely off children (even the youngest ones love adventures and strange gadgets such as Wallace and Gromit trucks) and adults have little funky, absurd tones in the middle of classical English farce, and only (and I'm probably here a minority opinion) compared to Chicken Run is almost a bit of a job - There is less plot than a series of running gags and of course lots of bunnies with bunnies and monsters and carnivals and cheese (and terrible men whose egos are in their arms gu Fiennes expressed Quarterman). But if it's the best, it's one of the most entertaining films of 2005. This will give me a big, cozy smile at any time.
