This 1955 film is being watched by Tony le Stephano, who has recently been released from prison because he is taking his life as a robbery. He is with his old peasants and they bring a crack to an expert in Milan, Cesar (also played by Jules Dassin, who also led. He led only because he was blacklisted in the US and could not work in Hollywood.) during 1/2 hour. During this time, there is no dialogue or music, but silenced sounds that dig through the floor or drill safe. This will increase the tension and pull you in. They get away with gemstones of several hundred million francs, but the gemstone offered to Cesar's dancer brings attention to the brutal brother of his nature. They tried to get the clips themselves and bring failure. Great hockey / gangster movie, but I prefer J.-P. Melville movies in this genre. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a lemonade that was on last night. I was going to a Caribbean restaurant and lemonade is made from sugar cane juice instead of sugar. It also had a lot of ice and the lemons were hard, leaving it quite sour (which I liked). The sugarcane juice gave it a subtle, slightly softer taste than the actual sugar and ice made it to be cold and refreshing when I suck it. 7.5 / 10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
