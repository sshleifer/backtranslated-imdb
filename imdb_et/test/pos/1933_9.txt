In 1931, "America's tragedy", the original story of "who it takes, a poor girl or a rich girl" was also presented. it was a really fun movie. Babs stanwyck was beautiful when she could be a ditto sally blane. Monroe owsley played Babs' husband. I had never heard of him, but I thought he had a good physical similarity to the "ambassador" (32) bing Crosby, even the receding hairline and ear ears. Ricardo cortez, a rich playboy with a golden heart. a real movie pioneer who goes wayyy back. The dilemma will be resolved at the end of the title strains and I believe Annette hanshaw was hit by the recording, although the screen sound was very good. I also enjoyed the dance hall scenes. I'm sure they were authentic; band, one of the leading times was great. good job, Lionel Barrymore !!!!
