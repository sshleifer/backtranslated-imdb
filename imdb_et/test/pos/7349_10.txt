Viva La Bam was one of those who showed that before I saw it, I had no higher expectations, and I never knew it until I saw my friend watching it. I thought Jackass was pretty funny, but the tricks were just like that, funny and I've never really shown. When I first looked at Viva La Bami, it was the opposite, I loved it. It had more television shows, which today have many "Reality Shows". I was hooked and I wanted to see what new scheme they were preparing for each episode. Until the last episode, it was in my interest, and although some ideas seemed to be repeated at times, there was always a newer and more funny twist. Viva La Bam is one of those exhibitions that grab you and I have not yet seen another model that is quite pleasant.
