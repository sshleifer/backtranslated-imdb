Considering that the manufacturers wanted to sell it abroad, he marks an American (late Richard Richard), but at least he is not the usual boring Hollywood hunk type. He is surrounded by a pound of British talents, headed by a wonderfully selfish and boss David Niven. <br /> <br /> Niven's terrifying Ivan will naturally get the best liners and all the best response shots. It also succeeds in being surprisingly dangerous and dangerously dangerous. The snooker club's moment when it falls on a charming facade and threatens Richard Jordan, is shocking those viewers who think Niven is just a light room. He is full of true power and mercy, as we see immediately as Ivan got his nickname. Even more surprising is how bad Niven was at that time. Shortly after filming this film, he lost his speech on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (known as Lou Gehrig's disease). This is the last picture Niven did when you hear his own voice, dubbed by comic impressionist Sid Caesar. <br /> <br /> Next to him are numerous familiar faces of seventies cinema and television.

Ideal for midnight after pub closure; if you have a certain age, you feel nostalgic and you always wanted to see David Niven's McDonalds branch, screaming quietly with the American retractable telescope!
