Wonderful little output. The method of filming is very scarce - a very old time on BBC fashion and gives comfort and sometimes inconvenience to reality throughout the piece. <br /> <br /> The actors are very well chosen - Michael Sheen not only has "got all the polar" but also has all the voices. You can really see that seamless editing of Williams' diary descriptions is not only worthwhile, but it is an amazingly written and accomplished piece. Mastery of a comedy from a great captain and his life. The rule really comes true with little things: the guardian fantasy that stays in place of traditional "dreams" techniques disappears. It plays our knowledge and senses, especially the scenarios that concern Orton and Halliwell and the set (especially their apartment with the Halliwell mural that adorns every surface) is very well done.
