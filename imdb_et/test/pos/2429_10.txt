It was apparently watching this TV movie that I was interested in discussing whether "Anna" was really Anastasia, the daughter of Tsar Nicholas. As you can see, I've made some documentaries to watch and also bought a book. Despite the evidence that has been discovered after the release of the film, I sometimes think he was. This is Amy Irving's power to act in this 2-party, which is somewhat liberal compared to historical facts, but packed to the brim, with teardrop drama and Irving's utterly convincing performance. <br /> <br /> I am not consciously aware of this Irving before, although I have to see her without understanding it in Carrie (another favorite movie). In "Anasasia", I never felt at one point that "it's just a movie". For me, this woman was Anastasia, and when the first part ended with a railway wagon where members of the royal family met, I knew it was hell or high water that I had to see in the second part. I just wanted to see how he proves he was the one he claims to be, and when the story progressed, I felt intense hatred against the character of Rex Harrison, although I admired him as an actor. <br /> <br /> When I saw the movie again in the TV guide, I convinced my mother that we should look at it, and later thanked me for being almost as keen as watching Part 2. this can be fully recommended. "Anastasia" is one of those rare TV movies that you just have to look at, how to enjoy the best shows on television, and it doesn't really matter whether you believe the legend or not.
