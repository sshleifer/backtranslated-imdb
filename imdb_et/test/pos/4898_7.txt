There are two ways to make TV shows a movie. <br /> <br /> The first, most common and least successful, is basically making a full-length television show - see Steptoe & Son's Disaster Movie. The other is to do something else - something quite different, Ã  la Monty Python. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the creators of the cult TV series have made a second choice and they have come up with something unique, smart and funny - it didn't feel less than a TV episode. <br /> <br /> Try your head around it - writers who play with themselves are facing the Royston Vasey alter-egos who played, of course, by them and said to continue writing the series, otherwise the village will be an apocalypse. <br /> <br /> High concept, natural and easy to turn? Yes, but somehow they managed to pull it out. Maybe not for every taste, and the end does not slump, but fans are joyful and can even win over the uninitiated.
