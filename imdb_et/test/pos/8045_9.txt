This movie really proves that the world is too often an unfair place, especially the world of films. "Task" barely got attention when it was released and was not surprisingly flocked, but when history is written, this film will definitely get lost in praise. <br /> <br /> Thank you God! m surrounded by friends who know what's good for me. Being a movie guy like myself, he highly recommended "The Assignment" - a movie I didn't even hear. I decided to check what Leonard Maltin gave, and it is not surprising that he gave it ** 1/2. Knowing that this is the same grade, he gave classics like "Alien", "The Usual Suspects" and "The Matrix" (I'm not your child). So without hesitation I went out and bought it on a DVD. It was about 3 years ago and the film is still one of my most proud items in my DVD collection, despite the cover design that reflects Casper Van Dien with a small budget stinker. <br /> <br /> "Task" is professionally focused on providing truly intense moments that keep you around the film at the edge of your seat; He is one of the best performers of Aidani Quinn and serves him well by Donald Sutherland and Ben Kingsley, both of whom are in great shape. <br /> <br /> Of the 42 42 user comments, like this movie, most of them are unable to praise it quite well. What are you waiting for? If you call yourself a fan of action contestants, you should have bought it, rented it, see it HIGH!
