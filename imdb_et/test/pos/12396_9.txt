The recent French study of the 50s on deprived young people (in the early 20s, actually "growing up" but not yet living in the adult world) apparently missed a milestone beyond the exact depiction of the 1958 French youth (Don't do almost all the adult films made by adults to do it? Those who can't - River's Edge comes to mind - are really rare), but Mar En Carne, the director of Les Enfants du Paradise, is too accurate to observe the nature of these characters. . In some ways, the details are not important - you could change the details and set the film today, and it would work just as well - but loneliness and insecurity and superficial passion and the anger of the characters are doing well. Young Pierre Brice and Jean-Paul Belmondo play a supporting role, but lead Jacques Charrier, Laurent Terzieff, Pascale Petit and Andrea Parisy play routinely and deeply. There is also a fine jazz score that you can get from CD JAZZ IN PARIS - JAZZ & CINEMA VOL. 2. Unlike the films that have commented on the film, I really don't see Director Carne, who is sitting down on their characters - he seems to be an objective observer for me. Of course, these middle-class characters may seem like people who are spoiled and have nothing to attract a movie to some classical viewer, and I think Carne is definitely aware of it. For this American viewer (I looked dubbed, quite literally, called THE CHEATERS), the film is an interesting window for France in the 1950s. He is also deliberately poetic (a scene that saves a cat, there is only one example of this) and this charming way has intellectual aspirations that only French films can escape - I can imagine a melodramatic, low-handed way of handling this material with America studio production, sensational, moral, and suggestive ways in which this material should have been handled by American management / exploitation filmmakers. I think Marcel Carne has taken the subject of graduation from high school for the period and when, in the early 1930s, people are largely routine, no matter what the routine may be. Those who are willing to look at the film with open mind and not to come up with many simple targets should find a serious and valuable study of people in the early twenties. And even if you don't want to do this, you can go to another room when the movie is playing, and just enjoy the fine soundtrack, the superb 50's jazz and instrumental pop, including the American "Jazz at Philharmonic" group, including Coleman Hawkins, Dizzy Gillespie, Stan Getz (credit written by "goetz"), Roy Eldridge and Ray Brown.
