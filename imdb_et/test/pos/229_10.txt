One evening, I listened to a radiotelephone and had the Leslie Nielsen program. He explained why there were only six examples. "<br /> <br /> With TV shows like MASH, you can go to the fridge to get a beer and as long as you hear what's going on, there was nothing left. Who could forget "... part of the city known as" Little Italy "..." with a colossal background. <br /> <br /> Even the movies were largely based on sightings, but then again in the theater you imprisoned the audience. <br /> <br /> Leslie also said that the show, movies and other movies like the plane were funny because they didn't try to say what was funny. Well, it's just my 2 cents.
