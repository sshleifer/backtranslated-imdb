I was looking for this movie after I read Tom Clancy's "Red Storm Rising" novel. A timeless masterpiece by some 13th-century Russians invading Germans. The film was made in 1938 under the orders of Joseph Stalin to warn the Soviet countries of Hitler and Germany. Battle scenes are wonderfully done, showing that you don't need a larger fighting image to make computer animation. Probably Sergei Eisenstein's biggest job. See also "Navy Potemkin". This movie should be viewed as the main buffer of any history buffer or policy. 10 out of 10
