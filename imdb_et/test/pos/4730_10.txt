After reading this documentary I rented it and watched it with my teenage children. It was amazingly well balanced, showing the perspective of both sides and leaving many questions unanswered. It should be so. I don't watch a documentary to say what to think about. I look at it for learning and making my own conclusions. It was a strong lesson for yourself. And it drove home the basic honesty behind "Waco: The engagement rules". If you just open your eyes and watch, the facts can speak for themselves.
