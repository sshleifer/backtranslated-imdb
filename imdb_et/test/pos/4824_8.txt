I saw some of this movie on the Sci-Fi channel, but it ended. I bought a DVD to see the whole movie, and I'm glad I did. <br /> <br /> A young mother and her two daughters are moving to the house that came from a husband who inherited her husband. died of the disease. It's very slow, but three women do the best. Teen's daughter (Scout Taylor-Compton) warns the local boy about zombies coming out at night. He ignores him, but because he has a sweet friend, he joins his group. Meanwhile, the younger daughter (Chloe Grace Moretz) makes her friend's zombie girl named Mary. It turns out that Mary and several other children died in a mine in 1913 when they worked as a child labor. Now that they are zombies, they attack and kill someone who is not a blood relative. <br /> <br /> The film was directed by J.S. Cardone, whose previous films include The Slayer (1981) and Shadowzone (1990), are the two films that I didn't like the least. That's why I was surprised that I really enjoyed this movie. The film is deliberately the pace I liked. This will allow you to get to know the main characters most of you like. Child Zombies have been used at least since George Romero's 1968 classic night of living dead. Nonetheless, I found the zombies of a child using this film's interesting tool. It seems that Cardone finally found the right script and poured it. The only stereotypical scenes of teenagers smoking, drinking and parked in the car were boring for me. <br /> <br /> Taylor-Compton will also release a remake of Halloween. Moretz appeared in The Amityville Horror (2005) and in Horror Film Room 6 (2006).
