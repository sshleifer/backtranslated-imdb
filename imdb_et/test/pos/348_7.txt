What exactly do people expect when they watch Al Adamson's movie? Do they expect a classic cinema that is wonderful and leaves them with permanent memories? For some reviews, you think this. Al Adamson's films are unpleasant and sloppy and cheesy, not much more, so if you go to them knowing that it already helps, and they don't necessarily have to be nominal, especially if they have so much inadvertent entertainment value. First of all, it starts with the ending of the theme music from Outer Limits, so you know things are promising. This is the story of some of the wacko cult living in the mountains and trying to lift the body, suffering from a heart attack and reaching the hospital. Of course, her sister Sherri tends to meet her needs and everyone, and when surgery is needed she just hangs in the operating room when the man goes on, so his spirit penetrates him. And the sister Sherri will change. No longer is a beautiful sister, she develops blood and sharp objects. There are a couple of small stories that go like people trying to burn a dead cultural figure and a blinded football star that has become one of Sherri's co-workers' love object, which is just a voodoo. It's not bad if you're a fan of the film, but it can be bad if you're a fan of Spiderman because you don't like it. Sometimes it actually comes up to "respectability" (in any case for Adamson), but then "unredeems: yourself with some ridiculous events. If you like Adamson movies and similar bins, then someone else who can look for lost treasure can hold the digging.
