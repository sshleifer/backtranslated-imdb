"Big Fat Liar" is welcome - low but welcome - breathing fresh air after too many movies with bathrooms, body fluids, pets in acidic gaseous jokes and crutches. After all, "Watch Spot Run", "Max Keeble Big Move" and "Snow Dogs" were noticed in a degenerative spiral of Kiddie Movie-making. What's even worse is that young audiences are later saturated with "Not yet a teenage movie" and "slackers". The writers of Nickelodeon, Dan Schneider and Brian Robbins (who collectively celebrated the 80s sitcom "Classic Captain"), starred Frankie Muniz as a Jason, always scratching off with a good lie. (Where is English paper? Dad pulled the Swedish meatballs.) His teacher (Sandra Oh) issues an ultimatum: Turn off the paper at the end of the day or take a summer school. Jason throws out a story called "Big Fat Liar" and hits the school with a limousine that carries the unknown Hollywood producer Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti). Wolf gives him a ride, but Jason leaves his paper behind. Nobody listens to the truth this time and his father tells him he has lost his trust. <br /> <br /> A month later, Jason and best friend Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) see a movie "Big Fat Liar" preview and head to Los Angeles to destroy Wolf's life - all to testify that he stole Jason's paper to make a movie. They even experience some of Wolf's abusive workers, including his assistant (Amanda Detmer), former driver (Donald Faison), movie stars (Jale's "Urkel" White, playing himself), and a stunt coordinator (outdated Lee Majors) <br /> <br /> Mrs. "Big Fat Liar" is on the edge that his sitcom "Malcolm in the Middle" is known, Muniz is easy to root, but he does not have much work to do. Like Bynes, who is titling his Tracey Ullman-like sketch of Nickelodeon. The whole hamminess is given to Giamatti, whose eyes collide and the cheeks ignite. <br /> <br /> The film simply clicks on the highway and should be enjoyed by the target audience (especially since most major bellows appear in the Universal Studios party). But here's one head-scraper: The message is that it's worth talking about the truth. But did we just not see how Jason reaches his profitability by saying that the film is all over the white? Well, at least there is no poop.
