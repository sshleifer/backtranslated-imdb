During my 13-year school education, I was in kindergarten through high school, but one day when my class won a trip. When I went to school, you went to school, from 8.30 am to 3.30 pm and no travel was made. But for some reason, at this higher age, I couldn't recall that we went to watch the film - National Velvet. I don't remember the movie, so I decided to review it on the eve of his 57th year. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that speaks of a time that no longer exists. The time people trusted others and didn't lock their house. The time when people were suspected. It was a time when the family was the most important thing. This movie shows it all and more. It shows love and trust and caring and the goodness of people. <br /> <br /> It wouldn't be bad for every family to watch this movie once and discuss its message. <br /> <br /> It was a treatment to see the younger Elizabeth Taylor, Mickey Rooney on her best, the Academy's award-winning Anne Revere, Angela Lansbury before the murder, she wrote and Donald Crisp, who performed for almost 60 years. /> <br /> What movie!
