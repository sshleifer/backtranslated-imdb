Dan Finnerty and Dan Band are both -o-o-o-o-o good, they have to be seen in faith. Does anyone have a copy of the Bravo concert there for sale? Please, if you have a release, we all know. I checked the Bravo site, but in the future there is no plan for repeated performances for the most pleasant choreographers, Dan Band. What a great energy it glows, strikes a lovely American-boy attitude based on the sensitivity of the meat, packed in sequins and tears, making men and women alike. I hope that enough people can influence Bravo's credentials to bring the exhibition back to our life, half a year.
