I saw this movie for the first time last night. I've been thinking about it all night and this morning. I can't say it was my favorite movie, at least not yet. I have to see it again. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is stunning. Every bullet has lyricism that could be expected in a movie with the name of Wim Wenders. <br /> <br /> There is always a temptation to see de Chirico in every picture that has ranks of lost commandments, but in this case the analogy is appropriate. In many ways, Ferarra's mist and wind talk through the shape of Malkovich in the main works of an Italian-Greek painter in the shadow of canvas painted in Milan. He is a bit of a threatening presence, who looks and publishes the whole story as a film director. <br /> <br /> A special Wenders fan can't help but think a bit about Damiel and Cassiel, who get lost on the streets of Berlin, looking at everyone, but not directly with the people. And after Himmel Uber's Berlin metaphor, an angel (or, in this case, director Malkovich) can communicate with one story. <br /> <br /> Here I have to take this criticism too far. I have to watch the movie again. I'm pretty sure it's a thread that brings Malkovich's monologue together. <br /> <br /> Maybe his music and pontifications are pretentious, empty dialogues that sound good but can't be communicated. Maybe it's the whole idea. No one can do this judgment with any degree of certainty or authority before doing his homework. <br /> <br /> We must be careful when we throw the word "pretentious" around. The mind that smells of intelligence is easy to write as biases, but it leads to a terrible mental state where the only conversation that is considered authentic, earthly or authentic is the most banal. If we lose all philosophy, God, existence, meaning and all that brain candy, discussions, then we set our culture to die of slow, stupid and ugly death. Perhaps this is a warning that Wenders and Antonioni are giving us. Surely this is not the only subject of the film, but I think it cannot be ignored. <br /> <br /> Another (and most obvious) leitmotif is satisfaction. There is a lot here, and a thorough review of all the nuances and consequences of developing this leotard would exceed the 1000 word limit of this review. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is to see the movie. But I offer a warning: this is not an independent film (at least I don't believe it yet). Some movies interact with the intellectual and artistic thinking of their time so much that the viewer must be in the background of the Zeitge before approaching the film. Par-dela les nuages ​​is one of those movies.
