So this is not the winner of the prize, what then? Have you ever wanted to see a movie that was just silly? "The Villain" and it could be typed. My husband says "Jekyll and Hyde Together Again" is one of those films that, when "you've been there and done", you think this 80's cocaine fraud culture is a rebellion. I think the whole movie is just fun. Nothing is holy; Hospitals, Plastic Surgery, Howard Hughes .... It is underway that you should monitor to evaluate it. To say that a movie does not follow the book, it would be true, but then really a lot of really good movies will be freed by the published word. I recommend this movie to all of our old "stoners". We can be smarter now, but we still know and laugh at the many people we knew back in time.
