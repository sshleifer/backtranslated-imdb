I agree with the messages presented here that the book is not like a film. I read the book Sumter SC as a high school high school. I immediately loved the book and was looking forward to the mini-series release. As much as I liked the film and thought it was very well done, I was disappointed that the film didn't follow the book. I was pleased that Orry was not killed as he was in love and war or N&S II. <br /> <br /> Having grown up in SC and graduating from SC University, I fell in love with Southern history. mini series and book. I was honored to meet John Jakes at the US Symposium in 1988. I stayed after that and met with Mr.Jake. Unfortunately, I couldn't ask him. But meeting him was honored. I was studying in accounting, but I got to my minor in the south. In addition, I patterned a lot for Orgon Main. Orry and I are very similar. I feel like I was born 150 years too late. I am a southern gentleman and very proud of it. <br /> <br /> Well, I fell in love with two women in the movie .... Genie Francis and Wendy Kilbourne. Did I have a hots for Wendy !!!! I was never able to find the real version. I hope one day !!!
