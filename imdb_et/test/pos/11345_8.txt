In Hong Kong in 1962, Chow Mo-wani (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) and his wife and secretary, Su Li-Zhen Chan (Maggie Cheung) and his wife, moved to the old building at the same time. Every couple is rented in one-floor apartments. Their husband and husband stay away from most of the time most of the time and Chow and Li-Zhen have the same habits: they love kung-fu stories and noodles and soap near the building. Their close contact becomes friendship and sort of platonic and repressed love. Later, they realize that their husbands have an affair, Chow falls in love with Li-Zhen, but his shyness and the likelihood of a married woman stand still on a platonic level. "Love in Love" is a very slow, beautiful, melancholic and romantic love story that has excellent photography and soundtrack and a very unusual edition. The film had no scenario, and the actors were never sure what to shoot. Later, the director changed his story based on film material. When Chow goes to Singapore, it is a story until 1966, when it was deliberately open and not well defined, leaving issues like a boy with Li-Zhen. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Amor Ã€ Flor da Pele" ("Love on Skin")
