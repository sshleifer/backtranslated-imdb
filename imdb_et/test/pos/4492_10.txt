Examining Susan Harrison (The Ballerina), referring to the Bonanza episode, I was reminded of this jewel. <br /> <br /> This episode is an inspiration to Dylan's "All along the Watch Tower" (Hendrix's cover is probably so well known and one of his best), one of his best. <br /> <br /> So this episode is responsible for a number of "bests" - not about 22 minutes on television. <br /> <br But this is "Twilight Zone". No additional series comment is required. <br /> <br /> '5 characters' is typical of Serling. Intense, dramatic, facing an end that is as inevitable afterwards, as it is surprising when you see it for the first time. <br /> <br /> This episode is spoiled by one sentence and is too good to spoil anyone who has not seen it. <br /> <br /> But you feel offensive. And you never listen to Hendrix with the same ear.
