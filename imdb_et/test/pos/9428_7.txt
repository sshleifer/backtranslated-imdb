In the name of propaganda during World War II, Sherlock Holmes moved to the present. One of the results is Sherlock Holmes and the secret weapon, starring Holmes, Basil Rathbone, Nigel Bruce, Lionel Atwill, Dennis Hoey, and Kaaren Verne. Holmes's job is to give the British Government a scientist, Mrs. Franz Tobel (William Post Jr.) and his arms design before the Germans can get him. When a man arrives in England, his worries are just beginning. Can Holmes decode the release of Dr. Tobel before he gets into the witch Moriarity, saving the weapon and also the scientist? It is an effective Holmes story, located in the Swiss atmosphere and in England. The series worked well today. It was not without problems, but these problems had nothing to do with the time period. Whose idea was to make Watson an idiot? Nigel Bruce's characterization, supported and supported by scripts, has always been the wrong comment. I prefer much of Edward Hardwicke's characterization in the Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes series - he is an attractive, intelligent and plausible companion to Holmes. In the Rathbone series, Holmes has often forced and treats Watson as a foolish fool that he is. But in this particular film, Watson has the opportunity to be partially useful in many ways. <br /> <br /> I testify that I am from Rathbone's presentation of Richard II - "... this blessed plot, this land, this England" - I can't imagine how much it meant in 1913 watching the movie. Sherlock Holmes was really his goal.
