Continuing an exclusive film program on complex relationships in some European courts, the film "Anna Boleyn", directed by Herr Ernst Lubitsch, the director of the ambassadors' film, was shown last night at the Schlos Theater. The film depicts the terrible story of Queen Henry VIII of the British King. He was executed by his wife (well, not exactly, the king ordered the prisoners to do their dirty work), not to mention that this marriage led to a major political and religious historical event, the English Reformation. <br /> <br /> The movie stars Dame Henny Porten, Germany's first screen superstar in these early years and Herr Emil Jannings, Germany's quietest actor in this quiet timing. Both play their characters in an appropriate way; Dame Porten is an innocent aristocrat who is gradually interested in the power the court offers him and Herr Jannings, a disgraceful, vivid and feminine British monarch, for the German actor who moves appropriately, taking into account the surprise and excessive personality character of himself. <br /> <br /> In the early film period, Herr Lubitsch was known for his remarkable costume films, big-budget grand productions ("Anna Boleyn" paid about 8 million marks, treasure even for this German account) taking care of the magnificent d√©cor that can be seen on the Westminster Abbey scene during the coronation process, with the use of 4,000 extra (used by the Germans used at that time, causing revolutionary workers to create fear when German President Friedrich Ebert visited it during the film) <br /> <br /> See what is this and every Herr Lubitschi One of the most important aspects of the film, even during its epic period, is the complex relationship between the main characters. We experience different interests, double meanings and complicated flirting art, but what is first treated lightly in the tragedy. The importance of these historical facts has been proven to be effective, but Lubitsch is really more interested in the change between Henry VIII and Anna Boleyni. <br /> <br /> And now, if you allow me, you must temporarily take your vacation, because this German Count must take care that one of his fat and rich heirs will not lose his German aristocrat with his head.
