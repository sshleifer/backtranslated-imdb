This is one particular short Stooge that actually uses satire with a slapstick. As mentioned, this short title and concept was "borrowed" from the feature film Clark Gable "Men In White" of the same year. Basically, they are the trials and tribulations of the trainees and their sacred cause of "court and humanity". I saw it recently and treat it almost like the Stooge version because it takes itself a little too seriously. In any case, "Men In Black" is so well written, directed and not original, it did not borrow from Chaplin or any other thing that Motion Picture Academy named the 1934 comedy in the best short time for this award. Some of the stinking short names "La Cucaracha" were nevertheless over and stole the prize. Some of the manufacturer's rights must be in the Academy Electoral Council. "Men in black" entertain the entire medical practitioner concept much like Marx Bros. There may not be a fair comparison, but I see Marx Bros in this short. In fact, in their function "Day Competitions" there is a scene where "medical things" occur and they cause anarchy as usual. I think this particular brevity was judged by these directions and therefore because it was first established. Try it really: look at it briefly first, and then look at "Duck Soup" or "Day at the Races" with Marxes and then see if there is just as much comedy quality.
