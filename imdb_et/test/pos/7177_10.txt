In 1968, when "SYMBIOPSYCHOTAXIPLASM: Take One" appeared, it came out somewhere and hit like a psychedelic thunderstorm. Afro-American actor and filmmaker William Greaves tried to change the style of the documentary "news reel" forever and has never been so far. The film is a film about "making a movie" and deliberately written and directed to create as many contradictions and contradictions as possible. Activities and lack of dialogue in the New York Central Park concern a couple fighting and intimidating homosexuality and abortion. A woman wants a relationship and a man wants an explanation. At the end of this communication, the drunken homeless man interrupts the procedure and offers his comments and personal feedback. Then, after recording the basic material, the film crew adds their views to the filmmaker, and what they feel is their wrong behavior. Throughout the film, different cameras are used to record the action in the scene, and foreign comments are cast by team and spectators. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone interested in Avant Garde filmmakers like Andy Warhol, John Cassavetes or Jim Jarmusch. William Greaves tries to show that things cannot really be traced and understood because viewing itself changes reality. "SYMBIOPSYCHOTAXIPLASM: Take One" can be seen as a cinematic representation or application of the principle of uncertainty. This is just one possible explanation and Greave's true intention is certainly open to speculation. Above all, this film tries to confuse. and stimulate and undoubtedly succeed perfectly.
