Three Stooges have always been some of the many actors I loved. I love almost all of the short they've done. I love all six Stooges (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curly Joe)! All shorts are fun and also celebrate many other great actors and actors, many of whom were in many shorts! In my opinion, The Three Stooges is one of the biggest participants who has ever been and is always a more comedy team! <br /> <br /> One of my favorite Stooges short shorts with Shemp is none other than Brideless Groom! All these short are Dee Green, beautiful Christine McIntyre, Doris Houck, Alyn Lockwood, Johnny Kascier, Nancy Saunders and Emil Sitka. Green and McIntyre offer great shows here! There are so many funny parts here. This is a very fun short. There are another three similar Stooges that are short, like Husbands Beware, and I recommend both!
