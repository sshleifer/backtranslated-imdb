This production remnant of the production codes and Hays Office Days is fun, not big, but fun. <br /> <br /> Based on Rogers & Hart's song, which was a huge hit in time, the ballroom girl Barbara revolves around Stanwycki, a rich romantic businessman Ricardo Cortez (who was vaguely beautiful), but whose heart belongs to her book Monroe Owsley . He and Owsley marry, but keep it secret while he fires Cortez, who still has hope. He helps hubby get a job in Cortez, but married salvation quickly becomes sour when Owsley develops a high life and enters college college and plays in a high-profile bridge (Yup! ..). Eventually, he lost $ 5,000 from Cortez and went to bed when his dedicated wife went to Cortez .... and I didn't discover anything else, though the end was definitely a surprise. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is the best thing about this movie; one of his previous roles he has completely accomplished. Owsley is a weak spot; She is unpleasant and slippery while Cortez is amazingly vibrant and sexy, while her performance is serious but remarkable. badly. But there are many good spiritual traits; at one point Stanwyck tells Cortez, "My brain is in my feet when yours is." There are a lot of nervous and suggestive things in this flick, the last few days before the code is clinging and everything is stuck. Funny antiques, a good reminder of how far we have not reached 70 years .... this story is very easy to change to fit in 2003.
