This strange and hypnotic drama by Don Siegel / Clint Eastwood was abandoned in 1971 and harmed. An amazing character study with some big women dealing with Squint. Geraldine Page was one of our highest actors and she is completely cast. Young Jo Ann Harris is flirty minx and Elizabeth Hartman (who died too young) is undoubtedly repressed. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10. The best result is C. Eastwood. In the same year as DIRTY HARRY, it did not give a good overview. Check with this unless you are only in "Explosion" movies. Very fine and scary, this piece will stay with you.
