Rickman is sexy and good, but "stranger" is less convincing - Friday is a kind of sexy, but he is not a consistent actor - it may be the driver's guilt in this matter - we should find him an attractive extreme because he is "beautiful" - but it is not enough. A corrupted woman is almost convincing - a 7-year-old marriage and her and Rickman's character should be more solved with each other, whether their roles have to be incompatible or not - they must have a pattern. i get that though i think a woman has a bit of rigidity in her role - and doesn't persuade convincingly a "stranger" - so it's failed - tying up the cast of Rickman's character and "stranger" is better, even if we are not sure what is this. I miss Rickman's sexy English accent (luckily he slips into it and out of the American pattern). disappointing but with some excellent examples.
