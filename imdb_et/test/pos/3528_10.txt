It was a great 1981 movie with a great story about three men and two girls who go on a camping trip and go through thick forests and high mountains with great water. This group of people got into the ownership of George Kennedy (Roy McLean), who plays his role as a forest keeper and rides on a white horse. Roy McLean warns those youngsters that where they go, there is no room for camping and they should return. Of course, these young people do not pay attention and continue to nail the water near the water, playing great music and dancing under fire and having plenty of beer and wine. There's an old wooden one-room schoolhouse that pulls the gals and boys in and since then the movie is very scary. There is a time when a young girl has to climb a tree to get away from a human beast who wants her body and starts cutting down a tree to hit her. Don't miss this movie, it's all a lot.
