If I were allowed to watch only one program in my life, I would definitely need to choose "The Chaser War for Everything". Of all the satirical examples on Australian television, I found Chaser the most fun. It's just so amazing that boys aren't afraid to do anything. <br /> <br /> Whether it's a dress up as Hitler to get into a Polish club, or push a MASSIVE ball string around Melbourne to try a tourist ad or a stone to a coke factory in a naked bath with $ 2.40 to buy water. Chasser's guys go there. <br /> <br /> By agreeing to the above comments (and / or below), "Chaser War" is more popular than their previous "CNNNN" program. But CNNNN was just as funny. Some unforgettable moments from this show ... Clean up Cambodia !!! So anyway, to stop me from Ranting, I urge you at least to give Chaser the chance to find more than likely HILARIOUS !!!!
