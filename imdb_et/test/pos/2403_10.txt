"Next Karate Kid" is a great movie full of adventures and new surprises. It has a great plot of land and morale that tells a wonderful story. Hilary Swank does an incredible job of achieving Julie's role. I've seen an actor playing Mr Miageet and I think it's one of his best performances. The film is funny and charming, and I can't emphasize how interesting the film is. I really took this movie out of 10 out of 10. I offer a movie to anyone who loves a good movie.
