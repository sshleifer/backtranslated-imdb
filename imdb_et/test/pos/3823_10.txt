When the new external borders began, these episodes were rather optimistic and complex. As the series began to fall, most of the episodes simply turned ugly and had no entertaining value. The six episodes here reflect the best and worst in the series. <br /> <br /> Because External Borders always preach moral. I would like to offer my own. Starting from the most pleasing flops. <br /> <br /> 1. Afterlife: The US-based military industrial complex, as an institution, is both bad and paranoid, not to mention the usual fool. People of great honesty serve our country and they follow their conscience even at amazing prices! Finally, foreigners do not have to say the word. Those who have no conscience are fools who are completely disdainful! <br /> <br /> Truly subversive episode! One that should be shown for the first time on television for everyone! It may be a revelation to some, but people without conscience should not serve in our army! Also, decisions do not justify goals! <br /> <br /> 2. Theory of Relativity: A good person can be forced to make a split second decision between good or evil in order to save the lives of vulnerable intelligent beings and at high expense. It makes this decision even more complicated - it is a great choice: with exotic aliens with strangers whom you cannot communicate with, except through gestures, or with a group of people who think you are not keeping up with unknown threats, even if they are merciless and without compassion! <br /> <br /> This episode is great! What heats this disdain is good old-fashioned greed. This episode is one of the accusations of capitalism, transnational corporations and rape that I have seen in my lifetime! Unlike real life, right here is right - and fast! <br /> <br /> One of the most memorable features is how the ruthless corporate thug said something, "We did the same thing in the Amazon rainforest." It also includes the killing of the Amazon Indians who tried to protect their rainforests from mining to justify killing again in the literal sense of "the best for the survival". Something Darwin never meant literally! <br /> <br /> 3. The Alien Shop: The tremendous amount of power you can use from exotic strangers. This power can be used instead of destruction. Only mortals can learn from their mistakes! Even the offender sees the light when he is given enough opportunities. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it takes strong medicine, but we can all wake up and change our destructive ways! <br /> <br /> 4. Grell: An alien may be a similar figure to Christ! In the distant future, slavery can again be justified for the sake of expediency. In principle, good people can ruin. Sometimes a person has to experience a great shame to see what he is doing. Children are closer to the truth than adults. People with political power have tremendous responsibility! Another genius! As a category: "Do people learn from history?" <br /> <br /> Flop Number 1: Mercy Quality: Loose Lips, Sinks Ships! When war is warfare, hold your mouth with important military plans. Gee, did I really need an hour-long soap opera to figure it out? I don't know if the external border makers ran out of ideas or pulled the plug out of the company? Dark and ugly, serve no purpose but despair! <br /> <br /> Flop number 2: Over the veil: So bad is moral, but: If the mental hospital is locked, please use some common sense! This episode is so bad that nasty. What is Hanging X Files! Don't waste your time in this! Thank you later! <br /> <br /> It is a sad comment that the External Borders fell towards the end of their ride. Subversive episodes, like the first four, could not stay forever! It was a miracle they did at all! Hopefully, one day, the other brave souls will follow the tradition of the submerging Outer Limits into the renewing territory! <br /> <br /> If you have such a bold person, it is a good place to start with one unique book: "Wonder's Anatomy: A Critical Guide to Scientific Literature", edited by Neil Barron! As for me, the most comprehensive book ever written on this subject.
