Haruhi Suzumiya melancholy is an anime that made me feel pretty impressed. Part of the characters, many of whom get into the anime fantasy / sci-fi stereotypes, but placing these stereotypes in a pretty everyday environment in high school is what I appreciated. Then there are somewhat crazy characters who are something else: a high, almost immoral, a girl with ridiculous talents and a secret she is unaware of. <br /> <br /> Setting up a series is a bit of a thought. Basically, Suzumiya, who is not known to herself, is a kind of superpower, capable of creating and destroying godly races, because she can destroy the reality of her whim. Our narrator and primary character is the high school of Kyon, whose sympathy / curiosity for Haruh seems to cause him to drag him against his will to the club where he starts to revive his life because he is a bored ordinary life. Looking for an adventure, he claims three more extraordinary members, both of which are secrets, and they all fall into his crazy schemes. <br /> <br /> It's a little crazy, but enjoyable, philosophical consideration early on when we discuss whether the world is just Haruh's creation, when he gets old and old, and whether our characters exist to serve him or to serve him to continue to exist or can they exist without him. It's a bit of a mess, but an enjoyable one. Although the series occasionally includes sci-fi / fantasy scenarios, I think that the joy of the series lies in the fact that normal things are, but that the tension knows that if things are too boring, Haruh's world can be destroyed by making it more interesting in hope. <br /> <br /> Art is pure and consistent with what I have been waiting for anime that is usually imported into the US; I like character designs and although there are not many activities in the series, I think it's better. The series is narrated by Kyoni's mind, and he does not play an all-knowing narrator, but only comments on what he knows and knows. He's running a lot with his head, but he doesn't really talk much, so it's good that we hear it. <br /> <br /> The English dub voice is enough, but I prefer Japanese over it. There are some strange aspects to the series, some of which are parodies as well as fanboy businesses, which I found fun. For the first season I have to admit that the closure is incomplete because the series doesn't really have a bigger story, but it seems that you are taking things at once, so it's a lightweight series that can be picked up and put down, though I think it's quite fun Due to its properties, it is still quite difficult to put down. It is also based on light novels and the author was directly involved in writing the series. <br /> <br /> Although it is based on novels, I still want the series to have more powerful arches, but I love how, of course, we see these characters evolving and how well the series can play both quiet moments and worse. Haruh's growth was quite affectionate, but also looking at the relationship between SOS Brigade (Haruhi Club). <br /> <br /> It is not meant for everyone, because it is your entertainment premise and "ordinary creatures" in the secular world. "It probably won't let fanboys in action / sci-fi / fantasy and be relatively oriented to drama enthusiasts too small, but for those who are willing to try something else, or a strangely peculiar series like that, I think Haruhi Suzumiya's melancholy is quite a refreshingly unique and enjoyable series.
