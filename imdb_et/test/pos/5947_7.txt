Pink Panther, Naked Gun or Get Smart fans enjoy this farce that won one César and was still nominated for four. <br /> <br /> Jean Dujardin is the agent of OSS 117, a man who doesn't know the hint when he hits him. It also reflects a colonial attitude towards the West. <br /> <br /> All Russian spies around him, Nazis and Muslim radicals are stupid, but Barmén (Beérice Bejo) and Princess (Aure Atika) to keep things interesting. <br /> <br /> OSS 117 is a stranger to take languages, play musical instruments as he takes them for the first time, and sing like a local, all more impressive than Bond's tricks, but he's still stupid.
