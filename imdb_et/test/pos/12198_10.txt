The surface is one of the largest t.v. the series I've seen. Action is great and the story is amazing. Every episode was hardly waiting for me to come next. Especially I thought Carter Jenkins, who played Miles Bennett, did a great job ... he is a very talented actor and I look forward to working harder. <br /> <br /> I can't believe Surface made just one season ... again the public has shot me down. It is hard to see that such large exhibitions have been canceled while the devil's reality shows year after year. Who made the decision to cancel the show pulled this ball down.
