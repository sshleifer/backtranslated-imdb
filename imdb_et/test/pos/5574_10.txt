After using this movie for two years, I finally signed up for IMDB so I could give Farscape "10." The writers of the exhibition, cast and the team, have proven themselves as unequivocal masters of the genre of science. Even those who do not usually rate sci-fi should be encouraged to give this extraordinary series a chance! <br /> <br /> Farscape's virtues are just too big to list them, but one of them stands out first; the quality of writing is amazing. I have not heard a dialogue about this "Blake 7". In fact, Farscape knows a lot like "Blake 7", which has good special effects and a little more romance. <br /> <br /> Everyone, enjoy!
