The short film, received by the film card Gaspar Noe, introducing us to our terrible but thoroughly interesting note "Butcher", which Phillipe Nahon played perfectly. The direction of Noe here is all the features of his later films, showing that he had carved his voice and style from the beginning. His sudden cut, with harsh, loud noises, skipping and many other techniques, is meant to distract the viewer. And it certainly works. He is also not afraid of showing violence because irreversible viewers know. Here the violence is equally powerful and the queue at Seul Contre Tous is almost unbearable. <br /> <br /> The movie opens with a horse killing. It strikes the head and looks at it on the floor, its blood flow flowing out. Then we see the human birth with the bloody glory of The Butcher's daughter. He was orphaned in World War II and grew up in hatred of the world and everyone in it. He serves his clients, but his inner monologue reminds us of his thoughts - he wants them all dead. His daughter Blandine Lenoir, who repeated his role six years later, is the only thing he cares about, and we look at them together as we get older. However, he is silent and bullying and toying the toll. Butcher's relationship with him is almost bleeding, bathing, if he's old enough to do it himself, etc., but it's being studied more in the next movie. When a man attacks him, the butcher explodes with rage, eating an innocent man in his mouth. She goes to jail, which is the only thing she wants - her store and her daughter. In a short 40 minutes, we see it all and more, his time in jail and release to his world. Because of my daughter's condition, I think it's autistic, but she's blissful, doing little, not stare, and she's under full control. The film continues in the extremely dark Seul Contre Tous. If you can, look at these two movies, the first one. It has really great actors, but it's hard to see because of the relentless tone. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
