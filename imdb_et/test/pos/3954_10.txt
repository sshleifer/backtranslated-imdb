When I saw it at the film festival a year ago, I was very impressed and started looking for it. Nothing to do, not in cinemas or on DVD, not on Blue ray. Absolutely nothing !!! How is this possible? The direction is IMPECCABLE, the story is intriguing and filmed in a very original way when the music is perfect and James Franco is hot as hell !!! this is the right life !!!!!!!!!! This is a really great movie that people should see and deserve another opportunity !!!!!! <br /> <br /> Edvard
