This film is about a deadly poison contained in small glass guns used to kill. This is probably done to hide the espionage ring, which is designed to steal the plans of a new American bomber. Currently, this plot was repeated in other Chani films, JADE MASK AND NEW ORLEANS DOCKS. In addition, it was first used in MR. LONG, ATTENTION - everyone had an exploding glass globe - an element of the plot that was obviously overused. It was an interesting MURDER OVER NEW YORK, but for these later films it was quite pass√©. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the rest of the movie was fresh and the plot was very well developed - with a good conclusion, of course, the culprit shows himself. But no plane could do that - especially in 1940. Such extreme dives and high rises were pretty stupid about this already outdated plane. <br /> <br /> By the way, due to its small role, the porter you see is Frank Coghlan Jr. - The same actor who played Billy Batson's CAPTAIN MARVEL series. According to IMDb, Coughlan is 93 years old and lived in the film industry.
