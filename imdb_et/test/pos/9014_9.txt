Although I realized that this exhibition is too strange to please everyone, I don't get where all these bad reviews come from, and I'm surprised at the bad reviews that he has got from the fans of the movies. I liked it and started it because I watched the first episode. But it is a bit confusing that Kuzco was put into school. And it seems to be a high school, not a college. But I think he's only eighteen right, so it's not as old as educated? And don't the kings always have the best education for them? So "Kuzco has to stop or he won't turn into an emperor" the thing doesn't sound too weird. And I think his education was previously overlooked, so he must now be educated.
