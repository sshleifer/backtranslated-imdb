Although this is not a masterpiece "Le Samourai" (I have now agreed that Jean-Pierre Melville was never able to do this classics), I find that "Le Cercle Rouge" is much better than "Bob le flambeur". I felt that "Bob le flambeur" was a higher than average and more influential b-film, but still a b-movie. "Le Cercle Rouge" proves that filmmaker Melville improved when he went on. John Woo is a great Melville fan, though their film making style is different. Although Woo uses fast-moving shootouts and operative violence, Melville has a minimalist style that fits her well. He was not interested in creating fast-acting films, but more meditative criminal thrillers. In this department he was one of the best. <br /> <br /> "Le Samourai" is still his best work, mainly because it has more character but at the technical level they are likely to be equal. Besides, although "Le Samourai" was one of the great leaders, it is four. Alain Delon is once again the coolest gangster who is delightful. Bourvil is great as a police inspector for throws and escaped con. He steals any scene he has, and proves that he was a skilled dramatic actor (best known in France as a Buster Keaton as a stealth comic). Yves Montand is also an excellent shaking and paranoid weapon expert. Gian Maria Volont√® (the common western spaghetti) shadows her three stars, but does enough work. <br /> <br /> Melville's direction is great again. Equal to both American criminals and the new French wave, the man always seems to know the best pictures and angles to choose from. This is a slower pace than most capricious keys, but it will eventually pay off. "Le Cercle Rouge" is a bit short of absolute classic, but is still one of the best reflections. Tarantino must see it before seeing the reservoir dogs. (8/10)
