It's funny when the time went and this movie was never seen ... 'until last week when I was like a spell. I saw it twice a week and it wasn't enough. This is a great movie and I love to see it again. The story is great and it really brought me. I would like to live such a story. Actors are great, including music, and you can dream of your love story. I just hope that one day I will find an opportunity to learn to dance like Johnny and Baby. I feel that dance brings people together and brings them together. I think people should learn to dance ... it helps a lot, especially in relationships. It's fun to dance in your blood and body.
