I understand why others reacted quite crazy towards the culmination, giving a twist that is really hard to take seriously. However, I think that its construction works quite well. The music, which is quite threatening and vertebrate, gives a truly horrible aura that fits a continuous ring that drives heavy English actress Joan Matlin (Jean Marsh) bonkers. He lends a nice flat to the ball when he tries to jump his career in New York (.. buildings outside the city window look as realistic as David Letterman) and is delightfully welcome with a noisy phone that speaks quite a bit. aloud against the wall. Looking for answers to who is responsible for ignoring this understanding, Joan discovers that no one is renting this space and that the former tenant was actually strangling himself. Without the help of the driver, Joan decides to find out who is causing this agony. Joan discovers an empty and phone with a certain female voice that worships her. <br /> <br /> The episode, in my opinion, is one for Jean Marsh, one woman. He is the only actor and we follow him through the crisis, which slowly weakens him, the phone and the beating of his second room causes him much suffering, which is growing into fear. Instead of leaving, Joan remains so shaken by this noise and breakpoint, where he just wants the phone (.. or someone else's ring) to stop. An episode gives a possible answer to someone who bothers Joan and why. The letter called Beth enters the story rather late when Joan tries to find out whose wife's voice this second line was, who knew her name with the scared phone she discovers in her room. Beta's fate can just tell the viewer why Joan is traumatized. I think this episode is a practice of spooks instead of belief, some did not like it, but certainly. I admit that the phone, like a physical danger "crawling" against Joan, is hard to take seriously, not to mention that he is attacking him, but I thought that an intense opening twenty minutes before that was cold enough to do so.
