Not bad MOW. I had been waiting for another movie based on female topics, but I was pleasantly surprised at the mid-term review. Of course, part of the plot was pretty hokey, but most of the movie kept me out. Was the walnut ball tied to the former spouse, someone at the tavern, or was the man (the person) who cut him off? Daniel Magder was great. I've seen her in mother strikes and guilty of the association, both in MOW and she's very reliable, especially how she challenges her mother, how preteen usually behaves. <br /> <br /> Laura Leighton also played a typical mother (a former woman) with whom both men and women can communicate. He was disappointed enough to seem real. <br /> <br /> See if you forgot about it. It's worth it.
