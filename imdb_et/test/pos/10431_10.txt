The ability of Eric Bogosiani to exhibit character in this "one-man show" shows his true choice of character as an actor. Everyone has a message to transmit truth, society, class, drugs, etc. It's an absolute duty for anyone who is a serious actor fan! His performance includes some of the most fun and real moments I've ever seen as an audience.
