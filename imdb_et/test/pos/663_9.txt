Loved this movie! Kick this old school! Love the idea. Love the script. Love symbols. I really really loved Geeks! I was delighted to see that the silly sliding horror is still in glory. It was with my favs like Saturday, 14th and Pandemonium. If you're big scary and terrible, that's your movie! Only one star because I would like to have a better sound. There is no bad sound but would have wanted more. Big blood cracks. Weapons of Great Assassination. Great costumes! I really love the breakfast club of the 80-year-old teenage stereotype area. And I appreciate the non-CGI relationship. Really good camera action and easy break, not CGI cutting. I would rather have a good fake that is really fake. <br /> <br /> Kisses for the cast and the makers! oh, also loved "making-of"!
