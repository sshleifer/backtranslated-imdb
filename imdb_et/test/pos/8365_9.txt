I'm a fan of Zhang Yimou and finally found this DVD title on the shelves of the Shenzhen bookstore after a long search in many places. <br /> <br /> This is a tremendous departure from the previous work of Zhang Yimou, esp in style and locality. The director himself has said that it is the first and only time he ever tries to make black comedy in modern China. It can even be said that this work is experimental in nature, compared to its well-known large budget and formal pieces. <br /> <br /> With a movie camera and wide-angle lens, fast-paced editing and high energy efficiency and naturalistic tone will never let you go from scratch. This presents a very realistic picture of the modern Chinese urban senses in this case, Beijing. If you appreciate and love this black humor, you will love this movie completely. See also the fun of Zhao Benshan (Happy Times) and leader Zhang Yimou. <br /> <br /> Last Note: I find the characters in this movie, like all other Zhang Yimou films, with the same personality traits - stubbornness, always trying to beat and up. Let me know your thoughts about it. <br /> <br /> David Lee
