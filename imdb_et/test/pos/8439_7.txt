It's a pretty good thriller in the South California nuclear power plant, led by James Bridges and the stars Jane Fonda, Jack Lemmon and Michael Douglas. The Fund plays a television reporter who wants to be a research journalist, but is only allowed to be a TV reporter. Douglas is an independent operator and Lemmon is a nuclear power plant supervisor. Fonda and Douglas are sent to a nuclear power plant on a routine basis and the accident almost happens and they get it on the film. Everyone is trying to cover it, except Fonda and Douglas, so Douglas steals the movie. Lemmon is starting to explore and discover that the company takes more profits, then plant safety. This is a good movie with a pretty good ending.
