The original man, who knew too much, first recognized Alfred Hitchcock outside the UK. Of course, the reason for this recognition was that people wondered how Hitchcock could offer so much on the screen, compared to the proud Hollywood products. The original film was filmed in the studio. <br /> <br /> For some reason he chose it from all of his films he did, Hitchcock, who now has an international reputation and a big Hollywood studio (Paramount), decided to see what a Man who knew too much would be like ultimate budget. It is done in Marrakech and London and has two large international boxes. It was James Stewart's third of four Hitchcock films and his only work with Doris Day and his only Hitchcock movie. <br /> <br /> I don't know why Hitchcock never used Dor. At first glance, he would fit the blonde profile of the ladies, which Hitchcock preferred. Perhaps because his healthy screen image was in conflict with Hitchcock's desire for his blondes. <br /> <br /> Doris will do some of her best activities ever with people who knew too much. His best scene is when his medical assistant James Stewart gives him a soothing agent before he says his son has been kidnapped by an English couple married to Morocco. Stewart and Day play beautifully on this scene. But Doris especially when he registers about four different emotions at once. <br /> <br /> Day and Stewart are on vacation with their son Christopher Olsen in Morocco and introduce Frenchman Daniel Gelin and the above-mentioned English pair, Bernard Miles and Brenda DaBanzie. Gelin is back in the Marrakesh marketplace and whispers some deadly words to Stewart about the murder that took place in London's Albert Hall. Their children are captured to secure their silence. <br /> <br /> Only once, when I think the hit song came out of Hitchcock's movie. Doris plays a actually observed singer who remained a wife and mother of the production. The song was Que Sera Sera and I remember it well in my 9 years. In 1956 it couldn't be heard anywhere, it even competed with Elvis Presley, which is growing rapidly this year. Que Sera Sera won the Academic Award for Best Songs, striving for a great company from True Love and over 80 days around the world title song. It became Doris Day's song for the rest of her life and she should never come back. <br /> <br /> In fact, this song works pretty nicely when Doris sings at the embassy Instead of doing it with mirrors, Hitchcock shot the scene in a real Albert Hall and, as the other reviewer said, is not directed, is this choreographic. You hang on your seats at that moment. <br /> <br /> It was worth the remake.
