I have so much fun reading user comments when I was watching the movie! It looks like it's a classic "Love it" or "Hate it" movie. And I have to say that I'm not just "Love" on the side, I'm going to be in the group to say this to my favorite movie EVER! Thank you Heaven I found it first. Almost POSSIBLE to find, I was happy about ten years ago to record it late on the UHF channel. Of course, the sellers may like me to be slightly biased, but I don't see anyone with a cornball with a dry sense of humor (like me) can't love this flick. The plot is large (but maybe the reason why it is not a well-known film ... if it is a poster, does it interfere with the medical industry?) Works great (I understand why some may say it was terrible. But that's it that made this movie so big ... it's full of stickiness) and humor is the burst of the gut. I'm proud to say I've been watching this movie at least 20 times and I have everyone memorable. This movie is a genius !!
