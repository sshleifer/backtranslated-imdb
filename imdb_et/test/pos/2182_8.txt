I saw it last night in Turner Classic Films (TCM). I had never heard of it before and was quite surprised that it became so attractive. <br /> <br /> Bogart is making a star as a sophisticated city-cynical editor, reluctantly going to his sharp "B" programmer with his greedy radio boss. About 12 years before he played similar urban crises perfectly in the United States, such as Knock On Any Door, The Barefoot Contessa, and The Harder they Fall, the band was already staring. <br /> <br /> To increase ratings and bring them to a somewhat higher level of programming, the WUBC, the "American Voice", pushes all the radio mini-women who were released 20 years ago to defend their spouse. Not wanting to be discreet to maintain the reputation of a woman and her husband, the station uses undersized methods to expose all listeners and as gently as possible. <br /> <br /> As a time capsule, I found it in the middle of the 1930s to light men at the workplace. Despite Henry O'Neill, I didn't feel supportive cast, the players were equally excellent and the direction was tight. <br /> <br /> If you like this kind of movie (eg Face In The Crowd, Inspector Call, etc.), don't miss the chance to see it. <br /> <br />
