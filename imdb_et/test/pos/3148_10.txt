The week saw Manhattan's "Reader". It touched my heart so some short films have done. In ten minutes, this tells a poisonous two-character story that has deeply resonated with me. Duncan Rogers has done an excellent job with very real and delicate moments for movies. This movie, which I really admire, is that the director has chosen a short story with a short story. These are really interesting characters and their story is perfectly spoken. It's not small. Have we not all seen the shorts that are just longer stories that are squeezed into format, or performances that didn't fit on the screen? I commend the "Reader" for doing really right, and I encourage everyone who is interested in film and storytelling to take this seriously. Worth every moment!
