Great movie. I smiled all the time. Why? Well, I'm from Austria, get together with German (Bavarian) humor. So I think this movie only makes a German native speaker. Stefan and Erkan talk about a new type of Turkish-German accent that became very popular in our countries (GER & AUT). But of course they are very stupid. As with any comedy, your personal humor will decide whether your thumb is up or down.
