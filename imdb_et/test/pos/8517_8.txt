If you can watch a 1983 bond film that is not as good as Octopussy and you still enjoy it. <br /> <br /> If you can accept production values ​​that are not as high as the TV movie. <br /> <br /> If you can look at Sean Connery with wrinkles that are obviously at the top of the forehead and still see James Bond. <br /> <br /> If you can experience inexperienced Basinger, weaker Largo <br /> <br /> If you can learn to love idiosynthetic scores, not Barry with your worst day. <br /> <br /> If you do not believe in hyperbolic assessments, it is welcome during release. <br /> <br /> If you can meet a poker battle and a video game and enjoy them both in the same way. <br /> <br /> You have never ever said and everything in it. <br /> <br /> And yet, you probably enjoy it, my son!
