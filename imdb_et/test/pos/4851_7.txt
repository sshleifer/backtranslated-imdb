I'm a big fan of the legendary director Elia Kazan. His films often deal with people who try to overcome their weaknesses. Whether it is obsessive love in "Splendor In the Grass, Poverty" Tree Growing in Brooklyn or Racism in "The Gentlemen's Treaty." If you are looking for other Kazan films, I stumbled upon a movie based on Arthur Miller's novel by William H.Macy ("Focus") who is one of my favorite actors) and Laura Dern. It deals with anti-Semitism very realistically. <br /> <br /> Macy's character seems to be going with her neighbors in her neighborhood and in her workplace until she personally affects her. here ... the reason he acted was not because he knew it was wrong and he wanted to stand, he acted because he was now regarded as an outsider and he began to experience the same look, the same remarks and as cruel as sir Finklestein (David Pamyers) experienced it. <br /> <br /> The film is very well written and well done by Meat Loaf doing a fantastic job to play the dirt bag! Both Macy's and Dern's performances are outstanding! Sometimes is for people to stand, influence their lives or the lives of their loved ones ... Only then will some find their moral compass.
