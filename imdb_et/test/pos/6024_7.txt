I own this movie and I love Canadian movies, but hire an actor like Rose I don't understand. It's totally useless in this movie just the name that is all. Other cast is good, good enough to make this little thriller work. I was surprise with a plot that wasn't the first time it was used. But these unknown actors did very well even Jergen, I'm not his big fan, but I liked this movie. see it for that.
