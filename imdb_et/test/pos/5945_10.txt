It is deeply stupid humor ... but I loved it. Jean Dujardin is a great actor in this film. Bérénice Béjo is lovely. It makes fun of all the secret agents like James Bond: refreshing !!! This is probably the most fun movie I've ever seen. I saw it three times and I want to see it. Buy DVD as soon as possible. You won't regret it. It's a movie that doesn't need a big scenario because it's a parody. The only mistake is that OSS 117 is too short. This is a jewel. It is not really common to see that a French movie is successful in the US, but I think it has everything to do. Trust me!!!
