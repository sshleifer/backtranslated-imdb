Although I don't like cricket at all and I've seen this movie 13 years ago, I think it's still one of the best age-class movies. I remember the day when I came home from my school and sat down to have my lunch, I saw the titles of this movie and then ... I was so tempted that I felt I was there, it really affected me personally. I still remember how I felt when I first saw that a poor boy was my friend going through the same adolescent experience we had these days. what I really liked about this movie is "shy" boy's main theme, who fantasizes about "kissing" his dream girl, not insulting, but if it was an American movie, you would definitely see the peak - "shy" boy "loves" at some point my girlfriend and i really can't understand this controversial concept so far ... i have a simple application if anyone knows how to get this movie via e-mail, please let me know i need a memorial. Thank you
