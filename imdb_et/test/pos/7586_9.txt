I've seen over 2000 Studio-Era soundtracks - including many of the universal features of Judy Garland, Lena Horne, Shirley Jones and Deanna Durbin - and a decent number of live and studio recorded music comedies and operas. And I assure you that no one is obliged to sing in front of the camera and microphone, or maybe somewhere ever, there is a USED DURBIN SOLO here ... a mono soundtrack and 1930s microphones and everything. A boy from Canada sings this "Il Bacio" as he lived and wrote himself, and then it happened that he showed retrospectively in Italy during his career, not as a child who learned it from his music teacher. > <br /> If you skip this extra DVD or skip to the Garland solo - you just take it off, because this cheap MGM teaser just happened with one of the 20c biggest performances.
