The important message that Miller would have certainly intended after seeing Vichy war crimes is that meaningless hatred without a rational foundation is a waste of life. Meat Loaf's character, Fred, has been known by Lawrence for years, and when the time comes, his fanatical supporters will allow them to attack a man who does not belong to their "target group". For me, this is a decisive message - it does not matter what Lawrence and her husband are doing from that moment on - they are marked and have the opportunity to save themselves by reason. Animal aggression and anger have blinded Fred's leader to the reality. <br /> <br /> One of my friends suggested to me that "The Wave" explores how irrational hate and evil ideology can take over people without understanding it. I took a turn-by-play experiment and was shocked to see how normal and flat people welcomed the creation of an oppressive police state, which would ultimately threaten them all, as it gradually broke. Fred is the beginning, his LA friends and the preacher idol is a catalyst that pushes his neighbors over to the edge of violence without thinking about what they are doing wrong. <br /> <br /> Between Lawrence and Finkelstein, the Jewish shopkeeper is fascinating because Lawrence leaves this point almost to the end: when the bigots reach out to Finkelstein, where is he going? When his family has escaped from the Nazis, what irony will be tortured again in the land of "freedom". <br /> <br /> This great poster (it's quite famous for propaganda) that concerns American families with the highest levels of living in the world is a very important detail. When you see this movie, check out the subway train and all the small posters. The message also speaks there. <br /> <br /> This movie should be in every school's curriculum, especially at a time when 'sensible' people who are just extremes of thin shades are promoting so much hatred.
