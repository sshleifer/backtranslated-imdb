Not your daily Tom and Jerry for short reasons. One, there is the story of Jerry, which is strange because Tom and Jerry rarely speak. Two, these two are friends who were also rare and rarely working, but also more competing shorts. Thirdly and most importantly, the comic is rarely humorous (by design), and jokes here are dry fools with a small cough and blood bubble. Think of Tom and Jerry as a comic directed by Tim Burton. Not entirely successful, but it works largely. The shortest end of the MGM I remember. Not all, and the evidence that these shorts were never intended exclusively for children as a target group. Worth a look. Recommended with the above warnings.
