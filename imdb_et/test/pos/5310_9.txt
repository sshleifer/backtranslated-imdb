Maybe people want the devil to be more than God. Maybe we like this security for no reason; making a mistake only to blame the devil for the pain and suffering of the world. There are so many difficulties in the masses that it is difficult not to see the sadness that you are all moving. Leland P. Fitzgerald understands all this; he knows that everything may not be OK, and maybe somebody can leave this country to avoid waiting for the pain of their life, the danger he must love. The credit goes to the scriptwriter / director Matthew Ryan Hoge to create a lyrical prose from about two suburban families who have had good times and badly crossed the road. By simply looking at the display of almost all A and B participants, the material shows that it really is for your audience. Emotions do not have to be worn on the sleeve. Sometimes all we want to do is stop suffering. <br /> <br /> Ryan Gosling brings to the table underestimated performance, which includes his character inside Leland's emotions. He is a very passionate and intelligent young man who cuts his life through BS, knowing what he sees and what is worse. The film is a cataract for the souls of those affected by the terrible birth of Leland, who killed the spiritual challenge of his former girlfriend. In the confusion of this teenager, he contemplates the incident, well knowing what he is going to do, he was going to stop the pain he sees everywhere, but most of the young Ryan Pollard's face. Almost immediately he realizes that he has made a mistake that perhaps God is not the work he has done on Earth. Whether this is true is about to be discussed soon, because the murder begins with a chain of events that ultimately leads to the lives of many when they awaken to the tangential insecurity of life. This boy has opened his eyes to both sadness and revival. <br /> <br /> With the ballads sung by the former Sunny Day Real Estate chairman Jeremy Enigk, the film has gone through two vignettes of small families. after the tragedy. The actors are great, especially for some. Someone who plays naive stories in most movies makes Chris Klein actually much of the same material here, but also an evolutionary person. His kindness is effective when used in the right part, similar to his success in the election, and I am interested in whether the directors allow him to expand his talents and bite his teeth more important. Jena Malone is also as effective as playing the role of young people in difficulty, as she is in Donnie Darkos and in a living house; Don Cheadle has a sharp professionalism that gives us a difference with a compassionate therapist who was in a manicia; and Martin Donovan is brilliant when a debilitating father, who tries to save his mind and finally understand, must also break down his family. It's also great to see the beautiful Sherilyn Fenn play a small but important role. <br /> <br /> When a tragedy strikes, people will band together to get through. As Leland points out at one point, you see men and women helping and hugging others when they see the pain and suffering that surrounds them, but in a few days everything will go normal. The character of Cheadle extrapolates the optimistic view that we at least get a glimpse of the true nature of people who want to help and be good to each other, but are fired back with a retort, "at least at least during a tragedy." Perhaps we do not want to think that we are good-natured because it makes us feel that we should be good all the time and that, as bad, it must be necessary in turn. Being faulty, we promise to revive ourselves and try again. Leland's mistake makes her see her close love, as well as opening the eyes of others to awaken, and not letting her loved ones go by. You can't focus on the sadness of others if they first have to get their own hands. Hoge has produced this parable and a truly effective film, hopefully much more.
