I watch this movie every time he plays on TV. Just a brilliant movie. Three men return home from war and try to return to civilian life with great difficulty. All three led the opposite life during the war (Executive Banker became a military corps, a soda jerk became a captain of the air force and a high school football hero loses both hands in battle) and now everyone has to rebuild their lives and unite with new reality. The homes to which they return, with their grown-up children and independent working women, with the depressed economy, are adding to the controversy. It is the scenes that are directly between the camera and the unspoken dialogue that resonates the most. The uncomfortable intimacy of Frederich and Myrna Loy and his fight back as a leader (both at home and at work) are heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews is a riveting as a beautiful, adorned master who struggles to keep his life uniform. <br /> <br /> The film is full of honest characters, and each is represented by a talented actor. <br /> <br /> This movie, however, took another level of vision after seeing "Private Save". The reality and size of the people that these people lived for love and land ...... and probably did not end on the battlefield. <br /> <br /> This is essential for every collection. > <br />
