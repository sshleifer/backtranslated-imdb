Brian (Wesley Eure) works for a security company owned by Mr. Norton (Conrad Bain). The Norton company is in financial difficulty, the owner is not aware of having an employee who sells secrets to the competitor's business owner (Jim Bacchus). It's not Brian, because he is a loyal and faithful employee and a good inventor. However, Mr Norton has no patience with Brian because Norton's beautiful daughter, Casey (Valerie Bertinelli), has a question for Brian and Norton that sets Brian's motives to her astonishment. But Brian does not come out with a large security device. This is called CHOMPS, which stands for a dog home security system. A device that looks like a dog is actually a computer-controlled animal that has the ability to strike walls and distribute siren sounds. The competitor's owner sends two spy spies to learn the details of the new invention (one is the red buttons). Does CHOMPS save Norton security? This is a good and clean entertainment for the old family. CHOMPS is, of course, a real dog, played by divine and talented Benji. In fact, Benj has a double role because Brian also has a "real" dog called Rascal. Just looking at this little dog, it's a joy because it can scaled walls, pull trucks and drive machine panels to grab the bad guys. The casting of a person is also quite nice, with everyone giving enchanting items. Costumes, landscapes and production values ​​are also good. While you may have trouble finding a movie, it would be a good idea to have a look at your closest loved ones. CHOMPS is a great, healthy deviation from world affliction.
