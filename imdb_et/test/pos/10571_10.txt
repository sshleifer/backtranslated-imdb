I never dreamed when I started watching this DVD, so I would be completely fascinated within minutes. The story was completely absorbing and fun. Action was great. The biggest surprise of all was how I would be so enchanted by the love these two young women radiated through the screen. Their first physical encounter for me was by far the most delicate, romantic, delightful, tempting, appealing scene of love I ever felt in the movie. I literally stopped breathing. I couldn't believe the chemistry between the two actors. Without nudity or graphic sex, they didn't pass on more passion and titration than any American production could ever count on. Bravo author, scriptwriter, director and creative.
