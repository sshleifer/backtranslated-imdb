I was like watching it right and I was all as oh it is so completely awesome and then I was just as good as ya so I really enjoyed all the amazing threats and all the British people and I think the doctor is a very good doctor, who does such a wonderful medical thing, and he was a very strange man and I was like I wouldn't want this man because he is a new doctor and i like an old doctor who is not this man but then i watched him and i was like oh this is fantastic and i liked it so i watched and enjoyed great evil enemies and conquering big evil and happy doctor who is pretty scary and happy looking
