this is another good west that I enjoyed. It's not epic or anything else, but that's good for what it is. about 3 fur workers, led by men named Jed, who is crude and un civilized.Jed and his two friends find themselves scouts in the fortress, the only thing that stands between them and the Indian band who is bothering Americans in their country and wants take it back. This is the main content of the story. even a little humor and forbidden romance. One of Jedi's friends, Gus, reminded me of a character Quint (played by Robert Shaw) in the movie Jaws.they, both of whom have this tough, terrible demeanor. Western fan, you should find a lot about this scrap. I think it deserves 7/10
