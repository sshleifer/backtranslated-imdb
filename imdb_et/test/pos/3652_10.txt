I just saw it at the Philadelphia Film Festival. It was the most wonderful film - the best I've seen for some time. The seductive character of his father is an open, exploratory and (as noted by the film) love-filled person, adorned with beautiful Camille Nat. The accompanying music is soothing and a means of transport, breathtaking noise. <br /> <br /> Every character seems to be in some way contradictory - and their relationships (conflicts) make a great story. A.K. Hangal, like an old man, was the most magical one - I wanted to go on and on. <br /> <br /> Hari remembered that his "place" was all included to get the story - the refreshing change revolutionized the titles of many modern writers. <br /> <br /> All and all, great movie. Look.
