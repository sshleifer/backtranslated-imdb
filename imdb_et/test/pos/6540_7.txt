When this movie is mentioned, it begins and ends with a debate between the excellent collection of cars and the dragging scenes that are often overlooked, there are occasional eclectic characters that fill the film around three central characters. <br /> <br /> Rebel, played by a great veteran Australian actor Max Cullen. Rebel is a blind drag rider who almost sleeps the hero and his group in the middle of the night because he doesn't use any headlamp. <br /> <br /> We find that the story of Rebel's captain's builder cars and his wife and his wife seem locked in the late 1950s. Rebel plays a small but central role in teaching Mike, played by Terry Serio, an almost spiritual truth about dragging the street. It's not speed, reaction times that make a great racing driver. This is the one who knows the car best, who gets the greatest <br /> <br /> This is best shown when Rebel explains to Mike after the test trip "You have all the torment, just lacking style" <br / Graham Bond is another well-credited actor who borrows her talents as curious police officers who want to get into some of the financial activities created by street competitions. The confrontation between Bond and Fox played by Richard Moir adds to the tension. Not only does Bond expect results, but also the Fox racing car drum <br /> <br /> Fox shows the most manipulative and evil in most movies, but at the peak it is a sense of respect that makes the last few minutes extremely tense and memorable at the end. This is almost the same as focusing on the true intention of the film, showing us the culture of the street competition, not the daily activities of the people. <br /> <br /> Scripting is one of the main complaints about the film. Although not exciting, I believe that the absence of any chemistry by Mikes' girlfriend, played by Deborah Conway and her mechanic Vangelis Mourikis, is more of a problem. Every scene where the two interact easily should have been cut <br /> <br /> Finally, the actors show that a truly extraordinary performance is given by Kristoffer Greaves, who plays the members of the deaf and Fox insider. His back story has never been investigated, whether he was injured in the race, so that Fox sees value to keep him in. <br /> <br /> The reality of the movie is simple, it is the race on the street and the culture behind it. When cars are driving and running sequences are moving, it's the only time Director John Clark and his writer Barry Tomblin really feel happy with what they're doing. <br /> <br /> So if you are looking for human relationships in depth, the moments of life that determine drama, this movie is not for you. If your pulse runs somewhat through the blown 57 Chevi or the 3rd stage of the iconic GTO that relaxes on Sydney's streets, you won't find this movie much better
