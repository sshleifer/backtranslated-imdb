In Victorian times, the father is separated from the family when he is wrongly accused of treason and sent to live in the country. Children adapt to their new situation, make friends and use the spouse they attract to their train to reunite with their family. <br /> <br /> Film directors are often not very good at this. However, Jeffries is one of the ten British comedy classic veteran actor, one of the few exceptions. His brilliant concept (also written by the script, by E. Nesbit's novel) is the story of the classic British children that raises this film to art. While the story may be very ideal, the great performances and the stunningly memorable settings of Yorkshire Dunes combine a truly memorable movie. Arthur Ibbetson's photography is a definition of good film making - the story doesn't tell the story, but at the same time the pictures combine a stunningly romantic atmosphere. The Agutter is just perfect as a happy Bobbie (okay, I fell in love with him early, but I don't believe anyone who disagrees) and Cribbins, whose comic actor is on an equal footing with Jeffries, is unforgettable as the Perks humble-yet-proud railway station. It's an outdated movie; a romantic, charming, very enjoyable and beautifully naive sense of kindness for all.
