What some Hollywood movies are trying and practically failing to do, creating somehow metaphysical relationships between people (without being unrealistic), manages this beautiful film perfectly (in this way it is a bit like the same director's wonderful "La Double Vie de Veronique") and the same beautiful actor ). This is a real movie that changes the life perspective a bit - a smart and beautiful story, masterfully managed, great main actors, masterful cinematography. I've just seen the movie 3rd or 4th time and I think it's one of the best I've ever seen. And if you should be satisfied with the "white" finish - "red" will put a happy ending on the trilogy.
