As a Zombie fan, I really love those types of places where people get into strange places surrounded by evil monsters! PB is also an excellent link to the Riddick Chronicle (COR). The gang must run as fast as possible away from the darkness. The story is so much metaphor! Riddick is this bad guy, but he is also a hero who tries to save people at a slow pace. The Muslim man, Imam, relies on the sun's positions five times a day in prayers, but he has remained in the lands of darkness. In general, I recommend this movie to any sci-fi fan. You don't have to be disappointed.
