The title is a reference to the destruction of harvest residues from farmers burning them, causing fires on plains, such as rice shells. This is a tiny story about destroying a Japanese soldier. <br /> <br /> The story is set at the end of the Philippine campaign as a soldier with TB who will return from the hospital because, as he can walk, he has no room for him. His superiors don't want him around because he's really too sick to work or fight. He was abused by his officer and sent back to the hospital to allow himself to kill or kill. They still don't take him and he will soon leave the war over the ravaged landscape, trying to find help or residence or even just food. Its a grim journey that has no hope in sight and only death and human inhumanity at every turn. <br /> <br /> It is a harassing journey into the darkness of the human heart and it is also a very funny film. This does not mean that it is not terrible, it is at times, but also darkly comic. How was it not? Here is a movie where madness and insanity run rampantly, people are constantly trying to feed tobacco leaves, trying to get even a little better pair of shoes, trying to remain a Japanese soldier in front of absurdity, but never anywhere, and you can't help but laugh. To be sure things go darker when it turns out that cannibalism can literally and figuratively be the only way to survive, but at the same time, there is something awkward about human comedy. <br /> <br /> A great anti-war movie with a stylish photographic style explaining the madness of war, even if it blinds our eyes with its beauty. Here we see landscapes full of bodies that include a soldier and a civilian. set in the middle of forests and trees, which would otherwise be and somewhat still pretty beautiful. Its an embarrassing feeling. What intriguing is that I read that it is based on the novel about the redeeming power of Christianity. The director removed all religious references to hope and salvation and used it instead of showing that life is stinking, war smells worse and that there is finally hope. <br /> <br /> Intellectually I admire the film, emotionally I don't. Part of this is an amazing point of impact that stresses to me what we see on the screen. Its almost gold-shaped lily, because the images are so strong, it doesn't have to make music feel in one way or another. Certainly, it is different from other war films, bloody, terrible and realistic ways the big budget films claim to be, but never. It is not for those who are not blood or gore because it is a shovel here. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth a look.
