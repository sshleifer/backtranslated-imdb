I have to say that this movie is absolutely amazing. I don't understand why this is so low. She has romance, music, darkness and vampires. Stuart Townsend also did a great job, being Lestat, the actor was great. Nor am I usually into this music, sometimes well. But I have to say in this movie that music fits perfectly. If you like dark movies about vampires, it's definitely for you or even if you don't want this love story. But all I can say is one word: amazing! My rating is false: 10 out of 10. Anyway, I suggest you look at it. I remember not seeing it for years, I looked at it about a year ago and I'm addicted to it. lol. Great movie!
