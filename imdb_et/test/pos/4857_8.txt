I don't know if it was the directors' intention to make sure that the sky would almost always be sunny and beautiful in this film. Maybe this is a romantic picture of many Americans when this movie is set, as it is in the middle of the war, Macy has come back from war (her neighbor asks "Hey, is that you got Fritz there?") to move on with life, but one day he gets new pairs of glasses (hence the name) and sees things clearly because the surrounding situation shows himself to be rare antisemitism and Macy and Dern could enter. Funny, how the Jews are not in this movie, but the accusation has been made. It is also historically accurate, as the affiliated unions of this time have broken Democrats into the flags of America and God. Macy is constantly in touch to come to a "meeting". His presence brings unexpected results. <br /> <br /> Applying this schedule today is the opposite of a survey. In 2005, he has undergone a total recall, with the average citizens who have taken patriotism and religion as a link between their Republican parties and an organized labor force as part of the left-wing "untruthful" America. <br /> <br /> A great picture to see if you care to see a friendly, jealous and foolish Macy (played by her beautifully) to catch the rape killing and hate in the mid-40s in NYC. <br /> <br /> A tough, emotionally charged movie.
