I love horror films, but I think they work better when they hide the dramatic effect (for example, the devil's backbone, exorcism). This is such a movie, and it's not just terrible and terrible when it has to be, it's also very beautiful. The story of the two sisters really begins slowly, so if you saw a quick spirit in the first 20 minutes, you are disappointed. In fact, isn't it a ghost story? This is something more complicated and is done so that it wins out of Ring and The Grudge. Story? is a smarter film than great cultural hits because it cares for its characters and the direction is flawless. Every movie detail gives you a breath when you're a person who loves to pay attention to detail while watching a movie. The actor is great, especially by the stepmother and the main girl. These two are worth the ticket price. Do yourself a favor and watch this awesome movie.
