The Bergman skimmers are one of the most realistic images of war ever set on film. It is in no way an action film, although the pace is faster and most are in action than in most other Bergman films. Nor is it romanticism of war or patriotism, unlike most war films. In fact, the deliberate ambiguity of the loyalty of characteristic reality and character is very modern. <br /> <br /> Skammen is a darkly lit movie that should be watched at night to let it work with magic. Many consequences are passed indirectly, but so effectively, that some scenes are competing intensely with a modern, meaninglessly big budget movie like Saving Private Ryan. Of course, the action in Skammen is much smaller, but it is impressive. <br /> <br /> Although the style of film making is contemporary, setting the film seems timeless and inappropriate. The war-torn landscape and even the small town of the untouched province can be everywhere, anytime. And this film is not so specific about historical events, specific names and dates, but against universal human reactions to accidents and chaos. <br /> <br /> Upsman and Sydow, who are usually impressive in Skamma, are unlike most other Bergman films, and are not in this film. Throughout the film, they are spectators as we are. Bergman has a war on them and through them an audience and their reaction is perhaps our reactions. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. 10/10
