First, obvious as a police book that passed a funny melodrama, QUAY ?? is uncomfortable, directly independent and dangerous to banality. The Jouvet aplomb is well used in the hard policeman's performance, which is immediately noticeable by his powerful and overflowing force; his Antoine is not so much a man of intellect but a great life experience and a reputation for instinct. QUAY ?? is not subversive in the sense that today's (and already yesterday) alumni enjoy this word. This is Clouzot's most playful hour. He wanted to adapt Steeman's books to a satirical note. (It has been said that Clouzot was a great reader of detective novels.) As a manager, Clouzot is a solid hand. <br /> <br /> It's not a mystery or thriller, but a satirical look at the Parisian couple and the police. People who are accustomed to Clouzot's masterpiece LES DIABOLIQUES can find a little inconvenience in the diversity of things, styles, and elements in QUAY. Here, Clouzot talks about many things, a couple and a hidden love story (Simone Renanti to Blier), entertainment about the world and old spinsters, police techniques and an old bitter policeman with boy, and so on. Quay is a realistic criminal drama made of satire. Jouvet offers excellent performance as a heavy police inspector. Antoine is an old policeman with an adventurous past (he fought in Africa but did not climb the stairs of his ranks due to his independent behavior); he lives with his son, a school student; at work, Antoine is harsh and ruthless, capable of inspector, bitter, intelligent and harsh. This is a very cheerful, very picturesque role. Jouvet compiled his character from a number of attributes to be determined: his clothes, his expression, his funny accent, his brutality, and his mocking air. when he interviews Blier, Antoine makes mistakes and his talent is presented as a talent we meet in real life, mixed with bugs and gaps. Antoine's talent is what comes from experiences, everyday observations? It is almost a supernatural _universal genius of almost all famous detectives. <br /> <br /> QUAY ?? is it versatile? It is a realistic criminal drama as well as satire and melodrama. It can be seen as one of the first films in the French police legendary toughness. A long time ago, Eastwood and Wayne's tough police were Antoine. <br /> <br /> The title is interesting, suggesting that it is the police, not the incident or the secret. <br /> <br /> Like crafts, Clouzot was probably the best and sharper in France (as Welles was). QUAY ?? is true to Clouzot's nature - sardonic comic, sharp observation, lots of psychology, sharp and insecure irony. The man was the first class when he filmed something, he knew what to do, what to choose? Watch the introductory scenes of the film at Jenny Lamour's big stage. Every scene is memorable, _ illustrated. Clouzot's technical, stylistic abilities were amazing. His style is inventive, satirical, sharp, extremely transparent, brilliant. <br /> <br /> Jouvet's style was overwhelming, powerful, tough. (Some people didn't really like these qualities. Since he was a great director, his film style was considered too theatrical, etc.). His Antoine is a good example of what he was thinking of as a composer. <br /> <br /> Jouvet had a very peculiar physiognomy like a threatening predator, somewhat like Van Cleef? Jouvet had this predatory, wild air and it is useful here because he fills an old tough policeman. One of the sides of QUAY is that it is a justification for Jouvet. He is immediately recognizable, identifiable by his quality of play (I see that many who watch this flick do not know that this is Jouvet's film, which in itself is amazing quality). <br /> <br /> Fresnay and Jouvet are two French actors I admire most; first appeared to me in Renoir's drama (famous), while Jouvet Carn√© comedy. I was fascinated to see that Clouzot gave them a leading role. <br /> <br /> Finally, the word Steeman; he wrote a novel used by Clouzot (who had previously adapted another Steeman novel as Fresnay comedy). Steeman was an old school mystery writer in Wallace. He quickly became obsolete with the new outdated fashion. When I was 11, I read one of his thrillers and loved it a lot.
