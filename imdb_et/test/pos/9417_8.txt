Sherlock Holmes' classical universe films tend to change in quality. This range goes beyond the very good average, with none of their output being abysmal or amazingly brilliant. Sherlock Holmes and The Secret Weapon are firmly anchored in the middle ground quality, and as always, this is an enjoyable outing so that a lot of fans like me enjoy a lot. This film sees Holmes in the middle of the Second World War plot, which the evil Nazis are stealing from the invention of a Swiss scientist, which may be a key element of the battlefield. World War II Sherlock Holmes films are not as good as those like Scarlet Claw, where Holmes conducts private sector research because they usually have too much propaganda or plot that is more related to war than secret. But it is pretty much away, and with Holmes and his research, the film works much better. Maybe Universal saw that brought Terror Voice earlier and changed focus because of it. <br /> <br /> Basil Rathbone puts an excellent maverick as an ace detective, while Nigel Bruce does not appear as usual, it's nice to see him do it. These two did not spend a lot of time together, which is disappointing because their chemistry is always one of the best things in Holmes movies; but it allows Holmes to spend more time on different masks, which is always fun. Dennis Hoey Lestrade is definitely my favorite of the secondary characters and although he's not as funny as usual; his facial expressions are great and his presence helps to emphasize how great Holmes is. My scene with Watson in a car following the paint droplets is my favorite movie. It is good to see that Holmes's nemesis, Professor Moriarty returns, even if he seems to have been thrown into this hell. Lionel Atwill's presentation is not as good as George Zucco's Sherlock Holmes adventures because he is never convinced that he is really a great mind; But seeing him lock the horns with the protagonist is fun and it's fun to see him in the movie offset World War II items that are never as interesting as Holmes himself. The film begins as a thriller rather than a mystery blow; but if it goes, it's hard to put down and it's more than a solid entry into Universal's work.
