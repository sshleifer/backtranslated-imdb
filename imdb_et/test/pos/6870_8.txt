It's a shame. Is it perhaps because romantic leaders are middle-aged, born-out and shy, not over-teenage stars? Maybe. If you are over 35, you get this comedy. If you are over 45, you get this comedy. If you are 25 years old, wait until you are older to see it. <br /> <br /> Matthau and Jackson's unlikely tying works just because it's so unlikely. Matthau has a great line up that goes between these two - "I like the old ones because you don't have to explain who is Ronald Coleman." (If this is not an exact line, it is close ...) <br /> <br /> The premise of a sub-para hospital run by incompetent is true. The art of Carney's portrayal of an ancient chief surgeon is absolutely brilliant. It is impossible for him to laugh out loud during his delivery. The subplots, if you can name them, are also fun, like Matthau and Jackson's teenage sons. Everybody hits exactly the right tone. Okay, there's a little bit where Matthau has to wear women's clothes, which is a bit overhead and a simple sign. But still - this is Walter Matthau's drag! It's funny!
