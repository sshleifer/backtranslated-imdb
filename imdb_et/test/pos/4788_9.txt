I saw it when I was twelve. It was a film that made me realize what a real secret was. I had read the whole series of Happy Hollisters children's mysteries and they were about a family of child shelters who always got their husbands. But we readers could not solve the secret with them. This movie showed me that a good secret is what makes the viewer / reader at the end, say, "OH !!!!! OF COURSE !!!!!!!"
