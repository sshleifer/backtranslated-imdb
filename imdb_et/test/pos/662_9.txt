OK, so the next review is more of a summary than actually containing any spoilers, but better safe than damage to avoid blacklisting, right? Right! Consider yourself officially warned and read more ... <br /> <br /> In this parody / respect most of the time in horror film history - the 1980s - a group of stupid teenagers get together to host the notorious murder of the McGee House years ago and buried them in the backyard. As I am sure, you might think things will get worse off worse than saying "Where's the beef?" And in the typical 80's horror movies, deaths are bloody, dialogue is cheesy, and beautiful women take their clothes off whenever possible. Good times ... <br /> <br /> There are no clichés or clichés in the 80s movie cliché. In fact, no stone was left at all? we have a cool hero, his innocent girlfriend, a goth chick, a tough thug (think John Bender), a hot blonde who loses her shirt, a shy dork in love with a hot blonde who loses her shirt, a couple of fantastic half-naked lesbians and two big geeks . <br /> <br /> As you can see clearly, the cast is quite large. Typically, the major pains are where things can quickly break down, with one or two sour apples that are punched together with the barrel. But not in this case. No cast member left me disappointed. Operation was very well done. Everyone has a hilarious hero on his Thriller jacket played by Jovan Meredith until grooovy Goth chick played by Renee Dorian to Geeks One & Two played by Cory Assink & Jonathan Brett ?? they all played it straight, brought their A-game and knocked it out of the park. If you're a fan of Gary & Wyatt at Weird Science, you'll love the geeks right away. <br /> <br /> Director / co-author Jeff C. Smith is a man whom he follows to trust me in the future. If this is what it can do with a small budget, it will not be good for it if it receives more money for future projects. The characters were dead; the atmosphere was perfect; laughs were great; blood flowed and splashed and sprayed nicely? it was like watching a movie of fear from the 1980s. Call it "HIGH CLUB meets NAMES OF NAMES" !!! The label line says it all and says honestly - "PUBLICATION ANSWER; GRATUITOUS NUDITY; ZERO BUDGET" - here's no wrong advertising, people! As fans of this genre, we need to look at the Indians and support those hard-working people who break their candles and bring us the original stories that we will not stay in the world forever, full of a large studio that has spent "horror" or meaningless remakes with PG-13 like The Hitcher. No, thank you - not for me. <br /> <br /> Finally, I must honestly say STUPID TEENAGERS IS DIE! is by far one of the best indie disks I have enjoyed this year. It is a bloody time and it repeats repeated views. From the dialogue to the character up to the wardrobe ... even the end of the final credit of the theme of love (which, if it does not bring back the smile that reminds the mid-80s by the REO Speedwagon - overridden R of every word starting with 'R' - Then I eat my own DVD) ... The bottom line is if you are a fan of the 80's horror or horror, no more hesitation - this flick deserves to be your collection !!
