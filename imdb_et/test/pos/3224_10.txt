I've been in GG since I watched in 2001-2002 (2nd season) when I tuned to see "Smallville" 10 minutes early. Thanks to "The Beginning," I now have everything except the 2 episodes on tape until the last night (Ep. 4.9). I'm a middle-aged straight guy and it's ONLY a weekly TV show I watch. <br /> <br /> I love this series because: a) Lauren Graham is a fucking pretty woman and funny and smart to launch; b) the dialogue is extremely well written; c) It's fun and fun, putting overpriced garbage like "Everyone Loves Raymond" shame. Many of the current television comedies have been heavily influenced by the very successful and much despised mucus pit, known as "Married with Children", where the viewer is encouraged to bypass and feel higher. The GG has characters in the characters, but we see them in their foibles and laugh with them, not with them. It stimulates a TV where writers challenge us with quick fires and left-wing foreign culture / literature / running events. I am delighted to see these episodes over and over again, trying all the linings and references to previous episodes. Stars Hollow is his little world that I can continue happily until the series runs.
