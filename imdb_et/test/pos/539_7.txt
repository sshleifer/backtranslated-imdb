this is a movie to be seen on television and only once. I mean, it's good, but it's a little too long and the plot is so well-known, it's not very original, but it's not boring. the best thing about the movie is performances, natalie portman and susan sarandon are great actor and in this movie they have done a good job. I'll give her 7.
