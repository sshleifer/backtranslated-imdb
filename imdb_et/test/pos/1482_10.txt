When I was younger and today, Mr. Bean is a genius. The triple BAFTA named Rowan Atkinson's stars an almost silent (mimic) person to look for an alien who fell on Earth, causing chaos and mischief wherever he goes. She has tried to take the exam, put her trousers blind in front of her (she didn't know she was blind), went to church, tried to dive in the pool, lunch at the park bench, saw a scary movie, changed her car, had a picnic with a flying intruder, spent Christmas with her girlfriend (Matilda Ziegler), taking care of a child in Portsmouth, had room 426 in a Queens hotel in Portsmouth, won her pet contest in Teddy, led a new board from her Mini, and even met a queen. The guests were also Rudolph Walker, Richard Briers, Angus Deayton, Nick Hancock, they thought it was all over, Caroline Quentin, the day of Today's David Schneider, Richard Wilson, the Fast Show Eryl Maynard and Dibley Roger Lloyd-Packi Vicar. It was named the best comedy (program or series) and the best light entertainment program BAFTAs. Rowan Atkinson was number 50 among the largest British actors, he was a comedian of the 24th comedy, and was number 8 in the UK's favorite comedy. Outstanding!
