This film is BRILLIANT. <br /> <br /> I don't even remember this movie in theaters, so I thought it was "straight to the DVD", I have rather low expectations, even though I'm a Mike big fan of the judge. It has some comic types like "Brazil" and "Demolition Worker", but go to the next level. <br /> <br /> Then I saw the cast; Luke Wilson, Maya Rudolph and Dax Shepard, who were all excellent in their role. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, this movie won me in the first 5 minutes, where it shows fewer than average people with fewer children and the poorest, the stupid, the hardest people who have many unknown children, and how this leads to a sort of reverse development. It takes this concept and shows where we are being directed to the pollution of this gene association. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I don't think it takes 500 years, but probably only about 50 years. I can already see that the general population, the media and culture are a shocking rise in "light retardation". People who love classical music and art are ridiculed. The lowest common denominator seems to be a role model, especially in Hollywood and television (such as "Jackass Movie" and any reality where they eat something disgusting or humiliating for money). <br /> <br /> All political / social satire aside, this movie is just LAUGH OUT LOUD funny! And I don't say it lightly; some movies actually make me "LOL" but it did. <br /> <br /> Many of the best jokes are in the background of the word / sight, so you really have to pay attention to some of them. I even had a couple of them pause and zoom (for example, when Joe got her government ID and "hair" said "yes" and "eyes" also said "yes"). The front of the prison is also engraved with "House for Specific People", as filmmakers (like real life) call all "people" instead of people, etc. Again, it was just a moment on the screen ... this is one of those movies that can be seen and amused again and again to get through the funny layers. <br /> <br /> Also, I usually watch movies with subtitles and it called me some jokes that could go between the ears in the dialog box, the police constantly talk about people "fleeing" instead of "escaping", and there are also many other misconceptions that just broken me. But again, I may not be able to get them from dialogue with music / sound effects; it is very fine but still fun. <br /> <br /> In addition, special effects were really good for sci-fi / social satire. <br /> <br /> I can go on and on, but in general I think it's one of those movies that if you don't think it's funny, it's probably YOU! I intend to recommend it to many people!
