I'm never quite sure if I like this documentary. It was shown on Channel 4 before the Revelations truncated version, and is unpublished on the videotape before the uncut show. The documentary is basically Bill's friends, telling him how big he was in the one-hour exhibition that was mixed up, a bit like the movie you're watching. It also includes David Letterman's groveling as a worm dump Bill out of his show before he died, the reason? Bill joked about how people in Pro-Life go to the funeral, and Letterman had a Pro-Life ad. Anyway, watch the video when Revelations is Bill's best in his hobby :)
