Although Flatliners is 15 years old, it was my first time today to see it. I had heard of Flatliners, but it had never been said to go out and rent or see for a while. Well, I got it on one premium channel and I have to say it was very good. <br /> <br /> This film was a study by some of the great young doctors who decided to investigate death. They have come up with a way to briefly die and live back. In addition to all the stars, this film had a serious bite. I just thought death was being investigated, there was enough riveting, but I really thought the writer and the director did a great job, giving them another look at their hair. It was not a general attempt to excitement, intimidation and difficulty in thinking ... it was a real thing. <br /> <br /> Instead of this movie, it was a thriller with an empty, superficial star stud. . Elbow, white finger, seat edge, hard nose triller. I'll give him 8/10.
