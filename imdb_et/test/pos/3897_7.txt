Just like "Columbos", we can see that the death occurs right from the start. The following is a web of lies, sex, blackmail and murder. Researcher Adam Arkin is even somewhat fumbler, not unlike Columbus. This is William H. Macy, as a film critic suspects who wears the movie. Constantly turning and twisting, the charter sends Macy deeper and deeper into his "perfect crime" attack. Fans of William H. Macy enjoy some murder cases, as well as those who love the captains of crimes with all kinds of delicious options. Add some well-timed comedies and it's very similar to the "Columbo" fine episode. Highly recommended. - MERK
