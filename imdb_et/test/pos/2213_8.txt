I enjoyed this movie very much and I think most of Lauren's Ambrose fans. His character is much softer than his role in six legs and all the performances are strong. I especially liked how Emily's role was perceived with mental effort. Despite some other review of the false information users, the actor, Taylor Roberts, played a role precisely and without clich√©s. The challenge was also Fran Kranz, whose natural simplicity was complemented by seasonal veterans. Although the direction hit here or there, it seemed that the only problems were the underdeveloped script. What might have worked well for the production could not be left out on the screen quite well. Nonetheless, Paul Ryan is a beautiful cinematic art, but also a pace of film that is surprisingly slow. I recommend this movie to six-foot football fans and also to simple action and cinematic fans.
