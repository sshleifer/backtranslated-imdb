I saw The Couch Trip (1988) for the first time on late-night television years ago and fell in love immediately. The funny thing is that I usually try out all the comedies made, but I've never heard it until I saw it. Dan Ackroyd is a plain and simple mountainous period. She has made a few good films with Belush and don't forget Saturday night. But I think the Couch Trip is probably his best and more fun. With the good support of Charles Grodin, David Clennon and Walter Matthau, this cinema's comic gold is illuminated. Ackroyd's wife Donna Dixxon is doing a good job. The favorite moments of the movie are Ackroyd and David Clennon's career Lawrence Baird. These two played well together. So if you haven't seen good comedies, take a trip in 1988 and rent or buy The Couch Trip. I just did, Amazon 78 cents. Which deal is too bad, I got a hit of 2.50 points. Oh well still worth it. Every man loves to control this flick.
