I love how he experimentes. Ab Tak Chappan had the pleasure of watching the same amount of Satya and the company. Jatin, the new comer, also lived his role and Nana Patekar was his best. Suchak was really irritating, but I think he fits his character - he had really tough teeth. The story is very successful and no movie story improves it. I wish he would sign Urmila for his other future films. I think they are the best director and the combination of actors I've seen. I haven't seen Naachat yet, but I'm looking forward to it. For some reason, Antra Paint, who is fascinating to view the screen, does not see Urmila.
