Blademaster is definitely a memorable entry in the Swords and Sorcery movies. I found Blademaster with Quest for the Mighty Sword at a sustainable shop with mentally disabled people and was very happy to pay them â‚¬ 2.00. Religious sets and costumes, a good sword fight and a beautiful female warrior, Mila makes it an enjoyable watch. Some of the problems, however, were that the plot had many details that didn't fit, like the cave men. I didn't understand their purpose. This film could also have really benefited from some monsters. The snake was cool, but I think it borrows slightly from Conan. However, I have any primitive film where someone hangs with the hanger (see the Battle of Yor and Endor). I think Ator is cool! Oh, and has anyone reminded Gallag about the villain or is it just me? I'll give blademaster 7/10
