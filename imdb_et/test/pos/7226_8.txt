Who else than Troma can get the classic tragedy and change it to today's standard? Someone ... in my opinion Leonardo DiCaprio one suck. Tromeon & Juliet is a sure stretch from the original Shakesperan tragedy, but it keeps it well. His sick, demented, twisted, but amazingly funny and perfect. In most cases, it follows the real Romeo and Juliet story, but has added many Troma elements. Does Keenan give an excellent result as Tromeo. Operation is sure and the story is great. Many people watch these films, not just Kaufman Troma movies, but all those they distribute. Of course, Troma movies have acquired a taste, but some of them need to be seen. This is the best way to film renegate.
