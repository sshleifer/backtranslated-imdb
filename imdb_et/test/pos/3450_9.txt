Sorry, the poor supervisor who didn't like / doesn't understand this wonderful movie. What a sad life he must lead! <br /> <br /> This film speaks more about life and relationships than most I've ever seen, but it's not dark or preaching like "ordinary people". This is mostly humorous, though not technically comedy. <br /> <br /> The whole thing looks a bit like a fantasy, maybe the Shakespeare's "John's Day Dream". Beautiful, intelligent women are abundant, with excellent cinematography and not an offensive scenario that doesn't miss. <br /> <br /> I expect it every time it is restarted with a movie cable. It's like a favorite, valuable book.
