If you are looking for a modern Buster Crabbe or Johnny Weismuller film version to overcome the mechanisms of unscrupulous, white safaris or insidious black tribes, then saving the animal kingdom is not a movie for you. This is the idea of ​​Tarzan's "legend" from the beginning to the conditions of intelligent adults. It's beautifully filmed and loyal to Edgar Rice's Burroughs. <br /> <br /> Tarzan is not a silver hero, but a man who is torn between the two worlds - natural and civilized. As a result of stunning, Christopher Lambert represents this doubt with absolute realism. If he slips right after the cat is out of the bag: the audience laughs (especially the adult audience directed at the film) and the film loses its grip. It falls into the depths of the cheese. But Lambert will never let it happen. (Forget about what you think of other movies when I saw it in my movie in my original edition, I thought he was earning an Academy Award.) Supporting casting is equally great, as other commentators have pointed out. I disagree with most of them that I didn't find anything wrong with Andie McDowell's performance. I wouldn't call her an academic award - this role is demanding - but she's totally against it. I don't know why his voice was too burnt. <br /> <br /> The African story movie movie is absolutely beautiful. This includes both the beauty of the African desert and the exotic expectations of their collective imagination who have never been there. The landscape is lush and exotic, and the colors are vivid. Costumes are outstanding. The soundtrack is beautiful without being overwhelming or confusing. <br /> <br /> Some disturbing scenes - especially for animal lovers - but no more annoying than some scenes Dancing with wolves. This is a great film about the conflict between civilization and nature, personalized by the young Lord Greystoke, which Christopher Lambert convincingly depicts.
