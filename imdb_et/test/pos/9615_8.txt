The creation of a skeleton is that the main character must win a public kung fu tournament with a high stake. The story of the flesh consists of the LOT fight, the triangle of love, betrayals, rivals and revenge. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of story here. The main character is a very pleasant, even tempered, easy-going and very tough boy. A good and bad film is just as good as the villains and the main villains are harsh and intelligent, not to mention ugly, potty and complicated. <br /> <br /> If there is one weakness, this is where the Groom's main character depicts him and the protagonist who runs toward each other in a flourishing field and hugging them when they meet. I thought I was watching the second and almost lost hope of the sound of music on the film. Fortunately, the movie quickly recovered in the fight.
