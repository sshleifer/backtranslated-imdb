Tom Clancy uses "Alesandr Nevsky" in his book "Red Storm Rising". The book showed Nevksy in theaters across Russia, which was the beginning of the Soviet invasion of West Germany. I felt I had to go through it. It was great! The cinema was excellent and hopefully unbelievable. I do not regret watching this movie and add it to my collection.
