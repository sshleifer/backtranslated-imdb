Kinks warned the media about heroes. Outside movies, most heroes are also "ordinary people". Society demands a certain role to play, but what happens when it extends to the parent-child relationship? Are some parents trying to improve themselves through their children, not the other way around? How do you give a role model but not a role? An excellent swimmer who hates to swim; a great musician who doesn't play. Amazing, funny (despite depicting "serious" problems), very good multidimensional action by everyone. Emotional tension is complemented by a lot of land. Celluloid heroes never feel pain. I never remember that Sigourney Weaver's film is disappointed (I even liked The Village!).
