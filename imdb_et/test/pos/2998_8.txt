I don't want to do so many "hers" comedies, and I may not care for it if it wasn't for the participants when it was done, and when I first saw it (just a few years later). It is almost too similar to "Happening" (although this is obviously much less serious comedy than it is) - the mafia figure takes over its robbery or rather changes it differently. Of course, Raquel Welch did not play the sharp character that Faye Dunaway did in Happening, but it doesn't make it into a sexist movie - he practically played a stock symbol, almost a "minor" version of HER! But I'm totally biased - this is one of the first movies I ever saw with him, and while I saw it, you couldn't turn around without seeing it (luckily). I think Robert Wagner was really right as the group's very pleasant or unpleasant leader, such as Edward G. Robinson (of course) and Vittoria De Sica. And Godfrey Cambridge, an actor who was always able to be funny.
