Having seen many other Wong Kar-Wai movies (Happy Together, Fallen Angels, Ashes of Time), I knew what to expect in the theater; cinematography would be lush, the use of space and perspective would be diverse, functioning great, and at least one character would be unnecessary loneliness. After all, these are the techniques that make Wong Kar-Wai art what it is. I did not expect the extent to which I was drawn to a film that some reviewers rejected and forced those symbols who "knew consumption". <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it is interesting how people who are so vigorously displayed by emotions and settings are so inconceivable that many of us take for granted or work in oblivion to forget: the injustice resulting from betrayal; the guilt that came from the idea of ​​not being right as a betrayer; everyday but deeply intimate moments in relationships where the need to express themselves orally is superfluous. This is what Wong Kar-Wai is trying to portray in the film and what he does so well. <br /> <br /> Too many Americans consume the need for the film to be full of stock dialogue at any given time; witty fraud, reckless sarcasm, and resurrected confessions appear to be the top of the "best" American film. Wong Kar-Wai sees things very differently. Instead of the character that needs the audience to know about every feeling, perception or belief, the Wong characters clearly make their feelings and understandings with facial gestures, body positioning, and, yes, silence. <br /> <br /> Viewers simply think of this film in terms of character development and action, so they may be disappointed with what it offers. If they are ready to try and give intuition, then what they feel, they may look quite different from what Wong offers them.
