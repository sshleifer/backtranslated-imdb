My friends and I saw it at the black film festival in San Diego. It was great. Stormy is a strong black woman and Nana reminds me of her grandmother. <br /> <br /> Rene is FINE !!! Seeing her take off the clothes was definitely worth the entrance price. Does anyone send me their contact information? <br /> <br /> Your friend thinks Flex is finer in terms of these two. He has been a fan of Flex for years, so he can be a bit biased. Relatives were funny and as insignificant as Nana described them. LOL. <br /> <br /> I am looking forward to seeing this movie again.
