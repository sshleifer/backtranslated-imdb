Frankly, this is probably the best book in my Jazz Singer soundtrack version. The 1927 version is indeed a silent film, despite being built first. <br /> <br /> Danny Thomas is a great comedian and he sings very well. He does Jewish things with feelings. Peggy Lee is great and every one of his films is always fun. Allan Joslyn is not too much fun and we would have been without him. One question: when do Cantors live in such luxury houses?
