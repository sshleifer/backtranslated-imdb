This is a great old-fashioned Christmas favorite that I try to catch on TV every year. It revolves around Martha Stewart, as a journalist Elizabeth Lane, who is charmingly depicted by Barbara Stanwycki. But contrary to Marta, this lady is a fake with no home skills. Other cast members perform this story effectively and include Dennis Morgan (Jefferson Jones), Reginald Gardiner (John Sloan) and Sydney Greenstreet (Alexander Yardley). <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Lane is a journalist who writes food, depicting herself as a happy housewife with children. In fact, she is a woman who lives in a New York apartment and can't boil an egg. His recipes have been borrowed from his Hungarian chef friend Felix. Elizabeth goes along with fraud until her magazine publisher Alexander Yardley decides that she wants a nice old-fashioned country for Christmas, and invites her to visit him, bringing him back to the war hero Jefferson Jones, a sailor who was in a ship accident. . Yardley requires the full honesty of his staff. Elizabeth borrowed from her long-time architectural director John Sloan, from home in Connecticut County, a bored man who has long sought marriage. He also borrowed a neighbor's child (actually several) to leave him and his wife as Sloan. <br /> <br /> Of course, this scenario makes a lot of fun. It is a comedy of screws and a charming romance, accompanied by a Christmas atmosphere. When I think of this movie, I depict snowflakes, a beautifully decorated tree, a fire in a fireplace, turkey roasting and a Christmas tree baking. new version? I understand that in 1992 Arnold Schwarzenegger's staged version, featuring Dyan Cannon, Kris Kristofferson and Tony Curtis. I have never seen or wanted this modern adaptation. This old favorite is perfect just as it is, and the holiday "must see" with its wonderful life, white Christmas, a miracle on the 34th street and of course all Christmas song versions.
