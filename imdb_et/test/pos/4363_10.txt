This movie is great! Fear of watching documentaries? Cancel your shrinkage and see a little about Dieter's story. You don't think this exquisite part of making a movie is as long as you've experienced it. I would like to say that it goes out with almost every Vietnamese war movie, including the Apocalypse now. It's a real story, it's a personal story, a story of flying love, a dream to be a pilot and a nightmare over the enemy territory. Everybody strikes the style "back ...", Herzog asking questions, Dieter gives them a memorable German-English accent and a subtle memory, referring to what happened about 25 years ago. It is the part I told my friends over and over again: he saved his US Navy from the plane, Dieter becomes the force of Vietcong. For most of the days, he has been incredibly tilted through miles and miles of Southeast Asian jungle barefoot. Tortured, insulted, disoriented, hungry and infected with infectious diseases, they arrive in a small friendly village for spending the night. The next morning, after several hours of walking, Dieter discovers that someone stole his wedding ring from his finger. That is all. He won't take any more. He starts to cry, due to exhaustion. Vietcong men react surprised. Dieter can explain what happened. The group immediately returns to the village and starts looking for a stolen person. They find a man, instantly their finger and start to go back to Dieter. - The film is full of these desperation and surprising situations. The whole film can be characterized by enormous cultural differences, an eastern and western clash, an unknown fear (i.e., everything that, on the one hand, marks America, on the other hand, the Asian jungle and its secrets). Back to Problems? Because you were sitting on the edge of your seat for two hours and didn't notice.
