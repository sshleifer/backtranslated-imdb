I was surprised that I got this TV on Friday, and I enjoyed it. Between the presence of Bobbie Phillips and numerous references, everything that could be considered a "cyberspace" was a fun movie. I liked the story that reminded me of a book I read ("Earth", David Brin) and was fun to see on television. Bobbie looks good, but I also enjoyed his work with Kamina because he seemed different from the others. But the biggest thing about this film was the atmosphere described in the books of Gibson, Sterling and others. It was just fun to see it on television.
