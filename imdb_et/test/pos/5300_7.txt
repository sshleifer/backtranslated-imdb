Hayao Miyazaki's newest and eighth film studio for Ghibili, "Gake No Ue No Ponyo" (Ponyo Seafront) is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood. At a time when the film's animation seems to have been dominated by Disney / Pixar CGI masterpieces, it is so refreshing and comforting to know that Miyazaki still relies on traditional hand-drawn animation to talk about its charming and enchanting stories. <br /> <br /> The story turns to the friendship between the magical seagull / goldfish and the human child he experiences during a curious departure to see the world. The human child, Doi Hiroki, lives in a small house under a rock overlooking the small port city of southern Japan (based on Seto Island), where he lives with his young mother Lisa (Yamaguchi Tomoko). Sosuke calls the strange goldfish "Ponyo" and takes it to the daycare / nursing center that Lisa works for. Ponyo is definitely not your typical goldfish and will soon begin to adapt and take on the human aspects (he develops the human speech and the lamb appetite) by choosing Sosuke's finger-cut blood. <br /> <br /> But as Sosuke and Ponyo begin to develop the bond, Ponyo returns to his father Fujimoto (Tokoro Joji), a former man who has rejected the surface of the world and is now trying to collect and develop magical elixirs from the sea, to help him improve and rejuvenate the world's oceans. <br /> <br /> Ponyo's desire to become a human has become so strong that Fujimoto is no longer able to hold him and takes on more human looks and breaks freely from his aquatic environment and goes back to see Sosuke. <br /> <br /> Ponyo unintentionally releases a cache of magic elixirs from Fujimoto during sailing, triggering all sorts of magical sea animals that cause a severe storm in the seas around Sosuke. Desperately for solving the Ponyo rebellion, he quickly calls on his beautiful wife, Ponyo's mother-to-water elementary, mother / Lady of Sea (Amami Yuki). <br /> <br /> Like previous films, Miyazaki's "Gake No Ue No Ponyo" concerns various ecology and environmental issues, this time focusing on the health and vitality of the world's oceans. The open deck is sometimes fun when Ponyo meets a ship that scrapes the ocean floor, discovering garbage and garbage in the mountains. One can understand the anger and frustration of Fujimoto's character, who has spent his lifetime to cure civilization damage to his oceans, but found it frightening and almost infertile. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to not get this movie with remarkable animation. It is sometimes odd and outrageous but at the same time charming and curious. It is clear that Miyazaki wanted to capture the meaning and style of the child's imagination. The art style has crayons and pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fancy. It's almost like a child's colorful book in life. <br /> <br /> Children's actors Nara Yuria and Doi Hiroki do a great job with Ponyo and Sosuke. They bring divine charm to their roles. Especially Nara Yuria sounds as cute as Ponyo, that it is little wonder that Doi Sosuke falls on a magical girl. The former campaign girl / model and actor Yamaguchi Tomoko (Shichinin No Otaku, Swallowtail) is also a very good Sosuke's modern mother, Lisa. At first I was a little confused about her character because I thought she was Sosuke's older sister. It also didn't help Sosuke to keep her "Lisa" rather than her mother, but I think it's probably the time and indicator of a modern Japanese family (in the anime series Crayon Shinchan also refers to Shinnosuke) also by her mother's first name). <br /> <br /> The 80's comedian Tokoro Joji sounds completely different from the serious Fujimoto, but wisely does not make his character sound cartoon or terrible. Although we no longer know our character, the former baseball player and actor Nagashima Kazushige (who depicts Sosuke's father Koichi) also has some good voices. The theme of the opening of the Japanese soprano Masako Hayashi "Umi No Okasan" is just beautiful and confusing. In contrast, Fujimaki's Fujioka and Nozomi Ohashi "Geke No Ue No Ponyo" theme is light and amusing and invites traditional Japanese nursery clothes. In one spectacular sequence, the soundtrack takes almost all of Wagner's opera sound that sounds like "Die Walk√ºre". <br /> <br /> The film is not perfect and suffers from the moment when Ponyo and Sosuke's central story takes a back seat to some fantastic visual images of Miyazaki. I also wanted us to have more time to study the relationship between Fujimoto's background and Sosuke and his father. <br /> <br /> Like "Kiki Delivery Service / Majo No Takkyubin", "Howl's Moving Castle", "Princess Momonoke / Momonoke Hime" and "My Neighbor Totoro / Tonari No Totoro", "Gake No Ue No Ponyo" is another classical Miyazaki class that is a wonderful party in the eyes. Like today's fairy tale, the film speaks of a timeless story of friendship and love that will certainly be appreciated in the coming years.
