Kirk and the team visit the Federation's mining colony on a rich planet with mineral resources. The devil in the dark is Horta, a very unusual silicon-based life form that tunnels through a solid stone. Horta kills the miners and decides to destroy it. But how? <br /> <br /> This review is difficult to continue without writing a spoiler, so I just focus on the technical aspects of the episode and touch on its topics. Special effects are OK, but many Horta scenes are a bit absurd. TOS is relatively average. Some miners are a little uncomfortable. Nimoy has the hardest role in the evil darkness, and he pulls it out well. <br /> <br /> Why is it still my favorite? <br /> <br /> The devil in the dark is actually an anthropological and ecological morality that is hidden in adventure. More than many episodes of this great TV series, which highlights the importance of maintaining an open mind and at least some empathy for others. Plus, it includes one interesting, if not likely, plot reversal of the original series. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
