Jack Webb's movie "The D.I" came from a real-life study of the deaths of many trainees on the island of Paris in the 1950s. As always, Webb, who is his patriot, came to the defense a lot like all his other exhibitions. I actually found this movie to the 1957 standards. I serve in the army and understand how intense the training is on the island of Parris (death of some camps) so that this film will never be as close as "Full Metal Jacket". I think it's a good movie that is more patriotic than it is. But again, think of the time it was done (1957) and what would be allowed and said on the film at that time. I've always found that Jack Webb is clean and very loyal. I know many have criticized this film as unilateral and government propaganda. If you feel this, check out "Full Metal Jacket" with Lee Ermey. I'm a Webb fan and I enjoy the movie's value, not its accuracy. As I said, Webb believed in this country and held institutions with high moral standards (LAPD-Dragnet, Adam 12, Emergency, etc.). Just sit back and enjoy this very rigorous moral time in this country. Don't be too decisive for Mr Webb. Mark Lockwood Lubbock Texas
