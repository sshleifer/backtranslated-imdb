When I first saw the poster of this film, I left it out as a second low-budget film directed at young people. A few days later, when it finally reached the theaters, one of my friends said it was good. <br /> <br /> A year later, for the first time I saw an ad, Anand went on TV and was briefly switching over to channels and for a moment when I stopped watching and that was that I finally watched the whole movie. <br /> <br /> And now, 3 years later, I watched the movie at least 7-8 times and I don't watch movies again and again! <br /> <br /> This movie is great because it tries to be different when all the Telugu movies consisted of 6 songs and 4 struggles. <br /> <br /> This is a simple movie, a bit slow, but very engaging scenario, the movie is not over, the very well-experienced dialogues that are really hard Music is both classic and soothing, great for Radha Krishna's deliveries some great kirtanas also come to bgmusika, through the movie. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is worth mentioning. Editing is not slippery, but enough for romantic as it is. <br /> <br /> But what really blows you in this movie is two things: 1. How each scene is very honored, now Shekar Kammula. <br /> <br /> 2. The locomotive's beautiful songs. Another thing deserves special mention, Kamalini, part of his success, attributed to Sunitha to give him such a beautiful voice, to say, the voice makes a miracle to me. <br /> <br /> Other actors, equally good, with Raja's character and little girl, and how she screams when she gets a new dog. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, I can tell you that this movie will soon be the second classic classic classic romantic, with Kammula's second classic-romantic Godavari.
