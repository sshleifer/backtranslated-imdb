As I said in previous comments, some programs exist to make them "light entertainment". So I'm somewhat disappointed when commentators seem to be waiting for a program that reveals the meaning of life, you don't get it from Cleopatra 2525 and it doesn't require it. What you get is a girl who was frozen and alive about 500 years later, and her adaptation to this new life is realistic. He is not within 10 minutes, because what happens to adventures traveling in other times, and he is not a James Bond female equivalent who is ready to come to all the entrants. Cleopatra is surrounded by new ones and scares some of the weapons on the screen. most of us would be. But this is a light entertainment, with stories beginning in the middle and late fast times, and they are surprisingly good. Especially Cleopatra's double episode moves and Jennifer Sky thinks she will give one of the best long-lasting dead language and film and television powder I know. Finally, to prove my sincerity, I've bought everything except four episodes, and I'm completely satisfied with my purchase. The only reason I don't have a complete set is because I bought other episodes before I realized there was one set. Victoria Pratt and Gina Torres reliably perform the trio and for Cleopatra 2525, for the ease of entertainment, I am sure to attract.
