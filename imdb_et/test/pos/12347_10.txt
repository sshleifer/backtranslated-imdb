A well-groomed, well-behaved teenager, Meg Tilly, has to spend the night in a spooky mausoleum as a high school club. The problem is a powerful psyche, named Raymar, who was buried just that day, but he is not quite dead and needs human vitality for his forces. <br /> <br /> Twilight horror movies offer a lot of excitement and chills, attractive and pleasant cast and best special effects. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> One dark night is valued for violence and adult issues.
