There's no word for that yet ... Fox sold it out without any marketing. No one in the country, except those who wait for this movie, knows anything about it. All red flags have flown. It must be a mess, it can't be as good as Office Space, right? Wrong. Although there is no office space, this film is definitely a satirical bite and a common sense. This is a certain level of attack, but who is the accused remains in the mystery. <br /> <br /> It can be said that nowadays theaters show that IDIOCRACY is a good movie. It's funny, sometimes ridiculous. It is effective, sometimes brilliant. What it is not as far as I say is over. We see something from this movie again, whether it is an extended cut or a restart. Only it can be fun. Sometimes it is ballsy. <br /> <br /> Leaving the theater, looking around the mall, I was surrounded by ads and billboards, commercialism and stupidity. It is not quite as dystopia as 1984, but this film is a ugly future for our culture. And it doesn't seem like anyone can do it. Anyway, look at it when you can, and try to find out what happened that it was so specifically buried.
