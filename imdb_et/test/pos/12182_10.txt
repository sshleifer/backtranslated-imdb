Personally I loved TRIS MOVIE! My best friend told me I rented it as I watched it. It's amazing! Music, actor, story telling emotions, everything ...... well, except one little fact. Absolutely no loyalty to books at all. I saw this movie before the interview with Vampire and before I even knew that books existed, I was shocked to find out how many people actually hated the movie. I hastened quickly that the book's fans were not satisfied with their dissatisfaction, didn't want to be hypocritical (I hate Harry Potter's films because of the lack of loyalty in the book), I stayed silent. Finally, I accepted the "Vampire Lestat" and immediately realized why everyone hated it. It's completely different (the Queen of the damned movie is a combination of "The Vampire Lestat" and "Damned Queen"). But I still loved the movie when I saw it before reading books. So if you haven't seen this movie or read a book, check out the movie first or hate it. When you read the book, you have the right to hate this movie.
