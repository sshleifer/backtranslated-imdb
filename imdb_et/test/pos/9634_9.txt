Many people have fun with Steven Seagals. And I really see why, if I remember Fire Down below. Well ... okay his other movies are acceptable (in relation to his example!). <br /> <br /> Having read the comments about Patriot, I didn't expect anything from this movie. I just looked under Fire Down and I read a lot about The Patriot being even worse. So I was very surprised about it. In my opinion, this is one of his best films. If it had more action sequences and a few more fighting scenes, it would be the best. I liked the story of the leader and the actors. Cammilla Belle was just incredible. He has a great film career in the future. Some scenes of action were very well done. And Steven Seagal was very credible in his unusual role.
