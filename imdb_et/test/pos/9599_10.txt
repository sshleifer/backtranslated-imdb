I'm not a fan of football in any way, but I looked at it with a friend because there was nothing in the box at that time. We laughed not only from beginning to end, but about a week later in the pub when we started to discuss it, we made the right spectacle with an uncontrollable laugh. Does this slope actually exist? I have issued my email here, so if anyone hears about the future or repeats on TV, please let me know. Definitely a more fun thing I've seen on television !!! King Leek was good too! another Tim Healy classic
