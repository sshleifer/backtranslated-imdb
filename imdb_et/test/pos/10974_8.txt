No spot, secret agent, story that is fun, funny and plausible. Some of the film's producers / actors met in the theater. They seemed as personal as interesting as their characters on the screen. This movie may not be featured on TVs with high dollar advertising spots, but it's definitely worth watching. I've spent $ 8 on a movie ticket in many other movies that were not entertaining. I am looking forward to future projects by this production company.
