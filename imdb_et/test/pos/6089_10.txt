TEP is like a long cool drink of water after climbing all over the Sahara, to classic film boys who have lost this cinematic magic for too long! Not only is it beautifully captured, but the characters are portrayed perfectly. If you are looking for a movie as a mirror of a book, you are seriously disappointed. Instead, this book is a great companion, and I think it is planned by Anthony Minghella. Ralph Fiennes is probably the most beautiful man in the world; not to mention the brilliant actor. Juliette Binoche is a posterchild of vulnerability and childish enthusiasm. And of course, I'm watching a movie with Kristin Scott Thomas. She just has to be the best actor because she likes Deborah Kerr. So much was promised with this movie, and so much is being sent!
