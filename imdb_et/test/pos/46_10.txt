I watch this movie almost every night in HBO. In my opinion, it would have been successful in the theater, assuming that this advertising was top-notch. I was impressed by the actor who played the female. He is a prominent actor. Of course, my favorite actor is Terrance Howard. He is a very underrated actor and deserves much more credit than he has received. Ebony magazine made her a nice article, giving her some of her favorite ads. Lakawanna Blue gave me an understanding of the stories my parents tell us. They came from a similar city called "Philadelphia, PA" when they were having fun in a jockey and such. I would also like to say that Mos Def is an incredible actress. He has found his invitation. I have seen him in a number of films where he has played different roles, from the tavern to the doctor, and he has things! All in all, put Lakawanna Blues into the rental of the video.
