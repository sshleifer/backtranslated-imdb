I love it. Others have exposed spoilers, but I don't want to. It was an unusual assumption, actually kind of strange, but I went with it completely. Camille had a hard time pulling out a convincing part; maybe some people hated it. But I think Sienna was great and her acting skills allowed her to partially elbow without being sombre or ridiculous. I don't know why he was even interested in the loser, like James Franco, but he still married. I like her actor and thought she was doing a terrible job. He has nothing to be ashamed of. There have been movies with similar settings, e.g. "Ghost". I just love Sienna Miller and went with the script written situation. I feel that his great acting talent is greatly underestimated and I hope that the public will recognize it more. I thought all the actors played their parts very well and I hope more people will see the film. I highly recommend it. I was surprised that about 10 copies of my local Buster store were available. I will definitely buy it.
