Shelley. <br /> <br /> John Jake's successful paper novel "North and South", "Love and War" and "Heaven and Hell" was in 1988 - 1987 in a mini-television series. A similar civil war era / slavery soap opera was on television in the 70s about a decade earlier. Patrick Swayze, at the beginning of his career and at the time he was dealing with many films such as Dirty Dancing, which made him famous, stars like Orry Main, a young man from South Carolina, who is based in West Point. Here he meets George Hazard (James Read), who should be a hated enemy, Yankee North, but with whom he closely ties. Soon the southern nets and the northern threats will become friends, even though the troubled time of the civil war. The topic of family, friendship, and the right things, even when the crowd was falling apart, is otherwise a soap opera filled with this activity and romance. Clariss and Ashton (Jean Simmons and Teri Garber) represent a nurse who becomes enemies when one of them marries Yankee Billy Hazard (John Stockwell. Garber's bitchy, seductive, manipulative, ambitious and wicked Ashton is fun to watch the screen.) what we see is its shortened version and they changed some things to make it a sort of historical romance with a story. where abolitionist and feminist Virgilia Hazard (Kirstie Alley) loses her life with love, former slave Grady, Fort Sumter, Vicksburg, Antietam, Gettysburg, Appomatox, and we are at the White House, where we see Abraham Lincoln (Hal Halbrook) in the battle for their conscience, with prominent players such as Lee, Grant, Sherman, Jackson and Davis, many Golden Age veteran Hollywood actors - Robert Mitchum, Elizabeth Taylor and Olivia De Ha on the campfire have fun and see. This is not a historical fact, it is a historical FICTION and purely dramatic entertainment. But it also has the end of quarries and beautiful cinematography, costumes and places. It's like watching an epic movie that lasts longer than Gone With The Wind with war scenes in it! The script may be bad from time to time and action may not be good, despite good casting. Swayze casts it as Terri Garber, but some performances, such as Kirstie Alley, James Read (George Hazard) and Leslie Anne Downes, like Madeline, are really good performances. They shot the set and southern places. The music is enchanting and it is a good movie, where we sink for good boys and look at the villain's scheme and finally get our results. This is to be observed by all fans of the Civil War films and the Jessian novels. It is available on DVD and VHS.
