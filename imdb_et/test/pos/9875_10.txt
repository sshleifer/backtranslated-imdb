Wow, "Michael Myers Curse" by a great movie. An exciting, fun, creative and smart plot that I love. Many hate the Thorn concept, I love it. I think this will give the Halloween series a plot. Marianne Hagan is a great actor and turns to great performance, especially for her first film and Paul Rudd and Donald Pleasence. My only complaint is why not Danielle Harris in this movie Jamie? He wanted to come back, but the manufacturers said no. I thought J.CC Brandy was great, but I love Danielle Harris. Still, I love the curse of Halloween: Michael Myers. I think Shape's mask looks best in this movie and George P. Wilbur is the best Michael Myers. Incredibly horrible and halting, Halloween 6 rules! <br /> <br /> I love this very violent but enormously enjoyable movie. Halloween Horrors - The Best of the Genre. <br /> <br /> Of the 10 in 10.
