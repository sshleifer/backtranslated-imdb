Lady and Tramp II: Scamp Adventure I think that is a good movie, but I think the first lady and the tramp movie is better because it's original and I think the original movies compared to sequences are better. Lady and Tramp ii retreat after the original, but this time the junior and Lady and the Tramp adolescent (scamp) are always hated with what they have to do, following the rules of the house, taking away all the bathroom. time and taking things nice and light, cries of anger and runs away with bulk packed dogs. Scamp meets another dog called Angel, they both can do well and do the things mother and mother did when taking Italian food (Spaghetti and meatballs, etc.). Later, Scamp understands that she is loved by her family, her special palm. child, candle comes back and Angel has joined the family. I'll give this movie out of 10 out of 10.
