It is rare for a movie to sweep you through your world and leave you with more credit. Such a film is Hayao Miyazaki Ponyo. <br /> <br /> Film is the story of a young goldfish Ponyo who wants to become a human. She swims to the shore and finds a young boy named Sasuke, who promises to take care of her. Of course, Ponyo's father, an ecologically affiliated witch named Fujimoto, is trying to keep Ponyus human to maintain the balance of nature that eventually descends when Ponyo finally turns into small girls, causing a massive typhoon. <br /> <br /> Ponyo is a very rich movie. It is full of wonderful fantasies, lovable characters and a true heart. What Hayao Miyazaki has done here tells a simple story while making an authentic film magic. <br /> <br /> Ponyo is an enchanting experience. Sasuke and Ponyo love are very pure and true. Also, Miyazaki's environmentalist in this film is still as obvious as any of his earlier works. Miyazaki shows dirt and dirt that get into the ocean's almost amazing light, not to mention Ponyo's father in an obsessive mission to clean the world's oceans. Although the story is simple, Miyazaki can add this extra layer to provoke skill. <br /> <br /> Film is a beautiful piece of art, every hand-drawn cell is wonderful pastel. The film is very different from other Studio Ghibli productions, but the artistry is still as remarkable as ever. The underwater scenes are just beautiful, the Fujimoto sea fortress is very inventive, and the order in which Ponyo runs through the jumping fish in the typhoon to reach Sosuke is an icon. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is a wonderfully executed character that makes this movie a memorable experience. Sosuke is a young boy who acts as a parent when he really is, and energetic Ponyo is laughing at me. Every character is just as enjoyable and memorable. <br /> <br /> In general, Ponyo is a wonderful experience that fascinates every single way. Although the film can be sold as a children's fairy tale, I believe many adults wipe their fantastic world with their children. Although the film may have some density of some of Miyazaki's previous works, it keeps it clean and simple, being in front of itself, offering a funny, warm-hearted and fun movie. This is a great movie. <br /> <br /> I give Pony a perfect 10 out of 10!
