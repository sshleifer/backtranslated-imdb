Analyzing "Trois couleurs: Blanc", I wrote that its tone is much lighter than the "Trois couleurs: Bleu" tone. I think it's the same with the same movie. This time it is not a tragic comedy element, but much more because the main character is Valentine. Although her boyfriend lives abroad and is ridiculously jealous, she drives the lightness and optimism of her life, it seems to me that she can be Kieslowski's idea of ​​a carefree youth. The opposite seems to be a judge who is a very pessimistic, terrible old man who experiences great loneliness. In my opinion, Valentine and the judge are quite similar to each other, the judge is much older and has experienced many more disappointments. They share a different kind of naivety and both discover that they can learn a lot from others. Finally, I would like to emphasize Irène Jacobi's performance, rounding off the stunning women's contribution to the "Three Colors" trilogy.
