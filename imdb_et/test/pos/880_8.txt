Jewel Thief is a * Bollywood criminal thriller and why shouldn't it be? It is led by India's Cinema Vijay Anand ("Johny Mera Naam" and "Teesri Manzil"), the largest exhibitor of criminal thriller art. I can watch this movie for the following reasons (in order of importance): <br / 1 <br /> 1 Vijay Anand Direction 2 RD Burman Music 3 Dev Anand 4 Vyjayanthimala 5 Ashok Kumar 6 Majrooh Sultanpur's Words <br /> <br /> Even Jewel Thief is not a Bond Movie, it is definitely a bond babes. Helen, Tanuja and the mysterious Vyajanthimala (and some came.) But our sauvé Vinay (Dev Anand) is nothing but Bond. He is in control of most of the story and goes where the story is almost always confused. He even flirted with Anju (Tanuja) who tries to hit his romantic nerve so he gets to work in his father's shop. <br /> <br /> Dev Anand may have a double role - well I don't want to ruin my movie or else I would have told you. That's what most of the mystery is. Dev Anand works in a jewelry store and is a robbery when she should be at work - although it is not or at least she has a perfect alibi. We don't know who did it, this is Dev Anand as "Vijay" the person he claims to be, or this "Amar" someone we haven't seen yet, but many people say he's the same. It must be Shalu (Vyjayanthimala), who even claims that he is his fiancé, in a tough situation, Dev Anand must prove that he is Vinay and not Amar. While everyone is wondering if Dev Anand is Vinay or Amar, he is asked to remove his socks. Amar, who has been told, has one leg of 6 digits. Even though we look at breath, the events of Dev Anand that are about to open will even be a joke. <br /> <br /> Real Life Brothers Director Vijay Anand and actress Dev Anand have a lot of movies between them, it's not the best of them, but definitely the best Crime Thriller. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock's northwest is moments, but the movies are very different. Except for the confusion about who is who, deceptive female leader and much travel, there is not much similarity. Dev Anand can also be Amar, who is additionally Vijay. People have seen him, they identify him wherever he goes. There are too many of these people to be a scam. Finally, Vinay thinks it's better to be with Amar to find out what the truth is, and that is a sad mistake. It goes too deep, but it can be recorded in the cinema. <br /> <br /> When I looked at the film as a child, I wasn't sure to be amused, the confusion ended me completely. Even now there are parts of what I don't like, but I would still recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> Even as a child, I enjoyed the songs offered by this movie. "Yeh dil ..." - a definite canvas song with Kishor Kumar's voice. I heard "Roller gaya ..." all day. For Ditto "Amasma ke neeche", which is "under the sky" of Gangtok (at least the story shows it). "Raat akeli hai" is the sexiest song that comes out in Hindi cinema, where Tanuja is a seductress. "Meri taraf dekho" - Helen's cabaret and we look at her. "Hothon pe ..." - can now be a better song thriller than this. If the song goes on, we are more tense than ever and the words "hidden Shalu lips" add to it.
