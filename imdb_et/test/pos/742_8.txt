I'm not sure what intrigues me about this movie. It is grainy, poorly written, bleached, often ridiculous, and in many cases, it is understandably boring (the person I looked at was sleeping twice.) And yet there is something in this film that interests me, although I'm not sure what; maybe Sami, the former chief physician, has been lobotimized and has been permanently breastfed by the ice pope, a great character or an admirable head physician (I forget my name). <br /> <br /> Anyway, look at it and the form you think; it has one of the biggest film visions.
