Why this movie only appeared in four states is beyond me. I thought this movie was a divine story. The name says it all: seeing other people. This film is more logical than laughing, which I think it works so well. Common sense also appears in what seems to be another frenetic sex comedy. Alice starts to freeze the cold when she feels insecure about how she could get her groom not only sexually, but as a partner and friend, and so on. of them. One comes after another, because it wouldn't be a bad idea from the start. Funny dialogue and comics make this one funny as hell! Nicholson and Mohr made the film's tone early and prevent their promise. Other highlights include Lauren Graham, Andy Richter and Helen Slater (in their first theatrical film for 10 years!). Climax will turn crazy, but the simple ending makes it much more enjoyable than most movies today. Mohr fans see something different in their character, and fans of Helen Slater enjoy their quick, but very good return. Richter takes the prize for the most moral character. Romantic and funny or just fun. Seeing other people is a pearl to be noticed.
