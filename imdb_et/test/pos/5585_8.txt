I saw this movie as a child about 30 years ago and I have not forgotten it until now. I couldn't tell if it's a good picture. But these days I fell in love with Jean Simmons. Memories focus on the very erotic feel of the film, but I still remember the plot. Simmons was very young then, and there is another movie that gave me the same feeling: David Lean's Great Expectations. And again it was young Jean Simmons. Sorry, BLUE LAGOON is not available on video; I'd like to improve my memories ...
