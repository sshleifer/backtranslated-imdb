This is one of the most enjoyable teen movies I've ever seen (and what I wanted to publish on the video). It appeared in the same year as the second great comedy, where Tim Matheson played the role of "Animal House" (which is probably the reason it was overlooked). <br /> <br /> One of the most memorable parts of this movie would certainly be a soundtrack that could and should have been the official label issue. The Soundtrack has a lesser-known 70's action called High Inergy, whose song "We Are The Future" played a role in the movie's Prom scene. I remember buying a group album "Steppin 'Out" as a child mainly because of the look of the girls and not necessarily because of their musical talent. <br /> <br /> The final song is one of the best ballads I've ever heard. I wish I knew the name of the group so I could look for it somewhere in cyberspace. also enjoys.
