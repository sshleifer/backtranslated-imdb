Having been interested in Akhenaton for years, I was surprised to find out about this movie via E-bay and bought a copy of the DVD for 99p. I liked the movie, the twisted lines, and the fact that the file was mainly a main character, Sulhe makes a "family saga" rather than an action film. Costumes and details were remarkable during this time (1955). Rear-projection while driving a chariot now seems clumsy. My main interest was in the nature of Akhenaton and his monotheistic faith. In this film he was depicted as "Jesus" as he refused to fight with the Hethites even through their invaders Egypt and his ultimate void of negligence and political power. Initially, there is a connection between you, the one who was cast in the Nile River in the canopy, and the Moses of the Old Testament. However, this connection is undoubtedly the fact that it is fully investigated in a new film, where Moses' similar character carries the monotheistic religion of Akhenaton to the wider world if such a film were ever politically possible. It is generally accepted that women are worried when we are stupid creatures, but the relationship or lack of it between Sinuhe and Merit, the character played by Jean Simmons, is difficult to accept. And that Sophia, an educated physician, would be so shocked by Nefer that the "femme dead" of Babylon would give him the house of his adopted parents, and Tomb is not really plausible, nor would his parents even have a grave. In real life, Nefertitti was Akhenaton's wife. And although Horemheb became Pharaoh, it was for some other reason, including Tutankhamen, son of Achhenon. <br /> <br /> Of course this is just picking and the movie is enjoyable to watch and it's about Akhenaton and his monotheistic religion is a big bonus. Perhaps after this De Vinci Code book and movie, this central secret is the foundation of our current monotheism! I look forward to seeing this movie very much, there are already many books in this area.
