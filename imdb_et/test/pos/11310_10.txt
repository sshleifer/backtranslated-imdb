"Medusa: Dare to be Truth" is a terribly funny parody, a companion to the original, "Madonna: Truth or Dare". Julie Brown's brilliantly creative documentary of Madonna's creative artwork (although it wasn't exactly bold, incomprehensible, sincere, or true), precisely packed. I recommend it to Madonna fans, Julie Brown fans or anyone who enjoys a sharp and smart parody.
