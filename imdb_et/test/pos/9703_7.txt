This movie is almost as good as the first Jackass, but with a slightly more annoying sketch. I wouldn't say it was as good as the first, but it came very close. Jackass fans don't have to be disappointed, but if you don't like the first movie, you hate it. There are scenes that are seen as Jackass classics (older suits with "additions", "cab rides" and many others) and those you want you to never see (eating, drinking sperm etc.) Generally, this movie was a good view and I I'm glad I saw it. I'm sure this film doesn't have the best ratings because critics appreciate it (I sat in the press and most of the parents looked disgusting), but don't let it stop it.
