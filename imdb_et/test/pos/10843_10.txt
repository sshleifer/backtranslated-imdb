The BBC surpassed the boundaries they crossed with Velvet. Previously, they are "daring" with Dennis Potter's work, but this mini-series (as it was reviewed in the UK) is great. Andrew Davies's work is top-notch - I haven't read Sarah Water's novel, but I can imagine he's done it for real justice. I comment on the fact that most men have been following it - this was the main talking and sales point originally advertised. In fact, in the socialist lesbian half of the 19th century - the time when most thought it was an old man and the boys - well it was - lesbianism was mainly behind closed and often respectful doors. <br /> <br /> You can also look at Tipping The Velvet as a "love story" - in fact - as well as "self-discovery" that many gay / straight and straight people are going through and commenting and repeating time. <Br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it yet - either repeatedly on TV or DVD - get it - you can cure it - and even making and filming it is perfect. Just try to hide your redness in parts - as I said - is a "terrible" daily order - and avoid "phallus" or two! <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
