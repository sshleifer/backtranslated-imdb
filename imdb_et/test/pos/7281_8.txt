This is a very dark film that is somewhat better than the average shelter. It was much better than I thought it was a combination of a psychological thriller and a horror film. <br /> <br /> The voice of the phone is really horrible - this voice without the face, this unknown and threatening voice works very well in the movie because we never see the face of the killer on the spectator. <br /> <br /> Action and intercourse will not break, and after the first part of the movie it will become vertical; there is not a lot of gore in this movie, just to make the story, and the director also pays good attention to your attention. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 8/10 because of some clich√©s.
