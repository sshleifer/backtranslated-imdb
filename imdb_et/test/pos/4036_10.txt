I thought the story was very good. I liked this movie. If you intend to stick to Bridget Fonda on the film, you can just rot. I thought the looting of movie stars was a bad idea. Apparently no one thinks it. I liked the movie rather. I even mean buying it. I want this to be my first DVD in my room. So much I like it. I'd rather not start an online argument with someone I don't know and whether it's over the film. If someone could kindly defeat what they say about the story, I'd be happy to take back my offense. But if they feel I'm not worth taking back, I can just feel they're not worth it. But I can't control my activity, I can only encourage them in the right direction. Hey, they don't have to take back, but I would appreciate it.
