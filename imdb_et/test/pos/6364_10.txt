does anyone know why this movie is called a sofa trip? I looked at it just and I'm still not sure why this title was chosen, it was very funny and probably my favorite Dan Aykroyd's performance, which even strikes out of his Ghostbusters performance, which I've never heard of before I saw the sears- in the store I read back and thought it sounded good, that I bought it and when I finally got the chance to watch it, I thought it was better than what I was originally waiting for. this movie price is as good as the animal house and the national lamp holiday in my mind that I would like to write recent comedies and it was nothing sad to happen, and the bad things that happen are also funny parts if someone else knows this and wants read a comedy script for a movie that has no sad email at killer2511@hotmail.com
