This is one of many Techno-fobilist films that grew like mushrooms in the mid-1990s, after the Internet went into mainstream. <br /> <br /> Hollywood films have always been able to "decorate" images, make them better and more attractive. The same thing happens when Hollywood tries to show us hi-tech. The results of such experiments vary greatly from being drawn and ridiculous (see Hackers (1995), Johnny Mnemonic (1995), etc.) to being quite realistic (see Sneakers (1992)). <br /> <br /> Net is somewhere between these extremes. In nitpicking, it may end up with quite a lot of technical contradictions, and many cases where moves seem to be much more "sexy" and graphic than how things are in real life (as is usually the case in movies). br /> <br /> In spite of them, the viewer gets to a rather solid, entertaining movie despite it. Characters and acting are convincing and the film does a good job of keeping you in place until it finishes. The plot is okay (quite common, based indeed on password design, but this time with a high-tech edge) and quite convincing (again ignoring technical issues). The plot development, however, is a bit slow and sometimes you can predict some supposedly surprising turns in the plot. <br /> <br /> Here is a bonus pie, Sandra Bullock, which, moreover, is probably pretty simple, it is a solid act. You really know his character - his despair, his emotions. <br /> <br /> On the bottom line, the movie is entertaining and interesting, with my score about 10 on my scale. It is worth renting a video library or even watching a movie theater. Whether you buy it or not, it's up to you.
