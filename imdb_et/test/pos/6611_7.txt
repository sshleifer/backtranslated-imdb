This film earns a lot of praise, because although I am not a surfer or a skater, I was inspired by the entire documentary. <br /> <br /> The depth and development of these two extreme sports have emphasized what they were able to do for two groups of people. The commitment that these individuals were / is is truly inspirational and it was because others can now enjoy and do what these boys founded. <br /> <br /> Unlike most of the other documentaries, it was cleverly assembled, recorded for decades and preserved, and that's why some of the major edits I've ever seen have been put together, and the theme was targeted. Without being advised, they would go back to the most popular surfers and skateboards recently. <br /> <br /> The film explores areas such as success, achieving new tricks, racing competitions, and collecting celebrities. In addition to errors such as injury or burning. <br /> <br /> It was also when he heard experiences from skiers and surfers, not from other data. This resulted in a better picture. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, there is a truly outstanding effort.
