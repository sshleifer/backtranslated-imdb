The whole transcript allegedly more aware of this strange time is that you are "blue". Blue country mentality. This should lead us to our hook that has happened in our country (USA) in recent years. It doesn't get anyone out of the hook, but it makes us better, as if we could not benefit from living here in any way and get all the good things a US citizen becomes a US citizen. <br /> <br /> But I'm so sick about it. It does nothing good. I haven't been working much lately and I don't know how many people are. Maybe I am just left behind because my work was "ordered" last month and now I am looking for work in the area of ​​declining technical support, where most jobs are going to India and other countries. I think it will not be soon to be a citizen with a complex infrastructure and a shrinking labor market and a war. These days it seems that everyone who speaks, jumped and interviewed "patriotism" there. Anyway, back to this review: USA Film is a hidden DVD that makes me realize that some people have taken action, be it through politics, protest or art or media. The filmmaker is obviously passionate, aware, ready to go out, disappointed, unique, smart, etc. I looked through the entire site that is related to DVD and disappeared in all articles, essays, etc. that are there. The DVD also does this, referring to different times, views and historical points. Sometimes someone does something there.
