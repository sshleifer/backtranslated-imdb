Recently I saw this film at a 3D film festival in Hollywood. It was polarized 3-D (gray glasses were not red and blue) It was so fun to watch this movie with the audience, print was great and 3-D perfect. The performances were up and fun, the surprise came to an end (that we should not share with other members of the film, at least a movie trailer and poster), people were scared of laughter. According to today's standards, this is probably more comedy than horror, but with a 3-D extra dimension (with screened horse nets and bats), this movie was fun with 50-year-old horrors.
