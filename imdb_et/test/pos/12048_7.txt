I've seen a lot of Shahrukh movies and it's a very good role for him. She has such versatility, but she remains mainly in positive roles. She is very dark and disturbing, but I found a great deal of compassion for her. If anything else, look at this movie for Shahrukh. He plays very convincingly a very complex and real character. The story is very typical and has been done before, but character development is very strong and fun. The opening is a bit confusing, but it is not important at the end. The songs I found were very pleasing and give an idea of ​​what the characters think. Very smart. I think this movie was very good and suggested it to all Shahrukh Khan fans. It's black!
