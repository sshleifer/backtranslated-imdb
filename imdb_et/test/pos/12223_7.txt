I like this exhibition, but writers come, I can do something about it! Turn it on and off. You have a great concept and it can be much more. Miles (Jenkins) is great and plays as a child that age should work in a situation where she finds herself. Hey, creative with creatures, they may have telepathic power or other world power. The actors in the series are very good and convincing. Miles' parents seem to be too pointless about what is happening but to develop it! You have great seeds here and next season can have a whole new twist with lots of new characters and creatures and all kinds of clean sci-fi stuff. If they could make a series of witches, you should be able to do it for these beings and children.
