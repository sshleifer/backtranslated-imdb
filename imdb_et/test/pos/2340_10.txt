Seriously interesting, intelligent and thoughtful drama is his best. Medium, thrilling, moody and enchanting. Every home should have a copy! Don't take my word because it sees it myself. One lifetime puts you in your lifestyle and treatment with your family and friends. Beautiful photography and impressive drama are one of the best cinematographic experiences of the year. John Kielty's debut is a joy and adds true truth and realism to this deep and sharp film. This is a film that cares and holds honesty that has been unequal in recent years. Cars are not just a movie that is full of hum and our emotions. I saw this movie for the first time at the Edinburgh Film Festival in 2000 and I'm happy to have a copy on DVD.
