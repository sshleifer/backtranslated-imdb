I have to tell you the truth. The only reason I wanted to see this film was Rose McGowan. I think this part has definitely worked out ... quite well. But the film was also very good. Some parts of this movie are really good. <br /> <br /> The film also has a great deal of action. The mystery is quite difficult to figure out and Rose [McGowan] makes some "Oscar values" at the end of the movie, but I don't want to give up. Adam Beach and Jurgen Prochnow are also some other stars in the film. <br /> <br /> If you like mysteries or action movies or like Rose ... I think you'd like this movie.
