The three-part series ended last night in PBS, which I thought was his first extensive exposure to the American audience. The richness of this text and the unique quality of filming is high. It seems very novel to watch and hear the action game that uses the Georgian English folk art, Jane Austen's showrooms are the main example of this way of speaking. Yet it is a drama that transcends the senses, making the strange language perfectly in every scene. Such bold exposure to old reality reveals literary giants such as Tolstoy or Shakespeare, while entertaining in the form of a saga by C. S. Forester or Patrick O'Brian. The universality of man's general condition is at the heart of this. <br /> <br /> Talbot, the narrator, plays as an actress with the almost perfect name of Benedict Cumberbatch (certainly not even Dickens could win it!) alternating with stodgy yingoism and extreme vulnerability, a acting tour. Indeed, I cannot recall the errors of interpretation between this very fine. This is a tribute not only to the actors themselves, but also to the director. <br /> <br /> The most impressive element, however, is how well a military servant lives in Australia in the early 1800s. This is especially true of how the movement of a ship becomes almost a character, which is seldom taken into account as the background of the sea. Anyone who has ever personally experienced it will immediately recognize it and appreciate it even more difficult to recover in the context of filming. <br /> <br /> This is not fancy Caribbean pirates. Some effort must be made to understand this nuance.
