This is one of the biggest movies I've ever seen. Davey / Mr. Slaussen is at the same time: <br /> <br /> 1) Tortured for his talents (eg "I can check it out; I can! I shouldn't chase it! It's good!"); <br /> <br /> 2) Desperate with friends like <br /> <br /> "How is soup? <br /> <br />" Soup is very good. "<br /> <br />" Would you like some crisp soup? "<br /> <br />" I'd like some more crackers. "<br /> <br />" How's that? "<br /> <br /> "Yes, the soup is very good." <br /> <br /> 3) proud of your achievements (eg "Pretty clean trick, ah?") <br /> <br /> (eg "You are so beautiful. Why don't you like me?") and <br /> <br /> 5) Sometimes, very, very angry (eg "You can't get away!")) <br /> <br /> Connors should have received the best actor's award for this film. I mean, who was probably better?! Tanya Roberts rocked the stratosphere, following TT's performance. The stars of this masterpiece did not go to a brilliant career, I highly recommend it! is available at amazon.com Everyone should have it Make it a night and see a bowl of soup.
