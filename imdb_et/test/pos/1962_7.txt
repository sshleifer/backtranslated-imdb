Less than zero could have been the 80s film that exposes teenage apathy in the most extreme form when they actually held the damn book. But if they didn't, this film will do the job and will leave you with an amazing feeling if it happens in a way that wasn't done until the end of the nineties with "Kids" and "Bully" by Larry Clark. <br /> <br /> The eminent teenagers face a rather curious dilemma (they don't treat it quite similarly) when their stranger friend (Daniel Roebuck) prides themselves on killing a teenage girl near the edge of the river in their suburbs. Keanu Reeves may be the only civilized character who has any conscience, but others either do nothing about the girl's death or want to help her friend hide her body. <br /> <br /> I don't know who's more sick in this movie - Crispin Glover - who gets almost obsessed and pretty daddy trying to prevent a friend and hide the crime from the state. Dennis Hopper, senior drug dealer (who clings to a female slipper) who interacts with friends (naturally as a reseller) and suddenly attends events. Or, Josh Miller, who plays Reeve's little brother Tim. He seems to be the most apathetic to them, at least until the end of his emotional crackdown. Of course, this is definitely not a teenage ticket for the 80's. Certainly, it makes the case remarkably clear when these children (despite the strange series of events) deal with many great performances (even Reeves proved to be capable of acting). <br /> <br /> Help yourself to comedy to recover if it's too harsh.
