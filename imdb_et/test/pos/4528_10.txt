How much do I have to write about this movie before I get it right? Tom Conway completely suppresses this Falcon coat from his actual brother George Sanders with this record. Conway travels from New York to Miami to find beautiful double-decker, one-button, superb, superb and 110% cars with huge fender skirts and smoky doors. The formula that industrial diamonds do not fall into the wrong hands. His "client" is cute, Miss Louisa Briganza, who has got great hair but lets you kiss her in just the first two months. Along the way, he moves into a set of colored characters that can only be provided by B-film. His contest at this outing is probably the best Falcon binder among Edward Brophy, like Goldie Locke, who has been given really funny lines. She runs Doris Blanding, which is the type of 40's chicks. His cohort is Benny, played by Steve Brodie, who, twenty years later, was a Presley punching bag in two Paramount King films. They work both with cold fish and boat trips with Kenneth Sutton, who is ready to do what he needs to get a formula when he travels to Brazil. What ever happened to the closest policemen involved in Falcon, this entry is still the highest. Forget those 120-minute melodramas, give me one hour Falcon movie. I have a wife and two children - who has time for a two-hour movie? Shake some dry martini and forget your woes with this great Falcon movie. But if you didn't record local television in Toronto like I did 17 years ago, you're in luck.
