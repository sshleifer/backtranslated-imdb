I totally agree with GarryJohal about Singapore's comments on this film. Quote: 'Yes, non-Singapore people don't see what this movie is great for. Some references in this movie fly directly over the head of foreign observers and mostly the Singaporeers are actually "getting". It is still not the truth and, as Malaysia-China, I get it, although I am not talking about Hokkien because we also have similar problems in Malaysia. I know it's really hard to understand and really accept it, but it is certainly not a real story. I was delighted to see this movie outside of Malaysia, because it is definitely forbidden in Malaysia. That means you get it "illegally copied to VCDs or DVDs" or you expect someone to share it on the Internet. It is not a "second violent teen drama ......." because it is a reality in Singapore (and also Malaysia) in an interesting way (sad + humor). I was a little sad to know that this film was about 20 censorship cuts. What waste!
