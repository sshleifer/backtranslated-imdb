I love this movie !! Of course I love it because Madonna, but who cares - it's fucking funny !!! * ALANiS Rocks *. When I first saw it for the first time in 1987, I thought it was fun! Madonna is so funny and I love her dubbed accent and crazy / funky look. A more fun part of time is when Madonna (Nikki) screams to the man who is going to get into the taxi. And even when Griffin Dunne (Louden) travels and falls into an apartment's interview scene. ** ALANiS Rocks **. Madonna's character Nikki steals / trades lifts and fools all over the film - her fun antics are enough to keep her on the floor all the time. "Not robbed when you rob an online store where you put it in. It is classic. *** ALANiS Rocks ***. I don't know why this movie got it the way it did. I don't see anything wrong with it." maybe, if you're a big Madonna fan, whatever it is, it's just awesome. Anyone who wants to see funny, classic entertainment will look at "Who's this girl?" Be known to all people, or at least to everyone that exists, ALANiS has always "come to an end!" So it's Madonna in this movie and it's just fine!
