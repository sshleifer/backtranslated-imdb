I looked at the longer version and could not take my eyes off the screen. 219 minutes passed, and yet it seemed that only one hour was over. the characters were very plausible and entertaining and photography was great. the story pulled me and kept my attention. I will certainly follow it again and again. this true story best talks ... not of Hollywood's usual cheap excitement and skin depth. I've seen many comments on this movie. most seem to put the film over or give it a little praise. basically this is a great movie that received unfairly harsh reviews. look at it openly. if you like western countries, historical periods, though historically inaccurate, you enjoy the movie. Excellent !!! 10/10
