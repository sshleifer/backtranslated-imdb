Is it a comedy of mistakes, a misleading affection that moves from one to another, flourishes and goes on in cat and mouse situations? Passionate burning, fire sparks and expulsion? Maybe she loves, loves or loves? A circle of emotions, evolving, liberation, hiding in hiding, but not in hiding who want to let him know, to let him know, let them know? A good ensemble cast despite the seemingly confused mixed emotions of different parties. <br /> <br /> This is a refreshing magic, casual, free and easy and on earth - not Hollywood glamorous like "Notting Hill", but many human feelings, weaknesses, vulnerabilities flow. Yes, everyone around is accidentally (lost and found) a love letter. Kate Capshaw, the owner of the city bookstore, with various characters depicted by Ellen DeGeneres, Tom Selleck, Blythe Danner, Tom Everett Scott, Gloria Stuart, Alice Drummond and Geraldine McEwan as seemingly unaffected by Scattergoods. Romance is in the air, love everywhere. You will appreciate the talented Kate Capshawit. ("Alarmist" is another tiny film that is fun to watch: Capshawil has a wonderful chemistry with David Arquette and Arquette with Stanley Tucci.) <br /> <br /> "Notting Hill" meets Julia Roberts' revolutionary story Hugh Grant's sparkling mating and great support for his (London) friends circle. "Love Letters" is a cheerful little girl in her tiny (Loblolly) small town and a story that includes Kate Capshawi's centrifuged ripple effects for her friends and neighbors. Both can be fantasies, but the latter felt more achievable if it happened to you. And if you appreciate words or poetic features, it may be a movie for you.
