if you watch it at home DVD or Bluray! Make sure you have a great sound system. The musical score through this is what takes you through the movie. I watched the movie many times and thought it was great, but after just improving my home theater sound system, what a difference. I watch this movie a lot, many times. <br /> <br /> If you don't have a big sound system. find a friend who does it and looks there. the fund ... but for these times, the boys got it. Today I hope some of it goes to girls .......
