Finnish sometimes feels like dreams for Estonians. The land where many of us want to go there and start a business. Find love, start a new life, etc. But ... Aku Louhimies has done this great work, which shows that not everything is so good in Finland. The fact that Finland can be like the Land of Bad (Bad Land) as any other country. This shows that people can be as unhappy in their lives as we do elsewhere. Sometimes there is nothing good. This film shows why Finland is one of the main suicide countries. It is not easy to live in northern Estonia. The cold climate is changing us. I have become more and more attracted to Finnish films and it is very good. Operation is also great. Jasper Pääkkönnen has become one of Finland's top. Beware of the sex scene (if you have small children) and the little depression that may come after the movie! 8/10
