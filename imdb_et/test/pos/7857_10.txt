This movie doesn't seem to be. Clint Eastwood is not dirty Harry or "cowboy" here. The film's complaint stems from its cautious manipulation of the atmosphere and the subject. It is a Gothic story set in the Civil War, and as such, the whole film is "actioned" or lacked in a house where sundials of all ages and shapes live. <br /> <br /> The horror comes from watching the whole story through Clint Eastwood's character. Seeing that he has been arrested and imprisoned by women, this is indeed a very "tempting" experience. And who's "frustrated" here? Are Eastwood's astonishing women? Are we the spectators who are being fired by both his sexual temptation and potential deviant sexualities? Or "tells" refers to what the director does here - keeps us fascinated by (maybe) going into a short space? Don Siegel makes all of the above one of the most memorable and disturbing movies I had the pleasure to watch.
