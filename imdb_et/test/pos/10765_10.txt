I was lucky enough to see it this year at the Tribeca Film Festival. I was stunned about how well and how fun this wonderful little movie was. Director Griffin Dunne has done an excellent job of bringing together this film with several characters and several stories that blend so smoothly and smoothly. The main story is the family, and it is a very thoughtful and entertaining story that accompanies the viewer in every scene. The film as a whole has credibility and integrity, but it still has such a commercial edge - the "indie" movie for the masses if you want. Cast productions are all great, but Diane Lane is the brightest. Diane Lane is simply sensational in this great movie and should be an Oscar. Early days I know, but Lane is here with her socks.
