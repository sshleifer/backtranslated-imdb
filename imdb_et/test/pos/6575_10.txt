I was one of the lucky people who invited me to watch this movie in New York. This is a convincing story of how a group of very tight friends dealt with the tragedy of September 11th. This film made me laugh and cry and showed me how a person's spirit, through love and friendship, can withstand and create great things from one of our darkest days. The filmmakers did indeed feel the emotions of the people concerned. It was amazing to see how the same story was spoken in the eyes of so many different people. I went out of the theater on the day who wanted to call all my friends to say hello. I recommend everyone to see this documentary. I would appreciate this movie A ++++++++++. See if you have the opportunity.
