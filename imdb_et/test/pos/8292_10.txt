I loved this movie for a long time. I hadn't seen it for a while so I checked it again and found it more enjoyable now. I loved Chipmunk's comic when I was young so I naturally adored "The Chipmunk Adventure". It's not wildly creative, but I've always wanted to travel around the world and it's just so much fun to see if my desire to travel is growing even more. Elenore's song to a little penguin always makes me cry ... <br /> <br /> 'The Chipmunk Adventure' remains my favorite forever, I'm sure. I think that because I saw it so young. I don't think it would affect a pretty senior who sees it for the first time. (If they don't have a young heart, of course)
