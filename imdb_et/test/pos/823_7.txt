I like a shepherd! Of course, the acting wasn't good, but the fighting scenes were nice. Van damme throws some nice shots and so does the adkins. The story was average. Texas policeman fights with smugglers. This movie did everything the van damme movie should do, what are martial arts and action. Van damme was never a good actor. I think this movie is better than van dammmes 2. If you are looking for an Oscar winning performance, you won't get it here, but if you're looking for action and martial arts, this movie is for you. Scott adkins is an amazing martial artist and unfortunately the public is tired of martial arts superstars, but his films in this film are great. Van damme offers strong hits and is good at seeing her again in martial arts because she is not in her last 4 or 5 movies. This movie is definitely worth it if you are a damme fan.
