Now I like Victor Herbert. And I like Mary Martin and Allan Jones. But it would have been nice to see Victor Herbert's real biography. Walter Connolly, as Herbert, has had a great deal of similarity in recent years. <br /> <br /> Jones and Martin sing beautifully. Herbert's music is right there to decorate the plot with these two musicians. Jones John Ramsay is a weak character, very similar to Gaylord Ravenal in Showboat, played by Jones. <br /> <br /> For Mary Martin, this mystery is why she never had a good Hollywood career. He was working with Bing Crosby and Dick Powell. He did well, but the film's listeners didn't take him. The best musical moment in the movie is Jones and Martin Thine Alone duet. The recordings I have about the song are individual and written as a duet. There is also a pleasant scene with Jones and Martin riding bikes that exchange Herbert songs as they drive. <br /> <br /> True Victor Herbert with his feminine and his Irish patriotic background and his music training in Germany, where he developed love for everything German would have been an exciting study. He was also a cello virtuoso before he called full time. I must make a strong exception to the observer who said Cuddles Sakall would have been a good Victor Herbert. Sakall is Irish, HELLO. <br /> <br /> Nice movie but real Vic would have been so much better.
