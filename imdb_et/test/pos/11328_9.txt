"Love in spirit" is simple enough: a married man and a married woman (though not with each other) slowly develop a romantic relationship with each other. The pace of the film is numbingly slow and little actually happens between the two. Against the backdrop of Hong Kong in the early 1960s, Wong Kar-Wai's great sense of beauty and the main characters make this film a joy. Actresses Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung are both great and Wong Kar-Wai has done an extraordinary job of capturing the past and nostalgia (something so many movies and directors are trying to do, but usually fails). There are so many little details that add charm to the film (director's brand), and colors and cinematography are the ones that send this otherwise simple story as an excellent cinematic achievement. 9/10
