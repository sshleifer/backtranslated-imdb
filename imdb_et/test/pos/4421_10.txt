Okay, so I loved Rachael Ray before, but now, adore her! How Innovative. I love having a cooking part - I admit that I occasionally miss this part just because it makes me too hungry for WAAAY! But I also love that the next day's grocery list can be found on your website. I love having regular helpers and making some of his viewers normal. I love how friendly it is and how creative it is. I also like how he does his mysterious guests. He just seems so much more authentic than so many other chat rooms. She still gets a little starstrucki and I love it. I love to talk about her personal life there and remind people how happy she is. She has even mentioned tabloids and is so funny! He also has more funny stories! Anyway, I'm a fan of life. Even my 2 year old knows who Rachael Ray is and she loves her too!
