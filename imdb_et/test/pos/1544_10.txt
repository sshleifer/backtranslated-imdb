This is one of the classic America made for television films that are only for rain in the afternoon. Although the script is highly unlikely, it never takes too seriously and does not do what brings the mystery / horror movie of a large mouth mouth murdered best with a popcorn or chocolate box packing bag. The big bonus for this movie is the fantastic layout for the movie and despite the strange events and even the strangers around Lake Tommahawk, I don't want to live there! <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a great movie to watch and see again.
