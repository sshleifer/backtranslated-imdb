It was very happy to see the film at Hari Om Bermuda International Film Festival. It was an opening night and was such a delightful film. It was fired beautifully from India and I want to go there now. The main actor .. Vijay was absolutely incredible. He was highlighting the film. He was probably in the movie. He was the star of the whole exhibition. Benoit's character broke me ... was very funny. And the girl (forget the name) was also great. They were all great! There were many huge scenes like monkeys. And basically I just loved the movie. Anyone who walked out was looting it and it was definitely the highest point of the film festival. Is my favorite festival. It really fascinates India's liveliness and can't believe how beautiful India is. The feeling of getting out of the movie was real high. It's a delightful and happy movie. I love it!!
