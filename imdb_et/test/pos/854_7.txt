It was a surprisingly good movie and an interesting idea. But it was a bit of a disappointment that Twist was a bit too predictable and just a little too early on the film. Looking at him, he started to make a bit of a strange and confusing result that the only reasonable possible result was the twist of the inevitable plot, but it certainly didn't destroy the film's flow. There were great performances, never a boring boring moment, so it was very worth it. It kept me up to the end and I don't have many movies on that day. I suggest people watch this terrible little movie.
