I really enjoyed this movie. It challenged my emotions and beliefs, making it a true work of art in my book. Operation was second to none. I would never see this movie with someone I couldn't cry, I don't think I'm crying harder for any movie, maybe because it makes me look, I can't. This is a must see.
