I found the movie Judas Kiss great. Carla Gugino's performance was extraordinary, probably her best career. His facial expressions in many scenes were incredibly true to the character and director Gutierrez used them best. All actors and actors were very good in their performances. Emma Thompsom was as usual, wonderful. His ability to act is much higher than would be necessary for his character, so he actually adds to the film. <br /> <br /> The story, although sometimes too complicated, is considered fun and ends up. Very good. The movie must not be skipped. A story that is well-knit and perfectly targeted. Movie quality, great.
