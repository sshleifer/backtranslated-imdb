Based on my current IMDb rating and multiple plot summary, I didn't expect much from "two hands". But how I was wrong. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, you have deeply penetrated into a genre that has been unoriginal for some time. Even in the sense of mass-scene and cinematography, the director creates a film with great imagination. If you are looking for a movie that is not only entertaining but also provocative, convincing and truly extraordinary, then make this next movie you watch. <br /> <br /> I hope Heath Ledger's tragic death has brought more people to this film. He was an incredible talent and his performance in it must not be forgotten. Don't make a mistake in evaluating and throwing this amazing movie before you see it.
