A short history. The cosmological content of this documentary is exciting, the thoughts provoke and the man ... brilliant. But I had this documentary hard. <br /> <br /> How family members and professors are interviewing is so unnatural. These members were interviewed with specially built kits and were uncomfortable. In most cases, their accounts were highly functional and focused. Failure to add (deliberate) questions will manipulate the information very harshly and personally. <br /> <br /> I don't know who is responsible for interviewing, but they did a terrible job and what took away from the viewing experience. <br /> <br /> In general, there is still a fascinating documentary that is worth looking at, only for interesting concepts.
