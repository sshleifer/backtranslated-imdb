I'm probably a little too old for this movie, 16 and I was a man, this story is a little too girlie, but I really thought it was a cool movie. All the girls in this movie are both hot and really big actors, from Alana, Adrian, Deen, Kimberly, to the sweetheart who plays Alana's little sister, Rachel. I'm not a huge pop star fan with lovesick songs, but I thought Aaron Carter did a really great job in this, and it seems like he was really in this movie and made it seem real. My mother liked all the older farts that she's grown up so it's cool. I thought I liked a lot of people and I don't know if I see them again? The sequel would be cool. I rented it, but I can buy it because I have tons of DVDs and I want to go back to see something I miss. I couldn't buy it at Blockbuster, so I don't know where I bought it right now, but I look at it. Anyway, I'm a 16-year-old man, I already said that, I know, but I would like to see this date. It's really good for all ages. I think even my 6-year-old little sister saw it. It is so cool that it is something that all ages see. I'm sure it was done with the goal, but it really works. Girls can dream with Aaron Carter and I like boys dreaming about all the hot chicks of this movie. There's something for everyone.
