I saw it for the first time when it was first shown, so I'm not too objective about it. It really managed to frighten me, partly because it was so late at night, but partly the feeling of it after a video-cut temporary story (the same thing that helped Dark Shadows itself). And the casting was so right. I hardly know Shane Brian, so it may not be so good to call him "well cast", but for me he is Dorian Gray. And for other male actors, the one who was so good at his role was Nigel Davenport (who is as good as "bigger than life" characters) like Sir Henry. And John Karlen, a kind of Dan Curtis "repertoire player" at that time, due to dark shadows. As one poster points out, this version is capable of engaging men with fine men. The scene where Dorian highlights John Karlen's list of male names, which is his way of extortion and Karlen's face, was very well done. (If this scene was now done, it would probably have been done in TOO OBVIOUS way and it would be worse.) I saw it when "Dorian Gray" was barely a name for me, not to mention more, so even more than belonged to the 1945 version ( which is rightly famous), this is a version for me.
