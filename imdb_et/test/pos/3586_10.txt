full of surprises, beautiful, cruel times. like life itself. leaves one to ask more. The best parts are of course the action scenes and moves. it is really a wonder how much work these guys put on some scenes (whales, polar bears, etc.). this is a great experience and should not be missed by anyone who dives, surfs or goes on the beach repeatedly. music is tempting and storytelling is great and very good pace. definitely one of the best documentaries ever made and worth no less than a highly respected 10 (sort of). some footage is very cruel and may not be recommended for people with weak stomachs (every killer whale is cruel).
