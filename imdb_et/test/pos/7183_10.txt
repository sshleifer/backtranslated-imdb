Eh oui, impossible n'est pas gaulois. <br /> <br /> A well-developed, very fun movie. The knowledge of French and modern France (and history) is highly recommended. I don't think this movie works in any other language. The film is incredibly much better than the previous one (looking ...). In addition to the great actors and thought cameras, it is very understandable and fireworks. The vorlage of the shape is recognizable, but the film is very emancipated. The cost of the film is well used. Indeed, all the special effects fit "naturally" in the movie, you never feel suffocated for them. <br /> <br /> Bref, oui, les 2CVs, ça traîne and peu mais à cela, Imhotep! <Br /> <br /> - Neighbor on the other side of the Rhine
