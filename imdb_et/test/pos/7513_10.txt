Patty Chayevsky was for years before successful scenarios and drama writers dealing with sticky topics. In this 1971 film, he followed Sinclair Lewis and A.J. Cronin (ARROWSMITH and THE CITADEL respectively), critically looking at the medical world, although his goal is focused on a special stage: a modern hospital in Manhattan. Chayevsky's point of view is quite direct: either hospital places where people can go well, or whether they make money organizations where people often die because of incompetence. <br /> <br /> Like a hospital too recently (and soon to return), I find the sick to be a very timely and rewarding satire. George C. Scott is Dr Block, one of the leaders of Manhattan Surgical Center, a great hospital for teachers. He has just begun his day when he is told that one year of the rest of the population has died at night with obvious blending. She seemed to be soothed and stunned while she was asleep in bed (she had been with her sister) and someone was hurting her it should have contained water with glucose (later it turns out that it got an overdose of insulin in i.v.). Soon, Scott finds that if he turns to another employee, it will die of a heart attack or botched surgery. The key to all this seems to be one patient who arrived at the hospital ten days before the regular inspection, and has since lost one kidney, almost lost his second kidney and is now comic (Barnard Hughes). <br /> <br /> Hughes' daughter (Diana Rigg) wants a comedy father back home with Apache India reservation in Mexico. Scott is not completely opposed to the idea - after the hospital bugs almost killed Hughes. Scott also suffers from a crisis in the midst of his marriage and family collapse and his growing doubts about his chosen profession. This is not just a case of Hughes. The hospital is in constant chaos, with regular staff (Scott, Stephen Elliot, Nancy Marchand, Stockard Channing) being overworked and overrated and fighting with business people (characterized by Frances Steenhagen's really nice performance). The local community is hostile because of hospital expansion plans - but when they meet Elliot to "discuss", they turn out to be inseparable (militant Black Panthers versus local clergy versus contraceptives seeking women and abortion clinics). Rigg (who loves Scott during the movie) is becoming more and more certain that leaving the city mad is worthwhile and Scott is also a toy with ideas. <br /> <br /> Scott was at the height of this movie, MURDER, THE HUSTLER, DR. STRANGELOVE and PATTON under his belt before illness. His angs registered when he and Rigg became familiar with each other (he prevents him from killing because of his despair). She can't tell if something done in the hospital is worthwhile and screams through the words "Summary Line". Although he later relaxes a bit about how good his teaching is with doctors studying with him, Scott is not really sure about it - he still fully agrees with his sense of responsibility, which others are simply mining. Rigg was also at the height of his international fame (if not his ability to act) - his stint as Mrs. Peel on AVENGERS was a couple of years old, but at the same time she was one of the sexiest women of the leading British talent of that period. <br /> <br /> Supporters are also good. In addition to cooling Steenhagen (requiring Medicare / Medicaid / insurance data from dog patients in E.R.), Hughes is a religious maniac who wins, and Elliot as a hospital head. My favorite caricature is also Richard Dysart as Dr. Elwell. Elwell is a butcher who has found a real home on his big board at the Big Board, himself for tax breaks. Anyone who resembles his performances as an ethics lawyer at L.A.LAW or a friend and doctor Melvin Douglas, having seen his greed, Dr. Elwell, sees the second facet of this underrated actor's talent.
