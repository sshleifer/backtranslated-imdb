I start by saying that I have always been a fan of Bonnie Hunt .... She always adds to every character she plays, and she did a great job in her debut debut. <br /> <br /> I have to admit this is a chick flick ... But with that in mind, it's a great story, it touches a lot of emotions and creates all kinds of reactions. <br /> <br /> This film represents real life as real-life people in similar situations. (Tho I have to rule out the coincidence that is the biggest part of the movie) <br /> <br /> This is a love story ... not only the love of a man and a woman, but of family, friends and love in the past. (Even pets). <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it. It is worth renting or buying.
