So well done, no CGI mess. Has anyone been on the Jumping Crocs trip to Adelaide before Darwin? Black water was realistic; The Rogue was a bit sharp. <br /> <br /> I thought the blonde chick was great - she has never seen her before. And the other chick is a baby, she's always great. <br /> <br /> V. Relaxing - I'd compare it to eating other people with jaws. <br /> <br /> There was a hole in Aussie things, without having reached the OTT with ostrich and crikeys. <br /> <br /> Loved It!
