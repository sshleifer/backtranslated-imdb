For those who are too young to remember, or too old to be part of "hype", at the beginning of the 80s Michael Jackson's fad with a fever like the Titanic leap, except it just let go. Every song, every video, every Michael's speech was important. There is nothing similar to see during the Beatles prosperity. <br /> <br /> I remember this video for the first time at a roller skating tower. Everyone finished skating. No doubt you're a Michael Jackson fan or not; you were. Everyone went over the projection screen and watched the video ... <br /> <br /> This is probably one of the longest music videos ever made, and certainly the best. In MTV's top 100 video always # 2 (# 1 always has a monthly smell, and any way that was # 1 of all time, slips past # 1 to make a new # 1 in Figure 1) and Thriller became a phenomenon and by itself. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity, you must watch the video; not only extracts from MTV or VH1. If necessary, you should look for Thriller making a video shop. Hey ... your parents probably made you look at the Beatles and Woodstock movies because "this was important" ... this is also important.
