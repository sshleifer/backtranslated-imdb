As one who often goes to the movies, I have to say that it has been one of the most impressive films I saw this year. Ed Harris and Cuban Gooding Jr gave outstanding performances that allowed viewers to exist against different emotions and to feel the characters. Sometimes it is nice to see a film that does not depend entirely on special effects, but allows the story to touch a person's psyche on several levels. I want Hollywood to bring more movies with this caliber.
