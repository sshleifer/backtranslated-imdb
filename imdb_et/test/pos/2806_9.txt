I have to say that this movie is perfectly produced and prime as a typical sci fi movie! I enjoyed it .. its a sci fi movie if you want a thriller to watch another channel. That's scifi lovers. Perfectly produced by one of Sci-fi's best manufacturers by Scot Vandiver! OK, special effects were not great, but what a great show! Some more money could have used the effect, but then again, what sci fi has a high budget effect. Stop the complaint and change the channel if you don't like these movies. Movies like Mission Impossible and Braveheart are great, but they are not Sci fi movies. Sci fi produces great movies like Sabretooth, Alien Hunters and so on. do .. hold them down!
