Halloween 666 (1995) Manufacturer's Trim Review! <br /> <br /> Halloween 666 begins with a reference to the fifth terrible ending. If you thought the last chapter was blind, it really strikes your spirit. The mysterious "Man in Black" has attacked the Haddonfield Police Department, releasing Micheal Myers. In the process, the poor Jamie Lloyd robbed the strange cultists. What do they want with her? Who knows, but just say that his long suffering will soon end. Doctor Loomis goes back to his rest of the dark years, trying to stop Michael Myers from killing innocents (luck). A friend of creation, Dr. Wynn, returns after four retreats to help a good doctor. Another old face from one guest star as well. <br /> <br /> This dark and harsh sequel was removed during post-production editing. For some reason, distributors found that the final product was not worth the time of the average observer of the horror film. So they decide to let it down. Then, after sitting on the shelf for several months, put it in the box. Whatever they did with the film, they made it worse. They should have left alone well enough. Hey, the movie company now knows better than filmmakers .... is it? <br /> <br /> Cut by manufacturer: highly recommended <br /> <br />
