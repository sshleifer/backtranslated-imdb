So many early British soundtracks I have seen on the video will suffer from either poor print quality or bad sound or both. Fortunately, I got a copy of this movie on a great quality video that allowed me to focus on myself. <br /> <br /> And that was a great story. At first glance, the passengers of the uncertain bus seemed to be a pretty boring batch (except always the beautiful Jessie Matthews). But when the movie returned to show every passenger's event the day before the accident, I discovered that, contrary to its original appearance, a talented group of performers had been cast, skilfully directed to bring true individuality to their distinctive qualities. <br /> <br /> Viewers may have different preferences for which two passengers complete the tragic end and survive. But the movie is of your interest because it keeps you away. This film deserves a much wider audience - a true early British cinema.
