I am a big fan of the 1995 version, which I have seen many times and a fine and wonderful film. The 1971 version I bought yesterday, a little hesitantly, but now that I saw it, I'm glad I did because it's more true to the book and the knowledge of Austen. The 1995 version has more dramatic power because it sharpens many of the signs - in the 1995 version, Lady Russell is more snobbier, more manipulative, less gazing at Anne; Sir Walter is even more useless and coats of arms; Elizabeth is nastier; Mary is more impatient; Mr. Elliot is more funny; Lady Dalrymple is a lot more stupid - but I think the character of this 1971 version is closer to the book, to Austen's vision and time for real people. The 1971 version also includes more key words and scenes from the book, including a particular key area in this area where Anne goes to Wentworth to talk to Louis (or is Henrietta?) About character strength. I found the actress more subtle and understandable than many of the critics here, but the 1995 version is more powerful. I agree with the critics here that the actor playing Anne is too old for this part; I watched her scrap in IMDb and was 38 when she was filming, when her character was supposed to be 28. I thought her action was subtle and effective. Wentworth is the right age and I found him very convincing. Especially Wentworth's 1971 version has a lot more sense of humor and teasing; 1995, much more power that the captain would have, and more passion. The admiral of the 1971 version lacks the peculiar presence of the 1995 version and the warmth of the person, and there is no sense of power that the admiral would surely convey; I found him with one really weak part of production. I agree with others that staging the "falling" scene was too clean and seemed convincing that it would be so damaged with so little decline. But it may be that he banged behind his head at the edge of the stone, which, if so, would really cause a very dangerous damage and make the scene more convincing than the scene in the 1995 version, where he falls further, but has no sharp edge that is likely to fall cause major injuries. As for the costume that some have criticized, I am not an expert and cannot answer, but I note that none of the naval characters (Wentworth, Admiral Croft, Benwick, Harville) in the 1971 version were wearing their uniforms, while 1995 the version will consistently wear their fancy uniforms. I suspect that the 1971 version is accurate and, in the 1995 version, always disturbed me a bit, officers are always in uniform when the people are clearly in peace and the officers are separated from active service. My father and grandfather were the masters of a career in the US Navy who ordered aircraft carriers and submarines, and they didn't spend their blues every day during their holidays or free time. I doubt it was 180 years ago. Uniforms bring a lot of fun to the 1995 version, and I prefer it, but I doubt that historically, these officials have the right uniforms so often. Finally, it is true that the product values ​​of the 1971 version are much smaller than the 1995 version, but for the year (1971), the TV format and the budget, we cannot blame the artists for that. Modern viewers who receive spiritual support for lower production value will find this version worth their time.
