Well, I can be biased because I grew up to watch a copy of VHS from this movie that is now ready to click and who has just been watching a DVD copy for the birthday of the last few hours. The film is so harmless and unpleasant that it fits all ages .... much better than anything Disney ever did in my opinion (and I worked in Disney shop !!!). The characters are enjoyable and the prize for the best scene is the split between wedded weddings (especially Swat's musical talent, flight and smack mosquito) and the amazing nightclub scene. The musical number is still 20 years after I first looked at it. there is no other movie that I could better recommend during childbirth, and actually every child I know (thanks to my Hoppity loving parents) has seen this movie many times. It always gives excellent signs of its fabulous love story, brilliant baddy and all-originalness.
