I saw the movie in the theater during the release, then I looked at the VHS tape over the years, and when Target's passage saw this DVD with "Pushing Tin" for a surplus of $ 5.50. <br /> <br /> There's something comedy that has really clicked on me - how Kelsey's grammar, "with his tattoo," is an unusual commander who suppresses rusty diesel and screwballs. He is against the navy's best - Los Angeles nuclear attack and his old captain (Wm Macy). <br /> <br /> Bruce Dern is playing a bad boy, Rip Torn admiral who runs - If you don't laugh hysterically in the "Do Not Quiet" segment, you have another kind of humor for me. <br /> <br /> Finally, "DBF" says without explanation - this is probably some of the old submarine consultants who have got inside the knowledge - thanks to Google, I learned that with the advent of old salts, "DBF" pins - Diesel Boats Forever. <br /> <br /> A naval friend said that many technical aspects are not right, but who cares - this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I think this will tell the comrade who wins this exercise!
