This movie is based on a real story. Einar Már Guðmundsson, the author of the novel with the same title, had a brother who turned mentally ill. I found this film to be very mobile, following the path of the main character of the disease, to see how it tries to cope with life after diagnosis and how it makes friends in psychiatric institutions, all very convincing. There are also quite a few funny incidents in the manuscript. Its title doesn't give anything about the story. You have to understand it ... and listen to the music that spins and turns your heart and soul back and forth when the movie moves. Must-see for everyone.
