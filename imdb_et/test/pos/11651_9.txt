This movie is a very delicate argument and if you are looking for something that makes you think here, you are right. Tim Robbins has done an excellent job and has resulted in some docu-drama that should be shown in schools (on strong topics). What about the actors? Well, they're just big; Susan Sarandon is really a "face of love" and Sean Penn is incredible as almost always. Completely black!
