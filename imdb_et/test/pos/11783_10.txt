I haven't seen "hardware wars" over the years, but I remember it as one of the more fun events in human experience and it was too early. Every aspect of this movie was fun and it was even better than Star Wars. I laughed. I cried. After that, I looked at the family member for a moment for three dollars just so I could say goodbye (I am the last one). I love it when Ham Salad's sidekick / co-pilot tries to eat Princess Anne Droid's cinnamon sticks and Darph Nader's character is just fun! This movie would be nice to look backwards with "Thumb Wars", and I sincerely wish it could have been "Hardware Wars, Episode II: Umpire Strikes Out". (Was there?)
