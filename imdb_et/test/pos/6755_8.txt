One of Starewicz's longest and strangest short films is looking for a toy dog ​​in search of orange, becoming the mother of an orange daughter. The dog goes orange when he has sold off the back of the car, but at night the orange must be protected when he comes, entering the devil's nightclub, with many strange and scary signs. With the help of a filled cat, the dog gets orange back to the little girl and is rescued from terrible deadly death. Mascot offers new techniques that I haven't seen in Starewicz movies yet. Adding a sync sound and a mix of real-time intervention and stop-motion animation will make Starewicz's old puppet theater a new twist. Moving cars on concrete sidewalks and people walking on live scenes are impressive and fresh. Today's sales of cars and cries of merchants are remarkable because the small studio shifts the sound that was expensive and the use of Starewicz's new technology seems to be an old hat. The new puppets in this movie are scary stakes for the fucking club scene. Twigss and newspaper layers come to life. The dead skeletons of the dead birds lay eggs that hatch the chicks of the skeleton. The symbols come across everywhere and the ball and swing horses. The new editing technique uses fast zoom, which is achieved by editing to speed up the speed of a previously slowed scene. All in all, Starewicz is able to update his film-making style to meet the demands of a new audience, making it one of the best examples of his work.
