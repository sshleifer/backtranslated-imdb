If you want to really frighten people, choose a devil for your theme. After all, a large number of residents believe it is real. That is why you combine healthy meat with all the existing religious and mythological designs. And there are quite a few nightmares for your young audience. <br /> <br /> This episode appeared in the entire Hollywood band. In fact, after I watched it, I started over another channel that recently played Bond and could not honestly say that the hair would be shared between the SFX differences. Minimal pain limited to his position in the space station; it was with the magnificent panoramic views of the admirable universe, it was both claustrophobic and intense as a stranger or scene. Outside the black hole, it felt that the weight of the black dark material would be by pressing the station's planet and whatever was closed. And when the horror is intensified by the knowledge that Dr and Rose have failed, the threatening Ode begins to channel the channels and then the characters start to separate one by one ... <br /> <br /> The best features of this new Dr. Chrome cream; Girl in a fireplace and an empty child. Emotionally appealing, scary and humorous, without appearing cheesy. It's much worse than any much flying Daleke. But you have to ask, is it really a good thing to watch children? This is not a family-friendly episode. Damage to the poor parent who has to put his children to sleep. I'm not sure I even want to see what happens next!
