My wife and I saw it when we were 17. The only good thing my father ever did (us in). It's "our movie" and music is "our songs". Michelle's song is "our" song. Yes, nowadays the crime is showing naked children on the screen, but we screwed up to 16, why not these kids? The film is a rich boy who impregnates a poor girl, a rich father steals him when he is born in impoverished conditions. She stays alone with the child. It is a love story and a "growing" story. The music is fantastic and the story is no one could associate with. Maybe one day it will appear on DVD.
