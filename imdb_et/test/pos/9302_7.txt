It's a weird and weighty movie. The subject of the atom bombs created in the United States, Los Alamos, NM, used during the last half of World War II, is enormous and, of course, deeply disturbing. The film's plot takes a lot of trouble and the participants have to bear a lot of creative tension. I had never seen a movie or much of an interest that I have to admit until I read the book "Smoking in bed: chats with Bruce Robinson." Robinson wrote a story and a scenario. I think the film was better when I thought I was reading it from Robinson's point of view, but I see how he thought it was on the track. I think Paul Newman is pretty good but is somehow below. He's too Hollywood. At one point, a large, average-looking man storms into Newman's office and has such a striking presence, thinking immediately that he should play a Newman player. The other leader, who is a head scientist, is also quite good, but somehow not brilliant to portray the great part that is part of the tremendous responsibility for creating the ultimate machine for death and destruction. One of the most effective signs seems to be the composite personality played by John Cusack. He has a strange influence on the whole, and finally he is a character whose fate really comes home and who made me think about the fate of more than 200,000 Japanese people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
