Sometimes it is difficult to look at such "self-esteemed" "message films" in an earlier, apparently simpler, time without some cynicism. The issue of racism and religious tolerance is what has been drummed at an early age, and as we have grown, the number of teachers and authors has been looking for less blatant but equally effective means of transmitting a message. "The house where I live (1945)" is as close as "messaging" and Frank Sinatra seems to be his audience as a child? indeed, maybe it was, because the short was undoubtedly meant to affect the younger filmmakers. Nevertheless, I found myself interesting when Sinatra started this sincere patriotic speech about what it really means to be America? and I'm not even American! Issued just two months after the end of World War II, director Mervyn LeRoy welcomed the war-torn audience with a message of tolerance, unity, and above all hope. Music is not bad either. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra with Fresh Face ?? already a star, but not yet a superstar from whom he would have been? opens a movie in a recording studio, where you can "complete your dream" with a full orchestra. When Frank goes to the smokers between the songs, he watches a large group of children who are tempting a young Jewish boy, their fraud, caused by his different religion. Ol 'Blue Eyes quickly stops childish behavior by branding bully "Nazi werewolves" and hitting their irrational bias. He then reads seriously and sympathetically the group on the simplicity of racial and religious discrimination, ensuring that every American culture, although it is different from ours, is still close to America's heart? if, of course, you are not one of those bloody "Japanese". Racial tolerance is hypocritical hypocrisy by presenting a collective enemy to one nation, even though you could not blame Hollywood less than enthusiastically for the Japanese situation in 1945. <br /> <br /> Sinatra leads her home to the wonderfully warming "The House I Live In", written in 1943 by Abel Meeropol. When the songwriter first heard on the film, he was furious that the filmmakers had completely omitted three of his verses, which he considered important for the message. These shortcomings were probably due to time constraints, but Meeropol did not understand them wisely, and this cinema was supposed to be excluded. When released for the first time, "The House I Live In" was considered such an important short film that he won the Golden Globe "Best Film for Promoting International Goodwill" and the Aupartar of all participants. In 2007, it was considered "culturally, historically or aesthetically important" and was included in the National Film Register of the National Library of Congress, so I came to hear it. Although his approach may seem sixty years later, this film can be quite traceable thanks to the young name Frank Sinatra.
