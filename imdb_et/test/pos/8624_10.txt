what they had. John and Carolyn were very private, so writers had to put together what they could. I really liked Portia de Ross as Carolyn, but the voice of Jacqueline Bisset grabbed my nerves. He should have used his usual voice. I would have preferred the entire film to focus on John and Carolyn instead of finding out about Johnist again.
