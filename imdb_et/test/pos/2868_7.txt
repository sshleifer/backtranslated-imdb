This is one of the best horror films I've seen for a while. Scary house, interesting characters, gore and twisted plot. Who could ask for more in the movie? This is largely predictable, but then most of the horrors you can find out in the first 10 minutes, so I won't hold it against it. Music, camera angles, etc. are great. Sets are well made and very convincing. However, the sub-blocks were not very much, it was too fearful, too many alternative plots took only what was fear ... Fear ... It keeps it quite simple and does it easily. If you compare it to any other film, I would say that it reminded me of a remake of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. You must definitely see a horror movie lover.
