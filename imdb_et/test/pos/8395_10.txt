This is one of the most unseen movies. Scripting language, costumes, landscapes, plots, characters, etc. are all supreme. You are not bored. I've been listening to this movie so many times, intensely or even when I've lost the census. Scarlett is aging intelligently, gaining wisdom beyond his years. This film takes you from Tara to Ireland, where his family originally comes from and sees the results of another civil war that was played there, this time between Ireland and England. <br /> <br /> This film represents double standards for men at this time - the man is still honored if he has girlfriends and whores but not a woman. If he is seen only in a private place, he wrongly accuses him. And, of course, Scarlett always thought outside the box, violating the rules when it was needed to make the necessary changes, help people and / or survive. <br /> <br /> The beauty of Scarlett is definitely poetry. His strength, self-esteem and wisdom grow in age. I remember his traits when I have faced too much on my album, for example, "tomorrow is another day" and the way he has carried his own determination and courage and has learned from his experience. It's a good movie to show your daughters because it teaches the woman how important it is to respect herself and that men, especially the very beautiful, can have two sides and they can treat the woman differently, depending on how she acts respects herself. An attractive woman must learn what this film teaches. <br /> <br /> This movie is therapy for me and it's better than wind. The second part is in Ireland, and anyone who is decent in Ireland is fond of the landscape, the people and the character of Scarlett.
