Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) is wrongly accused of sabotaging the plane for driving. He goes running, meets Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane) along the way and joins him to find and bring real criminals to justice. <br /> <br /> There are many things in this movie. Robert Cummings was a good actor but he is completely confused in this role; Priscilla Lane is beautiful but was never a good actor; the story doesn't make much sense (and ramps up longer than necessary); it carries a bit of its patriotism (but it was done when it was in full swing during World War II) and is not over. It should not work, but it is. <br /> <br /> This is a strange line and characters that are definitely in your best interest. <br /> <br /> For example: Lane tells Cummings (although they are in love), "I wish I had met a century ago" (???? !!!!); Lane PAYS is a villain to get her lunch, and Cummings and Lane joined the circus troupe for a short time. Also, Hitchcock's direction was (as always) just great - he throws some really amazing shots and sequences - especially the climax of the Freedom Step. <br /> <br /> This is not one of Hitchcock's classic films, but it is still very good and worth it.
