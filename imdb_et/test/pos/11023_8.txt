Wow! I got it in the IFC recently after I looked, but im Cheerleader. Id never heard of this movie, but the description sounded very interesting. I went to low expectations and now I have to say that this is one of the best love stories in the movie. Robin Tunney does an excellent job of depicting a person with tournaments. The relationship between the two and the smallest detail in the film is so great and plausible. I usually hate "romance" and love movies, but this film touched me. So I recommend this film to anyone with a visual ability.
