It's 3:30. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie about six minutes ago and it's fantastic. <br /> <br /> Teenage girl is passionate with her mother's lover and destroys everyone's life. The really interesting thing about this movie is that you can't really blame anyone. <br /> <br /> Everyone played great and the story was thought-provoking. <br /> <br /> You should definitely see this movie when you get it. <br /> <br /> I'll give it 10.
