Nazarine is a saint, he wants to live exactly how Christ taught man to do. But it is too late: now the Catholic Church is in a rich civic hand, bishops live in luxury and not because our hero cannot follow the way his hierarchy asks him to follow. So he separates himself from everything and on the road to purity, he is Joined Mary Magdelene and her wife who sexually attracts her (this girl and her groom are talking). In Spain (at the end of the fifties), they thought Nazarin was a Christian movie! Knowing Luis Bunuel, it was completely contradictory: all his work is insecure compared to Nazarini and his "holy women" with Jesus is meaningless. Nazarini way to grow only brambles and herbaceous grass.This is trying to help working men on the road to fail. .All his words do not reach anything. At the end of the ride, a wife was arrested and offered (Bunuel's sexual symbol). Thanks to "Nazarine", Bunuel was allowed to return to Spain (where censors did not get a clue) and "Viridiana".
