Although it has been in the air for 6 years, the promised land is one of the examples that come in one or two generations. Good cast, cast (including Richard Thomas and Ossie Davis) and team. The plot's belief is with McRaney, who wraps up his family and says he is so disappointed and incidents after he returned from Vietnam a year ago. I think many Vietnamese-era veterans, too, could really associate McRaney's thinking process with the final decision about his actions. Many of us did exactly the same thing in real life, after returning to the war and finding that America was not the place we left. The exhibition not only gives values ​​but a glimpse of what happened in one veteran. In these two aspects alone, I think it is one of the most notable series in our time. Why this program lasted only three years is next to me.
