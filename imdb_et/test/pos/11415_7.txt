Although I read all the complaints about this movie before I saw it, I still had an interest in the preview. I don't know if it was because I was waiting for a bomb or what, but I really enjoyed the movie. I wasn't very scared at the second half of the movie, but even then it wasn't very bad. I think most scenes and false alarms were realistic if they were a little too random, but the story needed to be moved. I think the house and the surrounding area are the perfect place for such a movie, it's beautiful and huge, but then the same attractive feature is scary. I also think that the light arrangement worked very well, because not only did they enter at the entrance, but they could not keep them, so that the house was blinded by a small section. Jill was. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Jill, I thought his part worked pretty well, at first it was not so plausible, but after a few phone calls it was good. In fact, the scenes in which he is scared behave perfectly. And finally, someone got to the right of the poker poker. I can't tell you how many times I hear noise in my house when I hear the fire and it was a nice touch to do the same, even though he forgets him idiotically when he needs it most. /> <br /> In the case of movie holes, the film is not perfect, but almost every hole can be explained and part of the mystery is how it entered it. how did he go out to kill his friend? and when did the gardener die exactly? generally I enjoyed it and I was surprised how fast it went. It kept my attention and wanted to see how it ended, although the end was very short and left my mouth in bad taste. My only complaint, except for the end, was the lack of character development. They could have added to their friends for ten minutes or something that would make us feel bad about our situation, give us the taste of our personality and give us the idea of ​​how it will start (for example, a scene where it discusses whether to go back to children) at the beginning, there are some scenes that spoke about him only about himself or something interesting.
