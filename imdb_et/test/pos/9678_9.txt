I absolutely love this example !!!!!!!, This is basically a fox-enhanced version of the simpsons (cau'se lets face that the symposiums are very dry when you are over 9. It is political, irrational and irresistible Anyone who says that he does not like, lies, everyone has a character, Peter, Stewie and Quagmire are my favorites, Peter, because he is rude, unpleasant and just does not give his amazing intelligence and how he hits you when he least expects it , and rush, because one of the guilty pleasures is dirty jokes, there is also an episode for everyone Mr. Griffin goes to Washington (VOL.2 SEASON 3.) If you like more sexual and physical humor, emissions are impossible (VOL.2 SEASON 3. ) or if you like some other humor, then Janet (VOL.1 SEASON2) .That is, if you see this example, everyone has a side-splitting humor for GIGGITY GOOOOO!
