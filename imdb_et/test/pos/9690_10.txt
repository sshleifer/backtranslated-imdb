Jackass Number Two is the most fun movie of 2006, also beating the fun Clerks II. It's one of the best queues in the last memory, beating Jackass The Movie in every way. Now this movie may be more fun, but it is also the most offensive, terrible and totally disgusting. In the film you find yourself badly on many occasions. I am absolutely serious when I say that I do not eat anything before watching a movie or during this movie, because it is likely that it can literally be bullied. Keep drinking to a minimum. You have been warned because, as the tag says, it makes you grace. <br /> <br /> Jackass number two follows the crazy show of Jackass, Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Ryan crazy people. Dunn, Steve-O, Chris' Party Boy 'Pontius, Preston Lacy, Ehren McGhehey, Dave England, Brandon DiCamillo, and Jason' Wee Man 'Acuna (Chris' Raab Herself Missing' Raab ') if they fulfill the most terrible life - cautious and irritating stunts. I'm not telling you what the tricks are, but I warn you that every scene with the animal is sick or psychologically scary, and that one cast member (again does not say) flirting with death several times What makes the Jackass number two so fun is not the stunts themselves just how the cast reacts to them and their making. Simply put, if they love to do it and have a blast, it's also (it applies to 99% of stunts). All the tricks are very original and 90% of them are never seen before. You see some recyclable, but they have grown up. You don't think that really the factors are directed to such a movie, but it is; The direction of Jeff Tremaine makes the film so much fun because he gives the board his comic timing that is simply brilliant for him. She could have just sat down during filming (in fact, you can see in the movie that she is sleeping through some filming), but she went there and helped those crazy guys do as funny as possible. I give Mr. Two thumbs for Tremaine. Another great thing about Jackass is his celebrity celebrity, and this time they include BMX legend Mat Hoffman, roller skateboard Tony Hawk, director / actress Jay Chandrasekhari (Super Troopers & Beerfest), actress Luke Wilson, Miami Dolphins star Jason Taylor and director / actor Mike judge (Office Space). Scenes with Hoffman, Taylor, and Chandrasekhar are more fun because even they are more fun seeing these men as part of the movie. <br /> <br /> Jackass Number Two is one of the politically false morally humiliating and all the time, if not the most, false films. Nevertheless, it is so original and so fun that you don't care about it. You start to breathe the air, laughing so hard that you are crying, and jumping from your place smiling at the whole movie. Because of the explicit and potentially disruptive graphic content of this film, no one should watch a movie under 18 years of age. You have been warned. I hope you enjoy Jackass Number Two as much as I do. <br /> <br /> 10/10 - spy
