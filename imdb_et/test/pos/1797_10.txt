I remember this movie back when it appeared, and I still remember the "buzz" that I felt when I left the cinema. All this movie is great! Music is top-notch and I still play all these years. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie so many times and still look forward to seeing it again and again. Nicholas Cage was great, and when I see Cameron Dye nowadays, I always associate that movie. It's too bad that the rest is no longer in bigger things, but maybe it's part of the charm of this movie. <br /> <br /> I do not criticize the film school because I am sure that all the analysts there can find guilt if they want to, but I say this film set my teenage years and still affects my life for over 20 a year later. The film "feels great" and pulls up emotions when you look at it (well ... he did to me) and I can't recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it yet. <br /> <br /> You either "get" a movie or you won't! For those who get it, a unique film experience is given.
