I looked at it shortly on the website of the Sundance Film Festival and I have to say that it is absolutely amazing. I was expecting it to be entertaining - like all the Sundance shorts - but I was not ready for such a deep sorrow and even passionate and beauty. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen any of the festival entries this year, I suggest you go to the site and watch these mini-masterpieces - I've seen them all and I can honestly say: The youngsters in us are what's most in my heart more touched. I'm not the weakest audience in the film romance, but my eyes are flooded so much that I'm surprised I still saw the screen. <br /> <br /> I agree with addicted2you, this is really a masterpiece of staging, and cinematography just breaks away. <br /> <br /> I can't think of a better way to spend free 12 minutes.
