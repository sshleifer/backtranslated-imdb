When I first saw this movie, I thought it was a terrible irritation led by the first director Liev Schrieber. What I saw in the next 130 minutes and completely changed my mind. Based on the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer, everything that is enlightened tells the story of a young Jewish-American collector (masterfully played by Elijah Wood) who tries to find a woman who saved her grandfather from the Nazis of World War II. He travels to Germany and opens a 20-year club hit with the help of a translator and his grandfather. This results in a rigid search across the country and they have decided to find what they are looking for. In some of the world's most beautiful landscapes, everything is illuminated, giving tension between the translator and his grandfather and the help Jonathan needs to find his career. There are also many religious things, because grandfather refers to Jonathan as "Jew." All in all, this is a film about yourself and a loving family. I'll give this wonderful, if not enlightened, film from 10th to 10th Arjun
