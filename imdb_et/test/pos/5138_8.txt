I read a book in a summer club club and we all loved it. My friends from this club did not agree to watch the movie, so the book would not be destroyed. I disagreed and watched it recently with my younger brother and parents. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised. The film was very correct for the book without losing its own spirit. The "new child" theme has been shown so that we can feel it, but that's not what the story is about. <br /> <br /> The actor was not the best I've ever seen, but it was still good and the kids had a lot of energy. The characters were interesting and the plot was lovely and not too overpriced. It was also a children's film that also works for adults or teenagers. <br /> <br /> I would like Beatrice to have a slightly tougher attitude towards girls, but she was still a great character. Mullet Fingers was quite a bit like I imagined her except her hair was apparently colored, with blond hair and dark eyebrows. Roy worked very well as a little boy and a new boy, especially with his parents and friends. <br /> <br /> The message and the end (which I'm not talking about when I liked it) worked together to make a very cheerful movie on a rainy day. All in all, it was a great movie that can be seen over and over again when you need to be reminded that the world is not a terrible place.
