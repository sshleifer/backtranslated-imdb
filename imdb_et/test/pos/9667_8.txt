Romanian film is little known in Romania. No Romanian director came to the international community because some other Eastern European countries such as Hungary, Czekoslowakia or Yugoslavia succeeded. One of the few great directors in Romanian cinema is Lucian Pintilie, who, 35 years ago, directed a major film, Reconstituirea, which was quickly withdrawn from circulation by communist censorship. After this film, which is still a reference to the Romanian cinema, Pintilie was not allowed freely in Romania until the Communist regime disappeared in 1989. <br /> <br /> Furia reminds me of Pintilie 35 years ago. The title means "Rage" and I can't imagine why distributors chose it differently. It's about a lost generation. Although Pintilie's classics have the root of evil in the oppression and lies of the Communist regime, young people here have to deal with the emergence of a subculture and morality filled with a totalitarian rule. The end is tragic and painfully awaited. <br /> <br /> The film is well-managed and the operation is good. Without excessive complexity, it is possible to create an emotional connection between characters and viewers. It could be said that some situations seem similar to "8 Miles" or "Fast and Furious" - but look at the production date! This film was made at the same time, if not against Western peers. If it's really the first film by director Dan Munteanu, as IMDB says, this is an outstanding debut. In any case, a good film can compete and sell well in the western market. <br /> <br /> There is hope that the new generation of Romanian movies that some happiness and good distribution will make their place in the international cinema. <br /> <br /> 8/10 on my personal scale.
