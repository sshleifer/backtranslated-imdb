I can't believe this movie just appreciates 7.4! This is definitely Hitchcock's best movies like VERTIGO or MARNIE. The only reason I can think about why the score is so low is that MAN ... abandons violence and definitely does not get a diploma "sex and crime". <br /> <br /> What comes from your tension is not violence, it is the reckless energy of the criminals who take the child from their parents and are ready to kill the child if the operation fails. Today, when we saw a lot of hard-boiled robberies by Mel Gibson's RANSOM, it seems normal, but in the 1950s, where the family was all in today's America, the idea of ​​such a crime has certainly caused a lot of emotion. <br /> And this tension still works for me today. Yes, these guys are selfish, ignorant bastards who are disturbing how they work: it's for them and they want to be "good businessmen", ignoring the fact that the business here is kidnapping children and murdering politicians in the opera! <br /> <br /> What makes the movie great is the creative aspects, the Hitchcock kinky idea, the terribly disturbing scene with the church (which brings this viewer to the attention of how alone, the stalled protagonists, someone caring, no one helps , the people of the church just home ...), meeting by the owner of the store who stuffed and made dead animals (which somewhat emphasizes the oriental flute that the film has about opening scenes abroad), the latter not only plays the role of music in this film. <br /> <br /> Music is the main principle here, because the murder of a politician targeted by the *** SPOILER *** must be done at the moment with a loud orchestra / gong; so Hitchcock will let the camera follow the orchestra score and now it will be the second *** BANG *** And then, of course, DORIS DAY sings Que's sera that became more famous than the film itself; he is singing it to inform a child whose parents are in the embassy ... <br /> <br /> All: Classic !!
