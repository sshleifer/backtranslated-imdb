I didn't plan to see this movie, but I wasn't disappointed when my friend pulled me away. Although there are no real surprises here, boys are doing quite well with their modest budgets. <br /> <br /> If you have seen a trailer, you probably know what to expect from this movie type, a stream of jokes here, a few classic moments, where the high point is probably a great setback for what the boys were in the 1980s. I have also read elsewhere that the end was disappointing, but I found it different from what I had been waiting for in this genre. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie does not change your life, but it is enough to laugh there to keep you entertained.
