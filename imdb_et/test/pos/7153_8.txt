It is always a joy to see movies that are completely cordial and well-intentioned, even if they are surrounded by those who are not. The modestly silly assumption of the film is that a conservative, religious Franklin family (mother, father, teenage boy and girl) is involved in an accident where parents and brothers have an almost death experience during which they meet with Jesus, a pleasant but somewhat irritated soul who removes the burden of "original sin". When they return to their lives, many of their views and attitudes have changed a lot, due to the daughter who did not share her experience. I believe that the religious side is in good balance from good (Jesus) to terribly awful (those 'followers' who are in prison for other sins and are entirely self-evident). This is a movie that makes you think, gives you some good laughs along the way and leaves you with a pleasant feeling that the world just might be a nicer place than you think.
