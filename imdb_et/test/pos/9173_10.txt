I just wish I was beautiful enough to say how good this film is. <br /> <br /> I ... it's hard to say. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm just saying what to remember, <br /> <br /> I laughed. I really laughed. I couldn't believe it. I laughed, and it wasn't a bitter laughter. it was not a cynical laughter. it was a laughter created by true joy. <br /> <br /> Joy. this is a foreign word for me. I don't know the word often, but I did it while watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Will. Maybe it's Will's face. He's a big person. "Smile my face and I have an eye." This line of Will songs describes him perfectly. He has "joie de vivre". Trey is a happy, happy boy with a father like Will. Jada is a happy, happy woman who owns a man like Will. He's someone ... special. <br /> <br /> Happy. I feel happy. It's a strange feeling. I don't know it so often. It's just so nice to see that ... other people are really happy. I really mean happy. In this movie I did. As Will says in the movie: "Maybe I'm not just" fine ", maybe I want" extraordinary. "You know that watching this movie made me think: so do it. <br /> <br /> Fun We all know we should be ourselves, but we seem to be punishing if we do. Maybe it should be. Maybe it's something we show after we haven't been That's why I just loved this end. Will, Eva Mendes, Kevin James, Amber Valletta, Julie Ann emery are all dancing at the wedding. Dancing without obstacles. WE ARE NOT! Except we are really happy. I think I can (at least liked their happy, happy sight). <br /> <br /> Women and men. I don't know anything about relationships, but I feel. By watching this movie, I feel like someone trying to push with whom It seems to be making life ... something else. I don't really know. I just think. i watching this movie. I felt that this connection must be ... must do, worth living. <br /> <br /> It's such a movie. It's funny. It's CLEVER. This is OFFER. It creates hours. It made me think maybe maybe maybe life is a really great thing. <br /> <br /> Want LAUGH? You want to feel good! Want to get some answers about girls (and girls, answers for boys)? Look at the engagement. YOU-WILL-GET-IT-ALL !!! <br /> <br /> NOT! You're a big person.
