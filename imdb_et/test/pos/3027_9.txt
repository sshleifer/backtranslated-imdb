What makes the watching and reviewing of movies a joy when every time you expect the film, like Cell, comes and hits your socks! This movie is a great fear that has everything you want when you want to scare your witts. Without going into the story, I say that I have a great start in the middle and at the end that keeps you on the edge of your seat, while surprising the extraordinary special effects. Action is good, without being prominent, but it doesn't matter, because the subject and the way it is put on the big screen makes it one of the best horror films I've seen for a long time. This is one of the films you imagine as a novel, but saying that credit does not seem like adaptation, so much credit must be written for Mark Protosovich. 9 out of 10
