My boyfriend and I went to see The Guardian. First, I didn't want to look at it, but I loved the movie - it was definitely the best movie I've ever seen. They portrayed the USCG very well, it really showed me what they are doing and I think they should be more appreciated. Not only did it teach, but it was a really good movie. The film shows what it really does and how hard it is. I think USCG would be complicated and very scary. It was a great movie everywhere. I would recommend this movie to anyone. The end broke my heart, but I know why he did it. The story was great, I'll give her two thumbs up. I cried it was very emotional, I'd give it 20 if I could!
