The first child game was an original and effective little horror movie. however, as expected, it seemed that the two terrible queues were writing the end of this franchise. <br /> <br /> Well, when I heard they made the fourth "chucky" bride, I just rolled my eyes and muttered "... when they will ever learn." <br /> <br /> But when I heard that they had become an excellent director, Ronny Yu and solid casting, including the glorious Jennifer Tilly, helped me out. <br /> <br /> This movie is very well done. it has a great sense of humor, highly stylized graphic violence, great cinematic art and amazingly sexy Jennifer Tilly who captures her most impressive things in her first half. (I should add that he is also a fantastic actor.) <br /> <br /> it keeps his tongue firmly in the cheek without moving to the camp. doll effects are great and their oral communication is invaluable. it is more of a horror / comedy than a straight horror, but humor is welcome and well integrated. <br /> <br /> I've already heard they're planning a Chucky son. if they can match the quality of this movie, maybe this franchise has made a legitimate return. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8.5
