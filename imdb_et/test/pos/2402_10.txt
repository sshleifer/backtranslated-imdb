The Internet is a wonderful thing, isn't it? I watch an episode of one of my all-time favorite documentary "Vietnam: Ten Thousand Days War" from my DVR in Florida USA on my laptop in Kuwait; I'm writing an overview of this series and just read another review of someone who actually lives in Vietnam! Amazing. I would just like to say that Minh Nguyen's claim that America brought the war to Vietnam is one side. I know America was the main player in the West, but it takes two sides to fight the war. Soviet and Chinese were the main weapons service providers in the North, so Mr Nguyen does not mention them in part, which indicates ignorance (well, I think we all know why he did not mention them, whether ignorance is not raised in the communist system and its political dogma, or because he is afraid to tell the truth because he is afraid of arrest.). Also, Mr Nguyen, I think the parts that concern Northern Europe as the main aggressor have not been shown in your country to blame America for showing ignorance again. Regardless of this, it is interesting to read the Vietnamese review (of course, that it could be prepared, but I take it as real), at least the Communist East is somewhat open. As far as the mini series; why do i love it? It is not just about engaging America. It was a war that began 15 years before American involvement and the series covers all aspects of history, so it's a real plus. The footage used is primary, all the Vietnamese war programs you see are now using the same frame, so you won't lose anything by watching this older series. The date of this series is another plus. It's all the main players who are being questioned what you can't do now because they are dead from old age, this is a great historical reference. Third, Richard Basehart adds a very distinctive narrative voice, his voice sounds as special as James Earl Jones' voice and I think it is a very stark praise. I don't think you could ever find a better documentary on war, like the use of relatively modern technology in 1980 and its transfer to the 1950s, and an interview between all generals and politicians on both sides of the world war, the Vietnam War. <br /> <br /> OK, I see some biases, its subtle, sophisticated shifts in the 1970s, such as the NPR "All Things Are Considered", when everything seems so straight forward, but when you blink that You finally have to shake your head. In this case, the case that later episodes do not throw away much of the role of media and propaganda, all the useful tools to influence the outcome of war, DON'T FRIEND ????? <br /> <br /> OIF war veteran passes the same thing 30 years later.
