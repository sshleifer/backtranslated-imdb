Footprints are definitely not the middle run of your Giallo mill and it's not bad. Unlike its previous efforts, the fifth leader (which was your "classic" Giallo) Luigi Bazzon's film is about almost all of Giallo's trademarks and murder; focuses on a very psychological secret. From the very beginning, it is obvious that this is a completely strange film, as the film opens with a scene placed on the moon. Things cannot become clearer after the Lunar order turns out to be Alice's dream of a troubled woman. Alice is tormented by the poppies that have died of an astronaut that has probably come to see the movie "High Traces of the Moon". After several things wrong, Alice decides to go to the abandoned former tourist destination, Garma. When he arrives, he is surprised because the people he meets already seem to know him. Alice also meets a young redhead girl who also seems to know her; girl tells Alice she looks like Nicole except for nicer and shorter hair ... <br /> <br /> The fact that footprints do not contain much sex, murder and other Giallo trademarks makes it somewhat backward because most people who enter this movie don't get what they expected (or probably wanted). On the other hand, footprints tell you to respect that it does not just follow what went before. By 1975, Giallo had begun to lose its popularity and many of the films that appeared during that period (some very remarkable exceptions) had only previously predicted, so Luigi Bazzoni would have taken the film with him as much as possible. Florinda Bolkan gives a strong lead to the lead; and the fact that he is not the most beautiful heroine of Giallo is not really important. The mystery is built nicely all the time, and although it can sometimes get a little swollen; Footprints are generally intriguing. It will probably not surprise many when they get there, there is little point in the end, and that is not really clear; but it adds beautifully to the strange cultural value of the film and everything in its entirety; I'll give Footprints thumbs!
