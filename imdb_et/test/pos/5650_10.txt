Plain fires (1959) **** <br /> <br /> There are no longer any such movies. "Fires in the normal way" is an incredible picture of the lives of the Japanese imperial army soldiers. Kon Ichikawa's masterpiece follows the tuberculosis soldier Tamura, who travels in the last year of the war around the Philippine landscape. His manager will only send him to the hospital for treatment and return. His CO tells him he's going back and when they refuse, his last time is to kill his grenade. He refuses, but meets a squatter outside the hospital. The next day, they will split American troops and Tamura will flee, choosing not to kill herself, and from there will travel to her place, trying to reach Palompon. He discovers that some men are eating human flesh to survive, while others trade as much tobacco as possible, no matter what they get back. <br /> <br /> The film is full of silent despair and destruction, madness. Anyone we see is skin and bones, covered with dirt and torn and split cloth. Ichikawa uses her camera to capture the destructive landscape and beautiful pictures of Japanese soldiers. Kon Ichikawa was famous in Japan for making many comedies and satires, and there are some fires in the fires at the moment. Take, for example, a picture of what appears to be a dead man down in the water area; The soldier walks, but asks himself loudly whether they all arrive, to which the man lifts his head out of the water and answers "what was it?" and then his face goes deeper than before. Another fun sequence includes one man who found a pair of boots from the track. She takes the boots, replacing them with her old ones. Another guy walks and sees it in a pair of boots and turns on his old boots. The scene continues until Tamura finds the exchange point and examines the remaining boots without any substance. She looks carefully at her and on the spot and decides that they are both the gate who will remove her and go barefoot. The film is full of incredible scenes. Like Mizoguchi and Kurosawa, Ichikawa knew how to use his camera to paint beautiful and stunning images. There are many wonderful pictures of men with incomplete empty plains, surrounded by nothing but the air and the dead or dead body on the earth. There is another incredible scene where dozens of Japanese soldiers try to cross the Yanks-guarded road in the middle of the night, everything that goes up and down from the camera. <br /> <br /> The film gets its name out of the fire barrier coming from the fire, seen across the film. They represent a little more common life for soldiers; The lives of Japanese farmers return to the burning of corn. But their hopes for normal life are hostile hands. <br /> <br /> The film caused blending of your day's graphic content. Much emphasis is placed on the horror of war, not just on the enemy, but on your ranks and yourself. Kon Ichikawa's fires on the plains are an incredibly authentic and touching and somewhat disturbing portrait of the admiration suffered by the men of the lower rank of the Imperial Army. Clint Eastwood's letters from Iwo Jim, although it is a very good film, cannot go far enough to realize the fear of war depicted in the sources of fire. (Eastwood was undoubtedly affected by the film, seeing as he claims to be such a classic Japanese film.) Many war films show that victory is through the eyes of the winners. It has been shown in the fires of the Plains that the war is even more hellish than you are losing. <br /> <br /> 4/4
