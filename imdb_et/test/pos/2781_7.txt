That's how we saw it on DVD in our apartment here in Paris. We're all here in the exchange program. We all laughed so hard that what happened in the movie happened to us! I think so sure that some of them were real clich√©s, but still, they know what I'm saying. <br /> <br /> I think I have more to do with a quiet guy (Italian) than Xavier because I'm more of an observer in our group. Anyway, I wish I had a hot roommate like Cecile de France. He seems to have been a chick and a cool chick after I saw him at the Cannes Festival last month. <br /> <br /> Now I think I want to go to Barcelona next summer after this movie. I also have to check what came out here in France.
