Nuri Bilge Ceylan's 2002 film Distant (Uzak) - her third feature film (her first was the 1997 Black-and-White Town - Kasaba) is a remarkable step in her good but faulty 1999 movie "Clouds Of May" (Mayis) ). Earlier film had the potential, but with low budget and improvised quality in the worst way - primed holes and wooden amateurs. The success of May Clouds Of May at every level testified to Ceylan's talent as a creative filmmaker. However, Distant is a great artist on the Ceylan international scene, who has many of the same qualities as other big filmmakers like Ingmar Bergman (although his scenario is not so much a dialogue as he has and lacks Bergman's propensity for close-ups - his shots usually have long exterior and middle frame shots for the interior) and Yasujiro Ozu (whose penetrating scenes are reconfigured for Ceylan). Most of the film takes place in a snowy hibernation in Istanbul (the fact that it is likely to surprise in Turkey), which gives the film a definite sense of Bergman, as well as some of Krzysztof Kieslowski's snowy cities. Decalogue. Natural images refer to the best of Werner Herzog as they tend to win or two longer than normal film theory dictates, making them even more memorable, while urban landscapes range from Michelangelo Antonion's nearly Precisionistic Compositions to Woody Allen's Cultural Hagiography is a water-based view of Manhattan's direct quotation ( read the steal) except for the absence of the Brooklyn Bridge in the background. In the second scene, Ceylan also quotes the famous story of Ozu Tokyo as a famous fiery ship. But like all other big artists, Ceylan makes her own appropriations for her art, making them a little bit more and keeping them in line with her film needs. Far away is a film whose title suffers from the character of the film and the feeling that some viewers are against them, but it does not describe the film itself, the scenes remain once after the end of the film. Perhaps the most memorable scene and picture of the film is when Mahmut stops at his former wife at the airport in Istanbul and looks at him with his new husband as they head on an airplane that will remove him from his life forever. When he looks at him, we can see far from seeing his catch look at him. Will she leave her husband and return to Mahmut? Not in this movie. He pulls back the column and Nazan just turns his head back into his future. Mahmut is his past and he knows how to best move forward. The container never gets it. Rarely do such moments come from life. The fact that some viewers get a movie and that Ceylan gets its authority for creativity shows that ignorance can teach as long as it moves. Far, though, it's just the right length.
