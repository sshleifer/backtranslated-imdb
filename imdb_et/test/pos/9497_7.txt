I found this film full of irony. But watching a movie can almost see what happens. Leila is a confused, boring house woman who is always looking for happiness. If he thinks he thinks he is a true fortune, he clings, leaving behind everything he knew. But he finds himself comparing the notes between his former and his current spouse. He learned that if he had only been more aware of what disturbed him in his previous marriage, he would have been able to save much more easily if he planned to do so. She understands that words are nothing but she learns she is too much to her second marriage and finds herself back and hopes for change again. The main conflict with this film is Leila himself. You will not get real happiness if you are happy. I liked this movie, but I would only like this movie for women, I don't see that a person really enjoys this movie.
