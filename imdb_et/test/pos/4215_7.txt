I'm honest, I rented this movie just because it was part of the "Children's Games" series. I was expecting a boring boring fourth part, but I was surprised. This movie was surprisingly good and I found it quite funny. There was a lot of dark humor and the idea of ​​getting two dolls was a good way to taste things. These two dolls worked well and added bonnie and clyde to the movie. In general, this series was very good for the fourth film, with some terrible death scenes. Praises the writers for things and ends, although I found it a bit strange, leaves room for another stage ... maybe "Chucky son" !!!
