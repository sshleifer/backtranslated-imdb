I rented this movie with very low expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised. This movie is very good. And never think it's a low budget. <br /> <br /> High, led by Richard Bell's centers around the 18-year-old Pip, played by the wonderful "Paul Anthony" who leaves home thanks to the circumstances of his older brother's death. He has been guilty of this incident and has been hit by heavy drug and alcohol escaped service. On his 18th birthday, his father, Pipi, talks to him about the ribbon left by his grandfather, which he had to listen to on his 18th birthday. <br /> <br /> How the whole movie has spoken. two simultaneous readings at the same time. Pip's current life and his grandfather's past life during World War II, when Pip listens to the tape. <br /> <br /> The three outstanding performances of this movie are those from "Paul Anthony as Pip and" Brenden Fletcher plays Jason, an 18-year-old WW11 soldier, his grandfather. WW11 also played the role of Mark Maciuley, played by Mark Hildreth. All fine performances. <br /> <br /> A couple of worries and scenes that didn't sit too well with me ... the priest, Father Chris, played by "Alan Cumming", who is gay and in a wide daylight, choose a local street keeper that the whole neighborhood knows. And then we have a local store secretary named Jeff, sweetheart, played by an attractive David Beaszely, who just wants to be loved and for some unknown reason, is interested in a very unpleasant and butterfly ball from the street hustler, a secretary who sleeps with almost everyone and is likely to be walking poisonous Time bomb. In addition, he is not a very pleasant person. This part just didn't call. <br /> <br /> The parts I love most were war rebounds. They had worked so well and touched. At the end, there is a place where one soldier dies and another soldier, "Jason", is comfortable for him and show him love when he is badly injured and dying. It is such a wonderful and moving scene that was tearful to me. Beautiful worked. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. It is one of the power of love, redemption, and human spirit to survive.
