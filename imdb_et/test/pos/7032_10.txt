I watched this movie for the first time last night and enjoyed it in every aspect - dance, actor, dialogue, plot, script and all the atmosphere created by this movie. I would highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Gray delivers an excellent and first-rate result with Frances (Baby) Houseman. She has the natural ability and elegance to dance and she is beautiful and enchanting on the dance floor. But what is wonderful about Baby is that it has such a great depth and dimension for its character. It's not just dance, but scriptwriters have given us the opportunity to see how Baby deals with the different emotions and feelings she experiences throughout the film, and give us an insight into how her communication with other camps changes her life. Gray represents his character with such reality and toxicity that you feel deeply into Baby as he experiences what he does in this film. <br /> <br /> Patrick Swayze is excellent in his Johnny role and he is successful in his character. He gives his character a complete personality, a strong appeal and great depth. Chemistry between Swayze and Gray is enchanting and powerful and greatly contributes to the success of this film. <br /> <br /> Cynthia Rhodes is a great penny in her role and her imagination is truly powerful and makes the film a frightening dimension. The other members of Jerry Orbach and later Mark Cantor deserve a special reputation here - they also give excellent and imaginative performances that give this film an extraordinary dimension of performance and credibility, a great experience. Dancing is great and first-class for all participants. <br /> <br /> Scripting and communication between all major characters is intriguing and engages the viewer in a powerful way. Although this film is extremely predictable, more than enough life and vitality is given to this film. <br /> <br /> In addition, the excellent music selection in this movie is a truly magical atmosphere and a very nostalgic environment that enhances the quality and success of all the different scenes. <br /> <br /> `Dirty Dancing 'is a truly powerful, wonderful and very appealing film that will leave you deeply touched and with a great sense of heart and soul, and inspiration to dance. I highly recommend it
