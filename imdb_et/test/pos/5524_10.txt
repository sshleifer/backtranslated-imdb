The title was "Don't Spank Baby". Wayne Crawford became a successful producer of films such as Valley Girl, Comet Night and others, although he was not too terrible in this little Gemis. And the little-known Abe Zwick should have done a ton of work on this movie, but not. Filmed in Moberly Studio in Hollywood, Florida, the same number of Tarzan's earlier films were filmed. This movie is definitely for those who appreciate the abstract. The film was originally filmed with a little naked and much more graphic scenes. Only for reasons known to Tom Casey, bloody slasher scenes were given to LSD and nudity was removed. Though this version deserves to look for those who are so inclined, I think the original version would have offered Plasher 70's Cult Classic full-length punch.
