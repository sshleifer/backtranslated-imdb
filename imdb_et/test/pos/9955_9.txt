one of my favorite lines in Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> s.o. * We haven't finished with you for a long stroke *, so not only Shylock gets his pound of meat, nor 3000 or 6000 or 36,000 (every 6th part was ducat) duck, minutes when he has destroyed all his losing property. and her daughter has given her up for a long time. <br /> <br /> Revenge is the dish that is best cold. but Shylock's attempt to retaliate completely back. I suspect that this game was and is popular because it fits the desire we have for justice. but the hard reality is that the world is injustice and most of it stands. some big names come to jail, gangps lose their bad "good boys", but in fact it is usually the other way around. <br /> <br /> But not in this game. The long proficiency of racism and anti-Semitism forget that it could have been any other group of social emigration that would be a fire, that is, the money lenders of that time were Jewish and therefore the needs of the story for Shylock were Jewish. The Venetian merchant is my 3rd favorite job at Shakespeare, 1 and 2 are Hamlet and Macbeth. It produces an excellent story of morality. Scenes with smoke alone are worth it. also the clumsiness of the new spouses and minimizing the fact that the rings slip so easily that they swore to stay forever. in real life, this trick is what spouses use to remind their right side that promises must mean something and they must not be done lightly. This game has a much deeper importance than just a comedy / dramatic aspect. it is loyalty, dedication and love. <br /> <br /> It's worth checking over and over again.
