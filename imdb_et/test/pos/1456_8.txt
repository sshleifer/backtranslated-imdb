The man with the golden hand was one of the great trio of movies, who at the same time studied drug addiction. The other two were Monkey On My Back and an umbrella. But I think that's the best of the three. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if Otto Preminger had left this obvious studio instead of this real Chicago, the film would be even better. Who knows, perhaps Preminger didn't get enough money to pay for the place. This is the only mistake I find in the movie. She took prison in treatment and wanted a new life as a jazz drummer. But a whole lot of people are conspiring against him. <br /> <br /> First of all, Bob Strauss, who wants to get him back, especially since a couple of serious players are in town. She uses some sub-letters to get Sinatra services. Secondly, Darren McGavin is a local dope dealer who wants Sinatra good and re-established as a customer. And finally, Eleanor Parker, who fucked a woman who works with all kinds of games to keep her. Sinatra could have won it if she hadn't won a couple of years ago from From Here to Eternity in a supportive actress category and Marty was a well-known film this year. His scenes, which pass through the retreat of Kim Novak's apartment, leave you trembling. <br /> <br /> Eleanor Parker doesn't get enough credit for his role. She's really something like a crazy schematic woman who wants Sinatra to be related to her, no matter what the price is. If she wasn't interrupted for the melody in the same year, she could have called it. 1955 was the highest point of his career. <br /> <br /> Darren McGavin received his first real message as a very serpentine drug catcher. His power is guaranteed to climb your flesh. your family.
