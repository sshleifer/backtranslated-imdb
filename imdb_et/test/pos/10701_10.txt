Sam Firstenberg's "Ninja 3: Domination" mixes martial arts with an "exorcist" like horror. The horror elements on the screen are just ridiculous, but the film acts as a nonsense action / martial art flick. Fighting scenes are well choreographic and exciting, and the movie is never boring. So forget the stupid dialogue, flat acting and annoying soundtrack-grab the beer and check it one! Highly recommended!
