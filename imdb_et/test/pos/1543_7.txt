The assumption of the story is normal enough; the average family wants to get out of the rat race; wants to find a simple life .... so they move from Sherman Oaks, California to Lake Tomahawk; kids are towing. <br /> <br /> The lake is beautiful, they have rented an old house .... but wait; there may be something in the lake; people are murdered and no one knows how (never understand). Gerald McRaney is an excellent, familiar face for lifelong viewers; Valerie Harper is also good; Since this film was made in '88, perhaps the writer should create another one! <br /> <br /> Although the story is a bit over the top; If you are a movie buff, you will be reminded of similar scenarios "Psycho" ";" "Fate" "; as well as other horrors of this genre. Many camera shots and sequences give you a sense of deja vu. <br /> <br /> Sit back and enjoy; if you don't take it too seriously, it's a lot of fun, and better than, for example, the latest movie: <br /> <br /> "" I know what you did last summer "" better movies!
