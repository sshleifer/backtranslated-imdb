In 1984 Edgar Reitz surprised film enthusiasts from all over the world with his epic Opus Heimat: A Chronicle in Germany. Eight years later, he came out with The Second Heimat: The Chronicle of Youth, which is even more preferred than his predecessor. <br /> <br /> In fact, this is not really a sequel. It is more of a "midquel" because it involves the events between the ninth and eleventh episodes of the first Heimat cycle. <br /> <br /> Another Heimat begins in 1960, four years after Hermann Simon (Henry Arnold) was separated from his first love, Klarchen, with the help of his intolerable mother and older brother (the contradiction involved being a minor) while he was about 25 years old). To be angry with these events, the young man never promises to fall in love (grandiose, as horrible) and decides to go to Munich (as the director himself at the same time) hoping to become a professional composer after a few years at the music academy. He is in Munich for ten years and the Heimat 2 13-hour episode includes the timetable, each of which focuses on Hermann's fellow students, people who, like him, are looking for a second person, a country for another person, be it music, film or anything else that they finally get peacefully live. <br /> <br /> Like the first Heimat, this second cycle is a perfect film and television alliance: episodic structure and various romantic subpages look like a soap opera, in fact, the Second Heimat has to be viewed as a whole to successfully embrace it, while some of the chapters of Heimat 1 can be seen as separate stories (especially for the Hermann teen years). But the style and content are the pure cinema of the author, with familiar black and white / color transitions (which are more predictable at this time) and ambiguous characters that the last element has emphasized in the relationship between Hermann and the cellist Clarissa. Lichtblau (Salome Kammer): They love each other clearly, but they continue to interact with others, staying inevitably until it's too late. This time Reitz seems more pessimistic about his characters (at one point, Hermann is so disappointed that he says, "The Beatles are much better than us!") By building an entire episode of blind, controversial topics such as abortion and suicide. The decade he is studying is not suitable for everyone, because some of them have been intimidating dramatically in the 60's central events (especially the '68 revolution'). <br /> <br /> Reitz also seems to think this minia is a series specifically designed for film films, given the numerous film references (including the brilliant quotation of Casablanca) and the smart jokes (one episode has been placed in Venice, whose film festival played an important part in Heimat saga for success). And since 1992, film students have never thanked him for being the 26 most convincing hours dedicated to celluloid.
