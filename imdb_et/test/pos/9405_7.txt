too bad that they showed a palm tree that was not inaccurate for Connecticut in October ... it was filmed in New Zealand ... This Martha Moxley case was "cold" for 20-25 years ... his family worked hard to keep it alive and when Mark Fuhrman decided he didn't want to remember only his participation in Nicole Simpson .... which could have harmed his reputation (if it wasn't already) ... followed by the police trying to get enough information to write the book. ... using the setbacks we see the relationships Martha formed .... The age of unattended boys without a mother and a father who was always on the loop ... <br /> <br /> Plus the fact that they depict the actual Martha, as if he were a star of the movie ... he was a sweet sweet girl in the neighborhood. In addition, other characters were very big, especially Jon Foster and Toby Moore, who played Michael Skakel and Tommy Skakel respectively. They were also good, customers had to look through the 70s until the 90s .... <br /> <br /> It keeps my interest even when I was trying to get to the Skull Dude. ..
