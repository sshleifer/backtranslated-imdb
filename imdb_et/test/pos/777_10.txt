I didn't expect much of this movie and I had to face. Julie Walters, Rupert Grint and Laura Linney make this film a great feat. Every teenager can be involved with parental control and the desire to get out who you really are, which is basically what this film is about. Ben (Rupert Grint) does this when he meets with Evie (Julie Walters), a retired actress, and starts expressing her ideas in words. She breaks slowly but firmly from her cream and becomes much less uncomfortable. Every viewer knows the ups and downs of the film and the theater is full of laughs 75% of the time. The film satisfies everyone and I hope it will soon be released in all US theaters, as many do not have the chance to see the film if they do not live in big cities. This is NOTICE!
