This film is not a comedy, its disclosure. I have always hated the exhibition, given that ridiculous uprisings put their dogs and idiotic names on them. So the reason why my movie, despite the uncontrolled cling, took place. I'm getting out of what's taken so seriously, though the benefits are small and irrelevant. It's like miniature golf or jumping corner championships or the need to set some hidden world records. The action was much more sophisticated in this film than waiting for Guffman and its main reason is that the characters are more smooth when they look much more comfortable with the specific partners in their movie. Eugene Levy was great, like Michael McKean and Fred Willard. But the dogs stole the show. But then again, who wants to see a bunch of hounds in dog movies.
