This short, which won the Oscar, created two sequels and a TV comic festival, has minimal animation, but an admirable script (Theodore Geisel or Dr. Seuss) and a more memorable and enchanting main character. UPA launched an animation style that even influenced Disney in the mid-1950s and produced some of the best animated short pants that were made in the late 1940s and 1950s. That's their best. God keeps this publication. Highly recommended.
