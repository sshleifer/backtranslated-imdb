Iron Eagle may not be the most plausible film picture, but the characters are well written and well-functioning. If you can't believe this sign, the movie is a flop. <br /> <br /> I believe photography, especially aerial photography, is great. I believe it is much better than the Top Gun, with which it is endlessly compared. This is one of the best aerial photography I've seen. The Basil Paledouros soundtrack (spell forgiveness) is great and works well with rock music. I want this part of the soundtrack to be available. <br /> <br /> Jason Gedrick is doing as a teenager who has to grow up in a hurry and life, death and responsibility reality unexpectedly. Lou Gossett is both complicated and human when he remembers the death of pilots. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of movies you look at once and don't care to watch again. Then there are those films that give you one or the other aspect and what you can look at again and again! Iron Eagle is such a movie!
