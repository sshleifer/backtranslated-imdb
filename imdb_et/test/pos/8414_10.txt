James Hacker MP didn't expect him to be the next prime minister. Unlike America, a party in the UK is chosen when we, Americans, vote for candidates, regardless of their party. Despite the differences, Paul Eddington CBE, as Prime Minister, has arrived overnight with his senior adviser Sir Humphrey, played by another knight, Sir Nigel Hawthorne and veteran actor Derek Fowlds returning to the scene. Now, instead of letting some people like it, he feels more to the people than to his constituency. Now it's hard to work harder than before. Now he must approve the list of praise and work regularly with his Majesty. The hacker is not a hacking type. He is more like any person we want and does not want and does not become such or witch dictator. We are now seeing the Prime Minister's position and all the pleasures that need to be continued and strikes.
