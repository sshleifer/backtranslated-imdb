It's easy to see why many people consider Wong Kar-Wai to be the best movie for In the Mood's love. The film's tortured appeal, focusing on the investigated view of the relationship through the emotional ring, has been restored together to Happy Together's territory, but without hyper-kinetic explosion of film stocks and hyper-saturated sequences that have become trademarks of Kar-Wai films since Chungking Express. Like Soderberghi The Limey, this is a different curio for Kar-Wai; where the mood and the composition give up the dialogue and plot to create a story of two delicate lives in a seemingly limiting emotional statue. <br /> <br /> This is a testimony of the Kar-Wai genius that he can resonate with such a simple story. Chow Mo-Wan (Tony Leung) and Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) are moving next to each other in the same apartment building. He is a journalist who dreams of publishing martial arts novels and is the secretary of a shipping company. Their final tying is obvious from the beginning, but the joy here is how Kar-Wai paints this journey with his great master degree. <br /> <br /> The key to the success of this movie is the use of Kar-Wai indoors, playing in the foreground and background level, like Polanski's works. In the delightful sensual first half of the film, Kar-Wai Leung and Cheung separate so that the other person in the conversation would never be visible. Kar-Wai deals with the environment and space here, creating a narrow emotional dynamic between his characters. He also says that Kar-Wai has never decided to focus on the physicality of Mo-Wan and Li-Zen's spouses. Their seeming partners are noticeably absent from the movie because they tend to interact with each other for their love affairs. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that love is a limited experience, because Kar-Wai manages to swim his movie with hypnotic camera movement and sound sprawl. There is one shot where Cheung's slow, sensual uplift with the metaphoric staircase changes from Leung's descent to the same staircase; their movements perfectly complement each other, book a blow and create an erotic dualism between the two numbers. Their souls are interconnected, but they are not yet physically connected. The erotic displacement of these scenes is both fascinating and frustrating, as two star-loved lovers refuse physical perfection due to their modest fidelity. erotic moves through its internal environment, making Mike Galasso a glamorously beautiful result. Cheung dresses bless your exterior beautifully as she moves slowly through her surroundings. His movements grow slowly to what seems to be an inevitable connection between Li-szhen and his dream lover, although the seduction process seems completely subconscious. <br /> <br /> If I see these two characters are more than two birds releasing pheromones with each other, it's probably not so far drawn. The close links between these two characters with their interior are almost as intense as their relationship with the exterior. The film rarely moves into the outdoor space, and when the camera does it usually through oval windows and symbolic bars that always remind us that these characters are like restricted animals. Kar-Wai also tempts us when lovers are close enough to break the couple's closeness to each other by shooting them between the mirrors or the clothes inside the cabinet. Mother Nature even seems to respond to their love of love, often releasing a soft rain map over the characters when their bodies are slipped close together. Yu-Fai is experiencing Happy Together's cathartic release, even though Leslie Cheung's Ho Po wing was not with her. At the end of this film, love was so inextricably linked to the war action that the third-man silenced love statements signaled Yu-Fai's perception that his dreams of watching the waterfall would bring him inner peace, even if he didn't bring him back to his lover. The Mo-Wan journey ends with a crumbling temple. His emotional exhaustion is parallel to his country's political climate, and the lack of Li-szheni is only allowed because Kar-Wai allows Mo-Wan to experience various exemptions. Mo-Wan provides an ancient myth, and his secret liberation in the break of the temple leaves him the opportunity to live his days in the hope that all his loss and heartbreak will in some way be higher.
