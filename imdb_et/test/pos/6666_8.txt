Kevin Spacey once again chooses the winner of K-PAX, a loving film that expresses a deep revelation through human existence from the na√Øve, but at the same time undoubtedly wise, point of view of the Pride. <br /> <br /> It's fun to try to work out "if it is or not" when the plot grows and the mark of Robert Porter becomes more accurate. However, some may find the end unsatisfactory, but in reality it could not be otherwise. <br /> <br /> My few problems with the film are revolving around the simpler portrayal of multimedia and the mental patient. I was surprised that the film shows a lot of intelligence and I don't feel that it has lost anything if I was honest about how people with mental disorders behave. <br /> <br /> I said I know it was a movie, not a documentary and the film itself is exclusive and the story is relaxing. <br /> <br /> Bridges are big and Spacey brings comfort and relaxed performance that is more stand-up than an alien. <br /> <br /> A good movie that speaks to your friends.
