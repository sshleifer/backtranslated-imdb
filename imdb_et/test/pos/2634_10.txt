Chris Penn is fun like Jeff Spicol all the time. This movie is great because it was much more real and funny than the quick time ridgemont high. Casting was perfect and one of my favorite music almost all of Eddie van Halen, which became ou812 for songs and illegal meat. This movie is one of the great stoner movie heroes who have cheech and chong. Fast time was more depressing than funny. Abortion, friends cheating, jerking in bathrooms, bad jobs and failure. Someone has to hate the eighties to go beyond wild life. The film even had big fires, such as Michelle, the city border maker, who was in the local shop or Ben Stein in her first role in a sunny shop.
