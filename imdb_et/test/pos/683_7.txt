I first saw it as a child (LITTLE RASCALS first went to a TV-born year) and recently bought it on DVD. Meanwhile, I watched it at times when it was, and took note of the notes 1) in the pie fight and 2) how some of the racist parts were: Farina as a nubia slave, doing voodoo, for example. I think Roach and McGowan would be dead if they had tried it now. <br /> <br /> Note how the pie fights at the Three Stooges' HALFWITS FISHING DAY and SWEET PIE AND PIE. it ... and this movie came a few years before their initial contract with Harry Cohn at Columbia Pictures. Of course, SS and Laurel & Hardy were inspired by these films ... Remember that at that time they stole all of the best, each other !!! Another note: Laurel & Hardy Buffs, to bake a sales lady was nothing more than Dorothy Coburn, who also appeared in the TBOTC - "flapper" who got into his car and got it in the back. Always fleeing me, why is he never credited?
