Although I brought this movie randomly (I thought it was the original Halloween (stupid eh!)), I was surprised how good it was, many descendants continue the events of the previous films, but tried and managed to explain the prequels, why Michael Myers kills people and how he seems supernatural. I thought it was a terrible movie full of activities, tensions and surprises, I'm very glad I brought it. I've given it out of 10 out of 10.
