Three Stooges short, this is Shemp. Of all the people involved in Shemp, this is my short film, Stooges. The basic thing is that Shemp has to marry at 6 o'clock when he has to inherit half a million dollars, which the abundant uncle left behind. So Shemp sees a bride for herself, but she finds it a harder-than-expected way until they learn about their inheritance money. The best bits include Shemp Shaving, Shemp and Moe in the telephone booth and Larry on the piano as Shemp's voice training. It is also fun when Shemp is wrong as Cousin Basil and its result.
