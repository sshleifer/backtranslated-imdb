Buddy Holly was the pioneer and victim of the early days of rock 'n'. Young singer / songwriter Lubbock, Texas left his mark on contemporary music models. Inspired by Elvis Presley, Holly spent a lot of time fighting the system to get her rock-a-billy sound. Prior to his premature death, he interfered with lush strings with bop rhythms. Holly would take her place with Presley, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis and Ricky Nelson as the voice of teenage voices. <br /> <br /> This easy look biologically is not without errors. Some situations, events, places, and even names were not right for different reasons. What makes this movie so plausible is that Gary Busey made his song on Holly's part. The well-produced soundtrack became a multi-million vendor. <br /> <br /> Busey was nominated for an Oscar. Other stars are Don Stroud, Conrad Janis, Charles Martin Smith and Maria Richwine.
