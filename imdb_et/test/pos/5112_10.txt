This is a great movie. I liked several parts of the movie. This movie is very funny! Visit the Ernest Fun Club website at www.ernestfunclub.com There are several films such as: Ernest goes to camp, Ernest saves Christmas, Ernest goes to jail, Ernest's army, Ernest goes to school, Ernest Rides goes back to Slam Dunk Ernest etc. I recommend them for family movies. All the stars Jim Varney try to visit again at www.ernestfunclub.com What's the best Ernest movie? In my opinion, 2 Ernest is actually going to camp and Ernest goes to prison. So if you have never seen Ernest P. Worrell's time to go to him and see him. Do you find it quite satisfactory "no, what do I mean"?
