I have to admit that I've never heard of this movie. I got it in TMC last night. I thought it was hysterical. I laughed so hard and loved the end. The picture the Marx brothers would want the movies when they collaborated with Salvadore Dali and Malcolmn X, and then all fell on the LSD. <br /> <br /> Funny and nervous are two words that can be overused these days. most of today's comedy points and surreal booties. I had to be at 6:00 and watched it until 2:30 am. I slept and missed my duties. Still worth it. I do not recommend renting it, I would recommend it. It was so good. <br /> <br /> The only warning I have is that both references are dated and may not be available to younger people. Beware of it and use your head. <br /> <br /> I have to put it in the most important comedies of all time.
