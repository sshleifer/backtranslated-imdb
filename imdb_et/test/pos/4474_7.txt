The story begins with the soldier being transported to the desert, and then the time comes back to tell him how he came to this place. He started as an official in the fight against the Napoleon army in Egypt, but left his unit. After almost hungry and / or thirsty death, he came to a leopard that somehow got his chest call. It brought him food and before the soldier became almost completely wild, he had an acute bond with the animal. But all things are over and the man decided he had to leave. Very strange film, well written and depicted. Beautiful scenery from Jordan and Utah, which did not always fit perfectly but cares.
