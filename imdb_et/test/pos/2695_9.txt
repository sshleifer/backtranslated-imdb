The "Queen of the Queen" can be divided into two periods. <br /> <br /> The first time of the first seasons depicted the everyday life of a man and his wife, which made this city alive. Paycheck by paycheck. <br /> <br /> Another era, increased the scope of the show, addressing the current popular culture and marriage issues of humorous spin. <br /> <br /> But besides all this. <br /> <br /> This show was a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Kevin James, when he did not make commercials with Adam Sandler, is a laughter gene and his chemistry with Leah Remini was incomparable on television. <br /> <br /> Jerry Stiller as a psychotic living creature father added his own unique style of peculiar humor and Patton Oswalt as "human-child" Spence Ulchin was amazing (he is also a great comedian) "King of the Queens" was the last sitcom in the 1990s go and it is a shame. Now, all we have to look at is an idiotic sitcom that is full of uninvited actors and actors whose only complaint is their physical appearance. I like many fans actually funny TV shows I'm now grief
