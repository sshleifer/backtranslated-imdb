Although I hoped I'd like it a little more, it was definitely an impressive movie. All the leaders had great performances and a story, although not what I would cool was still effective and kept me interesting. For me, the best part of this film was the appearance of the picture, because it always seemed cold and damp, and it just seemed to fit the film well. I also thought that a low budget would fit this movie because I don't think that a crisp picture and clear sound would have worked in a gloomy film. Taking all things into consideration, it fell slightly short of expectations, but I'm still very happy that I finally sat down to watch this movie.
