In describing the basics of the main plot of GATE, it can be thought that it is a revolutionary western 60's or 70's. <br /> <br /> * Our hero is a robber, a killer, and an instigator; <br /> <br /> * Love is a single mother whose unchanging husband gave up her and their child; <br /> <br /> * twice our criminal hero is "unofficially" released by the authorities for some good deeds, and is presented as a commendable act; <br /> <br /> * The only actions that are truly misrepresented are family betrayal and betrayal of criminals, <br /> <br /> * The hero tries to go straight, but returns to the crime scene if he doesn't get a job; <br /> <br /> * The hero is from a sheriff's position as well as a criminal, <br /> <br /> * The hero's final salvation is achieved by strangling the man with his bare hands and tilting his body over the cliff, <br /> < br /> * and a "good bad person" finishes the film by sending the young mother and her child back to civilization and riding alone in the Mexican desert, never (probably) paying for their life for a crime. <br /> <br /> Just tell you that there is nothing new under the sun. <br /> <br /> Of course, TOLL GATE does not really show his cynicism or moral nihilism: the hero's redemption is created when he surrenders after he has read the Bible. Clint Eastwood can't be imagined. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> of any standard, and Hart was a very subtle actor was not given a wide range of histrionics, often used to convey emotions in the days before the sound. <br /> <br /> 9/10
