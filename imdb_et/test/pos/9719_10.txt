I remember my father hired these episodes on video. My whole family loved them, and now that I've been away from home and caught my life, I try to share these fabulous Jim Henson creations with my husband and stepfather, but when I find out it's not all Henson fan. What's wrong, because it means they have to look for me in the search for this series. But even though they don't find them interesting, I would highly recommend that someone get the storyteller. You're going to have lost world stories in the world when people could only talk about inexplicable situations through stories and how people need to care if they ever come across these situations.
