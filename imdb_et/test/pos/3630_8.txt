Duke is a very silly movie - the dog becomes a Duke! But this is a very fun movie. It has some of the colds that many kids have of movies, but (luckily!) Some body tasks joking because so many animal movies feel forced to be! Mostly dogs are dogs and people. . . well, people. "Good guys" are pleasant and attractive. The bad guys are ridiculous and of course the punishment of many jokes. But there is something dignified about this movie, because although it's silly, it's not all cheap laughs like "Home Alone" and others. <br /> <br /> Crocket, Simon and Copper do a great job of Black and Tan Coonhound "Hubert", who will become a Duke after the death of his beloved owner, a true Duke. Mostly they act as dogs, do not speak or talk about human emotions and attitudes. But they make stereotypes and Hubert falls for him just because he's on a tree. Come on! These are dogs - they have a different view of beauty !!! <br /> <br /> Generally it is charming, fun and enjoyable.
