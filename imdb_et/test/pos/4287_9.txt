Now this is the movie we got weekly. Now-a-day it is rare to see a drama that depends on the talk that talked to each other. <br /> <br /> There are no explosions, no cars or no delay, there are indirect sexual situations. a younger crowd film, for those who appreciate people talking to each other, they claim a lot when we have a married couple with a middle life problem. <br /> <br /> Emily Watson & Tom Wilkinson is a seemingly happy middle-aged loving man and woman. Now, the same little suburb of London lives, beautiful, Rupert Everett returns home to visit his rich father. <br /> <br /> She will, of course, meet Emily Watson. I say no more, except that the beginning of the credit is a fatal accident, the rest of the film is the result of the consequences of this accident and all the different characters. <br /> <br /> This trio and others are great. <br /> <br /> Julien Fellows wrote a script on Nigel Balchin's novel. He also led it to be his first attempt at leadership and he did very well. All production is first-rate. <br /> <br /> At the end of 2005, the film was a few months in theater, with less than 80 theaters. For me, it is a shame, Stupid comedies open on at least 2000 screens, but real good printings like this and many others just open up in some. <br /> <br /> By the way, in some situations it is a very funny line. . <br /> <br /> Ratings: *** 1/2 (out of 4) 95 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)
