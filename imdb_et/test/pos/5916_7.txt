I see Billy Wilder (The Seven Year Itch, Some Like It Hot) as a little underrepresented and underrated movie to be seen. This is the biography of Charles Augustus' Slim Lindbergh (James Stewart), who in 1927 wanted to be the first man to cross the New York solo flight, crossing the Atlantic to reach the small cabin in Paris. The first half hour or whatever Lindbergh promises to do, and the construction of a plane called "St. Louis spirit", and all the necessary preparations. Then the rest of the course will see your dangerous journey, surpassing the moments of fatigue, loss of fuel, and loss of direction, but he was successful. Murray Hamilton Bud Gurney, Patricia Smith as Mirror Girl, Bartlett Robinson as Benjamin Frank Mahoney, Robert Cornthwaite as Harry Knight, Sheila Bond as Model / Dancer, Marc Connelly as Father Hussman, Arthur Space as Donald Hall, Harlan Warde as Boedecker and Dabbs Greer as Goldsborough. Obviously, Lindbergh was a bit younger, so Stewart was too old to play, but then you can never think of someone else who could do better. It's a witty and emotional drama where Stewart (as always) is a fantastic, great music score by Frank Waxman and a good direction from Wilder, a good little known pearl. It was the best special effect for the Oscar (the only prize he ever named). James Stewart was number 100 "The 100 Biggest Movie Star", number 100 100 years, 100 stars - men, and he was number 13 at the world's biggest actor. Very good!
