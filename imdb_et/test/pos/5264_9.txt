This is one of my favorites. Betty White and Leslie Neilson shine in this romantic comedy. One is the manager of the company who appreciates life based on his death expectations during the year. The other is playboy, who is tired of young women with gold and is looking for a relationship with a vital and mature woman. If you have silver and / or heart romance in your hair, the popcorn is in the microwave, honey in your hands and prepares you for treatment.
