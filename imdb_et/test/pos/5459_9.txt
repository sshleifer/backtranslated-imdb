Late Shift is a great book, I read the book several years ago, and I was in the hero that went when Johnny Carson retired and Jay Leno and Johnny Carson tried to take their place. When the movie came out, I cut a copy of VHS from the movie and read it again recently, it's hard to say what I enjoy more, because they're pretty much the amount of information they deliver. Two major players, John Michael Higgins and Daniel Roebuck, two actors I never heard of and heard about, play convincingly with Leno and Letterman, despite Letterman leaving his image bad. They play parts quite well, despite many people looking for the imitation of these two. I was not so interested. The story is what counts. And this leads me to Kathy Bates. Kathy Bates, who plays Helen Kushnick, is this movie. He plays this evil bitch that is so threatening as you realize how on earth you can control this woman yourself, with less national TV show. Yikes! Should be a sequel !!
