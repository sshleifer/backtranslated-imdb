In my opinion, Flatley destroyed the first ridiculous ego. He was disrespectful of his dance partner, trying to stand up and knowing the spirit of Riverdance. That's good when he left the show. Colin Dunne, the new male leader, is great, and when he and Jean Butler dance together, magic happens! Eileen Iver's dazzling is amazing (like Noel Eccles percussion) and Maria Pages' Fire Dance is worth the entrance price! When Pages and Ivers come together, at the end of the show for a musical duet, it's a real treasure. I agree that editing is not free, but the technical disadvantage cannot overcome this extraordinary market power. This is one to get. There has never been a Riverdance! It's real!
