Natile Portman and Susan Sarandon play as a symphony of a young girl who is understood to be the daughter of a woman's wife. Sarandon has this ability to call talent if you want to play some of the most amazing characters and bring your humanity to the forefront of every movie he does. As a naturally brilliant and mutant mother, a younger girl, Sarandon alternates with her mother and child in a ballet dancer. More importantly, he does it with force and burning without falling over portraying all of Portman's daughter. The question is always asked when we deconstruct a film plot that changes? This movie is definitely about her daughter, but if you look closely at the dreams and sacrifices the mother makes you realize she is changing her daughter's step. I am ready to bet that it will make us change in the audience. A fine drama feature
