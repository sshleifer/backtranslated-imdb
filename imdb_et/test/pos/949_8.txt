"Tumbling Doll of Flesh" by Tamakichi Anaru is a Japanese shocker about three heartburners who sexually abused, tortured and demolished a young woman by filming their terrible activities. Normally twisted Japanese porn sick, offering lots of sadistic sexual violence and harsh affection. There is no plot to talk about, but much hard core sex scenes (again optically censored) and lots of blood. Special effects are quite impressive - the breakdown of the Japanese porn actor is shown in uncertain details. His hand is also cut and his belly is graphically sliced ​​and finally one of the sick intestines is sexy. "Psycho: Snuff rolls" remind me of "Mussel: meat and blood flowers", but it's not so memorable. So if you're a Japanese sick who is very exhausted, like "All Women are Whores" or "Raping My Virgin Slave", then give it one out of 10.
