This is one of those movies you just don't want to finish. The characters are rich, like well-woven tapestries. Colorful costumes, music and characters bring you in and tell the story of the people who lived in the boarding house for decades during the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War. The young man takes on a dynamic, big-hearted woman who drives the house and these are the stories based on her experience. <br /> <br /> I couldn't believe it was made for television. It was so well done. S. Epatha Merkerson is great as Nanny and she brings this role so much. You want to be there in your limbs. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie as much as I bought a DVD.
