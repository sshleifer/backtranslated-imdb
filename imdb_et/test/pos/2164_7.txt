Don't make me wrong, it was fun to watch. It has a nice animated film, except for odd-looking bugs and nice music. And the standout scene was definitely Elmer, Bugs and Daffy dance on the floor, it was a nice and fun touch. Actually, the whole comic is nice to look at, but overall, what I call exceptional, like Carrotblanca. There are some very nice gags, but they have been used before I feel, and there wasn't much I would have fun. And did Daffy join forces with Elmer? Somehow he saw that he was the hunter's target, whether it seemed strange to be friends with him. Although I admit that there was a great Daffy. Voice was also above average, but somehow I missed Mel Blanc. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was an unusual but very nice cartoon. 7/10 Bethany Cox
