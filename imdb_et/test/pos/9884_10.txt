Take someone you love or want to love and watch this movie. <br /> <br /> It touches you in all the right places. <br /> <br /> All the other reviewers here have said it all. <br /> <br /> Maybe the cynical is not impressive. <br /> <br /> They only look like nice things that leave you depressed during the day. <br /> <br /> This movie is Ghana I am so pleased that the director is not trained in the USC. <br /> <br /> This confirms my assumption that there is too much mediocrity and compliance in the movie today. <br /> <br /> This is due to the USC's locking process and affinity. <br /> <br /> Hooray to Jeff Hare and Richard Marcus. Well done!
