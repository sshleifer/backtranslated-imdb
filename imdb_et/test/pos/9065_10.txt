I really loved this original scenario and the different places that I felt emotionally, mentally, and simply stupid. I didn't get the scenario or "credibility" of the actors and didn't think about it even before I read about the movie listed in IMDb. Listening to Michael Parson talks about Q & A's idea of ​​a movie, who wants to see how mad people or "f'ed" people, as he said, love is really interesting. I found that I didn't have a story about the romance of the book and liked to see that it was the best. I like watching David Krumholtz in everything he does and has followed his career for a few years. I believe this is some of his best works and tells anyone to watch this movie to watch the amazing young actress. I agree that Guillermo Díaz was really a screener and what he did was really a great lesson in commitment. I laughed and cried in this film and was disappointed that the festival didn't win any prizes. I ask why this didn't happen. I gave Max and Grace ten, because they are interesting, unique and creative Indie films deserve the audience. Technically watching this movie, is it really beautifully done? the colors are amazing and finally it is one of the best soundtracks I've heard in the film for a while.
