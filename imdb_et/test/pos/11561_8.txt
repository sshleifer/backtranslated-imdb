Okay ... this is 2005 and when you finally start watching this movie, you probably call it dated. But here's the thing, the scenario was bold, the exposure of the music industry at that time was also bold ... and it took time for the American American music to be promoted at the same level by white deeds. In some cases, it is still - but in the 70s this film has dealt with some "backgrounds" that many did not know. Now we have "American Idol" - "Pop Idol" and other things that allow us to "record" the thoughts and how they think they should market something that sells and not market. <br /> <br /> When I was a kid, I loved the release of Earth, wind and fire "It's the way of the world" that contained some of their biggest hits: "Shining Star", "Reasons", "Yeanin", Learnin '" and the title. I didn't know it was MOVIE SOUNDTRACK ... until I moved to Los Angeles and got an excellent "Z" channel. <br /> <br /> The "Z" channel showed it as part of the "Harvey Keitel retrospective. Gee, I had no idea Harvey Keitel had so many movies - and when I saw it, I was surprised. This film is not a cinematic masterpiece, but it deserves more values ​​than it is. This is a nice little movie. Harvey Keitel is doing more than a "giant piece" for Earth, wind and fire, as he has beaten as a disk manager trying to "fight the system". There's a lot of lessons and lots of "insider" trade that was open. <br /> <br /> If you find this uncut ... worth a look.
