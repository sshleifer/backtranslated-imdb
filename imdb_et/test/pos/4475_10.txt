What an incredible story and a beautiful movie! Hat is off with Ben Daniels, Lavinia Currier, and great Honore de Balzac. This enchanting film conveys the passion of the characters so effortlessly and so forcefully. I looked at it trapped, almost holding my soul as the story developed to its infallible end. Completing this film was almost flawless: simple and clean, playing with our hearts, guiding us to understand the strange platonic, absolute and overwhelming bond between two beings who are not part of each other's world. Both are capable of being attached, but ironically it is more "developed", who becomes addictive and predominant and unable to accept another freedom. This is one of the most interesting and intriguing look at many forms of love and an incredible study of how sometimes human love can be overwhelming and destructive. <br /> <br /> Only the rational mind would associate this story with any kind of goodness.
