I'm like the rest of the fans who love this comedy, I've been waiting for it on DVD. I got it on VHS and got so loose to wait for release and worried that my VHS copy would be destroyed when I got this device to access the DVD. The picture and sound are great for my surprise. If someone else wants me, copy the line at <br /> <br /> stone_stew@yahoo.co.uk <br /> <br /> and put it on a DVD, print DVD and get this post for you. Â£ 7.00 covers only your costs and stored delivery, etc. Maybe a little over, so I don't deserve the money after that, I would like to see this ignored comedy pearl as the world. got over 26 pounds, amazing. How they can't release this classics. Send me payment information like check or Paypal etc etc
