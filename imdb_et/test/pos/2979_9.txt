Great movie! The soundtrack is fantastic! Very relaxing sound. Already in 1971, Elton was ahead of his time. Lewis Gilbert did a great job of producing and directing this movie! The film was a romantic and fresh breath of air. Sir Elton's tracks praised the film T. Rex Morris does a good job of tenor scissor song "Honey Roll" and Richard Le Gallienne's poem "I Work Today" - was incredible! Kudos to all those involved in this fantastic movie! It was not surprising that many people involved in this film became the best in their field.
