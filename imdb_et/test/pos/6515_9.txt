Sally and Saint Anne are a very funny movie. The first time my mother told me this was 7 years old and Saint Anne was just the Holy I had for my dinner for Saint. My mother knew it, so she said I was watching her. I did it and I have seen it several times because it's really funny. The daughter of Bea Andy Griffith Show was there and Sally's grandfather was a man who played at Miracle on the 34th Street as Santa Claus. So there were many actors on television as well. It is a bad man who tries to steal the house and Sally tries to steal the house. Helping Anne with things to help raise money so they can keep the house. This includes a boxing game with Hugh O'Brian, who plays his older brother. This is a good and funny movie that I still love.
