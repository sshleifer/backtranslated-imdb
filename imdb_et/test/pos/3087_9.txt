I remember when I first saw this movie. I was a nanny for my mother's friend, and one of the kids suggested we looked at it. Thinking that it was honestly ridiculous, "The Prince of Thieves", they slipped into the video record, I was ready for a few hours of boredom, which I came up with as a shock, a pleasant thing that I admit, but still a shock. <br /> <br /> Now you all know about Robin Hood's legend? I'll explain a little. Robin Hood was in Saxony's criminal order, where he won money there and gave it to people who needed it all the time seducing the beautiful Maid Marion and annoying Nottingham Sheriff and Prince John. That's the basics! Now, during the review. <br /> <br /> This movie was released in 1993 and is the attack of the whole Robin Hood legend, and especially of the princes. <Br /> <br /> After the legend, Robin of Loxley first appears in the Arab Prison during the third-century crusades and, together with "Moor", when they were invited these days, he fills the cunning battle, Asneeze asks Asneeze after Robin to find him his son Atchoo, a foreign exchange student in England, and look at him. This Robin promises to do! Robin goes back to England. <br /> <br /> He returns to his home, Loxley Castle, to find that bailiffs are driving down the back of the vehicle and passing through his sad revelation that his father, dog, cat, and even goldfish are all dead. Desperate is the familiar face that he finds that the family's loyal blind servant Blinkin is sitting in a toilet with Braille Jazz Mag. The sensation continues throughout the film. <br /> <br /> As with all Robin Hood's stories, Robin must prevent Prince John and Rottingham sheriff's evil plans that are devastating the king of King Richard and overcharging. He's away. <br /> <br /> For those who know Mel Brooks earlier, there is some thought to be expected. After all, it's Dracula-dead and loving and young Frankenstein. All the jokes, ranging from visual gags to wonderful spiritual commentaries, are in exactly the right places throughout the film, where you ever laugh more than a minute. <br /> <br /> Cary Elwes (just an English-speaking person) Robin Hood in the movie), many of whom you know from Princess Bride, bring an eye to this film with an embarrassingly ridiculous eye and do a great job. From extreme heroic positioning to the evil sexy look, he is really amazingly funny. And the man looks better than tights! <br /> <br /> Richard Lewis is fun as a lofty, arrogant Prince John with a constantly changing mole. He gets a must-boy behavior on the road, and his sparkling American vocals are great. Throughout the film, the mole constantly changes in his face: it starts in his left cheek, then to the right cheek, then to the jaw, then to his forehead, before he returns to his original place. This is a subtle joke based on Alan Rickman's mole when he played the sheriff in the prince of the toes. <br /> <br /> Roger Rees, as Rottingham's buggy sheriff is admirable and nasty, and has excellent lines all over here. There are some faces you can recognize from other Brooks films. For example, Robert Ridgely, who played the nickname in this film, also played Blazing in the saddles, in the second film production Brooks. She also likes to include fine references to her earlier films; there are several people in this movie who are dying hard for Brooks fans. Those who watched the history of the 1st part of the world recognize the music for the song "Men's Tights". When Patrick Stewart arrives and travels to Marion, Mel himself (playing Rabbi Tuckman) speaks of "it's good to be king", one of his lines in world history. <br /> <br /> The whole cast is wonderfully comedic, even those with just a few lines bring them great warmth and humor. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so wonderfully warm and funny I think are all improvised scenes. Although there was a script, some scenes in themselves were completely improvised, for example, a scene where Latrine (Tracey Ullman) prayed in her bed for Rottingham, and she falls through the ceiling, landing to the right where she wanted, and both sides were fully developed and thoughtful. <br /> <br /> There are few special effects, and those with small but fun moments of computer shooting are <br /> <br /> a memorable, some very funny songs and a few cheesy love songs. Singers "Men's Tights" or at least move it for weeks. <br /> <br /> Rating is Pg, to which I say BAH HUMBUG. There's no bad language in the movie except when using a double club, and one sh! T and violence is scarce. In fact, I would like to go so far as to say nothing, except for some anti-comedy scenes. <br /> <br /> A great fun movie that both adults and children enjoy!
