I love the TV competition. You hate to see it. There are so many talented competitors. It's a shame that only 2 are selected. I also love judges. Sometimes they are as fun as competitors. I've been looking at the exhibition faithfully every Sunday night. Don't miss this world. This is the best reality show that has ever been on television. Good luck to all competitors, though I've already chosen the two I would like to see at Danny and Sandy Broadway. I want to see if my decisions are right. I don't know how long the contest will continue until Danny and Sandy are selected, but I look up to the end.
