Absolutely the most thoughtful, spiritually deep and intense Hamlet ever made - no other version is close by. Jacobil has the best understanding of the role of all the players who have played it. Patrick Stewarti Claudius is wild and still sympathetic - I especially like the two Doophuses who play Rosencranz and Guildenstern. Very unpleasant and still sinful. Some may need strong Ophelia - he is not a strong person, it is a point and Lalla Ward hits the right nuances. Amazing. Just amazing - each of more than two dozen times I've watched it.
