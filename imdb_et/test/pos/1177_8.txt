Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon, both of whom have unfortunately been left behind, have once again proved that they are a team dedicated to their craft to bring the fun of the screen. This movie is another example of this. <br /> <br /> This time they play two brothers who land on the ship as dance teachers. <br /> <br /> Of course, their boss is a perfectionist and unhappy man named Gil Godwin, who just enjoys these boys' harassment. It's fun how Lemmon gives Matthau a quick lesson in dancing and how the latter dances ship-owner Rue McLanahani robbing the rum. <br /> <br /> It is too bad for fellow dance teachers Hal Linden and Donald O'Connor to be given so little, but their parts require it. Matthau falls on Dyan Cannon, with his companion, a gold-mined mother, the usual outrageous Elaine Stritch. It is not known to them that Matthau also has no money. Widow Lemmon falls on Gloria De Haven, who sees love more than ever. <br /> <br /> The film belongs to Matthau and Lemmon and is an additional respect for their outstanding career.
