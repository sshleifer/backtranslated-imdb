This game requires stealth, smart and steady hands. The game is simply the best; besides, there are interesting extras - bead holes in walls, enemies react to specific points where they have been hit by bullets, there are tons of animated animations that make enemies very real (for example, by reviewing) the window on the guard stands there swatting flies, sneezing or scratching yourself), the list goes on. This is the best licensed / movie conversion and it will make you spy in the shoes of spy. This game is the best reason to own a N64.
