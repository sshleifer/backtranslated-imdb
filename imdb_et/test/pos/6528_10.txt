I love Aaron's crankcase, but I even expected the pop star to be predictable, but I was so wrong! Aaron's carter was a very funny and great actor! The actor who played Jane was also a great actor! Anyone who didn't see it loved it! <br /> <br /> In this music it was also great! <br /> <br /> My favorite lines of the movie are "you can't send me a public school mother! Im a CELEBRIDEE !!" and "Take your time, it's coming to you!" <br /> <br /> Although the ends are a kind of cheesy, all the good chicks do! This movie is great and the right chick flick that I can watch again and again!
