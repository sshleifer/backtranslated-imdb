I know Chill Wills usually played the beloved old varieties in the West. But his role in this segment is something I remember for a long time. Wills can be the first offender. Yes, the autumn of Burgess Meredith was right! It looks like a Hepplewhite eye! It simultaneously expressed the greed, ignorance and the risk of violence of the pigs. I think it is quite effective. <br /> <br /> The segment itself was also good. Question: Didn't a small black bag improve alcoholism? I think it was like Fall. But the doctor would have wanted to treat him if he did, as soon as possible to Hepplewhite. <br /> <br /> There is one moment that was annoying but also necessary. And this is something that seems to be repeated in the segments of the gallery this night. This is Serling's constant need to preach. Because we got again with Dr. Fall. I don't know what was more frustrating, lost a black bag and all his wonders or not to stop Falli from declaring a bag of usefulness to mankind, all at the same time rubbing Hepplewhite greedy face mud and thus all besides begging Hepplewhite for him to hit him. But as I said, it was necessary. At least it was for me. Otherwise, we would not have been able to see the Wills action described above. Everything is done without moving the muscles or speaking the word.
