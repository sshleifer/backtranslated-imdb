LACKAWANNA BLUES is an entertaining, emotionally charged HBO-TV film based on the childhood memories of actor Ruben Santiago-Hudson (who also plays a small role). This delightful film experience focuses on Rachel's "Nanny" Crosby, a guardian of Santiago-Hudson's childhood, a strong, cordial black woman who ran in the 1950s in New York. Nanny was one female social services organization whose boarding house was full of drunken, abandoned, exhausting, drug addicts, misfits and all the other towns that needed delivery. The story has turned to Nanny's relationship with young Ruben (beautiful Marcus Franklin), a boy whose divorced parents could not raise the boy properly, so Nanny took him in. Epatha Merkeson, who has been wasted for many years as Lieutenant Van Buren's role in NBC Law and Order, turns the Christmas Contest as a babysitter, a mother-in-law neighborhood, whose nursing home became a symbol of abandoned black people in her city. Merkeson is no wonder in the performance that earned him the Golden Globe and the Emmy Award. Merkeson's support is impressively all-starred with Terrance Howard (brilliant and heartbreaking like a nanny's wife), Louis Gossett Jr., Rosie Perez, Jimmy Smits, Delroy Lindo, Macy Gray, Michael K. Williams, Jeffrey Wright, Henry Simmons Patricia Wettig, Ernie Hudson, Mos Def and Hill Harper as Adult Ruben. Colorful and exciting, beautifully photographed and exquisitely appreciated, this is one of the definite film experiences that works at all levels, but if for some other reason it is worth looking at the electrifying performance of S. Epatha Merkeson, who is given the vital role and gives the most benefit.
