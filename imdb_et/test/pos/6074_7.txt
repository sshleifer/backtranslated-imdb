An English patient is one of those films that deserve the highest praise. I say the most, because this film, though very serious, intense, deep and truly thoughtful, still suffers from some drawbacks. First of all, why, oh, why are modern films so long? It takes more than two hours and from time to time it is very difficult to concentrate and follow a very serious plot. I'll say that if the film was an hour shorter, it would only be good. But we have what we have. The winner of several Osars, the English patient is still very good. It is a deep, incomprehensible treatise about human soul, love and betrayal, war and cowardice, violence and bravery. Ralph Fiennes is an amazing great actor. His hero, neurotic and quiet, is a mysterious person who is ready for everything to save his lover's life. He's big, though half of the time he's deformed exhaustion. He's the strongest link here. Juliette Binoche is traditionally very convincing and sweet. He adds a lot to his great game and love story to the plot with this Sikh officer. Willem Defoe, Colin Firth, Christine Scott Thomas are all here, all great and all very strong. And then there is the Egyptian desert, then there is a deep, cloudless sky, Italian green baskets. Nature is here, even when people die, bombs are blowing, landmines explode. There is war here too. It's obvious, terrible and bloody. Then there are dead bodies, horrible bodies, then naked bodies, adultery and all. I do not know what to say. So many great actors, so much realism, so much cruelty as war brings. It's not a relaxing film. It makes you think.
