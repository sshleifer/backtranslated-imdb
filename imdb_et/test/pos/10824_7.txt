More and more French cinema shows that it is the only one who can fight against Hollywood and spend large sums in his films. If Bon Voyage has been made in the US, no one would be surprised. Perfectly set for France, in the 40s as a Nazi invasion, technically impeccable and with some of the most international French actors (Depardieu, Adjani, Ledoyen ...). Bon Voyage centers in two parallel readings: a scientific and his disciple (Ledoyen) who tries to hide the Nazis from one of his discoveries (water that can act as an atomic bomb); and a poor boy who loves a well-known actor (Adjani) who gets into jail, accused of a crime he has not committed to his defense. <br /> <br /> Bon Voyage seems to be made in an old style without unnecessary camera movements and effects. Without large revolutions in the plot. As I said before, a great deal of work has been done on production. But the main problem with this movie is the script. Is this a spy movie? Romantic Comedy? Spy Comedy? Comics intrigue? It's not clear. This makes Bon Voyage a little unbalanced. If you think you're watching comedy, suddenly another story becomes more dramatic, slower ... I think they should have focused on one line of argument (this is a piece of spy) and left the romantic parts in the background. <br /> <br /> My Course: 6.5 / 10
