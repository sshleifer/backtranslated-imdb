The Naruto Anime TV series has so far given birth to 2 full-length theatrical films and the third is coming this summer. <br /> <br /> The first, which appeared in the summer of '04, was a fun adventure in the exciting adventure of Naruto's main characters. But to deny the film's faults must be dark, deaf, and one footed chicken. Although the first was certainly enjoyable, there were many things that could be improved. However, Naruto Movie 2 takes all these aspects and stands out for them. <br /> <br /> First of all, it was an incredible movie. Lighting, setup and style were three times as effective as the first film. The first was given the basic measures, well animated and choreographic animation, but nothing struck, but the cinematography of this film was extraordinary, using shadows and combining lighting to make everything that was more intense and effective. fighting force. <br /> <br /> Animation was great. It was rivals with Disney, but because it is a movie with TV characters, there was nothing special about the character and details of the actual characters, but the animation was incredibly liquid and realistic. I think they used twice as much cinnamon every second because there was nothing nervous about animation, it was incredibly liquid. <br /> <br /> Music ... I don't think this movie will succeed. For the film, the original composer / conductor of the TV show was used and I don't feel that he did that good. Music mostly reminded me of old SNES games. The composer is very good, but the synthesizers used for the film were not able to convey the sound very well. But they couldn't leave the movie at all, adding a good addition to the action. But with the exception of a few violin / strings at the end and some choral works, the music didn't seem to have any limits or anything special. <br /> <br /> The story was fun. It was a fairly typical story for Naruto, and it was very similar to the first films except that it was all that was wrong with the first movie and better for them. The characters were much more interesting, and the way the story progressed was what looked at the whole movie. It went on to think that the movie ended in any second, but then it would move on, but instead of feeling out of it, all the activities and signs were all fresh and exciting. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is good, but still good, it is definitely one of the fans. I liked the movie, but that's because ... I'm a fan! But I see, as with Final Fantasy Advent Children, it doesn't look like a movie, but just acts as a fantastic service for fan service in a good hour and a half. Although I think this film works as a good introduction to the current series of non-observers, it does not give any effect other than that glued on the Naruto screen. Nonetheless, it was a fun movie during the irritating time of filmmakers.
