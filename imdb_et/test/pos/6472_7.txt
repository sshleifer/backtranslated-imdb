Knute Rockne led an extraordinary life and his story is quite well spoken by Knute Rockne All American. We follow Rockne's incredible journey between a young Norwegian boy and an iconic American football legend. The film produced in 1940 may occasionally feel touched and sometimes completely cool. And filmmakers sometimes make it a little thick when Rockne is beautifully and lovingly depicted. You might think that Rockne should have applied for holiness when he was just a football coach. But it is undeniable that he had a big impact on the football game and that it had a tremendous impact on the lives of so many young men he was in charge of. This movie shows the great influence it has and gives you an insight into why it is so respectable today. <br /> <br /> Playing Rockne, Pat O'Brien provides impressive performance. This is undoubtedly O'Brien's film he does, and he makes a movie and his character. Actual Rockne was known as a great inspirational figure, and O'Brien's strength gives you an idea of ​​why. The only imprisonment begins at the beginning of the film, when O'Brien plays a college student at Rockne in his early twenties in the early twenties. All the makeup in the world didn't make it credible and the effect was rather dirty. However, like Rockne's character time and starting his legendary trainer career, O'Brien fits in perfectly perfectly. <br /> <br /> The rest of the name jumps out and this is of course Ronald Reagan, who is young, charismatic, but finally killed George Gipp. It's not really a big part of the movie, because Reagan will appear in no more than 10-15 minutes. But the performance has become legendary thanks to Reagan's famous "Win one for Gipper". It's a great game full of emotions. Reagan may not have been on the screen for a very long time, but he certainly had a huge positive impact on his winning ability. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie has a balance between football and life in general Rockne has great lessons for both young men in both areas. It is rare for football fans (and historical buffers) because the actual archive material of Notre Dame's games in the Rockne era is inside the film. This is a rare opportunity to see how much the game has evolved over the last six plus decades and the chance to see Rockne's legendary strategic innovations in practice. If you're a fan of Notre Dame, probably the fact that Notre Dame Victory March is apparently enjoying a movie for the film is a pleasure. If you're a Notre Dame lady ... well, you're not likely to watch this movie. Knute Rockne All American is an inspiring, uplifting, emotional film. Maybe it is too sentimental, but it's not that bad. This is a very enjoyable movie to watch.
