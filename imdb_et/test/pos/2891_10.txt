I bought this DVD recently and I was quite awake that Rush's songs sounded the same way when they first heard them in 1980. The composition of Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart is so talented that I want to play Songs that I remember like Tom Sawyer, XYZ, Big Money, Trees, Freewill, Closer to the Heart, 2112, Limelight and Radio Spirit and 40000 plus fans sing together and they have a great time and I swear more than half the audience under the age of 25! <br /> <br /> Writers who put Rush as far as I like Rush fans are a lot of jealousy lovers of sour cream mixed with sour cream taco. <br /> <br /> Speed ​​doesn't make makeup, wear spikes, lips synchronize, wear lipstick, get into trouble with the law and have band member for how long they've been single. All they do is entertaining! <br /> <br /> I give this DVD from 100 out of 100.
