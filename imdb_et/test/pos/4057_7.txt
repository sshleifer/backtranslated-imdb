This is Showtime! Showtime is just a career for Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro. It is an entertaining film and innocent pleasure, but not the standards of the participants, especially not Robert. Showtime is run by Tom Dey and has some small roles, like William Shatner and Mos Def. <br /> <br /> Showtime is about two very different police officers, Mitch Preston (DeNiro) and Trey Sellars (Murphy). One takes the job seriously on a low profile, in a quiet way, while the other is easier and wants to be more fun than its back seat. They are both after the same generations behind huge TVs, VCRs and so on. Then they cross the road and the television station wants new TV shows to fight crime when they are on television. Mitch hates advertising, while Trey loves this line, "It's Showtime!" Their TV shows their TV videos and methods and these are a new "Cops" show. Fun starts. <br /> <br /> Showtime is generally a fun activity. Good film, but not quite in line with the expectations and standards of the participants. However, it rolls along when it runs and parody of reality TV shows. A good break at exhibitions like Cops. Really at the end, just guilty of joy. <br /> <br /> My Rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
