This is one horrible, undervalued gem with cool and fantastic finale! All the characters are big and the story was fantastic, plus I thought the ending was really cool! The plot was great, and it didn't forget me, plus while the child's actors were bad, they gave me a slip! It happened in the space channel some time ago, so I decided to review it and record it, read some good fans of some terrible fans, I have to say that I agree with them, it is very horrible and tense, plus Strother Martin, was fantastic in his role as a worshiper of Satan . It's a ton of creepy atmosphere, and it keeps you everywhere, plus all the characters were very nice, and you start at Ben and his family! It has a lot of troublesome moments, and sometimes the film pulled me in some places, plus, it's very well done with a low budget! It's one crappy, underrated pearl, cool and fantastic with the finals! The direction is very good!. Bernard McEveety is doing a great job here, doing great camera work, creating a creepy atmosphere and keeping the movie at a very fast pace! It's a little blood and gore. We get a split leg, lots of bloody corpses, a bloody slit, slicing and cubes, breaking and impaling. Action is great! Strother Martin is fantastic here! as a worshiper of Satan, he is extremely horrible, very convincing, was quite cold, was extremely intense, seemed to enjoy and just made a fantastic job! Charles Bateman is great as a father, he was very caring, very pleasant and gave a good show! L.Q. Jones is fantastic as a sheriff, he was funny, on things, he seemed very young, had a cool character and just made awesome work. Ahna Capri is a good girlfriend and did what she had to do well. Charles Robinson exalted extreme as a priest and didn't convince me a little! And his smile was particularly bad. Geri Reischl is indeed her daughter, she was somewhat pleasant and got only a few times nerves, she liked her. Alvy Moore was funny but very pleasant in his role as Tobey I dug him! The rest is doing good. Generally recommend it!. *** 1/2 out of five
