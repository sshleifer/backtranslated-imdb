Ghillie Telugu's "okkadu" remake is fortunately a refined version of the original, which wraps the same punch and Dharani into its cinematic brilliance, giving it its style and panic, celebrating Vijay's career with Surya and other similar names Vikram is terribly scared, which may well turn out to be the best movie Vijay has ever had, considering the choices she has made since then. with talented new entrants both industry and the public. <br /> <br /> A tight, tight script that runs around the neckline around Velu, a deliberate young man who wants to mark Kabadd's game (a popular Indian boys game). Events after the accidental meeting of Muthupand, his salvation from a girl in trouble and how he juggles with his friends and his own aspirations makes Vijay fit in the role of "T" and the essays of the boy next to the weak and credible image. Trishal is more than a stereotyped Tamil heroine coat. This role is much more complicated than just a girl in trouble. In a restricted dialogue, Trisha uses her occasional silenced expressions and a subtle vulnerability to add color to the role. This is a classic case of a portable girl who becomes a professional actor. Trisha became my personal favorite after my movie. <br /> <br /> The film ends on predictable lines, although you have to credit the director to keep the audience in the decisions about leaving many things, including Trisha. Prakash Raj deserves praise for giving Vijay a perfect counterweight. His almost unbeatable reputation as a criminal and the obvious tenderness of the hero's armor are the perfect hit to keep the audience away. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a great movie that deserves at least one viewing. I'll give it a clear ten out of ten.
