This movie is about people. This film has remained a favorite choice for years all the time. <br /> <br /> Isn't that the easiest thing to make life so much more interesting?! We humans are so soft, compassionate, funny, caring for each other - we invent the most beautiful and amazing machines to kill as many people as possible, at least with the next effort. In our short life, we are destroying our world, each other and often our own lives, as we spend the rest of our lives trying to destroy what we have destroyed. Sometimes there is nothing to solve. <br /> <br /> This movie can attract, educate, and even help us understand what is wrong with our lives! Life is short and can be even shorter! The ending is too optimistic, I'm afraid. <br /> <br /> I love Richard Condie's mind and what he does with it! <br /> <br /> Enjoy <br /> <br /> H.K.
