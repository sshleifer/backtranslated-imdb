It's one of my favorite series, all categories, all the time. <br /> <br /> I was fortunate to have got a whole series of VHS a few years ago. I loved it when I saw it back in -91 -92 when I was about 12. I love it so much or more today, which is remarkable given my (hopefully) improved film recognition and criticism skills. Most of the movies I liked are not as pleasant today as the nostalgia factor. This factor is here too, but Sherin Robin has so much more than nostalgia. <br /> <br /> There are only a few bad things about this series. First, the picture and sound quality is so, at least during the first few episodes. Fortunately, it gets better. Secondly, you might have wanted a little more blood and realism in the fighting scenes, although I know that this is not an option in this case. <br /> <br /> So, for good things! And there are many. First is Michael Praed IS Robin Hood. I don't think I've ever seen him in this way, which only strengthens that fact for me. He offers such a faith as Robin. Jason Connery was an impossible task to replace him. The fact that Michael Praed has not become a bigger name as an actor is incredible. Or perhaps it was his fate that this one task would be done perfectly, then disappear. <br /> <br /> I love Nickolas Graces Nottingham Sheriff. He's not really complicated, but it's completely rotten. The relationship between him and Gisburne is just fun. In fact, just looking at de Rainault sitting on his throne, boring, dazzling, makes me laugh even before he says anything. Another actor who deserves further praise is Ray Winstone as Will Scarlet. You can really feel sad inside him and his hatred for soldiers who killed his wife. Winstone is an actor who has finally received his well-earned Hollywood breakthrough (The Departed and Beowulf). There are also many other great actors here. <br /> <br /> I love Robin's gang portrayal. They are fun, play, laugh, you really feel the divorce between them, the closeness that comes from such a narrow group. These binding scenes are so important. <br /> <br /> I think that the UK has been produced with British actors, for example, compared to the -92 feature version of Kevin Costner, which just seems fake, fake, fake. (Christian Slater, like Will Scarlet, come ..) Speaking English with a British accent allows you to believe more, and I feel that actors, like the director and writers, can take a lot more Robin Hood gang shoes than the American team behind the series. The music is wonderful, Clannad is great for a series of music. Music is another thing they just laughed at. <br /> <br /> Fantasy and the magic spice that is placed there is also an exciting addition. It is not up, but credible and makes the whole thing better and more interesting. I also love how nicely comedy, adventure and drama are. <br /> <br /> These are some of the things that make this series so vivid and so authentic. This is the best version of Robin Hood I've ever seen. I will not break the "Nothing Forgotten" quotation. But one thing I will never forget for me is this fantastic Robin Hood repetition. Look at this.
