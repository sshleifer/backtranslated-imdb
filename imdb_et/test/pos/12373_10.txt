Much said without words. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie. It was done in color, like in contemporary films, but with a special monochrome use (with shades) that represented meaning, mood, thought and time. It should be seen in color because it becomes a completely different film. The story of the Nobel laureate Selma Lagerl√∂f has been effectively presented. There is never a clear real, memory, or fantasy. Changes in Swedish society are finely stratified. Most highly recommend. Try renting it or searching online. I saw it in the Swedish film class and I want to add it to my movie book.
