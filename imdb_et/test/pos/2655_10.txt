2001: A Space Odyssey <br /> <br /> Is this a sermon? An overview of human history? Man's pointless attempt to explore technology only to destroy technology? Is it a fragile balance of time and space? Is the lesson in evolution? Or it's just a remarkable effect to show; the film Kubrick did just to show us the limitless possibilities of the film and to tell us the truth that the pictures are extremely powerful? 2001: Space Odyssey is all these things. One of the most interpretable films ever created is almost fun to express and discuss the ambiguous design of the film and the events you actually watch. But it is open for deliberate discussion; when Kubrick had explained his wonderful 1968 classical meaning (ranked # 22 in the list of AFI's largest 100 films, my personal 21st favorite nowâ€¦ and 4 nominations for the Academy: Director, Original Scenario, Art Direction and Visual Effects he won) would be has lost half of its charm, its complexity and a good part of its cinematographic value. We would only have the technical ingenuity; which in itself deserves praise. <br /> <br /> Because every shot is worth seeing. And there is a lot of time. 2001 is very elegant and also cool; isolated. However, the emotional distance and slow pace pay tribute to the unique visual experience; In 2001, the ancestors of the ape of mankind, who renew the planet from destroyers to hunters and tool-makers after discovering the giant monolith in the midst of their desert, then (in one of the most inspired jumps in the film experience) when the bone gets into the air and becomes a satellite, jumping into space where astronauts discovered a similar object for a few thousand years moon and the next movie after the space mission team, if they follow the monolithic signal through space. by their unreliable computer, HAL, who is trying to sabotage and kill the crew before the single caterer starts up through space and time (with drug-related colors that are likely to give the hippies an epileptic shock back) that they get old, die, and "Star-Child". Whew. <br /> <br /> This pace and emotional darkness are also in sharp contrast to the most ironic scene in the movie; Destruction of HAL. Since the team's ultimate researcher turns off the machine, dives into a holy red light aura, Kubrick has always used a recurring motif, the cute tune of singing HAL, it's a strangely emotional experience. And that's all genius. <br /> <br /> Other remarkable aspects of Kubrick's masterpiece are HAL's memorable voice (calm, somehow evil, Douglas Rain), minimal dialogue (Kubrick trusted his pictures wisely to pass the film, giving his actors only banal and helpful features. the most famous is "Unlock pod bay doors HAL"), satellites dancing in orbit to unusual music, and this first scary land shot; Slowly exposing the glare of the sun in front of it, played by the blasting sound, the horns triumph. <br /> <br /> 2001 will always be a mystery and will forever test the cinema's strongest point: Visuality is more powerful than writing. All of this is one of the most legendary and best directors of film history, whose unique vision was always his own. 10/10 <br /> <br /> "Open the pod-bay doors at HAL"
