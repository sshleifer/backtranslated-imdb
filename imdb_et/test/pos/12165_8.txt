After 10 watches in 20 years, I also think that it was Crazy Gang's best film film, more cohesion in the plot than their best, "Alf's Button Afloat". Indeed, they were a crazy triad of twin actions that were thrown mainly on stage, sometimes with royalties, until Chesney Allen retired in the '40s through "bad health". He lived for over a year. Obviously, they were "crazy" outside "work", playing regular practical jokes with each other. <br /> <br /> The six-wonder boys' troupe will guide me to get the gold I found there in Alaska. It seemed like a better idea to go to Mansfield ... because they were there. When they arrive at Red Gulch, they find their data was only 40 years old - they thought the chips in the guilty newspaper were joking. But then it is not important because they are all in love with Snow White and want to help his grandfather find his long lost goldfish. Baddie Bill "M" McGrew wants it himself. <br /> <br /> The number of verbal and visual braids is amazing, but most of them are likely to make sense to (?) Britons and themselves who want to see 30 British b & w comedies. Imho almost all the gags and routines work, including the gold body Bud & Chesney and "during the cultivation, when you work" pastiche - even "always getting our husband" base plates. A great little movie that is quite tired but recommended.
