WHAT TO MAKE A FILM !!!!!!!! I came out of a theater that was stunned. The film I just saw was one of the best films I've ever seen in my life. I had eyes glued to the screen. It is very symbolic, visually lush, beautifully photographed and gorgeously said. It is basically about two people moving into the apartment and living with each other in the neighborhood with partners who are expected to communicate with each other. Assuming our two heroes behave, what they think their partners will get upto. Vouryist camera work, body language and symbolic stairwells have a distinct feeling for each other. It is a visual party and hard to dislike. Some stories are a little confused, but that is not something. The end is one of the most beautiful (and anti-Hollywood) ends I've seen in my life and visually amazing. The haunted score of the movie adds to the mood. I recommend this movie to anyone with open mind and respect. With a great movie.
