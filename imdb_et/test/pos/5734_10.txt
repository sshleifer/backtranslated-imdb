I can't believe anyone gave this movie 1 rating !!! and this is only the 3rd average ... What does this movie dislike? It is original, it has many scary scenes that actually jumped out of my place and have some special special effects. The story is fresh, there is some nudity and it is very comby. The killer was scary with his dementia and the end is very unexpected. I have to admit that I really love this movie, one of Spain's best horror films. If you consider yourself a real horror blower, you have to get out of there and try to find this movie. You will be pleasantly surprised.
