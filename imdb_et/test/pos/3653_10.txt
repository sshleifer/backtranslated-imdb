The work of love. Every frame is a perfect picture and grabs you. Then emotions and storytelling will go through a dream that will stay with you long after the movie. The director receives your heart and takes it through 100-minute visual poetry. You are part of the emotional journey of the characters. I've seen this movie at two festivals and it got stagnant at every show. A remarkable story tells about citizenship and language, and I felt like I'm part of the drama that emerged before me. Casting is as perfect as it can be. Vijay Raaz, Camille and Benoit have their own. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates good cinema. I can't wait for the commercial release of this movie.
