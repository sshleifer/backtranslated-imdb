I also found that "Oppenheimer" is a brilliant series and one of the best deals in American PBS. David Suchet was especially effective as Edward Teller recalling, and the overall concept was remarkably good. The only reason why the price of the series is not a complete 10/10 is in some areas with low budget output values. Actual content is absolutely first-class in my memory. <br /> <br /> Oppenheimer's mini devices will be released in the UK on July 31st! This is the area 2 / PAL, but it seems that the region 1 / NTSC set should soon be set aside. <br /> <br /> If you have a U.S. Universal Player, you can order the series right from Amazon UK. <br /> <br /> http://tinyurl.com/znyyq <br /> <br /> Huzzah!
