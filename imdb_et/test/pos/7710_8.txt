The detective story is not typical of the Matrix Universe. This is a film-noir-esque private eye story with a strong narrator and a very rich feeling. Rich, with its visual appeal. Snow scenes, graininess, it all stands out. <br /> <br /> But the story? This is interesting even if it seems a bit inappropriate. Representatives hire a private detective to look for Trinity. He discovers that they tried this approach earlier, but had dangerous consequences for hired detectives. However, he is trying to find him and finally succeeds through Alice in Wonderland references and hackers and chat rooms. Then things start to interest ... <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a perfect short animation. <br /> <br /> 8/10
