Hands down, the best television drama / comedy. Smartly written exhibition of a young mother and her 16-year-old daughter who is studying life and finding things not only for the world, but for herself. Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) tries to find a way to stay close to her daughter, but to guide her in the right direction, which is getting harder and harder through the show. Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel), caught in the world of books and learning, has just begun to know boys and his own rebellion, which surprises both of them. With the help of Luke Danes (Scott Patterson) and Sookie St.James (Melissa McCarthy) and with a huge number of other fun characters, this exhibition is just one of my favorites. What really shows that this exhibition is up, is still complicated, incredible and spiritual writing, often using pop culture references to the mink dynasty.
