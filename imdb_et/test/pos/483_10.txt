I first saw it on Thames television and loved it. Later, I saw someone who was definitely not watching and listening, was terrible. So, I bought a copy and bought another copy! The only sad thing is that it is not available on PAL VHS or Region 2 DVDs. The Australian version is great, but it's better! I could buy another .............
