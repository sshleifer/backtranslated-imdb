and I think it's good. I've never been a fan of Rosalind Russell, although the original was my favorite RR movie. But I love Bette and I was glad when I heard she did it. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the production, I think it was a little less than the original film. One of my favorite characters from the original was Mazeppa with his scratched nail plate with "HEY! It takes much more than any talent to be strippah!" and although I missed it, I was pleased to see that the producers were inside to not make copies. <br /> <br /> I also liked the fact that the big parts of this movie have been filmed as you look at the stage, giving you the feeling that you are in the theater, not just the movies. <br /> <br /> I think the other thing I liked about this production was that it seemed to be a bit less repetitive. song "Let me entertain you", which will be heard about the fifth time after that.
