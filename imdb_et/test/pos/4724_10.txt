I never saw such a powerful true story movie. Thanks to this cinema masterpiece, I discovered a city, state, lost revolution and even a Nobel Prize winner. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie, you can't say you've seen anything. <br /> <br /> Great courage, humility and a lesson in life. <br /> <br /> I've never seen anything so good since then. <br /> <br /> TE Saturday, January 9, 1999
