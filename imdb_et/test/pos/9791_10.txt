It's just my favorite movie of all time. Nothing special. It's just so incredibly detailed. Makes me just think. Geronimo Bill is the most beautiful man I can imagine. Money is not important. Bamboo spears are important. You don't need the money to get what you need. If you need something, it just comes to you. When people realize that the world is a much better place. Whatever you do, don't do it for money.
