I could no longer agree with those who say it's a bad movie. I and my friend went to see it at the Stockholm Film Festival and it was actually one of my favorite films at the festival. The dolls that are used in horror movies are nothing new, but I have not seen many films work as well as it is in this movie. The atmosphere, device, actors, camera-work. Everything is just beautiful. And they work well with each other. Now that you think this movie is another Grudge or Ring, it's probably not like it. But if your looks good, stylized to scare, then it's perfect. Although it is quite predictable and sometimes ridiculous, I still recommend it to anyone who loves horror. Look at this. Now.
