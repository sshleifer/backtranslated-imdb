It happened to me when I watched "Imaginary Heroes" that every screenwriter trying to create a drama family relationship should seriously consider killing a child or two in the opening roll to get his characters to open and discover himself. There must be something to this story because it seems that every other family-run drama uses this device in one form or another ("Paradise" and "Moonlight Mile" are just two of the last examples that will appear right in the spring), though to get back to the golden old man like "Who is afraid of Virginia Woolf?" It is not that the death of a child is an illegal subject to investigate serious films. Far from it. It's just that, like every topic, it can be used too much to make it just another cliche of a movie, a nice bit of narrative summary to get the ball rolling and give the characters something that is left behind. the last such work is "Imaginary Heroes", a film that borrowed heavily from what is one of the first and perhaps the most famous examples of coping with family death. child "genre, Academy's award-winning" ordinary people. "Like the characters from the earlier film, the suburban family seems to be on the surface of Travis, up to one fateful day, their eldest son Matt, who is the" golden boy "athlete and therefore the apple tree. kills himself without explanation (one small difference is that the son "ordinary people" dies as a result of an accident, not suicide.) This is Matti's younger brother Tim, who comes up in the body and takes on the role of a protagonist in the film. Matt, who has always lived in the shadow of his elder brother, is becoming more and more alien to a man who has ignored him for almost all his life and begins to turn to drugs. Father, father, swallows repentance and guilt, turning his work and his family away. a woman, Sandy, is the most complicated character of a movie, a child with 60s free spirits, who feels a strange deviation in her role as a mother and woman en unmarried marriage in sterile neighborhoods. He spends most of his time after the tragedy that is trying to restore his pot-smoking past. <br /> <br /> "Imaginary Heroes" written and staged by Dan Harris appears wildly as an uneven film. For every scene that is real and authentic, there is another one that is arbitrary and unfair. Sometimes, the feeling that Harris wants to cram any possible life situation he might think of in his scenario may be an admirable goal, but what makes the film unnecessarily melodramatic in the process. Instead of identifying with characters and being in difficulty, we often think, "Oh, come now? What's next?" In the case of teen suicide, this is the tip of the iceberg on hot-topic topics covered in this film; The scenario also includes drug and alcohol abuse, physical abuse, sexual identity conflict, life-threatening illness, even unintentional gay incest. It is a "everything in the kitchen sink" way of thinking in a writing that robs the film to a great degree of credibility that needs us to care. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that Imaginary Heroes is a bad or reckless movie. Much of what he has to say about family relations and values ​​of the 21st century is reasonable, original, sharp and deep. The main credit for this success goes to the actors Emile Hirsch, Sigourney Weaver and Jeff Daniels, who perform sharp and sensitive results in their roles. It is those who fight over narrative surpluses, stimulate the brains, and touch our hearts. What's more, Harris effectively achieves the melancholic tone in his directions, but what is often complemented by some bold dark comedies that need it. <br /> <br /> "Imaginary Heroes" may seem vague and derated, but its subtle performances and subtle mood changes make this movie worth watching.
