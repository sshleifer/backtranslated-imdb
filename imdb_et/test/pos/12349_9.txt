I first looked at a dark night in the theater and wrote a review of my high school newspaper film. I loved it then and I still love it. The story is two people. First of all, one woman learns that her father is a telekiss after death. He feels his father's strange powers even at death. The stomach that he is buried, is played by the host, another high school girl who does something to get in on a group of girls who want to torture her and dare to join her all night. They go back at night to scare him and find fear. Val Til is led by Meg Tilly, who has supporting roles from Adam West and one of my personal favorites Elizabeth Daily aka E.G. Everyday. Check it out if you love 80s movies and cheesy horror movies.
