I've repeatedly commented on this Chucky, but I had to do it again to say some movie-related things when I first saw it on a big balcony in a big theater. The movie was a lot of fun in the theater and in my first theater in Chucky, and it was a special moment for me because I love Chucky. Other horrors are related to GREAT COOLNESS !!! And the gore was shockingly great! The scene where the gay boy was picked was amazingly cheerful! It was a great gore scene !!!!! And the end was so weird and shocking, it put me in s *% @ pants. The idea of ​​Chucky seed was very, very bizarre and shocking! When I left the theater, I loved it easily and I couldn't believe it was real. For some reason, the odd and diverse features of this child's play have signaled that Jason is going to the hell of a child's play set. It was just this intense shocking, bizarre and different quality that reminded me of Jason Goes To Hell. Definitely ***** *****. Here's how I organize the series: 1.4.2.3. I loved it, but not quite as much as Tom Holland's original child's play class. I can't wait for Chucky seed! Go ahead!
