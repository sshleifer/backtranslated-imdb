I wasn't sure what to expect from "driving hours" - I'm not sure if Rupert Grint could play such a role, but in the first few minutes I was completely hooked. All the music, acting and scenery were absolutely stunning. Julie Walters, as always, gave the excellent performance of the eccentric old actress Evie and Rupert Grint, just as good, gave an excellent result as a romantic Ben. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, I was forced into involuntary carts, a burst of laughter, and joy when Ben got rid of his control and fought for his friendship with his only friend Evie. A very controversial story, probably quite exaggerated, but still one of the best films I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> We recommend very good British people looking for a movie and in the evening to kick back and just enjoy yourself.
