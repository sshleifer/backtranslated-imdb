When this film is directed by DW Griffith or Stanley Kubrick, it is recognized as being: a cinematic masterpiece that is spoken deeply and subtly and passionately in a film that is not equal in the visual field. It is unremittingly stunning and also very brutal in its portrayal of our great legacy of greed and destruction. And, of course, what the reviewers couldn't follow, it just doesn't tell a narrative dick and foot, like 99% of Hollywood production. His characters are complex and confused by their passions and thoughts, fears and emotions. They even seem to be thinking what your average filmmaker does not understand and cannot hold, so they destroyed. See the original uncut widescreen version. It's stunning.
