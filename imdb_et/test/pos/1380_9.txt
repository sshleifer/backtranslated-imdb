I buy DOLLARI !!! <br /> <br /> I bought this movie for the dollar and I've seen a lot more worse !! <br /> <br /> This is a Scottish sci-fi movie from Mark Stirton and "Made of (Hysterical)" production cost only $ 8,000. Eight great !!! It doesn't cost half a minute in Hollywood! Nonetheless ---- This is the ultimate fun movie making. If you like the things you are, then you are treating. These are some harsh characters with rough voices and harsh swearing. I don't mind, but my girl friend did! Actors do a good job and it is interesting to see people I have never heard or seen before. That meant I had no idea who would first die. <br /> <br /> If you watch a movie about its last visual effect, check out Star Wars. Impacts are good here, but weak in space. But the monsters are very well done, as a little prelude. At least it was not predictable and I fell under my chair when one guy got blown up !!! OK, so it's for other sci-fi small derivatives, but for this budget, it's an amazing experiment, and anyone who thinks a sci-fi movie for 8g is easy or a lot to happen is not clear about the film industry. <br /> <br /> Good characters for good film, extra characters for hard work, extra extra marks for really interesting production. Normal pull is not here, all production problems have gone to Lost in Manchas only at the end of the movie. But why not comment? CONTINUE TO CONTINUE!
