I first saw all the rivers on the TV when I was a kid and loved it. It was a great sight in the mini-series that was set and filmed so close to home. Lying close to Echuca, I loved going to a historic harbor to see the paddle steamers. The first I ever visited was Pevensy (in the movie Philadelphia). I love the way things happen. Nothing knows speed because most movies are today. Action was fantastic. All the rivers were completely cast and I just love the Philadelphia team. Mac is always delighted to watch its own branded raw onion sandwich after a great night. Just deserves 10 out of 10 and is a favorite mini-series of all time with the Dirtwater Dynasty.
