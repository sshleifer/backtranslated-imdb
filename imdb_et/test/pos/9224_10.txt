People talk about how scary the script was and how terrible the animation was, but Rainbow Brite and Star Stealer are really Japanese Anime aimed at children. If you look at anime today, it's done in the same style and it's very popular. I don't think this film would ever be for adults. Just as I don't think it was ever serious. The things that people hate about this movie are the things I love. Rainbow Brite is one of the best cartoon characters I think has ever been created. He's smart. He's funny. He takes care of that. He cares about his friends. This film can teach so many young children. My little brothers even liked this movie. I have to say that this film taught me a lot when I was a child. When it appeared on the DVD, I was the first to buy it. This is a great children's film. What if it's not perfect, there's nothing perfect if you look far enough.
