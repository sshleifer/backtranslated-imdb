I saw this movie on the day it was opened in NYC, Ziegfield. At that time, Madonna was not a real cultural icon she currently has. He had a few hits, was very good at "Desparately Seeking Susan" and I had tickets to see him at the Giants Stadium concert. <br /> <br /> "Who is this girl?" gives Madonna a real role that is not just a variation of her own personality. She does a crazy / heroine routine better than you think. Griffin Dunne is very well cast when the man around to see all the Shenanigans. <br /> <br /> The story includes a big cat named Murray, a bride who has slept with every NYC father and key. There are many car rides and police officers who are driving their way. All the elements of the screw comedy are intact. Sir John Mills is briefly seen. She shares a glass of champagne and has the largest apartment on the Upper West Side with rainforests and everything. <br /> <br /> Compared to most Madonna movies (those I've been able to tolerate anyway), it's fantastic. On its own, it's not so bad. 6/10. <br /> <br /> PS The concert was terrible.
