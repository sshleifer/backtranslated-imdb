I've just seen a couple of episodes of "Eleventh Hour", but I have to say they were impressed by me. This series is just as impressive and interesting ... I will definitely follow it. <br /> <br /> First of all, I have to say that it is top-notch. Patrick Stewart plays his character - scientist Ian - incredibly and coolly, and he makes the audience a character. Other characters, such as Rachel, are also believable, and although they are sometimes a little cold - because of the way the series was filmed - they are interesting. <br /> <br /> The stories in this series are also interesting. For example, one of the episodes I saw was cloning and the person trying to clone people. The way the episode was developed and how Ian - Stewart had to follow the clues and saved people was amazing. In addition, it made me think about ethics and how good or bad it might be. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I think it's one good TV show. I hope it will continue this way - interesting, thought-provoking and acting well. Although it's filmed in a cold way - a little flash, cold photography, lots of close-ups - it's never going to be interesting. Highly recommended.
