Usually I am a typical "creepy-crawly-hatin" girl, but after watching a movie (of course on YouTube) I have different perspectives. And I did not know that my favorite animation studio - Fleischer's second film, related to an insect community whose urban garden home is endangered by people (cigars and cigarette shrubs, traces, etc.), and how a happy young grasshopper named Hoppity saves the day and won the bee Honey heart; I love cute Mrs. Honey. You know, after watching the movie, the bugs reminded of "jitter-bugs" from Don Bulth's Thumbelina. And among the songs in the movie, I love "We are a couple in the castle"; when I sang this song, it almost made me cry. <br /> <br /> This great movie was the second (and last) feature that came out of the Fleischer studio. The film was originally released in November 1941, but since Fleischer's rival Disney released Dumbo a week earlier, Paramount changed the date to December of that year, but unfortunately, Mr Bug went into a, then unrealized, tricky timing. Having failed two days after the opening of the Pearl Harbor attack, Mr. Bug was a financial catastrophe and led Max and Dave Fleischer to the studio in 1919 and reorganized the company as famous studios. Another big factor in their departure was the fact that Max and Dave Fleischer were no longer talking about the controversy (when it was sad). In general I love both movies Fleischer bros. - Gulliver and Mr. Bug.
