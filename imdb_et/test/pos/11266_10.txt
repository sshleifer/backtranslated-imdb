I bought this video from a VCR tape to the US for 50 cents. I've taken quite a few videos that I bought back to sell to others after I looked at them, with a 50% price on rent. This is the only one that will never go back. This is an explosion of artistic talent, color and sound. I don't know if I call it circus, dance or both. It's bigger than life itself. They can do it in just a few years in their lives. These are performers. If Gene Kelly and Burt Lancaster were alive today and saw that they were living, they would be terrifying. I would like to see it for others, but I know if I will do that I will never.
