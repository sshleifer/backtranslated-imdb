I loved this movie. Mark Blankfield was ideal for this role. More classic sci / movie / horror movies should be rebuilt into this comedy level, which I think is at the beginning of the line. Don't drink a movie, laugh so hard that you hit it. Do we expect more? Hope. I'd like to recommend many movies for this type of remake. Mel Brookes made some transformations of classic films. Dorian Gray's picture would be a good suggestion. I hope some producer or director can get into the idea and bring a new comedy on our screen. we need good comedy to keep our smile higher than ever. Good comedy FIX.
