If the noble Hanabusa clan is destroyed by the usurping Samanosuke clan, the loyal keeper Kogenta (June Fujimaki) escapes with his eight-year-old son Tadafum and his daughter Kozas. They are in the shelter of priest Shinobu (Otome Tsukimiya), serving the god of the Hanabusa clan, Majin, a vengeful spirit imprisoned in a gigantic landscape on the side of a local hill. Ten years later, Kogenta and Tadafumi (Yoshihiko Aoyama) are seeking revenge against the Lord Samanoshi (Yutaro Gomi), but they are trying to catch and understand death. The priest, Shinobu, desperately trying to save his master, threatens to divorce Samanosuke, but is pushed into his efforts. The same lumpy, in vain, cruel and narrow person, ordered Majin to destroy his form to break any of the last traces of hope among the rest of the Hanabusa loyalists. But God Majin, who has been strangely quiet so far, has other ideas ... <br /> <br /> Daimajin is a tempting, timeless, deeply moving fairy tale. From a shamefully produced, respectful budget, this film is about values: noble values, justice, dignity, loyalty, self-sacrifice and love. It is a hierarchy and rules and the consequences of not responding to the rule. These are things that we don't talk much about in demo times, except the lurking like William Bennet, but are still relevant, and Daimajin shows us why. <br /> <br /> Daimajin is a great example of why Japanese cinema is so brilliant. The values ​​described above are obviously relevant to those involved in the film, as are many Japanese filmmakers. There's no lip care, no pressure, no irony. Instead, there is an authentic attempt to create a world where these values ​​can live again, and show what happens when they stop. Just compare Daimajin, Lone Wolf and Cubi series or Kurosawa movies to intimidating Tarantino nihil Kill Kill b * llshit to see what I mean. <br /> <br /> In a movie with such a talented talent, I would just like to draw attention to the majestic result of Captain Akira's Lady's Room, the talents and beauty of actors Jun Fujimaki, Yoshihiko Aoyama and Miwi Takada; and Otome Tsukimiya Stunning. The scene of his death is one of the most mobile and thoughtful I've ever seen.
