This movie starts with the ass, none. Bam and his bear have done this movie. Since I got a DVD (4 days ago), I've watched it three times and it gets better every time I watch it. I can't wait for Grind to come out in theaters. If this is something like Haggard, you should wait. <br /> <br /> Thanks, JTcellphone
