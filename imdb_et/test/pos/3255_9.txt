Lightweight spoilers <br /> <br /> .... and it's always at the top ten. I stumbled randomly on "two hands" (maybe it made it even more special - not inflated expectations) one night at the IFC and couldn't believe I hadn't heard of it. Now that Heath Ledger is more famous in the US, I'm sure it's more accessible. At that time, I talked to friends about the movie and nobody could find it except for the occasional display of IFC. <br /> <br /> In any case, this black-comedy / gangster genre fits well with his other favorites, and all film-makers seem to end up with what they deserve. Bryan Brown is fun as the main gangster who makes his origami with his little son and plays with his commander. It's also fun to quickly edit a random car thief. Even Heath was pretty good at that. At that time, I remembered him insecurely from the short-lived Fox series "Roar". Hopefully Gregor Jordan will make another blow, but I think it's the best.
