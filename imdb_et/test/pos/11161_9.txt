Unlike the previous correspondent, I thought Shoppen Munich (because it was billing with English subtitles here at the November 2007 film festival in London) was very funny, very well-functioning, and well-scripted. > <br /> It's totally bold to make a 100-minute movie that consists of exclusive and relentlessly speaking heads. But I think Ralf Westhoff managed witty and lively. No standard film that follows the harsh pronunciation of the character with some meditative little seventh chord music and a long stroke of nature. But when somebody said something that showed their soul - well, we kept the man with a timer for another superficial introduction. Of course, this is the point: the sharp square superficiality of the agglomerations, where everything is a quick question and an answer. <br /> <br /> Perhaps most movies are so cunning and stupid that English is ready to laugh at any vaguely intelligent and illegal cinema, but I can promise you that tonight (Curzon Cinema, November 25, 2007) ) A full audience belonged to a laugh. So I wasn't the only one! <br /> <br /> My girlfriend (who speaks German and lived in Munich) thought it was fun. I (who doesn't speak German and haven't been to Munich) thought it was fun. I recommend Shoppen (Munich) to anyone (especially couples ...) looking for a smart, smart, original, clever movie about the superficiality of the modern relationship and the confusion of the generation who feel they are happy-out-after stuff for the first time. <br /> <br /> NB! In English subtitles that show in London, the subtitles (which were very good) were shown completely under a slightly reduced image, not inside it. I thought it was a good thing.
