This movie is great (I watched the French version). There are many sub-blocks (which generally worsen), but they open up nicely and agree to their real self-discovery. In fact, the whole movie (in addition to its background) is a trip to discover your (or someone else's) self. Is the king really a "good-headed monarch" who is trying to "end the war for all wars" or is he just disturbed, blood thirsty hoodlum? Is he a real king? Is the queen mother's sender just a scary, career-capable, endless sock puppet or rather sharp thinking, a bold person? Does the mansion / husband understand who the king really is? What is between the king and the old chancellor? What is the secret that everyone knows, but does not say? What is the Reason Why an Assassin Stopped His "Work"? The sub-blocks (something that I don't like) are handled well and keep to one end of viewing. The scenes are well-crafted and CGI fits well without having to drive over. The intercourse is properly maintained and the participants are in the task. There are many smiles with brain damage, but it had to behave in the king's court (as the devil / concubin complains). Realistic film without superhero moments. This Chinese film puts Hollywood cardboard colossus (Gladiator, etc.) into shame.
