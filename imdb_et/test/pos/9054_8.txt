Hick Trek is clearly a film that is even envious of El Mariach's budget ($ 7,000). Nonetheless, creators are sometimes able (often due to high editing) to have decent effects such as radiation, cat-ship situations, and Slim T. Jerki's unique interaction with their ship without traditional communication. The device works. <br /> <br /> The actor has rough spots, but "Horns" McBoy is great and Fluffy is definitely not too strong for the eyes. <br /> <br /> I want the film to be longer than its approximate hour - and it should be seen as a compliment. This film is a success thanks to the sincerity and hard work of the people involved.
