James Cagney, the racket and peasant of the political congregation, is the deputy of change and visits the boys' reform school. The catch is that Cagney is not grafting it, he really wants to make a difference in the lives of the children who live there because he comes from his own background. <br /> <br /> Pieces of villain are Dudley Digges, who is a grafting chiseler and consecrated hypocrite. One of the subtypes of the mayor of hell is that these children are mostly immigrants, and those who meet and are in power are those who have been here for a few generations. Note in the fair hall, where Digges offers thanks to the food they are going to get, Digges eats well, but the kids get the quality that you don't support your pet. <br /> <br /> Cagney has his own hunger city with his own troubles and he must demolish it. This puts Digges in charge and creates a movie for this peak. <br /> <br /> The Mayor of Hell was a typical workgroup studio product. And since it was a forerunner, it gets tough from time to time. Its later version, Crime School, with Humphrey Bogart and Dead End Kids, was more disinfected. <br /> <br /> Although Cagney is in the lead, as Madge Evans, a school nurse, the actor's awards go to Dudley Digges. It is hard to believe that the same man can portray drunk, but kindly, one foot ship surgeon Mutiny's Bounty. But Digges is a good player and a joy to watch every movie he has. <br /> <br /> This movie is often not shown because of the racial and ethnic stereotypes it represents. Today, a number of minorities are being offended. It's still a fine movie. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, a couple of years ago, Sleepers appeared and it touched on some of the same problems. I think reform schools will never change.
