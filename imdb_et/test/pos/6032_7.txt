An independently recognized Slasher addict means that it is very rare for me to get a chance to look at the much larger budgeted movies that have reliable pains. In addition to James Mangold's successful ticket offices, draw Identity; There have been no big badges there, because Scream's trilogy once again brought Wes Craven back to the Hollywood card. This is why Mark Malone is the last stop? a mysterious thriller with a blatant slasher record, I was immediately interested. With a decent composition, including Adam Beach and Jurgen Prochnow, and the intriguing soundtrack that even finds room for Lynn Anderson's Rose Garden, I have to admit that the initial signs were very positive for this claustrophobic function. To my knowledge, there are only three snow-crossed skitters, except, of course, if you think Demon is suitable for the category. The first slice and dice on the ice were dry bone from Satan's blade, then came Lisa Loring's cheese party, which was Blizzard of Blood and enjoyable Shredder followed about fourteen years later. <br /> <br /> Extreme snowstorm, national soldier Jason (Adam Beach) is fighting through the snow to reach the Colorado Mountains far. His task is to inform guests that the road is closed and must stay for at least one night until the road can be carried out in hazardous conditions. This news does not go well into a suspicious bunch that includes two heavy-duty brothers (Callum Keith Rennie and Peter Flemming), a truck driver who doesn't really want to stay around (William S. Taylor), a randy couple of lovers (Winston Rekert and Amy Adamson) and Jason former girlfriend Nancy (Rose McGowan). Also, motel owners (Jurgen Prochnow and P. Lynn Johnson) are not happy about the news, but they provide space for visitors and try to calm the tense situation calmly. Things get worse when Jason finds the body behind the cafe behind a broken wall and a stolen cash bag. Like the chapter that came out of the mystery of Agatha Christie, tenants begin to die in a masked attacker who seems to be willing to reclaim money. With so many angry characters to choose from and not to leave the crime position in any way, Jason must try to stop the mania before he kills again? A good mystery needs at least a handful of shady suspects, all of whom have a credible motif, a distant place that no one can escape and a clever protagonist who helps break the clues. Luckily, this last stop offers every important ingredient in the thriller, with equal moments of brilliance and even stupidity. The film starts up perfectly when suspicious personalities come into contact with a claustrophobic environment that can keep the tension high throughout the lifetime. Malone keeps the level of interest raised because every character brings out his reasons to lure doubts, and to be fair, it is not important that the main twist is not easy. In fact, I found myself watching the movie again to see if I could pull out all the clues I first missed. Unfortunately, when the maniac is found to be the top psycho that hides like a comic book, the last stop has lost tremendous credibility. Fortunately, everything has not disappeared when an unexpected and gloriously organized plot deserves the film's finals. <br /> <br /> Similarities can be drawn with an excellent identity, as two plots are almost interchangeable. James Mangold's efforts must be better than the two, mainly due to John Cusack's and increasingly trusted Ray Liotta's bill. That said, although Adam Beach is doing a good job in the lead, while Jurgen Prochnow, Amy Adamson and brilliant Callum Keith Rennie are adding solid support. Rose McGowan performs in this role as much as she is likely to start from day to day, and Winston Rekert started fantastically before the climax of the movie resurrected. If you're a hard-fitting fan that looks at it for bloody killing, you're frustrated. The Balaklava-carrying psychopath opens up only once and the rest of the murders are under the screen. But as I said earlier, Malone's talent means that the arbitration is never too far to boil and you can forgive some of the shortcomings because the positives are almost triumph. <br /> <br /> The last stop is worth searching for slasher addicts and movie fans so. Yes, there are a handful of negative ones, but in general it is a strong example of new Hollywood talents. If you liked identity, be sure to try it?
