After my personal research on the end-of-May 2012 cycle provided by the Mayan calendar, I believe that this film should be viewed as much as "What do we know about Bleep?" While some may believe that top-notch science issues should only be communicated at doctoral level "talk", "Elegant Universe" violates such barriers. Visuals and election dialogues make it a walk through the history of physics. There are many messages in this film, the least of which is that academic science must always be prepared for what is taught. True, pure discovery science is beautiful because there is always something extra and exciting to bring to light when we have the courage to look for it in the established science.
