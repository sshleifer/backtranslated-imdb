Why didn't the end of the movie get Sean Connery men who fought against the Germans instead of French. Since the French occupation of Algeria in 1830, tribes from Morocco and Algeria made attacks on the French army and civilians. This film could have been a constant of the historical aspect where the French had seized Rasuadil, so that his followers would not rob Algeria, and then his followers would have attacked the French to release him. <br /> <br /> The film is still stereotypical about shootouts between Germans and Americans. When Americans shoot Germans, their weapons (even pistols) make a loud noise, big bloody sores and their enemies scream after shooting. When the Germans shoot the Americans, their weapons do not make great sounds, they do not produce bloody wounds, and their enemies do little or no after shooting. <br /> <br /> In real life, the American Kragi rifle was America's worst rifle until the early M-16 came. Krag was difficult to maintain, it was not reliable and the rifle had to be kept. The German Mauser was one of the world's best rifles. We were so impressed during the United States War that we made this copy and call it a Springfield rifle. Finally, the Moroccan people must have a French-speaking word. those raids on Morocco. I didn't like if they made Rasulda's feeling foolish, that Moorika's vocabulary didn't have artillery. Instead, Rasuadli reported that Europeans have weapons that change the ground.
