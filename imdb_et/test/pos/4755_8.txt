Buddy Manucci (Roy Scheider, a solid random leader role) manages a secret police unit called the seven leaders whose tactics may not necessarily follow the exact laws of the law. They can do the job in their own way, without having been leaked into the press, and it gives them the freedom to extend their resources to criminals who work as detective and the policeman simply cannot nabid. Buddy has a childhood boy named Vito (Tony Lo Bianco), who is exchanging information about mobile types and shysters working on NYC streets. What Buddy does not know is that Vito picks up the scheme using the Buddy's "checklist" names (he opens this book with notes from Vito, but he doesn't know that his friend has copied them with his written names) to create mob families in a series of attacks that generate cash thanks to two policemen, Moon (always bad Richard Lynch) and Bo (Bill Hickman) who worked with him. When this scheme goes awry when one of the seven places is killed, Vito becomes frightening because he knows how Buddy can be when he is after someone is after, especially if one of his own is murdered. <br /> <br /> An extremely underrated police flick has an exciting car chase through New York City, as Buddy follows a robbery policeman who is trying to get them after killing his partner. The film is not too complicated after setting up the plot and we understand who is the leader of the mobsters schemes. Scheider has never been given the good credit he deserves as a leading actor. She has an emotional range and we see her policeman and friend losing her toll. The movie is accelerated using good sequences of action and an interesting plot is created between friends, because the greed comes before childhood friendship, and how a smooth criminal smile seems to kill the evil mob families.
