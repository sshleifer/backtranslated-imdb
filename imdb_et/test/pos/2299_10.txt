After spending a lot of young people watching such movies, I found it very easy to follow in both unmodified and edited versions (though the story is much more to keep it in the unedited version). a much more serious remark and I think this is where it hit me. Animation, when the grainy is very original, and I just love how artists this year emphasized the shadows to show different emotions. I think this story is perfect. The movie really hits and, as the movie progresses, you feel like you are going with characters in this adventure as they meet, become allies, and find their biggest strengths.
