The previously connected Chinese story must be popular. Jet Li's hero made the king's murder popular. <br /> <br /> This is another story that was made a few years earlier. He celebrates an incredibly beautiful Li Gon (Geisha's Memories, 2046, Vice President of Miami) as a king lover who was sent to hire an assassin to be defeated by the king. She recruits Fengyi Zhang but loves her. <br /> <br /> No matter how he can't complete the mission, as the king knew him before. I suspected he knew but went anyway. <br /> <br /> It was a beautiful story with massive military operations and, of course, another way to see Li Gong.
