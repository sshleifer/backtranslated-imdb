If you look at Mexico's best films, you'll find more than likely that Gabriel Figuero made the photographer. He is world renowned as one of the best that ever existed. His camera control added value to the movies he had. Adding to his involvement, we add the direction of Luis Bunuel, you will never find such a pair of aces anywhere in the world. This story was written by Nazarini, the largest Spanish writer, with the name of Miguel de Cervante (Don Quijote de la Mancha). The story itself is great: the Nazarean priest who lives by his convictions tries to live a very Christian life, but as always there are people who do not accept it. He travels through many places that preach his Christianity, but mostly find people who don't accept him. However, besides the great story, it is always interesting to try to interpret the mysterious messages that Bunuel shows us in the whole picture.
