I just saw this amazing classic again after many years, the last movie directed by Henry Cornelius, who died three years later only at the age of 45 (same age as the male Larry Harvey died) in 1973). The team had three future directors: Jack Clayton (co-producer), Guy Green (operator) and Clive Donner (editor). The film is based on the well-known British authors Christopher Isherwood's autobiographical story "Farewell to Berlin", which for the first time became a play by John van Druten, then a film, then became a music, "Cabaret", and finally filmed "Cabaret", which brought the world of Liza Minelli astonishingly, by voice that can break the glass miles away. Isherwood appears as a film symbol under his name. He was gay, but on those days that were illegal and could be grounded in prison, he concealed his customs under the description he called "confirmed bachelor". It is the key to his platonic relationship with the wild eccentric, nervous, brilliant, always cheerful and thoroughly unique character he calls Sally Bowles. The portrait of Sally Bowles in this film is a tour of the young Julie Harris who wipes the personal charm of the magical and exciting sparkling wine of each scene. What an actor actress with a lot of her own charm! This is one of the major cinematographic performances of the 1950s. Isherwood is perfectly played by young Lawrence Harvey, a subtle estimate that never lets comedy go over the edge and even the limiting moments of farce will be "almost plausible". Larry is as funny as depicting a strange hypochondria. What is irony, given the complete absence of hypocondria, as evidenced by his bravery and stoicism in the last year of his life, when he died of terminal stomach cancer and behaved in the absence of such dignity and complaint. I knew her well in the last three years and she was a generous, warm and modest person. She adored her little girl Domino, now unfortunately also tragically dead. This film was her best early performances, followed by her remarkable work "Room at the Top" (1959), "Summer and Smoke" (1961) and "The Manchur Candidate" (1962) Larry was often underestimated during his lifetime because he was too beautiful, often poured into a frame, and the glamor boys were not always accepted as good actors, but many of the best actors who played against him were in no doubt about their abilities, and he was a strong leader among many of his most important films: if he had lived over the middle ages, he would have become strong and become the "old old" of the screen. One day he sat in his house in Hampstead, gave me a glass of his usual white wine from the big barrel he had brought. I said he always gave me the delicious wine that it was? He replied proudly that it was the Sancerre he had chosen from the grape. in France and has gone over specifically. Then he added with extreme affliction: "You know, I've been waiting for four years for someone to comment on it and ask what it is, and you are the first person to ever do that." It was important for him to be recognized for the taste of wine, and his more glamorous friends denied him that satisfaction. For the first time in this film, Anton Diffring performs for the first time as a serious young man (later he had to play too many Nazi victims, a poor companion), and the young Shelley Winters plays a rich German Jewish girl in her usual noisy but efficient, but it wasn't too difficult because she was anyway noisy Jewish girl. This film has the air of joie de vivre that it is pure joy.
