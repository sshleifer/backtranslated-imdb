SPOILERS Each large mode uses the state media at its ends. Have governments tried to influence people, from time to time through different media, whether the Nazis forbid certain leaflets or an alternative to television on Tiananmen Square. In 1925, the Russian Communist Government supported the creation of this film, the battleship Potempkin, in 1905. It is a great piece of cinema that is powerful and beautiful today. <br /> <br /> The Potempkin is a miserable crew. In unfortunate living conditions and maggot infected food, they are angry with their top class suppressors. Now, though after rotting food, it's enough. The team led by Grigory Vakulinchuk (Alexander Antonov) turns to his masters and fights for his freedom. <br /> <br /> As far as propaganda is concerned, the "battleship Potempkin" is perfect. By presenting a positive light in the first, unsuccessful Communist rebellion, the film was a useful Soviet tool. Eighty years after the release of the films, the USSR has completely disappeared from the map. The amazing thing about this movie, however, is that even though the message of this country was meant, the film is still a powerful and worthy movie. <br /> <br /> The film was written and directed by Sergei Eisenstein is a surprising joy to watch. It is true that this is far from what we are considering for entertainment today, but the film is a beautiful work of art. The stage in Odessa has made this movie perfectly. The music is powerful and dramatic, the lighting is flawless, even if it works, though slightly overturned, the piece fits. In principle, it is not possible to break the final product of this film. <br /> <br /> It's impossible to know how the Russian people got to release this movie. Praising a country that has not been 15 years old is hard to know what the complete spirit the film inspires. However, this work of art is excellent. Beautiful from start to finish, it's far from easy to look at, but it's worth the effort.
