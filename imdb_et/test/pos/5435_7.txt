Robin Williams shows his stand-up talents and raises his comedy status in the movie "What's Wrong in American Politics and How Hollywood Tries to Influence Without Dull People". Of course, Hollywood uses a hidden or non-hidden agenda. I think this movie is for people who like stand-up and political debate. And the trailers for this movie were meant for everyone to make sure so many people see it. Everyone knows that Hollywood is more liberal / democratic than bush & co, so they have to make these movies now and later ... but that was perhaps obvious, at least I thought to make real changes. <br /> <br /> However, big stand-up and fresh political issues and talks ... I liked it and thanks to IMDb.com ratings I was positively surprised when I left the cinema, and yes, I laughed several times. Sometimes you just have to let it go and forget about all the seriousness .... look at this movie if you like a good and smart stand-up or policy and you don't offend with several references to how things aren't good right now. Rent it if it doesn't fit you.
