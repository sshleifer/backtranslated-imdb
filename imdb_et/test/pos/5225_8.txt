It's pretty revealing to see it today and see how far we've been waiting in movies and at the same time appreciate how many basic principles have been created. <br /> <br /> Here we have a complete narrative film - audio and visuals are pushed to their time limits. Framing is limited to seat belt and height - no close-ups of the face. <br /> <br /> The compositions are significant; an early cross-sectional cross-section to introduce the dialogue; there is a fraudulent descent into a canyon with some harassing perspectives; the sun's bleached carcass is in the dust when the wheels and feet are marching in the upper part of the frame; the tension between the hero and the bad boy is visually captured when filmed over the long axis of a large tree between them; and forward and further - early visual treats abundantly. <br /> <br /> Today it is disturbing to see that young Wayne is wearing a film that is unloaded with ego or admonition. <br /> <br /> I have to wonder if Walsh acknowledged self-analysis: it is a journey of a group of different pilgrims; Those appearing on the screen are different groups of actors, vaudeville comedians, choral artists and probably also carny barkers and 10-in-one show veterans. They all drive together to make a mark on making movies. <br /> <br /> It is worth at least one viewing to understand the source of so many visual ideas borrowed in later films.
