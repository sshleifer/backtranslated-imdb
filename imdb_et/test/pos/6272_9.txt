This movie must be quietly released in another part of the world, perhaps even in English. Hopefully nobody will understand any word, not to understand anything in this movie! Come on! Call me nuts, but I think it's one of the best movies. Why should I come to this conclusion? Because it's my national time to sabotage horrible movies and it comes up every two minutes! When I became a fan of Myster Science Theater 3000, I had no doubt that they would find it anywhere and use it. Of course! The acquired version was titled "Cave Dwellers" using some strange introductory material, not even from the movie (apparently they are ashamed to use film from their film!). I can't say I recommend buying this movie. Rather, I recommend getting the MST3K version. MST3K DVDs are definitely sold everywhere, don't forget it!
