I just love this example. It's so funny and cool.Kuzco is such a fun and interesting character, I love her. He's the thing that makes it show what it is, even though Kronk and Yzma are both funny and charming. Everything about this show is great for me, because I always make me laugh, no matter if it's just a once episode. Disney Channel. Give it a try the next time it is turned on when you have seen the movie and even if you haven't seen the movie, you'll find it very enjoyable so go ahead.
