We all know the bits and pieces of Gulliver's trips. Small people, yes, definitely. Liliputians. Giants can also remember. Some may remember that the word yahoo comes here. It was a stop for most people. <br /> <br /> The Swift book is in school libraries everywhere. It was when I first read it, and there were many people who read it last. It is deceptively written, like many old adventure books. Kids can read it. But it drips with satire, black and uncompromising. I think most screen writers forget about customizing the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie, however, remembers. Our hero, Ted Danson, gives a credible and serious result as a world-adapted man thrown into mysterious countries like ours. Gulliver's trips criticize everything. Courts, scientists, government, crowd, nation, humanity itself. Few have been saved and most of the satire is as fresh today. <br /> <br /> Although this story is very loyal, the film also dares to add new angles that all work very well. The screen writer deserves all the credit that he can balance the time and action so well (it's not boring, that is). <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are farther than TV. With some marketing, this film would have made the box. All the fantastic worlds Gulliver visits are well done, explained in detail and often very funny, like the Swift book. <br /> <br /> Actors are all pros because it's British production. Mary Steenburgen faces James Fox's Dr. Bates, a cool brutal doctor who, like Sister Ratched, only wants the patient's best. <br /> <br /> So, a modest suggestion if you ever get the chance to get this movie, do it. This is real coffee.
