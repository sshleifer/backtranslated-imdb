Shame, the Swedish movie is in Swedish with English subtitles. The film is related to Jan and Eva. They live on an island that works as a farmer. War is underway and soldiers are attacking people on the island. When the war leaves slightly Jan and Eva is arrested with the opposite side. When more problems are released and the film shows how two ordinary people act in a war and life or death situation. CEC Award for Best Foreign Language Awards for Film Artists, Guldbagge Award for Best Actor (Liv Ullman, Playing Eva) at Guldbagge Awards, NBR Award for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Actor at The Review and NSFC Award for Best Actor, Best Director (Ingmar Bergman ) and the best film in the national cinema critics. Shame, good direction, good script, good presentations of both Max Von Sydow (who plays Jan) and Liv Ullman (who plays Eva), good cinematography and good product development. Shame, well done and well done story of how people in desperate situations sometimes do everything they can to survive. The film has a powerful message and is a good movie. The reason I haven't rated this movie is because it's not a masterpiece like some of Ingmar Bergman's films, such as strawberries, the seventh seal, or Persona. I didn't have such a big impact on the film as I thought it was missing and lacked Ingmar Bergman's thoughtful and philosophical dialogue. Although not one of his best films anywhere, there is still a lot of fun, and that's a good movie. I would have liked to have seen more of these Bergman masterpieces.
