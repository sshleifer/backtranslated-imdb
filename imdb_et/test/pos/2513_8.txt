This is an unusual film, because even though it was made by Twentieth-Century Fox, it is one of the few pairs of Barbara Stanwycki and her future wife Robert Taylor. Barbara Stanwyck had made films with many different studios (RKO, Paramount and Selznick) at about the same time she did it, but Taylor was an MGM player so she only appeared in this movie because she had borrowed Fox sometime studios of that era sometimes did. <br /> <br /> The film is interesting because many real people have roles in the film, although it is otherwise pure fiction. You can see actors playing William McKinley, Teddy Roosevelt and Admiral Dewey. I don't remember any movie that would be McKinley or Dewey in that character, although I remember Roosevelt's THE WIND and LION, and a few other movies. Three joy of seeing the "smaller president" in the film as a great character! The film begins with McKinley, who takes the young lieutenant (Robert Taylor) and asked him to be a special representative for him - and he doesn't talk to anyone - not even the secret service. This is because the president is afraid that someone inside the agency is banging a gang that has long been kidnapped - all based on inside information. So this is Taylor's task (not known for his male roles - especially at this stage of his career) to represent a thug and find a gang-responsible AND internal person. <br /> <br /> There are two serious complications. First, if he can find gang members, one of the gang members' father-sister Stanwyck. Taylor believes that he is in love with him, but he must also fulfill his duties and turn to the authorities. Second, because McKinley is the only person who knows the truth, there are serious problems when McKinley is murdered and Taylor is sentenced to death for a crime !!! <br /> <br /> The film did a good job of creating the story and its historical context. Although most people today don't remember McKinley and don't remember being murdered, the movie is set for an interesting period of time. The action is pretty decent, because the stars are supported by Victor McLaglen and Brian Donlevy, although I have to admit that the role of Donlevy was quite clever and common to many of his other film roles. In general, it is a very interesting, well-written and not romantic department. A good break for everyone.
