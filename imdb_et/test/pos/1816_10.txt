"I'm so sure" and "totally gnarly", this is one of the sweetest and most vivid novels depicted on the film. deborah foreman (where is he now?) like julie and nicolas cage because randy is classic like romeo and juliet, tony and maria, jake and samantha ... you can't help but fall in love with them. In addition, the soundtrack - plimsoules, sparks, furs, flirt and, of course, modern English - is also outstanding. For fans of young love movies, I would like to recommend a movie that is all David Gordon's green girls.
