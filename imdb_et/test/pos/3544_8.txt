I think some of the 24-hour film directors sat in their Cannes or other film festivals around the 1980s to drink their absinthe, grappa, aramangac, or jungle juice and said, "Hey, guys, we're making a film where each of us creates a segment around world-class aria." .. it's kind of worked. It is clear that someone was smart enough to pick some of the best recordings of selected arias, such as the Bjoreling Nessun Dorma, so if you were blind and were on the floor but listened to the DVD, you have more than money. Not every director succeeded, but more than not and the flick seems to be healing with every view over the years. My favorite is Die Todt Statd's eerily beautiful love duet; Okay, young naked Elizabeth Hurley is an eye candy, but her husband sings his wife's ghost with love music only incredibly beautifully in Otello and Desdemona's "Gia nella Notte Densa" throughout the opera. Whether the flick was better, sure what could not be, but it is a worthwhile view, especially your hyper-romantic mood.
