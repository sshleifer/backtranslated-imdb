OK, most of us agree that this is a weak test, but at the same time it is a different film in itself. Don't do it wrong, "The American werewolf in London" is a good movie, but also "American remake in Paris" is a decent film. <br /> <br /> First, the only real similarities are TITLE, 2 American BACKPACKERS and WEREWOLVES. Other than these 3 things, "American Remake in Paris" stands out quite well for its special blend of humor, action / adventure and horror. The majority of people who say this film is better than the original are the youngsters of today's generation who think the film made before 1990 is complete. Although these 80s grew older, they appreciate older movies and what they've added to today's horror movies. Many people are unable to understand that without the old classic films, including the B & Ws, the horror is not what it is today. Now I'm getting a little bit on the road ... <br /> <br /> An American werewolf in Paris is a good attempt to restore the classic design, but it never goes beyond the original. That said, it's still a very fun movie to watch and I recommend it. I'll give him 10 out of 10. Maybe it's a bit generous, but I've seen a lot of worse attempts to re-create the classic.
