I hope Robert Redford continues such films. Hillerman's books are wonderful and, as a young child who has grown up in the southwest, has hit his stories! Adam Beach is a highly regarded and unused actress. Wake up to Hollywood, not everyone thinks your Mel Gibson is cool! Many of the film's visitors want to see the movies that think of you. I've seen all the Redford / Hillerman series. They are thoughtful, picturesque and have large plots. I hope that if enough people write to Robert Redford, he may decide a few more! Thank you to Adam Beach and Tony Hillerman for great entertainment! If anyone gets the chance to read Tony Hillerman's last book, do it! That's great. I also recommend traveling through Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Colorado. Stop at every viewing point and feel the Hillerman book settings. Amazing experience.
