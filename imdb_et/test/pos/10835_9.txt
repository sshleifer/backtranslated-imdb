I made a dissertation on border demarcation: a female cross-leg and I use Tipping the Velvet as her main text, any remarks about gender and sexual identity, gender and sexual confusion, gender as occurrence, sex as fiction, gender images, baptism, erotic fantasy and revolution, men costume etc. effects etc would be greatly appreciated! But a little bit has anyone seen Sergio Toledo's 1987 movie Vera? Its about a young lesbian maybe a transsexual cross dresser .. I die to see it because I think it would be really helpful ... Does anyone know where I can get this copy? I've tried Amazon and some other site, but luck ...
