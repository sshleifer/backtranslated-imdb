People of my generation and older people know about World War II (or as it is called in Russia - during the Great Patriotic War) not only school textbooks, but also witnesses and participants of the event. My grandfather was a soldier in Stalingrad and when I was a little girl, I listened to my stories about how he won the Germans. He also told me some anecdotes, not everything he told me was gloomy. But it was a long time ago, and not when I have a conscious interest in what was happening there in the Battle of Stalingrad, I have to take note of books and movies. Somehow, most of the movies I saw were made in the Soviet Union, but some in today's Russia. And Stalingrad is an exception. The film describes the war on the other hand and the fact itself is interesting. All that is shown in the film is quite different from what I am used to. <br /> <br /> The film reminds me of Remarque's "Zeit zu leben und Zeit zu sterben" because the war is shown through the perception of a regular German soldier. And this soldier or lieutenant is quite obsessed if he repeats that he is not a fascist. The heroes of the film, directly from the clean and enthusiastic Europe off the coast of Italy, reach the snowy Soviet Union with snow. They are dead; it is clear from the beginning. <br /> <br /> After the elite separation in their first battle in Stalingrad, one of the soldiers said a phrase that reflected my whole idea; he said, "When you start thinking, it gets crazy." And I think it applies to spectators. On the one hand, you may think, OK, I look at this movie and it doesn't scatter me, I don't like the people on the screen because those who attacked my country and not the other way around. But sooner or later, but inevitably begins to symbolize. Probably when Lieutenant prevents his tears from seeing Kolya's realization. <br /> <br /> "Stalingrad" is hard to see, all those frozen legs, dirt, executions, snow, hunger, destroyed illusions. <br /> <br /> I know that Mr Hans von Witzland is one of the few films where Thomas Kretschmann played his star. I watched quite a lot of Hollywood movies where he was given insignificant parts of small French fries, such as "Next" or "Transsiberian" (why did he do that?!). And after looking at "Stalingrad", I can't point out that European actors want to appear in American films, even at another price, at all costs. The fact is understandable. I believe Thomas Kretschmann deserves better parts and much better scenarios than Hollywood. And what I saw with him, "Stalingrad" is the best, beyond doubt. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the worst of Stalingrad's shortcomings is how they speak Russian in Russian. Of course I mean those who should be Russian. Say, boy, who spent time with the Germans or the girl with whom they were going to escape. Was it really so hard to find participants who could pronounce a few phrases without this terrible accent? Initially, I went to see "Stalingrad" to listen to native speakers because I'm learning this language. I didn't expect anything extraordinary from the movie. But that impressed me, letting me cry when I wasn't at all. I know I look at it 15 years later, but "Stalingrad" is not a mill film, and after 15 years it's still traceable and shocking.
