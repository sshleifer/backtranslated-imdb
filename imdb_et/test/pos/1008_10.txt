It was one of the few Norwegian films I was looking for. It started with some ads with a football match. Then they made a movie about it. Wires are not pluses (and you see it), but they still do a great job and the movie all beat me. <br /> <br /> Norway is known for making movies (which are not offended), but I had a good feeling about it. Even if I don't want the football I wanted, 2 to see it. this story is much better than expected and just laughing at each other. There are many pictures of Norwegian celebrities and players. Characters are well represented and you know them. If you are ever GONNA, see NORMEGA MOVIE. LETE IS IT !!
