Warning: Herzog is a filmmaker and as such tends to be a little too dramatic. So closing closed doors can be a real part of real life, but the dramatic decoration of cinematic art - or both - agreed to a premiere in San Francisco. But Herzog's usual charm with character, dreams and perseverance fits well with this story, which was first published in the Soldier of Fortune and now in the full-length autobiographical book. (Fortune Fortune's comment brought the politically correct SF audience loudly, and both the filmmaker and the main character had to make sure the movie had just been seen by the audience that SOF's interest had been misplaced - a warning, not a Rambo, but a survival.)
