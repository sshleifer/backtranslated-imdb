Okay, let me start by saying that in general I don't like anime. I have enjoyed a couple of frequently quoted "classic" series, but I consider the media as a whole as I do on American television: that a good 90-95% of it is surprising, the rest remain somewhere "guarded" to "decent". In this case, it is no wonder that I do not like self-depreciating anime parodies. I don't get most jokes, and the media fills a certain sense of humor that I don't like at all - pick, hyperactive, low and completely up. <br /> <br /> So when I started viewing this series at a friend's hand, I was disappointed after the first few episodes. I thought the characters should represent the story of the cliché characters from the store and that their actions had to be similarly satirical. I could see where it came from, but didn't think it was all that smart - a lot of "crazy, fun high school shenanigans and moves, now we're ironic about it." In about a third episode, my opinion changed drastically. <br /> <br /> At this point, the strengths of this series began to emerge. The order of the non-chronological episode, the sense of snarky self-consciousness, and above all the smart man (well) well-done straight man. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, any media has a rarity, this exhibition introduces thoughtful and spiritual interactions between diametrically opposed signs. Chief Specialist Kyoni's eternal vague resentment resigns the perfect foil title to the character of Haruh's general "anime-like" exploitation operations. This is a break from the formula and it works incredibly well. <br /> <br /> On the basis of this strong foundation, the series succeeds to deliver truly phenomenal attention to detail. As mentioned earlier, the episodes are vented in chronological order. I thought it was a trick at first, but it works surprisingly well. The chronological order of the events is logical, but the episode-driven sequence follows the traditional structure of the aristotelian drama. The selected order does not leave narrative gaps that cannot be filled with a simple conclusion (but although it is possible to guess what happened in the uneven "previous" episode, it is still forced to follow exactly how these events unfold) and excellent planning prevents any plot holes or contradictions. I looked at this series for the second time immediately after you first stopped it, and I was surprised at how well seemingly unreasonable events seem to be linked. <br /> <br /> The last point shows great attention to detail in every area of ​​the series. Although the characters in the "anime" stock are slightly developed, the background art is subtle, actually based on actual photographic references. Animation quality is also great at points. For example, a musical performance in a later series where characters are actually shown when playing a song - it may seem trivial, but the sound that actually corresponds to the music is incredible in the film's (film quality) subconscious effect. br /> <br /> In short, I love this series for some reason. By its very nature, it is something that I generally dislike, but its execution is so unique and well-executed that I cannot help it.
