And I love it! Wonder Showzen picks up a cultural audience and when it is canceled, the sale of the DVD goes to the roof. This is a very funny show on your way. This is a parody of children's shows, namely Sesame Street. Our pups are made up of Chauncy, a yellow hairy monster with a hat in our hat. Clarence is a blue lizard like the thing that makes her segments where she goes out on the streets. He is a weird dog who refers to a third person. Wordsworth is a wise person whose brain always shows. Then there is a newsletter and a pink doll. This is a very funny show, not really as nasty as you wait, but more situations. They take the 7-year-old out on the street, tell them what to say, and let them mean jokes they don't understand. My favorite segments are Clarence videos, especially if no one wants to shoot. I prefer TV Funhouse, a similar show, but it's still a very funny show that I hope it will last for years. <br /> <br /> My rating: *** 1/4 out *** *. 30 minutes. TV MA.
