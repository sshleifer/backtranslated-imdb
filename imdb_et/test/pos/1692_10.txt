Krajobraz po bitwie like many Wajda films are not understandable to the "rest of the world". A story based on Tadeusz Borowski's little short stories, who were prisoners of Oswiecim, Dachau and Dautmergen camps during World War II. In his books, Borowski describes inhuman life in Nazi camps, author of the Tadek-porte password, who was also privileged among prisoners. Borowski was merciless and merciless for humanity. He describes human history as an endless chain of exploitation and humiliation. Ironically, after returning to Poland, he finished writing artistic prose and became a communist propaganda, producing anti-imperialist and anti-American press publications. In a few years he committed suicide. In the film, Wajda changes the angle of view. Vorarbeiter Tadek - an animal created by Tadeusz Janczar - plays only a supporting role. The story is focused on a poet who has been destroyed, burned by war and imprisonment, and his one-day love relationship with Nina, a Jewish girl who escaped from Communist Poland, although he actually hates the life and mentality of the Jews. The sad grotesque life of the so-called "dipy" (displaced persons), which, after release, is settled by the Americans in the SS barracks, can be observed. Married, patriotic kitsch mixed with food and / or German girls' prostitution. <br /> <br />
