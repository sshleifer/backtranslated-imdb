All the trials and tribulations that make the budget out of the mouth of the people directly involved. You feel all the sweating, guts, determination and dedication make Stuie the job and the disappointment of love that he's been hanging after all his work. The clips of all the interviews involved give a great flow of narrative and pass balls, hardcore punk, almost anarchic attitude towards the film "Waldo" and then documentary. Stuie and the company deserve the requisite props around the world if they don't give up when going tough and getting out of the Texas Tale of Treason so we can see what it is like for a Buddhist filmmaker on the street!
