When I read the summary - 3 people who had disappeared into the nature, fought with a huge crocodile - I wasn't exactly drawn. It sounded like a typical horror-movie horror formula, with only three in a monster, except in that case, so we wouldn't even get them to be joyful when viewed one by one. <br /> <br /> But I looked at it (couldn't sleep, nothing else) and it turned out much better than expected. Action is great, the atmosphere is tense and you will get this rarely low budget winner. <br /> <br /> Horror as it should be done. First-rate movies. It's not perfect, but it's worth looking at. I'll give her 7.
