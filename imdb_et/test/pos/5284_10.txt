Ponyo, written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, is a little story that talks about respecting the ocean, respecting the young and old, and respecting cultural differences. This is a new story about a small goldfish that wants to be a girl, not a repetition of Disney's little mermaid. Miyazaki is an animated hand, fun and magical film for young and young people. The film starts slowly with seawater, jellyfish and childish faces with a slow, green, green palette of small, mischievous goldfish. There is no need for narrative, the movement of beings and the music of Jo Hisaiah speak from the beginning. Last summer, Japan won the Japanese Academy Award for Best Animated Movies and Best Results (Jezebel.com). The charming little goldfish, Brunhild, leaves the ocean with jellyfish. When it reaches the surface, it reaches a fishing net filled with other fish, garbage and mud. He is moved to a can, which is rolled to the shore, where five years old Sosuke (Frankie Jonas's voice) got it. He cuts his hand when crushing the can open to release small goldfish. Brunhild tastes his own blood that cures Sosuke's cut and puts his transformation into a human being, while throwing it away from nature. Sosuke puts small goldfish in a green bucket and names Pony (Noah Cyrus), which means soft and jelly. Sosuke's mother Lisa (Tina Fey) lets her take the Ponyo school, right next to the nursing home where she works. The superb queue of Miyazaki's activities is represented by Add Crazy Journey along the Dry Dock to a smooth fishing area and a tree-lined road to a nursing home and an excellent illustration of a parent's passionate morning. Miyazaki has created another strong, independent female character. Making her a loving, sensible and modern mother to both Sosuke and Ponyo. Add a phone call to a non-coming home again with his wife, Kiochi (Matt Damon), because the ship he is supposed to do is a typical woman's reaction. Later that evening, Sosuke used a signal light to talk to his father when the ship passed through the rock where their house was sitting. Lisa refuses to admit Kiochi's apology and jumps up, signaling "Bug-off, Bug-off, Bug-off," this is a fun scene. But when Sosuke takes a signal and tells his father "Good luck, I love you," Lisa adds to him and tells him he has a good heart, this is a very terrible scene. <br /> <br /> My personal favorites are Miyazaki's elderly, grandmother-type women in wheelchairs in nursing homes, Yochi (Betty White), Noriko (Cloris Leachman) and Toki (Lily Tomlin). Their exchange between Sosuke's small goldfish is wonderful and reminiscent of the magic of waste (Lauren Bacall) and Sophie (Jean Simmons) as they drag the long stairs on Howl's moving castle. Ponyo's magical seagull father, Fujimoto (Liam Neeson), who resembles a wizard Howl, returns to Ponyo back to his ocean home. Fujimoto uses one of his elixirs to try and balance nature, but the magical little Ponyo is once again escaping with the elixir and causing the tsunami. Running on the back of giant dolphins, to reach Sosuke, it is reminiscent of a redhead, a little girl for the audience who is a stubborn, adventurous little Mei in my neighborhood in Totoro. Ponyo is as adventurous and curious as Mei. When Fujimoto understands what Ponyo has done, he requires the ocean goddess Gran Mamare (Kate Blanchett) to improve the situation. This wise and soothing goddess arrives in a blue flowing garment that never ends. She has a private conversation with Lisa, where the future of babies is being discussed, helping the audience understand Sosuke, and the relationship between Ponyo and lovers is not the relationship between lovers. MÃ¼azaki's films are characterized by a quiet, simple end to life, which leaves the audience hopeful.
