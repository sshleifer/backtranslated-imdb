At the end of the 1960s, this film had everything it wanted to look at. It was tremendously fun and gave a modern insight into the many changes that took place during this period - and were still in progress - with the Black Power movement in Vietnam and the volatile movement that followed the quieter, post-war 1950s. All this and one of the most funny movies, then or now. <br /> <br /> Looking at it a second time recently, I was surprised to find it as attractive as originally. Its humor is just as funny and its message is strong. <br /> <br /> And if you look at it now, you will get it all, while gaining additional opportunities to be a "periodic piece". and the great chronicle of this historic, turbulent time.
