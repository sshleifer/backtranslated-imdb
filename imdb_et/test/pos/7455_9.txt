Rated TV-14 for sexual content and language. <br /> <br /> I remember listening to this show in 1998, when he played Teleton earlier. I didn't look at it then, but now it is playing the channel, Razer. I've seen about four episodes of this show and I have to say it's pretty intelligent and funny. <br /> <br /> Exhibition star celebrity Jason Alexander Seinfeld and also Tim Curry Rocky Horror Picture Show and It celebrity. The exhibition is about a dude who is a police officer. He basically does his job as a cop, while coping with personal problems. This show is quite funny at times and fans of animated-comedy like this.
