Stephanie Meyer will be so labeled! Now his book "Breaking Dawn" is not the first of its title. Sorry, Twilight fans. <br /> <br /> Kelly Overton (Ring Ring) is a medical student, Eve, who has been interviewed with a psychotic Don (James Haven - Angelina Jolie's brother). I suspected twisting and when he discovered that they both grew up in the same city, I was sure. <br /> <br /> He held a deeper and deeper point with his patient that I felt a common fraud. Sometimes he was even like a PTSD. I really thought he would lose it. <br /> <br /> Well, he didn't lose it, and when the end came, I was on the floor. My entire suspicion turned out to be wrong. Twist was even more amazing than I believed. <br /> <br /> Overton was fantastic and the story is so much better than something that Stephanie Meyer would have come out of. Must see.
