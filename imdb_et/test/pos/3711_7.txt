This Oscar winning short film (40 minutes), based on William Faulkner's short film, takes us back to the small town of Tennessee in December 1941. Two brothers, one about 18 and one about 8 are looking for bird eggs (probably at that time big collectors for South Boys' boys). Well, the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor and older brother Pete decide to recruit. He gives his egg to his little brother Willie and directs those who want to show little to their emotion and sensitivity. Well, Willie is nothing about it, if Pete can be a soldier, can he. He leads Memphis, showing his stubbornness and determination when he gets a better result as several adults. After finding a recruitment center in Memphis, he asks his brother to pull the knife to lieutenant and wound him in the process. We are shown the commitment and love of a little brother (Jonathan Furr). It offers impeccable results as a stubborn strong-willed boy in the delicate times of last year. The film strives and is mostly able to show how brothers can show commitment and the importance of family ties in the youth. Because the two brothers are reuniting, the film offers a cathartic cry because the brother's love surrounds us all. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a cold bottle of water. Perhaps Dasan or Aquafina, good, clear water with a delicious mineral pack, but not pure natural spring water like Evian. However, it quenches thirst and you do not doubt its purity and erasure. It's more a grinder and less expensive than some, but it does work, leaving one update and detoxifying later. 7/10
