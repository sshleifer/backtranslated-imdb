"Witchery" is a decent little Euro-Trash horror yarn! David Hasselhoff is pretty funny here and unfortunately he is one of the best actors. Linda Blair is a terrible and lady who plays Hoff's wife ... she's badly bad! The plot of this movie is also ridiculous. It has some holes that you can not ignore, but it will be fun. <br /> <br /> "Witchery" gore is amazing. I loved the part where the old bag is "sucked" into the trash and ends with chimney roasting! And the part where the devil "exploits" was pretty damn disturbing. I would say it is mandatory for gorehounds. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a highly-produced, well-functioning flick, look elsewhere. But if you like the old school style Italian sleaze and over the top, "Witchery" belongs to your shelf. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised to find a low rating here! What were you waiting for, "Exorcist?" 7 out of 10, kids.
