It's a great job, definitely. In fact, there are many of the best scenes in the movie or at least in the Bergman movie. Liv Ullmann and Max von Sydow are as good as you would expect. Do these two give bad performances? Sven Nykvist offers some masterful, though unusually masterful cinematography. The script is pretty good, especially for single scenes. Sometimes the film stops and the pace is uneven, though probably deliberately. So, what's the problem? Well, the film is too dark for its good. The other Bergman movies are also gloomy, but not close to the harsh ones. Finally I just gave up and started getting a little irritated. I was often influenced during the film, but finally I felt still involved. This is a great movie, but I doubt I'll ever look at it again and don't recommend it to friends. Or, if I would recommend it, I would certainly warn them. 8/10
