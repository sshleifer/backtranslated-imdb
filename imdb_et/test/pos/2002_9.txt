You have to believe it. In Hollywood, in the middle of a sliding tape, something goes into the 70s, this cheap-made flick must be really packed in the city center theaters. And again, I bet he had one week. In fact, it's pretty fun. Action is terrible, there is no direction, but hair, clothes, rotten pre-music and general out and kicking are desperate. Sleazy, its very slippery. Highly recommended (if found)
