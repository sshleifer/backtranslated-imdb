(Includes spoiler) <br /> <br /> People who advertise in the Lonely Heart newspaper are often idealists. They try to put a few words on everything they have and are waiting for. The exchange of letters is full of hope ... Louis Mahe (Jean Paul Belmondo), owner of the cigarette company ile de la Reunion (east of Madagascar), is Julie Roussell's letters he offers. But the unexpected beautiful brunette does not come from the "Mississippi" board, but - Catherine Deneuve. And we already know from the beginning that he is a married couple and that the crime has happened. He doesn't know the "Julie" wardrobe (he can't even open his trunk) and leaves his canary aside until he dies. But the most important seduction tricks (open zipper) are enough for Louis to become a flexible small dog. First: a common bank account. And when Julie's sister directs her attention, she's flying. 27 850 million Louis '28 million - he should have signed all his money. <br /> <br /> Louis and Julie's sister are dealing with a private detective (Michel Bouquet). Louis talks to watch Marion (Deneuve's real name) in Antibes, where he works as a taxi-girl - his gangster lover left his steadfast or rather centimeter. Louis can't kill him. He talks about his story: Orphan. Early. Lesbian Experience. Many sugardaddies. Jail - and soon he will run his nose again. A detective turns out to be cunning and tearful as a blood hound; Louis and Marion buried their bodies in the basement. They flee to Paris, where Louis discovers that Marion has a costly taste. He worships money like deity. He sells a fraction of his business in value. But when a detective body (flood) is discovered, they have to flee again - without money. Living in mountainous areas, with a plywood loser - Marion can think of a happier life without this additive ... <br /> <br /> A high point in the career of all involved people. Belmondo's own scam makes him almost love. Deneuve Sees Yves St. Beautiful in Laurent's wardrobe and her performance is admirable: At first she freaks her fragile spouse - too scared to ask her husband for money, so she needs a joint bank account - but after she has revealed her as a Katharine Hepburn prison scene that is up built. The scenery is remarkable - the tropics, the Riviera, Paris. Truffaut manages to take for granted: the sixties were the only decades when European films were head and shoulders across American productions. After this movie, Truffaut was able to look at his idol Alfred Hichcock.
