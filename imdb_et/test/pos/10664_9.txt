Bronenosets Potyomkin is one of the milestones in the history of cinematography, one of a handful of great films that deserve to be called classics. It was a picture that made Sergei M. Eisenstein's film a historical one. Nowadays it is still remembered that it is a great cinema that has always been. <br /> <br /> "Potyomkin" is a movie that NEED to be seen as a single unit, not a choice. Don't just look at the clips where they only play "Odessa Steps" and then move on to "Citizen Kane" or "The Godfather", look at all that is 75 minutes of famous time to really understand and enjoy. Don't expect every infinite detail to be perfect, but I mean the work of the 20s silent era that Scooby Doo looks like an underrated master of realism, some plot points may seem illogical and some battles look dated, but it's still an enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> The most memorable moments of the film are the Battle of the Battleships, the body of Vakulinchuki, which falls from the ship, the sailor at the end of the tent at the end of the ship, the mother who kept her dead child, the stepped stroller in Odessa and the lion rising as the next carnage follows. For every pair of new eyes that look at it, the Battlefield Potemkin is alive again.
