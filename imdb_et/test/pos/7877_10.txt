Oh man, this movie is amazing, it's very good that it's a story of a man who hasn't received such black people, he sits on a bar in the evening and hangs with hippies who are anti-war, and how black and hippies don't deserve welfare . This movie is very realistic because it represents a man "Joe" who represented many guys back and now. The story goes like this .... Joe is in the bar and he rubs with his shoulders a rich man who just accidentally killed his daughter's hippie boyfriend. And this rich goes to the bar to think about what he just did, and when he does, there is a "Joe" bar, where hanging hippies and people who are against the war. The rich man accidentally tells Joe that he killed hippie; and apparently praises the rich man of joe, because Joe hates hippie, the amazing film looks at what happens next. I liked this movie because it reminded me of those days in the early 70's, I liked how movies were shot these days, very good things, it's not like today's movies. In principle, the film gives an internal look to the mind of the "Joe" sign. I like the theme of the movie ....... about a working person who strikes his ass trying to earn a living
