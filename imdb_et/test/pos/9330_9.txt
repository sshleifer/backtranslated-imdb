Before that, it was shown on MTV or VH1, playing in my local theater just before the main movie. I remember this short movie more than I saw this day. It was the first time I had such a music movie, but I tell you that seeing a big screen on 35 mm in a dark theater gives it a much better effect than seeing a cropped pan and scanning version of VH1 at Halloween.
