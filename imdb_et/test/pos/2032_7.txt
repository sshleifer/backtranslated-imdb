There is nothing very unpredictable in this film, but solid in every sense. Everything about cinematography was certain. Not a completely linear line, but there was nothing you didn't see. Maybe then at the point of a melodramatic, but again quite decent film. Definitely worth a look. If you have any doubts about what to rent at the weekend, let it go. Although you may not feel like running out and buying, I found it quite worthwhile.
