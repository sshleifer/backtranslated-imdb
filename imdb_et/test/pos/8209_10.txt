I loved this movie! <br /> <br /> Movies and games fulfill their purpose when they reveal problems affecting social, political and other majority. This movie served this purpose. <br /> <br /> I know the plot and I know the people to whom it happened. While making this movie, the concepts in this flick have progressed to the public, but it has already happened to my friends in powerful positions. And I know what it is when people do to you what they did to Angela Bennett because they've done it to me. <br /> <br /> I was very pleased with Sandra Bullock's picture of Angela Bennett / Ruth Marx. She depicts a beautiful, intelligent and spiritually young woman who has the courage to avoid surprising contradictions, to fight hard to keep her peace of mind and restore her life and to try to protect those she loves. Losing his self-consciousness and surrendering to this old endeavor to strengthen self-esteem through stranger interference, an amazing touch of reality was added. <br /> <br /> The plot's peak opens the only real solution to this problem.
