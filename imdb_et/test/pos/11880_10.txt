Critters 4 is a good movie. A little twist to the series because it takes place in space, not in the earthly community. Good effect and action make this movie visible. I would recommend it to Horror / Science Fiction fans everywhere. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 <br /> <br /> Fans of such amazing movies should check out Puppy Training, Skinned Life, Sleep Camp, Slumber Party Massacre and other full moon pictures tend to.
