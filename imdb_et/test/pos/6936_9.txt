OK, I got a DVD last week and I can finally post my comments, but I certainly liked this sequel in many ways. <br /> <br /> Zombie Bloodbath 2: Undead's Rage. OKAY. The movie on this quick clip has some really good gore effects and some very well done atmosphere and style. I would really like to record, saying it may be one of the most stylish DV shots I've bought. Most of the time I get quite angry for DV movies because they are bored and look like soap operas. Even the film, as I like Bone Sickness, is an incredible DULL width. Not that movie. It never ends long enough to catch your breath. Although I wouldn't say that I liked it better than the first movie, I say the pages definitely improved between the films in two years technically. It is a better gore, inevitable zombie feeding scenes, scumbag characters, and some returning actors (though their roles are different) mainly Jerry Angell as a pretty good psychopath who is hell killer with a mullet. The shots are both ambitious and script at the time, because you can say that the pages try to pull out much more than they did on the first film. Some of them work and some are not, but I have to say that at least he didn't try to make a bigger version of the first movie. At that time, there was no mention of a chemical pollution power plant, but of satanism and occultism that brought the undead back to life. So I tell Mr Sheets that they are trying to do something else. I'll give this movie two bloody thumbs!
