Intense home relationship with a caretaker (Lupino, great, as always) threatened by a psychotic housekeeper (Ryan). The genre's two masters are best placed in their main, erotic situation when they are in the position of intelligent hostages outside Saturday's afternoon. Richly lit B&W photography that includes an unusual range of close-ups. A young girl who strips Ryan is really well targeted. Unlikely but satisfactory suburban melodrama.
