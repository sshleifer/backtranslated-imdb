The three summaries given in the 1959 compilation are timeless Chaplin classics, nothing wrong with them and no criticism. There is also a well-made Chaplin score between these films and the short sections between them. The problem with this compilation is small but annoying. Shorts are printed in 24 frames p.s. speed of modern films, while short shorts were shot at 20 frames p.s. These results are a jerky movement that doesn't seem very attractive, but it was an excusable solution, given the limitations of optical printing technology, it's not just an excuse that the current DVD version is unrestored, movies look dirty as they did in 1959 and are still printed. Various restored versions are available for these DVDs, even on DVD, and there would be no problem restoring the image, but unfortunately it hasn't been done. <br /> <br /> A small amount has taken up a lot in my article, but I'll say a little descent again, it shouldn't count much on experience, although it reduced my rating to one point. Short pants are still worth '10'.
