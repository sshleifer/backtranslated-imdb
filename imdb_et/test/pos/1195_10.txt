Milos Forman's original HAIR was an ideal film that actually showed how life changed in these years, not only in the US, but especially in that country. One of the film plots was meant to be used in other films that came from hair, such as American graffiti, etc. It was an original story of generational sadness. The movie characters were like a single "cells" in the "body" that changed everywhere. In general, a very good film, perhaps a bit underestimated. Annie Golden's role was small, but she worked very well. It was a film that practically launched John Savage as an actor. One of the Chicago members played their role well, although it was a small role.
