I looked at Nightbreed for the first time after seeing it in the theater almost 20 years ago, and although I remember to like it at the time, I don't remember it being blown up today. I can't really do anything about this movie. Craig Scheffer is a great Boone character. I have never understood why he has not had a more successful career because most of his early works are unfulfilled. As good as Scheffer is, Cronenberg is even better. His imagination psycho Dr Decker is unforgettable and steals the exhibition. The rest, which contains Doug Bradley, is very good, except for the ridiculously top red sheriff. The visuals are good and large in some frames. Danny Elfman's score is as good as it is, and it's one of his best works. The end was epic, with nearly twenty minutes of stop-ups. All in all, Nightbreed is a tremendous achievement for Clive Barker, a favorite of my films, just over Hellraiser. 9/10
