OK, Anatomie is not a revival of the Horrormovie genre, but it is still well done. Good actors (Potente and FÃ¼hrmann at first) and some beautiful ideas made me happy. Perhaps I would have been so positive if it wasn't a German film, but who cares. A good, exciting story is good to see familiar faces with some gore and good jokes. You all complain about duplication: I didn't see a duplicate version (of course), but I believe it's not easy to see duplicate movies. We (Germans) use such films, so it's not a big problem. But try to look in German with subtitles. The actors are really good!
