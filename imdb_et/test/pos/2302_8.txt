This is the film of Oshima, the head of the infamous "In The Senses", that is both sexually hard-core and disgracefully contradictory that it has been banned for some time. This film originally takes place in Japan in 1895 and marks the very beautiful Keziko Yoshiyuk, Seki, a rickshaw leader, who falls on a much younger man who admires him a little. This man, Toyoji, comes to him as he sleeps and seduces him, though he is soon to be attracted. Soon they will have a thing and a plot to kill Seki's husband, to be together forever. They do it and throw it down. But they did not take into account the ghost of the deceased husband who haunts Sheki and others in the village! This film is very visually stunning, using shadows that highlight the story of this passionate murder. Yoshiyuki (who is still acting as an actor) is particularly good at his role. His sexual time, but not like "In The Sims". Some of what is happening is our imagination. I found that this film has a continuity of mood that makes it very traceable. A little creepy, but it goes with the territory. I recommend it.
