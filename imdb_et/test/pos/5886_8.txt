During World War II, film studios rushed to focus on vets returning to their homeland. "The best years of our life" was probably the best example. It depicts different people who return home and how they need to adapt not only the pre-war life but the changing world. Probably the most interesting member is the non-actor Harold Russell. Having lost his hands in war, he plays a hooked man whose hands were earlier, and reminds people that he wants to be treated like everyone else; He won the Best Supporting Actress and Special Oscar for this role, making him the only person to win two roles for the same role. There is probably always a debate about whether it earned the best picture more than "it's a wonderful life", but I think they did a good job with it. Very well done.
