I feel that this film is so different from many others because it shows a family of girls who really care about each other. They may have mistakes, but bitterness and spikes are not in these girls' places. Try to find it on TV or in regular movies. It's a breath of fresh air to see that girls are feminine - beautiful, feminine dresses and shoes. Contrary to the fact that the stores today have clothing, i.e. dirty and faded jeans and jackets, and the like. The storyline has an evil thread that makes it more realistic and interesting. I know it's animated, but it still gives you the feeling that families can stick and get out. I recommend this film to both boys and girls.
