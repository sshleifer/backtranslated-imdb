Michael Polish's hypnotic "Northfork" is a movie that has been in memory for quite some time. This finely designed film, written by Michael and Mark Polish, is one of the best things that came out of the world of independent films last year. The film has been perfectly captured by M. David Mullen, who has been hit by Stuart Matthewman. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen the movie, you should read it here. > The idea of ​​making a movie in Montana was a great coup for Polish brothers. Never have the majestic views of the country and the mountains so vividly caught as "Northforkis". We don't need color! Beauty is in the dark colors of the film, which improves the devastation of this remote control center. . This boy is on his bed, where a kind priest manages the medicine for his body. But does it exist at all? We look at him in a relationship with a strange group we first experience around the cemetery. There are two freshly opened graves. Is one of them for Irwin? <br /> <br /> At the same time, the second plot line plays in parallel with this first theme. We see six black men who have come to the area to remove as many people from the area as possible. This is the bed of the lake to be created. Their pay is one acre and half of the real estate in front of the lake when they move a certain number of people. . They follow the opportunity to link to an angel injured in this area. When Irwin encounters them at the cemetery, he will only help if they take him at least a thousand miles away. We are watching the quartet study the feathers that the boy has placed between his Bible page. Is Irwin this angel? <br /> <br /> The closing sequence shows us all the parties who leave Northfork in different directions. The black ones travel with their cars, maybe they go home to enjoy the newly acquired qualities that were given to them. The mystical group sees entering the plane and picking up a higher place. We also understand that the child living in father Harlan has died despite the medicines and care he has received from the saint. <br /> <br /> Michael Polish became one of the best ensembles working on all principals. Nick Nolte, like his father Harlan, has in his imagination such a low-level performance. James Woods, like Walter, one of the men working for the developer, does a good job. The biggest surprise is Duel Farmer, who makes an excellent impression of Irwin. This child's actor with the right instructions shows a great promise. <br /> <br /> The mystical group works great with Daryl Hannah, Robin Sachs, Ben Foster and Anthony Edwards, a man with funny glasses. Peter Coyote, Mark Polish, Ben Foster and the rest cast is Mr. Polish perfectly flawless. <br /> <br /> The beauty of a movie depends on its simplicity. Mr. Poland's vision haunts memory. Montana pictures, because perhaps the unrealistic landscape is one of the best things about American movies.
