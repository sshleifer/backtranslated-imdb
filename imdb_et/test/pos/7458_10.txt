I've always had animated ducks for some reason: Duck Tales, Darkwing Duck, Daffy Duck, Donald Duck. Although none of them are the same as Duckman. Originally, between 1994 and 1997, Duckman was distributed with a total of 70 episodes, but it can easily go on forever, unchanging. <br /> <br /> A typical character is an uncomfortable, unapologic slip and pretty much the worst living person. the world. She is a private investigator, widow, peeping tom, alcoholic, sex maniac, murderer, a (fill empty). You call it, Duckman has done it. But who can blame him for being so thin as the world we live in is so crazy, outrageous and just pointless? Eric Tiberius Duckman (spoken by Manic Jason Alexander) can deliver the entire exhibition, but if he is surrounded by a number of eccentric supporting characters, you know that the trouble is waiting for an explosion everywhere. My favorite must be Willibald Feivel Cornfed (or just Cornfed Pig), Duckman's incredibly deadly man who is seemingly talented and highly skilled in everything and is constantly aware of his partner's infinity and incompetence. <br /> <br /> The typical plot includes some odd incidents that he inevitably threatens or rotates around his very uncertain household, though every time and again Duckman's army-enemy king chicken (Tim Curry), a kind of Professor Moriarty in the form of birds, carries some damn schemes for revenge on bullying at school. <br /> <br /> Since I was a teenager, it has been my absolute favorite animation show, better than the Simpsons, Family Guy and even the Hill of King. Nothing goes beyond that. Never had anything like Duckman ever been like. Satire level, observational humor and writing are so sharp that it is deadly and animation takes place in a unique Klasky / Csupo style (anyone who has seen Rugrati's understanding). It is a wonderful, very imaginative and wild world, and everyone who has noirish knows in the 1940s. <br /> <br /> You will never get too much of this bird.
