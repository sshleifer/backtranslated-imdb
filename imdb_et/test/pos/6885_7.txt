I went to Blockbuster with another friend of friends who decided we were too broken and too lazy to be active. He decided he wanted to look closer, which seemed like a repulsive idea that I had to rent a movie. Looking around, I didn't see much of what I was interested in, but I saw The Doll Master in new releases. Just under the cover sleeve (A woman with a nose-like face that cries tears of blood) thought it would be interesting enough for the rent. The house where all the lights were off was pretty scary. I have to admit that I have always had a little phobia of my dolls (and I watched a horrible movie called Asylum, one of its stories that involved a mental patient who created people who killed people. A flat but scary but frightening time) and its three first quarter hit me on the spot. Especially the first half hour was fantastic. The amazing predictive atmosphere set the scene well, and without moving the dolls it seemed really dangerous. Unfortunately, as soon as they started to move it, I got a little bit, I was a little disappointed when the moments that could really scare me, smiled because they were filmed. <br /> <br /> As characters, this is a horror movie, you don't expect anything memorable. I found that I remember names and faces better than most of the Asian horror films I saw, suggesting that the hidden character development had to be something I did not consciously notice. Typical stereotypes apply in this film, where everyone has a character that differentiates them from other, shy and quiet Yeong-ha and his doll, Damien, to the outgoing bimbo Seon-yeong. <br /> The plot itself was rather cool, although the end that bought many of the plot's loose chains seemed a bit confused and did nothing for me, even though he had a couple of really cool plot-twists that I didn't break here. The main plot is a bunch of kids called dolls of famous old doll producers, they have to stay in a horrible house (decorated with scary dolls, some big little ones) and things are going to happen to our hero Hae-mi to explore rural areas and things are going to happen to other people. <br /> <br /> In general, I would definitely not recommend watching a movie with too many people because some moments are likely to make you laugh when surrounded by friends, but if you look at something too dark because windows and doors open just a bit, just when everyone the dolls are looking at you. This leaves you with the biggest part of the film, allowing you to go into the theories of a wild conspiracy to destroy them later. If you really get in there and ignore this joy in places where I can guarantee, check in bed before going to bed and maybe even leave the lights. Or maybe it's just me: P What's closer, it was OK, but I preferred it.
