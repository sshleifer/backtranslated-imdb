It was one of the few that showed that my wife and I agreed. I was upset to hear that it was canceled, especially since I didn't know the ratings were so bad. As far as I knew it would make a lot of viewers. Almost all of my friends and most of the people I talked to looked at the sample to watch. Now we're left to look at either dirty shows or DVDs. How bad was the show? does anyone know the actual results of exhibitions? I know that when I went on Thursdays, it was harder for me to catch. Thanks for the G * d DVR! Anyway, it was a real surprise to know that there is no "civil war" anymore. If any other network sees it, PLEASE PICK UP SHOW !! PLEASE!
