Contains spoiler <br /> <br /> The film adaptation of Thomas Mann's novel by Luchino Visconti is visually, if not philosophically, faithful to its source (Brittany's opera offers a more faithful reading of the Apollonia / Dionysian struggles that consume an aging writer). This is definitely one of the most beautiful movies ever made. <br /> <br /> The Visconti version has more emphasis on the physical aspects of the story. Venice has never looked more beautiful and appealing, decadent and nervous. If you've read a short story, it's like living out descriptions on its pages. Dirk Bogarde gives a great result as Gustav von Aschenbach. Though he has very little dialogue, he transmits bitter, irritated passion, and ultimately Aschenbach's longing through facial expressions. Young actress Bjorn Andresen, who plays Tadzio, a beautiful object at Aschenbach's request, was completely cast. He also plays with facial expressions and gestures. The character of Tadzio is central to this story, so every actor of this role must be worthy of inspiring passion and desire. Visconti knew exactly what he was doing with his incredible eye for beauty. And by transforming Ashenbach from the writer Gustav Mahler into a composer and then using Mahler's music, especially Adagietto, from the fifth symphony, another great stroke. Although I read the story of Mann in front of the film, Mahler's music and the death of Venice are always inextricably linked to me. Like the movie, haunting images appear, especially the last Ashenbach died on the beach when Tadzio walks into the sea slowly. <br /> <br /> One day, this movie will appear on the DVD Widescreen and its visual splendor, which was completely restored to us.
