Faced with, people - "DK3" is more complex, innovative and smart than its predecessor. The challenge - its levels are a lot of time ridiculously difficult. A particularly difficult level is called "flash viewpoint", during which you can catch the flash at any time. Innovative - it opened many doors. Too bad that SNES died long after this title. And wise - level names range from brand - to - words ("Orangatanga Lake") to wise references that the game 's target audience will not reach for many years ("Bleak's House"). <br /> <br /> What shines most people's criticism of this game is mainly two words: Kiddy Kong. He is a worthy "little friend", the descendant of Diddy Kong, and certainly not worthy of being called a "slowed monkey". "DK3" remains a classic until the end of time.
