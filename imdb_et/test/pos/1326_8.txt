I would just like to point out that in addition to showing that the series is being published on DVD, it does not have to be entertaining. These days, all the news and crimes, the blood and the colors shown in reality are good to have fun characters in a beautiful show. PWOG fits the bill. Was it Emmy material? No, but it was just the same. <br /> <br /> I also have to vote for another story - they were more charismatic than the season's first. Certainly I agree that the first season was more serious than the other two, but the last one was more painful for me. Although the series has been out of the air for years, I never expect it to be released for purchase.
