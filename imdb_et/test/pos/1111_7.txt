John and his wife Emily, accompanied by their child Edward, came to a village in a comfortable neighborhood around the suburb, where his wife spent some of his childhood. There has been death in the family and John has to start the procedure to take over an old seaside house, which is located by the sea and where there is an old man who has apparently committed suicide. the circumstances of death, John separates himself from his family and reality, puts his life at risk and puts the clothes of a dead old man. <br /> <br /> The film is changing now - nothing is what it seems - the people of his past appear fully in Gothic / mountainous glory - his wife is worried about his mental state - and his son disappears from reed. <br /> <br /> John finds the old man not suicidal that his death is much mysterious and strange. In the Final of the Backbone Cooling, we learn that the events of the film have never happened, and the whole narrative was designed by a little boy, Edward, who is fighting for his parents' divorce proceedings. Modern love is a cinema of extremely high art, a mysterious and perverse work full of vague suggestions and unexplored red herring. The current Indie trends, both of which confirm its creators, are also humorous and seemingly unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> However, the weaknesses of this Australian film completely outweigh its muscular cinematic vision, its bloodless, unconscious and uncompromising accuracy and its strange Euro horror. The lack of scripting standards for bastardy and weak dialogue lies in the unimportant background of the noir and leadership that must be seen as valued. <br /> <br /> One of the most aggressive strange Australian films of the years.
