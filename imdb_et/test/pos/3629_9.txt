this is a great movie for the whole family. I don't think many people have seen me asking people and they say they haven't heard of it before. Sophie Heyman is my aunt's sister. my favorite scene is the whole movie I can't even choose for my favorite scene. my favorite character is Hubert because he is a funny but smart dog. if no one has seen it, they will be out of a great adventure. I only saw that my aunt was related to Sophie and she got a copy of her. if anyone reads it i recommend buying a movie and i guaranteed it is not a bad decision. I've seen this movie about five times and every time it gives me the same message, dogs are as smart as people just give them the opportunity.
