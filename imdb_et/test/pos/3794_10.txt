Very few comments I found on Barnens night on the Internet do not do it fairly. I read them all before ordering a DVD, but for some reason I ordered it. I regret it almost immediately, but the order was already gone so I couldn't cancel it. I'm very glad I couldn't. This is an extraordinary film. <br /> <br /> I don't give a plot summary because other reviewers have already done so. But I say I do not understand the comments that it is grim, shocking, weird, clinical, depressing or pornographic. Certainly this is very unusual, which I think may seem strange to some people, but other criticisms must reflect the reviewers' own questions, because I did not see it in the film I was watching. I'm not attracted to boys, so nudity didn't seem to me to be pornographic - it's just a child who tries to find out who doesn't help irresponsible adults in his life. And this is Sweden, not Utah, so topless women are not big. <br /> <br /> What surprised me the most is how positive is the portrayal of this movie about the devil's missing child, who is going through some kind of strange experiences through Odyssey, looking for - and ultimately - himself. It is exciting, thoroughly original and deeply satisfying. <br /> <br /> I'm not surprised at all that Barnens รถ won three big Guldbagge awards, best film, direction and actor, but I'm totally surprised that the actor who won was not Tomas Fryk, a child whose the terrifying power of Reine has to be one of the most remarkable films ever filmed, but in the relatively insignificant role of Ingvar Reklwall Stig, the buggy boy of Reine's mother. I don't understand it at all, but it doesn't change the fact that it's a great movie.
