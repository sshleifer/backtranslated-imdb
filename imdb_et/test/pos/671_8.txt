Caution, My Lovely recently came to TV on BBC2 so I set the video to record it and was happy. <br /> <br /> The man finds a dead woman so that he escapes so he can't get guilty of his murder and becomes a widow, but he doesn't know what he's doing here. It turns out that this man is a psychopath and a possible killer. He starts torturing him and locks him in the basement. He then cuts the phone line so he can't get help from outside. A young boy who does not take regular steps to buy his announcements is not quite right when he leaves his purchase. Finally, the man leaves, acting as if nothing had happened. <br /> <br /> I see why I was warned that My Lovely was given an X certificate when released on cinemas. Some scenes are quite disgusting at this time. I also thought the man was going to do something for the young boy. <br /> <br /> Cast features are excellent Robert Ryan as a psychopath, East Lupino as widow, and Barbara Whiting and Dee Pollock join them as a boy. <br /> <br /> This is certainly Robert Ryan's most freezing power I've seen. Must see. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 out of 5 stars.
