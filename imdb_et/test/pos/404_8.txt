I saw it recently in TCM and through IMDb I found that Seven "Crime Doctor" films were a psychiatrist detective with Warner Baxter. Baxter is a bit long in teeth compared to his solid performance on the 42nd street ten years earlier. Not a noir and a bit of campy today, the film is also a touch of a possible supernatural. The plot, monochrome cinematography and characters are much more complicated than Mr Moto and Charlie Chani. There are several sub-blocks, several unexpected revolutions and performances of the B-film, which we should all recognize immediately (none has made it static). It is wonderfully unpredictable for 70 minutes. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see a DVD series of these movies.
