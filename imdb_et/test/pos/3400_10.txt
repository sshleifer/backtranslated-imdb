I had always heard of this great mini-series, but I was watching it for the first time this July, 2007. I see why he started a career with so many young participants. The story is intriguing and provides an excellent overview of the time before and after the civil war. I care about the characters and their lives during this time. Some of them were stereotypes, but they still helped me see how people think in the 1800s. Many historical facts were thrown down and it was interesting to see that history books come to life. Costumes and kits were proud! I enjoyed watching both Part I and Part II thoroughly. Part III is disappointing.
