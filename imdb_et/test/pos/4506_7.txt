The guilt and redemption are the two main elements of emotion and heavy, powerful dramas that Oscars love so much (which is funny because "The Kite Runner" was only nominated for the best starting point - the lack of candidates was perhaps unfair). While most of the book's customizations (or some other means) are usually worse than their literary counterparts (and the "Kite Runner" is no exception), Marc Forster's movie is good. <br /> <br /> Most people are familiar with this story, the book has been read by millions, so I'm not going to the plot, except to say that the book remains true to the source. If you don't know the plot, watch the movie or better, read the book. <br /> <br /> The best thing Kite Runner has done (except for his story) is director Marc Forster. Forster is an epic expanse and a unique vision that is perfectly used to bring Khaled Hossein's book to the screen. A small part of me was concerned that he was using the same dreamy images contained in the Forster's earlier features, "Findland Neverland." Don't do it wrong, "Finding Neverland" is a great movie, one of my favorites, but the visual trick he used there is not here. Fortunately, Forster understands this, and his direction shine shows his versatility. The absence of the best director for his work here is not exactly travesty, but I see him along the road with several statuettes. <br /> <br /> Also noteworthy is the scenario customization. It remains loyal to the source, but it leaves room for interpreting the material for Forster's vision. The dialogue is not puzzled. with Forster's direction moving at a solid pace. Like the Forster, the time of recognition of the scenario during the prizes was not an annoyance, but I would not have filed a complaint if it was at least nominated. <br /> <br /> The line between this movie is big and big. Most of the performances are strong, but there are some that do not cut it, and it hurts the movie. The most remarkable weak force is Zekeria Ebrahim, who plays young Amir. It's not that it's bad, it's just that it's not as effective as possible. He just can't translate the guilt of Amir into the audience. In fact, I think I can be a little lost at the moment when I wouldn't have read this book. He looks terrible and sometimes annoyed, but we don't know our emotions. It is a difficult part to imagine, and most of the young Ebrahimi owns what is particularly surprising because it is his first film role. <br /> <br /> The best performances are Khalid Abdalla, who plays adult Amir and Shaun Toub, who plays wise Rahim Kahn. Abdalla may not be a well-known name (although he was "United 93" by Paul Greengrass), but his work here is amazing. She is a quiet, modest man and feels perfect when needed. A less capable actor could have made Rahim Khan a cliché, but Shaun Toub uses enough nuances in his performance to ensure that he creates what the clichés are trying to imagine. <br /> <br /> Forgive me when I go here, but that's something I have to deal with and it's a PG-13 movie rating. The fact that this movie got such a low rating is outrageous. This is not justified. Some might argue that the rating was bent because everyone has to see it, such as "Saving Private Ryan", some say it should have given the rating given to NC-17. However, this exception cannot be used here. The only purpose the scene serves is to tell the story. Forster (probably from the producers) tried so hard when he could announce the most painful and annoying scene of the movie to hide the PG-13 rating, but the subject matter is too troublesome to be portrayed in some way and get less than the R-rating , regardless of whether "tasty" can be imagined. Worse still, this editing repels the scene a lot of its power and trying to get it less distracted to get a lower rating is offensive. In addition, some scenes of violence are also very disturbing. As for how many of these scenes are taken from the movie, it doesn't add much, but is at least worth the R-rating. The MPAA, which has always been corrupt in the film evaluation system, has fallen to a new low level, giving this film such a low rating. <br /> <br /> But the movie shouldn't be blamed for it. The film is a solid film that is well worth it, especially if they are fans of the book.
