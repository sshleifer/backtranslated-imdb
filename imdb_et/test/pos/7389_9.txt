I saw Dark Harbor at '98 at Seattle Film Festival. Filming against the fall of Maine in the background, this film is a great cast and a plot that keeps you guessing all over. Sometimes I have to be scary, sometimes funny, to say that he stayed with me a few days later to see it. Rickman and Walker are wonderful, because icy marriages and Friday are someone you hear more, I'm sure. The look of the wrapping, abandoned road in the low light (and the associated score) put the tone so well - just terrible. Nice, nice work by the new father / scriptwriter and his talented teams.
