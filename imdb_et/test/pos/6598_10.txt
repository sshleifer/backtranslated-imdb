I have to say that this must be the best documentary I've ever seen in my life. I'll first tell my friends' house movie and didn't get the chance to watch it. Since then, I spent my free time finding a movie. I never found it, but on my birthday, my friend, who knew I had the hardest time to find a movie, got it for me. Sean Penn does a great job of documentary narration. I loved the way he talked about the history of Z-Boys and Dogtown. I've been to Venice and the surrounding area several times and have never known what happened until I saw a documentary. I didn't get the chance to see the actual movie, and I heard that it wasn't close to what the documentary was. I don't know if I really want to see the movie, but who knows.
