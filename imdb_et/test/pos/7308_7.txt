Norma had spent most of the 20s playing beautiful things, but her first speaker put her "Brassy Showgirl" on "Mary Dugan trial" and she came out with flying colors. Since then, his sweet and lovely places have been left aside and in his shaggy parts that made him a challenging woman in the world or as a girl of social excitement. "Let Us Be Gay" was done earlier, but was released after "The Divorcée" and was unusual for the twist of the upper bark that Shearer himself did. <br /> <br /> Norma first appears without make-up when frumpish Kitty Brown, who is the main goal in life, is a raft on her very inappropriate wife Bob (Rod La Rocque). He's quick to get to his golf game - but he really sees his lover. When female bitch Helen arrives home to show, Kitty faces a situation, but behind closed doors she has mass emotions and Bob leaves good. <br /> <br /> Three years later, Mrs Courtland Brown (Kitty) arrives as a guest at the eccentric Mrs. Bouccicoult ("Bouccy") (Marie Dressler). Kitty is now dropping out and "Bouccy" is her job. She wants Kitty to romanticize the guests of the house, who in turn romance her big daughter Diane (beautiful Sally Eilers). Shock! Horror! - man is none other than Bob, his former wife !!! Kitty continues to meet with sophistication and wisely repartee - "It seems that this person has something strange acquaintance" !!! - And no one is wiser. <br /> <br /> The film then lives in one of these early "talkies", boring "bedside" comedies. Kitty tells the story to all men and Bob is desperate to start again. She has a strong role in this film - men are just dolls. Raymond Hackett seems to be in the movie as an additional carrier - "give me a cushion", "get me a drink", "move this chair" instead of Diane's harassing fiancée. Norma Shearer is, of course, the whole show, Marie Dressler adds "Bouccy" to her eccentric image list and Sally Eilers is a real outstanding as a great Diane.
