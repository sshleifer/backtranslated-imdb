This movie was well done. It covers the hardships of a returning Vietnamese veteran in dealing with the horror of war. Unfortunately, the writers decided to focus on Vet, who had been involved in cruelty. I was in Vietnam and only once heard about a work that saw it. The offender was convicted and sentenced for years in Leavenworth. <br /> <br /> The notion that only wildlife veterinarians had emotional problems is a punishment for everyone who served. All the soldiers I personally felt or knew for word of mouth were honorable soldiers who even respected the enemy and believed they were there to stop the spread of communism. The biggest problem was at home to find out that many Americans were against the war. This was the reason why many veterans felt they were attending less than honored. Not the way they served. <br /> <br /> At the end, a father who acted more than a warlike bully as a loving, caring father. Because I gave him 10 out of 10. If the end were allowed to a certain extent, it could have been assessed by 9. <br /> <br /> Most decent men come from guilt and emotional scars. They need acceptance and understanding to overcome it. I pray that the public will better understand our modern veterans than it was in the Vietnamese era.
