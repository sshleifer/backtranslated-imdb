This movie is sweet - not tempting, just warm and cute. I found that it was just a little funny, and the assumption * is * wildly unlikely, but the characters are so charming (especially the Minnie leader) that they had paid full attention from my very beginning and soon my affection. <br /> <br /> Bonnie Hunt has done a good job in her debut debut and has written a good job. I recommend this movie very well and see it again, I'm sure.
