Mountainous forests, young happy campers, warning of park ranger and lurking figure. The ingredients are there for the joy of horror, and director / co-author Jeff Lieberman does enough work to achieve this. This is a formidable horror of forest land, but mostly it is at the beginning of the game and the story (which is quite common in the truncated sense) is actually realistic. Maybe there would be little more exposure, but the Lieberman finishes the material shortcomings and typical details that arise with the rising tension, the moody visuals, and the smothering atmosphere created by Brad Fiedel's very malicious long-term result. Whenever this very horrible exclamation began, he painted a truly convincing way of thinking that was on a beautiful background. Cinematographers Dean M. and Joel King are also doing a striking job. There's plenty of style, even with minimal scope, and the buildup is slow. Sometimes the momentum can become stop-and-go. It is not particularly violent, but there is still a clear center line, even if some of them happen on the screen. The latest chasing scenes and increasing fear are well done because he has the darkness that is alive when it is with the acute killers and you get the actor George Kennedy, who is driving his white horse lightly but wonderfully. Have a pleasant set of productions; Deborah Benson makes a strong and embarrassing heroine. Gregg Henry, Chris Lemmon, Ralph Seymour, Jamie Rose, Mike Kellin, and Katie Powell round off a modest incredible supply. The final climax is quite twisted, but the end is one of those types that leave you thinking? "Is that all?" A well-etched back side that is likely to play a bit too safely to really deviate from the norm.
