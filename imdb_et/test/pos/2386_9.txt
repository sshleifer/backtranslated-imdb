I've seen some Fred Carpenter movies on Showtime, Pay Per View and video / DVDs, and I enjoyed most of these movies, especially some beer, (Carpenter knows how to entertain) "EDDIE MONROE" and "MURDERED INNOCENCE" are my favorites. Recently, I watched "EDDIE MONROE" Promo DVD and everything from cast style and control all worked smoothly. (The price of Doug Brown's music was sensational.) I liked to see Frank Sivero ("Goodfellas", "New York, New York" and "Wedding Singer"), he is an amazing and very underrated actress. Paul Vario, who played Uncle Byden, looked at the IMDb with his actors and I found it to be his first major role. Where has this man been! Give Fred Carpenter a credit to discover a new new talent, it's just a matter of time when you see this guy with Pacino and DeNiro. As I mentioned, Carpenter knows how to organize entertainment, and if working with a limited budget is amazing, what Carpenter can produce (I read the VENT MAGAZINE interview and Carpenter never made more than $ 400,000.00 in the movie.) Before I watched "EDDIE MONROE" I saw "Rocky Balboa and The Good Shepherd are both great films. "Eddie Monroe" took me to the end of the race with a very good script, good productions (Craig Morris is a movie star that is waiting for the event and the leading actor Jessica Tsunis was hot!) Great cinema, direction and Doug Brown music scores. As I said, I recently saw "Rocky Balboa" and "The Good Shepherd" when I write a comment on the two films I would say about the same things I said about "EDDIE MONROE". two very good films don't have a "Eddie Monroe", they didn't cost a couple of hundred. Great movie and I don't even drink beer.
