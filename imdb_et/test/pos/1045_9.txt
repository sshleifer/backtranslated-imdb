Barbara Stanwyck probably didn't think about it, but it's a relief to see her become a dark haircut (if it wasn't a wig) than what she had to wear in "Double Indemnity" a year earlier. This film, even though the premiere of "film noir" and the all-encompassing big movie, gave it a big role, but oh, it's hair. Here she is chic and certainly not femme deadly, but she is definitely a 40 year old woman. He's used to living without men, because most of them are left behind in war, and as successful Martha Stewart as a columnist, he writes in a home column where he describes his homeland as pans for what it really is. We'll meet his boss, Sydney Greenstreet, who has no idea he's going to lie, and when he gets away from Christmas in his presumed Connecticut home, he'll have to find his wife (Reginald Gardiner) and baby before we can say "Jingle Bells." Hungarian Chef S.Z. Sakall is going to help and reach the cutsey pie one by one with Irish Una O'Connor. "It's not goulash, it's Irish pea." The zigzag just takes the peppers, pours most of it and says, "Now it's goulash", making it ready for lunch. Then, when it comes to flapjack, it slips and shakes. For years, some of my friends have been using it and I have this line every time pancakes come into the conversation. "I will not turn. He will not let Greenstreet even say," I have never turned my life. "O'Connor can get nerves when he's driving more and more in some movies, but here he is joyfully loving and linking with Sakall it is very charming. <br /> <br /> In the novel, it is obvious that Reginald Gardiner is not Barbara Stanwyck's teapot, especially when she meets a beautiful Dennis Morgan, who is a bit of a pleasure in eating a soap, causing Stanwyck a little anxious. He should suspect something instantly, but no, but it doesn't matter, the film is so charming that the snow-filled area, plenty of rocking chairs and their dogs running in New York after 25 years in Los Angeles, a small town in the west of New York. When Central Park is beautiful after the first snow and the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree is also exsquisit, there is something that looks at the snow-covered field and try b occasionally look at deer, rabbits or other nature. <br /> <br /> This is a great vacation movie that can bring out the Christmas season out of the season and make a great match with Barbara Stanwycki's state of the art "Remember the Night", an underrated pearl. Add Christmas to the "Meet John Doe" metropolis, and you may have found one of the most lively stars on holiday movies.
