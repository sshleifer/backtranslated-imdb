Uzumaki (this is the Japanese "spiral" or "vortex") is one of the most absurd films I've ever watched. The city becomes obsessed and then the vortex pattern spins in very grotesque ways. Hands are cut off, people make suicide in washing machines ... just a wild and crazy Japanese horror. Maybe as psychologically damaging as the "Ring". In general, it is not as scary as "Eye", but the images in it are more sick than most things "Eye". And not as funny as "Unsold story" ... but that doesn't mean there's no right blood and chopping. Seriously, if you enjoy horror films and especially the Asian horror, you must add this movie to your list. Some parts are a bit strange with sound effects (the story is adapted to the manga comic and it shows), but it really fits. Unlike some movies that try to get too hard to capture the original source ("dead house"). The most original film you see ... not only this year, but probably ever. Recommended!
