You're alone - it's a pretty, almost gentle film, smart, passionately written, with two complicated and riveting performances, and an end to the end that nobody sees, but wants to see the movie a second time and come up with all the clues you read wrong. <br /> <br /> A story about a high school girl who is drowning in her depression and discomfort, working a few hours a week as a $ 500 hour schoolgirl attendant. and a depressive neighbor who discovers her secret and hires her in the afternoon, in the middle of New Haven Hotel, offers both Jessica Bohl and her breathtaking performances and Richard Brundage as neighbors. <br /> <br /> Bohl as Daphne gives a breakthrough in parallel with Maggie Gyllenhal. He strikes a teenager to grow his skin, and when he always talks about being under control, you begin to realize that he is not under control, but threatens to go deep into what I think he does. <br /> <br /> Brundage when Buddy is depressed, angry, heart-beaten, human shell. But the amazing conclusion of the film is that you understand your full understanding of pain. <br /> <br /> After a very short opening segment that captures most of the independent film students and has religious exits, we bring the hotel room. At first, you are not sure about these people or the style of filmmaking. Shaky, annoying ... like characters. Until you understand your back attack, he spoke of brief feedback. They are a controversial reason and also a camera. But when they open, like the story disappears, the camera. And I don't know, for 20 minutes, give or take, you will find yourself impossible to keep your eyes off the screen. <br /> <br /> Having just seen the world premiere of the Brooklyn Film Festival - - when the director asked the audience if anyone expected an end and not one person answered yes? I almost want the movie to be on video so I can watch it again. Now that I was thinking of some film conversation, especially a very frank dialogue about fantasy and climax, I thought things were going in a very different direction. But I understand that so much of their conversation meant something completely different than I imagined. I have to see it again !!! But like dark and sexual as much as to speak, it is blunt or said that I'm laughing more than I can expect to have some of my courage that will definitely fall into "things we think, but they don't have the courage to say a loud category. it is very blunt, especially if you realize that it has a completely different meaning. Some of it makes you uncomfortable, especially if you look at you with your partner alone. You definitely have something to talk about? probably claim? later. Maybe it should be Music is amazing I would have come home and bought a soundtrack from my favorite music store if I could have it The film looks as good as anything made on the film After the screening director Gorman Bechard was asked what process did he do He used it to get digital material so good His answer was: They could not afford it. <br /> <br /> I have to give Bechard credit, I'm his two short parties, The Pretty Girl and M irror objects, a big fan, but even they couldn't prepare me for the complexity and surprises of this movie. <br /> <br /> For everyone involved: bravo.
