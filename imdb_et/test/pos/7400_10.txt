It's better than the first one. The film will be opened by Sheriff Sam. Then Sam and Anne offer their bags and go to Tropicana until Jack's tags pass. slips, ice crashes, head blows, drowning, pendants, lobsters in the faces, split throat, dead snowballs, arms crashed, thawed with anti-freezing waste, butterflies around the neck, pots and pans face down, bite fingers, ice burners by mouth, bite on the neck, explosive people, roasted snowballs and mixers. <br /> <br /> Snowballs are fun, they put it in the blender and turn it on, it says it was fun and put them in a snack and it burns. <br /> <br /> It's just a great movie. Then they start thinking about other ways to kill it, and the snowball answers, "it's not nice" <br /> <br /> It was worth it when it took ten bucks to buy. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 stars.
