I had never heard of this movie and just got it because I'm a fan of Martin Sheen. Now I'm stunned why he didn't get the praise and appreciation he really deserves. These four characters make you feel like it, your father is trying to confirm your authority, your mother still adheres to traditional family values, and both try to keep their manifestations, despite their family's complete fragmentation, of a daughter who wants her life and son. haunted his experiences in vietnam. One felt that this was a scenario to be played in thousands of "normal" families after Vietnam. Emilio Estevez, as Jeremy was great, was his war experience that none of his family had. The screen chemistry between him and his real father, Martin Sheen, was amazing. And there were times when Emilio's embarrassing face was like Martin's "Apocalypse Now". I'm sure, as Martin has read Apocalype as one of his best films, Emilio reads it as one of his best. The gun scene was absolutely delightful because all the emotions were in the face of the family. Brilliant is operated by Estevez, Sheen and Kathy Bates. I was watching the movie for the first time last night - and today the main story of the news was a veteran of the Gulf War, who had had several members of his family. How many more young men are being destroyed by war?
