We just looked at the last series shown on the SBS network and leave the weekly Danish Delight dose. My wife and I took the show after finishing the Swedish show "The Eagle" and when comparing it, it seemed to be a very poor substitute for our then favorite show on television. But in the week, it showed that the show grew to me and although it is not as glossy as the Swedish show and definitely a grittier for daily crime investigations, it certainly provided a very satisfying weekly meal. <br /> <br /> Before these two examples, I really haven't been a fan of the police genre and can't say I am, but 2 Scandinavian exhibitions really offered us the lives of these northern European countries through their special eyes. police units.
