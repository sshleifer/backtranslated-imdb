George Saunders is a fake who steals a copy of a rare Hamlet, killing a process guard. A month later, his companion sells the counterfeit book for large sums of money. One of the fakes is sold to a Nazi worker. It is not happy that the Nazi front man has reclaimed his money, while another researcher working with disappointed clients is also appearing. In the midst of a woman trying to keep her safe, she starts to play against each other and creates a meeting in New York's public library between different parties, but when people die, the library is locked and murders (and maybe there are some rare book thefts). The mystery of a complicated murder is a good little thriller with great pain (Richard Denning joined Saunders and solid strong players) If the mistake is, the film is almost complicated when the plots are plots and everything is pretty much for yourself. The layers of intrigue of theft, counterfeiting, murder and war (that was 1942) are almost too much for a short 70-minute ride. Still, this enjoyable little movie with darkness and inevitable condemnation is a character that clearly denotes it as the first movie pointer. Until Denning shows that we are among some charming thieves we want, perhaps even more than a hero, but it is clear from its word and deeds that it does not have a completely happy end and they know it even when they fight. A good little movie to look for.
