There is a version of "Nevsky", which is shown by a lively symphony orchestra, choir, soloist and film. If this EVER happens during the day, you'll see that "Nevsky" did it. Oklahoma City Philharmonic did it a few years ago with the OKC Canterbury Choir (one of the best somewhere). I think I cried all over, it was one of my emotionally powerful movie experiences. I'm listening to "Nevsky" now, and it tears me still. There are movies I love, and the classical music I love, but there's no combination I think it has almost "Nevski" effect in real time.
