This movie is funny and sad that I think it's true. If you love Office space, you love this movie because it's another Mike judge, but it's not like Office Space. I told everyone to see this movie. I just want it to be more in theaters so it deserves this recognition. I love this movie and I would like to see Mike more than the judge. Luke Wilson is also what makes this movie what it is. I'm so glad I didn't live in 2505 because if this movie turns out to be real, we've all worked hard. I hope more people see this movie because I know it will fall in love.
