It is a soap opera based on the idea of ​​applied ethics. The film's human suffering and death may not be a good film. I did not get any emotion from it, ideas are not new, there are no tensions, it becomes annoying in the other half, but in the end I think it becomes quite interesting on the Burlesque route. I mean you have this middle-aged, paralyzed bald man who gets more women than Don Juan. He does not seem to have suffered as much as you would expect someone who has been completely paralyzed for over 28 years, he has no problems with God (and probably is waiting for it), the people around him seem to be perfect slaves (I don't get out of my mind Bergman crying and whips that resemble many aspects that simply break with emotions and not everything that is humane) and so on. This movie is the perfect recipe for a housewife looking for emotional excitement but don't wait for it to blow. The film is worth seeing from all the cynics of today, which it wishes to present with its sincere intention to present a modern ethical question without wishing to awaken the viewer. Amenabar does not rub your face and he does not take the coil, he does not want us to fan for a particular idea. However, I have no idea why this film was so highly appreciated.
