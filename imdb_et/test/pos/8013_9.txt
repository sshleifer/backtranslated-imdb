After watching the movie, I experienced a new feeling. I watched a film in which the leading actor was performing, almost rivaling Chevy Chase "Fletch". This does not mean that the performances are comparable, but both give practically their lines. This actor is Marc Singer! The singer is Jack Ford, titled "Droid Gunner", grinding out the collection of life from android. There are some mutants, topless droids (!), Scandinavian smugglers and perhaps a half-hearted attempt to make a statement of class or even globalization, or ......... well that's not really important. For this movie, it is important how the singer performs his own lines, resulting in side-pounding humor! For this film, it is important that director Fred Olen Ray seems to understand that serious sci-fi works very rarely, and if your budget is dirty, it is better not to take yourself seriously. I have told Ray that all the participants in this movie were very fun and they are wearing the film. I dare to criticize a film that allows myself to portray futuristic Earth forever in a dark and neon light, and then ends with a â€œwarehouse in pipes and valves. Self parody is a very redeeming quality. In conclusion, Fred My Ray is Ambassador of Independent Filming and Marc Singer is the perfect B-film leader. If only Ray I could draw in Tim Thomerson's equation, we would have a movie.
