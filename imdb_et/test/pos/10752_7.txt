For those looking for mad tricks that characterized Harold Lloyd's silent comedy, it's not a movie for you. What is Cat-Paw gave us an interesting and atypical character for Lloyd, who tried to set himself up. <br /> <br /> For me, the closest comparison to a movie is Lloyd's Peter Sellers. For all of Lloyd's education available to the world, he may have grown up when the sellers were. <br /> <br /> But as he grew up, he was a missionary child in China, and I don't know how much he and his family's Christianity taught Chinese, but young Harold has learned the wisdom of Lin Po, a Chinese philosopher. whom he constantly quotes fortunately for cookie aphorism. As it turns out, Lin Po turns out to be one smart guy. <br /> <br /> In any case, Lloyd's father, Samuel S. Hinds, has decided that his son needs education in the 20th century American modern world and he will send him back to be a home pastor of the church who supports the mission. The pastor is a multi-year candidate for the movement of the "reform" of the city of Stockport. But not before Lloyd arrives and the pastor dies. <br /> <br /> Now the reform movement is shameful and the pastor is a patsy of political bosses who need the opposite in every election. They decide that Lloyd may just be a better patsy than the one who just died. <br /> <br /> Of course, if it goes into such movies, patsy isn't that easy. In fact, Lloyd constantly quotes Lin Po, the way Charlie Chan gave out wisdom, proving Stockport against leading attacks. In addition, Lloyd Una Merkel achieves admiration because a cynical dame, like Jean Arthur, was Mr. Deeds and Mr. Smith. The cat's strap is still a nice political satire, although she did not create Harold Lloyd as such a comedy as she was in silent films. Nice players were chosen by director Sam Taylor, who was preceded by George Barbier, who plays a political boss who discovers Lloyd and proves that he has honesty in him.
