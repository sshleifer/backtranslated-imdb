This is certainly one of the best Western films produced in the new millennium. It is a tribute to all the stars of Western Western classics and it is the ultimate revival of Western film. The story of two brothers who meet after the war between countries and come to different sides of the law is not yet new, but interesting, and the shootouts and atmosphere are great. There are some graphical violence, like bad guys, who are going to break up when the ax or women are dropped off with cold blood, and Lee Majors is not involved until the end, so I gave him 10 out of 10 points. But it's still one of the best new western productions I've ever seen. I have had the honor and pleasure to meet Chris McIntyre at the Western Festival and have a nice conversation with him, and I have had the opportunity to meet Buck Taylor, who plays the role of urban physician. In my opinion, we should be very committed to Chris McIntyre for his efforts to collect the many stars of Western TV and SASS around him in order to do so in such a new West. Chris also has a great ability to choose the right actors for the main characters. Both are young and promising, and I think we need to see them more in future Western productions. I enjoyed this Western movie sincerely - it was worth every minute. I hope that Chris McIntyre will continue to work on other Western films and will present us with some major productions like this. Great job, Chris! Jasper P. Morgan (Pete)
