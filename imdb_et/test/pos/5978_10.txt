Having seen this, I find it hard to believe that it is not better known. This and somewhat better known but almost disgracefully ignored COME AND SEE (Klimov, 1986) must be the two biggest war films. They are meaningful, powerful, sharp. ASCENT is also a talented but scanty but brilliant Schnittke score.
