To begin with, I would just like to say that I can only hope that the creators of this film and his film The Intruder (directed by the great unheralded stylist, Jopi Burnama) know in their hearts how much joy they are with me and my friends in Jarrow in the north of sleep. <br /> <br /> A sequence of pre-credit credits that can be pulled so little, even though it includes a man who falls through a motorcycle window, a silent destruction lab, one at the same time annoying annoying and anemic malefactors in movie history and costume design, what Jean Paul Gautier found in Ott and garish. Don't be mistaken; this is a truly unique experience. Early Highlighting - an explosion (used to it, much more from where it came!), Followed by our plump heroine and the lively memory of the word "father" the most fun line. And then ... the theme song ... <br /> <br /> Yes, it deserves your paragraph. By the people singing by AJ who really want to remain anonymous, this is similar to the songs written for Rocky movies, Schubert. This is the narcissism of the 80-hero hero's motivation all the time at the highest level: selective words like "his only me and you, putting it on the wire" and a lot of talk about having to "cross the border" (this makes sense) - our hero cares little bona fida from police work). Not to mention the Indonesian superpowers who are attractively attracted by the title of the film. At this point, there is no impulse for anyone who wants to turn off officially. <br /> <br /> Our hero is semitist Peter Goldson (Intruder star Peter O'Brien), titled "Stabilizer". A man's bull in the Chinese shop approach to fighting crime, and especially his less than inconspicuous secret work, leaves much to be desired, but he is undoubtedly a fun tutor through downtown Jakarta, where it is local to capture the ball-captain Captain Johnny Peter's own waste from space partner fashion crime Sylvia Nash, who does little . So much highlighted, so little time - Peter's "surprise" arrogance has not been too convincingly argued against leader Greg Rainmaker. well ...), x stands for the stupidity of the on-site location, our hero Tina Probosti's shocking advantage at the time of his weakness, the latter turning an aching operation dressed as a member of a particularly amazing dance member. And believe me that it hardly covers it. <br /> <br /> There wasn't even a time to go to the plot that surrounds the drug discovery system and the kidnapped professor, who is alarming but praised by national pride. Or our hero turns to a funeral dressed like Boogie Nights. Or absolutely hysterical craicus between Captain Johnny and Goldson - two men have never made a girlfriend shticki harder than these clowns. The plaster, in my opinion, was too thin. <br /> <br /> Ah, when he throws people off, and you never thought that deliberate destruction and general chaos could be so incredibly boring, but interacting with the characters, the dialogue is truly priceless and incompetence at the show is somehow loving . Oh and shoes people - watch out for shoes!
