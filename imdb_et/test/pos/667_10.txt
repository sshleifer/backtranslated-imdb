Who hasn't put this review as a "bad taste" is not all right there ... its so funny, genius and fantastic that you can see until the eyes are square! not to mention the rest of the work he has done in the rest of the series ... everything is as good as Morris standards. if you think it is "terrible", "unpleasant" or "ill" then I can only think of one thing to say to you: "go to hell." thanks. it had to be said! I think so many people who complained were completely joking ... I would like to call on all the people who actually did it: "Do you have anything better to do with your time? What are you trying to prove?" Thank you for reading my a full review of the heart ... joy
