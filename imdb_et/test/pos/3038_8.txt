This movie is part of the time it was made ..... Realistic. Films were not covered with candies in the late 60s and early 70s. Manufacturers did not try to create a happy ending that was not. Lack of a happy ending would create an audience of peace of mind that will hopefully inspire them to act. At least it seemed at that time. In today's world of film this film is unlikely to be made. Surely this would not be the end, though realistic. The sad fact is that the film depicted a situation that could not be improved by the improvement of the relationship between traditional thinking and progressive movements of that time without action.
