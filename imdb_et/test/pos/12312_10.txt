It's really the only way to see the magic of James Joyce's writing. His novels are inappropriate (in any sense) and this is the only long story he wrote. It was John Huston's last film and did not reach the screen until he was dead, and it is easy to see his size touch. The dead is poetic in the approach of the screen, which speaks more about Ireland than any modern movie about IRA and "worries" could ever hope to tell us. Hopefully more people will watch this movie and experience the best of both John Huston and James Joyce, and maybe they will visit this story in their local bookstore (and discover that this is probably the biggest story on paper).
