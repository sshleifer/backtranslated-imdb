I just watched this movie because I didn't want to leave my 9-year-old and his friend at the theater. Honestly, I was waiting for a good sunset - but I found myself in the movie. I recommend it to anyone who asks! Roy's mother was one of my favorite TVs of all time years ago, playing Mermaid (Maximum Bob). She was very cute in this movie. The three main characters were all great young actors. Jimmy Buffet also liked seeing and hearing. The film itself was pretty beautiful - introducing some of Florida so big. I'm glad I came to this movie. And I thought I was disappointed that I couldn't see them "Stick It" - I think it was much better!
