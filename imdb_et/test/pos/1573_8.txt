Dean Bell, a writer-director, offered many surprises and interesting moments on this modest but compelling journey. His dialogue was horrible and the use of his very short setback was particularly effective in the film's narrative structure. <br /> <br /> At the heart of the film is Alice's character, who runs her new England after a desperate quest for Florida. On the way, he travels with the eccentric pair Bill and Sandra, who are incredibly trying to groom Alice as a prostitute who earns money at truck stops. <br /> <br /> As a novice who plays the role of her first screen, Emily Grace as Alice is sensational. There are no false messages in his character choices. But the film is worth looking at Sandra's strange but sensitive character, masterfully created by Judith Ivey. The particularly subtle subtext is almost every moment Ivey is on the camera. As a spectator, I found myself looking at the suspension of the tape, the rebound of the stroke and the review of my scenes to try to differentiate psychological nuances. <br /> <br /> The film raises the following question about the characters: Are Bill and Sandra good Samaritans, or are they some evil pair of dichotomous predators attacking the youthful Alice? One of the strengths of the film is that he does not quite answer this question. Alice seems more confident when she started with Bill and Sandra experiences. But is he really a better person? <br /> <br /> Partially comedy, part of the road image and part of the age drama, this carefully crafted film succeeds in engaging us at many levels.
