I'm not a filmmaker, but I know it's hard to tell and drive people in seven short minutes. I think a good movie is what you don't want to stop. Eric did a great job of developing a microbial career and making him "human." Loved the microbial music and voice. I look forward to seeing what Eric has preserved for us in future movies. This is one movie I didn't want to see. Great work.
