For me, Tempest and its characters (what I mean to admire) are like old friends. Ever since I first started to play through classrooms (playing Ferdinand), I immediately found that I got into a fantastic world created by Shakespeare. I can clearly recall that one student decides not to play Ferdinand, and so I took the stage and was honored to play against excellent Miranda. <br /> <br /> One of the great friends is that you can't feel them completely - there is always something you can discover about your character. Quality Tempest movie production is like visiting an old friend, dear to the heart: every visit presents a new perspective of memory. In Prospero's books, the ritual and its elegance, the artistic glory of art were emphasized. Here we see a vision of esoteric mysticism, loved crafted interiors filled with candles and critique on the floors, more like Aleister Crowley than the Neapolitan nobleman. It made me think again - why was Prospero poured out of Naples? His magical power in this production is so sensitive that it makes one wonder whether it was just a policy that understood Prospero's exile, but rather his difference with his peers. So he suffered in the real world. Was cast out, unable to change the wrong way. All the runners in this game, whether they understand it or not, act according to the world's more painless hell - it is always in the interest of the oppressor to make life on earth closer to hell. But Prospero is able to bring these terrestrial crooks to its island, where he has (absolute) dominance. <br /> <br /> Shakespeare brings his audience to a theater where Shakespeare dictates events, words, results. Shakespeare is, of course, Prospero - but what this film adaptation really respects is that Prospero is such a reasonable indicator, despite the fact that it is surrounded by what society calls irrational (astrological texts, alchemical symbols, magical diagrams, etc.). Is it more appropriate to be a man and a murder or to be heresy and work to correct lies? Prospero is a heretic because he gives up his magic not because books lose their value in Naples, but because they are no longer necessary - the world itself - has become the magic of books. <br /> <br Hamlet presents Hamlet to his peers. Playing blames your companions for conspiracy for others for your progress. The reaction of the audience changes: although Ophelia is overwhelmed, Claudius reacts with stunned shock. It happens in the game and then Shakespeare has this game for men of his time. Did Shakespeare monitor their reactions? In the affliction, Prospero lives the game he is building, and we live with him. How do we respond? Are you just reacting happily to a happy ending? Are you upset and shocked by the oddity of production that is perfectly suited to the source material? Do you feel sad that this little life, a game, has been rounded asleep as a passing, because it is eternal? The tragedy is that Shakespeare creates the life of mankind on Earth as a paradise for reason and hope, but man is weak and does not want little power for power struggles. We have Claudius. <br /> <br /> Like a good friend, this movie is not without its mistakes. I do not agree with the option to paint some scenes completely in blue. The dance of sailors is quite tangential. But in the heart it is really Tempest and one of its many faces.
