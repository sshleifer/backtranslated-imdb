I don't easily cry over the movies, but I have to admit that it brought me to tears. Although I'm not a fan of Mrs Streep, her performance was great. The title defines the phrase that mother's love is. For the first hour, I didn't like any of the characters, but it changed when the movie went. The film also explained why certain marriages last, although there are obstacles. Must see a movie.
