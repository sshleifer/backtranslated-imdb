"Father Hood" is a "spectacular" little spectacular pearl. Great performances by Halle Berry, Sabina Lloyd and Brian Bonsall, Diane Ladd and Michael Ironside's two really fun "over-tops", <br /> <br /> and one of the most outstanding Patrick Swayze. The film has been helped by an unusual story, but it has been badly broken by the setback that results in a formative, sudden end. "Father Hood" would have worked much better without their "bookends". Nevertheless, the film raises important questions about the consequences of "family responsibilities" and state interference. As long as the benefit system is paid by state institutions that do not allow children, such violations exist. <br /> <br /> Pick it up. It is worth to "drive".
