The best years of our lives are often compared to wonderful life. They should never be. Their only compatibility is the desire to make a serious comment on the war that lived millions of lives. It's hard to know what the value of an individual's life can be. (How many people know that 1/22 people have been violently lost in the last century? What statistics do we have to live with.) Our feelings about war have also changed over the last 60 years. We have gradually changed from thinking that war is just when the enemy is right to believe that war is not entirely fair, especially those that have been in the fight recently. . I'm against the whole war. Not long ago, I had tested this position. It happened while I was in USS Lexington, permanently anchored to Texas, Corpus Christi. The ship needed a crew that is 3 or 4 times in the community where I live. This is a powerful experience that moves on his deck. He had seen great action. Someone gave me the right to be pacifist and it wasn't bought cheaply. <br /> <br /> I can't watch the best years of our life without thinking of things like Lexington. <br /> <br /> Each of the three veterans paid their fees. And they also paid the mine. <br /> <br /> None of them escaped more easily than any other. The Navy, the Air Force and the Army paid equally, though differently. Each had problems directly related to war. And everyone had to work very hard to overcome these difficulties. There was more courage in their civilian circles than in dealing with war because everyone had to do it themselves. Everyone could understand and sympathize with other problems: finally, no one could help. <br /> <br /> The moving part of the movie (this may be the beginning of the spoiler) is what happens when one of the male leaders found someone who knew enough. The obvious case is when Derry told her to marry her. Don't be afraid, do it tomorrow. It is hard for Harold to believe that someone could love him when he was a hero and a sporting star before the war. But his credit is heard by Harold. <br /> <br /> The second is when Al tells Derry about his daughter. The meaning was clear. Improve your relationship with your wife? Standard Fair of 30 Years and 40 Years Movies. Derry did not discuss this question: he felt that he was not suitable for Al's daughter. So he agreed. The film's truth comes out when we find that the daughter feels like Derry. Real people's real emotions. I think there are feelings and feelings and glory in our era. Sometimes I think we believe there are no values. That's why people who watch this movie have problems. <br /> <br /> Al has no advice he does not want. Each time his boss talks to him, Al can tie the knot. And right. There are some things that cannot be judged by occupation standards: they have to be assessed by large, general intangible assets, and only those who are tested for life's severity understand what these intangible assets are. <br /> <br /> All this leads to the end of the scene, where all planes that fought so bravely have been removed, stacked, stored, thrown and soon recycled: their function, worth and pride are transparent like Derry himself. He is able to overcome the transparency he does, so he feels like a woman he loves. <br /> <br /> I gave my life the best 10 years and there are a few movies that I feel about. It's not a movie for a popcorn. It deserves our attention. We are very privileged to bring down the lives of both private and wonderful people. We should be careful not to abuse this privilege.
