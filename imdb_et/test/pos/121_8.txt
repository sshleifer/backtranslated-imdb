Now I understand that this film was not meant to be a blame for all Indians, but it is an amazing film because it dares to explore the hypocrisy that some Indians have about their women and their sexuality. I have known for some time that sexism is very common in this society (when women are murdered because a man's family does not want them after death or because he had a small spouse, as well as often killing a female fetus because they are considered a curse instead of a blessing). I also understand that some of this film is very offensive to such a culture, but the bottom line is that there is truth to the subject - even if the film was attacked so strongly as it did in India ten years ago. Because of the extreme outrage of the film, most Western audience members are shocked or at least emotionally drawn into the ladies of this film. <br /> <br /> Although I'm a man, I'm not a rabidly feminist and I'm straight, the film had a strong positive effect on me, and it's not an agenda that can only be enjoyed by lesbians and "man hate". In fact, I do not believe that the film promotes hatred against men or homosexuality, but gives a credible argument as to how these two ladies were the only reasonable alternative because of their wicked spouses. Yes, I use the word "evil" and I mean it, because both spouses living in this large household are intensely selfish and do not respect the sexuality of their spouses. In many traditional societies, this is the case, and women are condemned to empty emotional existence. <br /> <br /> One spouse married a viable young woman, Sita, because of her family responsibilities. This organized marriage is uncomfortable for them, but at first Sita tries to connect with her husband. But she sees herself as a victim and could have taken less care of Sit - and she continues to have a relationship with a liberal-minded Chinese lady. Worse still, he did nothing to hide the thing and did not apologize. In her dead marriage, the sex was meant solely for the production of children, and Sita could not fulfill her sexual or emotional needs in any way. And unfortunately he would have been less cared for. The other husband was married to women who were infertile (Radha). Strangely enough, they have first tried after sexual contact without children in the next 13 years! This is because this person has decided to become ascetic (ie, Hinduism, a person who renounces the joys of the world in order to receive inner enlightenment). Now that she wanted it, it was all well and good when she wasn't already married and had responsibilities to her wife. But when he was married, it was an incredibly selfish act and, like his brother, he assumed his wife had no sexual feeling and didn't seem to care. The closest she promised her sexually was to sleep beside her, because putting her aside helped teach herself "to overcome the desire of the flesh." It must have brought him some disappointment. <br /> <br /> So you have two neglected and normal women living in the same household who need both an emotional connection and their sexual needs. Finally, these needs bring these sister-in-laws together - at first, simply emotionally, but later also sexually. The film was great, how I could see and understand how in some cases homosexuality is inevitable and even healthy compared to the life of emotional destruction. <br /> <br /> Late when their sexuality relationship has been discovered, Radha's "enlightened" spouse does not react completely unexpectedly - a person who seeks religious understanding and peace is so embedded that true understanding and growth is impossible. <br /> <br /> This is a very complicated and adult movie. Although there is very little nudity, the subject is very adult and it is not a film for children. Indeed, one minor who is masturbating in front of an old paralyzed lady is very disturbing - as I said, this is not a film that would let your children watch. But for a mature audience, this is a great and very erotic movie that will help you think. <br /> <br /> The movie features good actors, sophisticated characters, great writing, beautiful mood music and slow pace. may be somewhat disturbing, but what I found satisfactory. The only serious negative thing I can't blame in the film is about the idiots that released it on the videotape. This is because although the film is in English, accents are sometimes quite strong and it is not always easy to understand what is being said. BUT, and this is the worst part, there are no closed or open headlines - these include the Western audience. When you watch this movie, see if you can find it on the DVD or hopefully the newer release of the video is labeled - I wasn't sure. <br /> <br /> By the way, director Deepa Mehta (a popular female director) has made many other wonderful films such as EARTH and BOLLYWOOD / Hollywood. The consistent theme in his films is the conflict between traditional Indian culture and expectations and the western world - with an emphasis on female characters. Not surprisingly, this western thinking woman makes her home in Canada and is divorced - a truly unusual woman at least to say. For a similar film that explores traditional culture, Western culture will meet, try another Canadian pearl, EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN.
