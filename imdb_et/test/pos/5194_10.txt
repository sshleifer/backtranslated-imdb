Describing Stalingrad as a war film may be a bit inaccurate. Of course, it focuses on the longest and bloodiest battle in the history of the world, in the largest theater of the most expensive war that has taken place in life, money and ever before. Yes, it includes actions that represent bitter battles and terrible destruction. Visceral storytelling and harsh images make it more than a war movie, even more than an anti-war movie. Instead, Stalingrad is a film of absolute and undeniable hell. <br /> <br /> The film is full of a visual description of the worst war that is intense personal and close, where days are taken to take one block of a city, just to take it back with a surprise attack. The early form of modern city warfare, which the Germans called Rat Warfare, is depicted brutally and uncompromisingly. The characters run into the sewers in tunnels, at railway stations and from construction to the hell of a hell of a bomb that has been destroyed in the destruction of Stalingrad, but that the Russian winter is intolerable. <br /> <br /> The film deals with Nazism and the Germans' whistling during this period, as many other films from Germany and the world do. His characters are a group of soldiers driven by the wind of war and just trying to carry it out with himself and with as many comrades as possible. The characters do not fight against the Soviet ideological hatred between national socialism and Soviet communism, not against Grossdeutschland's great dreams or racial superior. They are fighting only because if they do not, the enemy kills them, and then if the enemy is not their officers to refuse the fight. This depiction adds another layer of hidden hopelessness, passing through the film, to a warm envelope. </Amend> The unexpected perspective of an ordinary German soldier as a hero, caused by a tragic fact and a brutal government that would sacrifice him.
