Well, what you know, I painted my house today, and the radio came Elton John's song that brought me back to the movie I saw in 1971. So long and so far. Ten years later, I hung through the countryside of France and I would have been sure to see Michelle. The film is probably not very complicated in today's standards, more damage, but it seemed quite awful. A few years later, a successor to Michel, who lived in Paris on a high rise and returned to Paul to meet him, just like the life they had been moving, was very low. However, the original was original, and if you get a copy, just rent it out, remember that you give it for yourself and treat it gently. I note that Americans may be more proud, so take note that it contains scenes and themes that may disturb the average America.
