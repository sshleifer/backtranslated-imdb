The close musical family, the cunning good-natured father, and the four living adolescent girls have their roots in Felix, the dreadful young composer, and secondly, and the deepest look of Mickey, the friend of his inextricably attractive orchestra. <br /> <br /> Michael Curtiz takes time to get this Americana piece. The first part looks almost like paraframing the cereal trade without being sure and natural, and then John Garfield enters the scene as a doomed Mickey, first making movies, black curls, sleepy, hung eyes, rude and unpleasant, the absolute opposite of Jeffrey Lyn's smooth conviction , madly charming Felix. Garfield is complete and necessary, as opposed to the rest of the household ("Something I would surprise me", but), and suddenly the film becomes interesting, although I agree with the critics who find the plot that finding a plot is not motivated enough. <br /> <br /> Four sisters are played quite gently and seriously written, but Claude Rains as a pater familia has his moments. <br /> <br /> Let's look at it for Garfield, though it's just a really lasting thing.
