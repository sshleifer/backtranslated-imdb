I never saw any League work before the beginning of last year - although I was trying to end one of the three episodes of a series by jumping one night. But last winter I fell in love with the exhibition and its dark, eccentric and sometimes even bad characters. So when I found out that they had made a movie where the creators who love the exhibition met their characters, I couldn't get the DVD fast enough and close it to post it from the delivery service provider. I was so excited to see what Gents had done and how they did it. <br /> <br /> And that was great! From the outset, when Jeremy (Michael Sheen) is terrorized by Edward, Tubbs and Papa (Dyson, why didn't you play yourself? He's totally capable of noticing the notorious Highgate House of Horror!) By discovering his flock, Geoff, Herr Lipp and Hilary characters that are a great scene. The scenes set in 1690 are very enjoyable because Gents is turning more hands and new plots into his hands. David Warner's once Doctor Pea is awesome in the camp and very funny. <br /> <br /> The league has always been great, combining humor with sadness and emotions - and the climax of this movie where Herr Lipp fights the idea that he and other Vasey residents are just fictional people who can never change who they are is, or their purpose - and to witness how it breaks, is really sad and beautiful to look at at the same time and it is really shown by Gents' talents - something that they have so far been horribly neglected. <br /> <br /> And then you have this pretty smart ending - where you sit in a miracle - with Joby Talbot's beautiful theme music. And you know you've enjoyed a very smart and funny movie.
