Under the guidance and starring of Rutger Hauer, this film is a short story of Dutch writer Harry Murlisch. <br /> <br /> Within 10 minutes of a movie's length, you can see a lifetime like "Harry" leaving its long-lasting charm in the space it constantly stays in. After many years of returning to town he finds that he has leased the same space. <br /> <br /> Using black-and-white movies, the texture is emphasized in this story. "Harry" voice who pulls you into your world. <br /> <br /> Rutger Hauer and 2 non-spoken characters with subtle, intense performance. Great soundtrack for Dutch musician Dyzack. <br /> <br /> This movie is currently hard to see because it is only available in DVD 2 "L'infi" (Liv Ullman) as a bonus line. But it is for the re-released DVD "The Hitcher" - another tight but very different Hauer performance! <br /> <br /> Watch this movie when you can!
