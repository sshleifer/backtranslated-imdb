Claire Booth Luce "Women" shows relationships with men from a woman's point of view in the game (and a 1939 film with Joan Crawford playing a slut: a character who might have been Amanda Farrow 20 years earlier). male characters. Here we see the characters of men and what they are. They use women like toys and throw them away, leaving women to suffer. Ironically, women who are "women", perhaps because they are all seen, are shown in less favorable light, alternating with fools and schemes, only "nice", (Norma Shearer), with the end of "claws". "Best in Everything" we see men men who are them, while women are largely innocent and vulnerable. <br /> <br /> This is a movie about how women jump from things. Diane Baker jumps out of the car (perhaps the most absurd scene in cinema history, which is not in the book). Suzy Parker falls into the fire. In the film, women jump to the workplace while looking for success and love. Women would go to the future and leave such a soap opera over the next seven years. But they came back in the 80s and 90s through novels such as Sidney Sheldon and Judith Krantz (although their trashier works are not so good). <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie looks like. I love the shiny movie films of the '50s and' 60s. They look so much better than home movies that we have done with pixels, because the picture is so clear on the television inbox and DVD, so you can enter it. It is also memorable for the beautiful beauty of young people. This film probably has more beautiful women than any other. It has a supermodel (Suzy Parker), a queen of beauty (Myrna Hansen who wasn't Miss America 1954, as Rona Jaffe says in a DVD commentary, but rather Miss USA 1953, about IMDb: but so) and a Playboy playmate (Blair from January 1957 ). My voice goes to Suzy, the amazing beauty of all time. His behavior here is not as terrible as people pretend: they just react, as people did, in the eyes of the supermodel (first, really), trying to act. No one felt caring how well he did. His role, apparently in the form of a earthly woman who is the most vulnerable, is the most difficult bundle and he does just that. <br /> <br /> The most relevant thing about the movie is now the age of female drivers. Hope Lange was 27 when filmed in the spring of 1959. Diane Baker was 20. Suzy Parker was 26. Hope, who saw Grace Kelly heir, never made it big and finished with Mr Muir on television and IMDb who live at home with "coffee tables" because he spent for the money he died before the age of 72 years. This film was supposed to be a very distant and insignificant memory for him. Baker, always a welcome face on 60s TVs (especially Richard Kimble) and still active as an actor and actor coach, turned to 67. Parker found Bradford Dillman 40 years old when he died at the age of 70 in the same year. But here they are young, beautiful and ambitious for success and love, like their characters.
