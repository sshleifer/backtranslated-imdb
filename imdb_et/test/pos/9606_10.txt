I saw it back in 99 and I remember it lovingly. Until today, I remember the parts of the film with my head, like a slant. Unfortunately, out of 99 - I never remembered its name before I watched my uncle's filmography and found it (he played Clive Kennard). Immediately after reading the description I knew what it was. After catching up, I was shocked to find out that not only did it do it on video or on DVD, but it was repeated. It's a tremendous shame, I ask that ITV at least repeat this great TV movie. Nick Hancock in this movie showed that he could do more than just his figure with Mike Tonker. This is a movie that most football fans would love and even those who aren't too interested in sports could enjoy it. Yes, it is a brief overview, but there is not much to say besides being an underrated movie, it is worth repeating or publishing on video / DVD, so ITV, myself and others of this movie fans will demand you. HOW TO GET ONE OF THEM!
