I saw the original original dirty screen four times in Gencon a few years ago. I was happy to do this, my daughter is in the movie. omit the line. Permanent membership later was like watching fans when the US Hockey Team won the Russians at the Montreal Olympics. Married to Taxi, Barney Miller, Cheers, Frasier and Chilren is my all-time favorite comedy. Less shows that I don't even look at it. Forget that there is no mega-budget to support production. It's pure art, it's so good. <br /> <br /> I couldn't have been all the cast and for the manufacturing company happier.
