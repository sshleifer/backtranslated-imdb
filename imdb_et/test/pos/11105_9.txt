In the 1980s, this is a very dark film. Here, the filmmakers began to act on the assumption that all the films needed a comic relief (which is, of course, extremes for today), wonderful scenes (even more than today) or a steamy sexual scene. /> <br /> Hutton and Penn are strange in their roles because childhood friends were changed by Soviet spies. Especially Penn is a brilliant so unhappy drug dealer in Daulton Lee. <br /> <br /> Here is a real thriller / drama. There is no eye candy talk, but the story is so convincing and acting so wonderful that (hopefully) most people will not miss it. There are a couple of fun scenes, especially where Penn is trying to get his Soviet benefactors involved in a major drug deal. <br /> <br /> It's worth checking out.
