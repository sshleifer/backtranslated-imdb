I don't know if this film hits my heart the way it does for friendship, love, the closeness of others, or the heat of the transformation that Babette's cooking creates, but when the party begins and for the rest of the movie, I speak often. Yes, it is a good-looking film, but without weakness or mild sentimentality. Please note that the elements of the plot will be discussed. Babette's party tells her story with restraint and care and gives us the opportunity to discover the values ​​of grace and love. We must know that Babette Harsant (Stephane Audran) was a French refugee who was given two aging sisters in a small community on the coast of Jutland. The sisters take the remains of their father's herd. He was a pastor of beliefs who taught that salvation was a denial. Sisters made a commitment and a sacrifice. Those who are still there now respect the teachings of the dead pastor and his spiritual guidance. However, as they are outdated, a small community has become meaningless and argumentative. Nurses do what they get. For pastor's 100th birthday, Babette wants to prepare a dinner for a small group where the sisters invite. Nurses are reluctant to agree, but when they see the accessories Babette has ordered, they and their guests become worried. They are accustomed to the usual prices of dried cod in the community, boiled and bread, water, and little rain. Although Babette has made improvements over time, what they see now is near divinity. For dinner, there will also be a guest, General Lorens Lowenhielm, who for many years had chosen an ambition for his love for one sister. <br /> <br /> What do we experience? The faith and stone of an aging community, the wind-blown cottages where they live, are frugal. Nurses' warmth is the nurses in a small, overcrowded dining room. And then Babette's transformative power of artistic art, when we look at her chef, look at Eriki, a young boy helping her, serve and pour and watch old churches, wines and fine cooking, gradually discovering her community and love and friendship. The general serves our unexpected guide because he is the only one who knows what extraordinary dishes they eat. The general speaks about his incomprehensible dinners, the story of a famous woman who was an exemplary chef in the famous Café Anglais in Paris. "... this woman, the chef, was able to make dinner a love affair ... a love relationship that did not distinguish between physical appetite and mental appetite." He has also become a man who accepts what he has received, but always knows what value he has long since refused to accept. Old couple kisses. Two old men remember the friendships of the past. And Babette, who spent all that time she had won in the lottery, has had the opportunity to be an artist she once had in France, an opportunity she accepted with love and friendship. <br /> <br /> Babette, who is as poor as she was when she had failed for years, continues with her sisters. The general list of his aunt returns to his heritage. And the elderly are leaving their nursing homes to return to their homes. They stop and look at the clear night sky and the stars. They are spontaneously holding hands and dancing and singing this song ... <br /> <br /> "The clock tends and time goes by. Let's use that time to try to serve the Lord with our hearts and to find our true home so that we we'll find a real home. "<br /> <br /> They laugh at each other. Everything is agreed. <br /> <br /> Babette's party is a wonderful film full of restrained emotions, unexpected insights, wisdom ... and of course a meal that leaves you in a stupefying stomach when you leave the theater. If you win a lottery so that you can afford what Babette has created and has her own skills and artistic work, here is what she earned: <br /> <br /> Potage a la Tortue (rich turtle button) served with amontillado sherry Blinis Demidoff au Caviar (small buckwheat croissants with sour cream and caviar), served with Veuve Clicquot champagne Cailles et Sarcophage with Perigourdine sauce (boned quail, stuffed foie gras and truffle blade with Madeira-enriched truffle sauce). fine burgundy salad cheese and fresh fruit Baba au Rhum with fruits and fresh figs Coffee and exquisite brand
