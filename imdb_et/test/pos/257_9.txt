I watched this movie at a local festival, Silver Sprocket International Film Festival in Florida. What a lovely movie. A simple, simple moral story of a young careless young man who must take responsibility for his actions. It is not cautious or flashy for my two teenage daughters, no change in the content or language of the film. A real family film and the best British comedy movie I've seen since Billy Elliot. The film surprisingly continued with the best film festival and best director awards. Ten out of ten.
