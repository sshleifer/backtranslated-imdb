Many movies are ambitious. Few succeed. This movie is one of them. <br /> <br /> Although this concept is a black comedy, this concept seems too restrictive to express the true nature of the story behind Max and Grace. With several hyphens, Michael Parness has managed to worship elements of absurd comedy that have incredibly real human emotions. It is quite remarkable to be sure. <br /> <br /> Although the comic aspects definitely exist, the heart of the film is led by David Krumholtz and Natasha Lyonne. The delicate balance of the film - really crazy and true love - falls on them and they achieve it by passing it from the opening to the heart-catching climax and the warm-hearted end. David Krumholtz confirms the picture as a leading role and narrator and is doing an extraordinary job. We see the world through the eyes of Maxi, and Krumholtz sucks them in a kind of miracle and hopefulness that no one would expect to be credible if he had previously taken himself from a suicidal attempt. There should be no doubt here that he has indeed achieved the status of a leading person who deserves more than ten years of memorable supportive roles. Natasha Lyonne can be a revelation to anyone who has seen her only in less complex roles. Grace's role is extensive, demanding that she show so much rage and great tenderness - sometimes within seconds. He can convince us of Grace's deep despair, directly under his alternating torpor and mania. <br /> <br /> It is not a laugh of a minute type of comedy, so the movie is not expected from the beginning to strictly humor. to stop. Think more dramatically than comedy. There are some very dark moments, as the subject of suicidal individuals and some strange real moments that Emma Adele Galvin gave to Max's sister Sis. The most humorous scenes are those that are populated by many namespaces in support roles. Although Lorraine Bracco and David Paymer give the most surreal aspects to their scenes, there are other supportive characters who fill the institution where Max and Grace meet, is a true treatment. Guillermo Diaz is an enchanting stageer like the amazingly crazy joke, Hector. Ralf Moeller, like Bruno, acts as his straight man but has his own charm and attractiveness. Rosanna Arquette lives in full with Vera's role as a crass vitriol at the rodent waitress. Even his hard-handed character will eventually melt, just like everyone Maxi literally loves Grace against. <br /> <br /> Can love conquer all that can be behind the movie and even if the realist does not say, movies are about escaping from reality, even if only a few short hours. I recommend seeing this movie not only as a reality, but as a cynic, which says that such a love story will never happen. A few hours are spent in a world where it gets and works wonders for the psyche. <br /> <br /> (Seattle International Film Festival - June 2005)
