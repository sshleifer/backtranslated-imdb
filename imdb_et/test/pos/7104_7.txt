"The House of Dracula" is really something new to offer chills or excitement or new twists to an already tired storyline. This film was quickly produced as a continuation of the "Frankenstein House" a year earlier. "House of Dracula" looks like a factory in 1945 with production values ​​taking a different, potentially frightening movie. Earlier films from previous films in the series and then the end of "Ghost of Frankenstein", used here at the end, will make "el cheepo" flick. It is a shame of the studio and the producer that they had a talent of excellence and they just wasted money and money on a long money back scheme. But it seems to have been at the end of the Hollywood World War. This is what brought some of these harmless lizards out of some of the nonsense SciFs of the 1950s to make them dinosaurs. The days of James Whale and Val Lewton, mentioning the two, were over in this genre when creating a real mood and atmosphere. Also remember that the makeup artist Jack Pierce, who was actually engaged in medical research to create all of our favorites, was fired immediately after this movie was released. The less capable champion, Bud Westmore, was then hired as the head of that department as the head of the Universal International Department. Not to disdain Westmore's ability, but the horror movies were not just his forte. OK to view or not view. Watch this movie, but only in the chronological order of Frankenstein and see how it all turned into a comic book for Abbott & Costello.
