Although this movie doesn't really differentiate the movie from the crowd, it's still a very nice movie that sits in front of your feet and look! Maybe there are a couple of one or two mistakes you are trying to make, and the cinema is a little slippery, the film itself is very enjoyable and has a great atmosphere. The music helps a lot in the mood of the movie. <br /> <br /> The actor, however, is impressive (especially the dog he is!), John Travolta directing the fun-loving Michael. Other characters feel very authentic and work very well in the movie. <br /> <br /> So after a long day at work, stick with Michael in the evening with ice cream and enjoy the high quality movie of your right :)
