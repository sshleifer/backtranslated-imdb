If you are looking for a kung-fu action film, look elsewhere. Although there are fighting scenes, the film revolves around its provincial protagonist struggling to find its way into the Americanized canton. Unlike most "kung-fu comedies", scenes of action are used to strengthen comedy, not vice versa. <br /> <br /> Cheung Booi is a statement about the fictional nature of kung-fu movies, where the stars always seem to have any reason to fight. Instead of the drama of great honor and respect, the small misunderstandings create characters against each other and start to beat each other. Cheng Tai-nun, played by Kara Hui, a young woman who marries an older landowner to keep her households in her greedy and corrupt brothers. When he dies, he moves to Canton to live with his nephew, played by director Lau Kar Leung and his son Ah Tao, played by Hsiao Ho. <br /> <br /> Iron is based on the fact that although Cheng is of the same age as Ah Tao, his way is similar to his status as his adult aunt. While Ah Tao speaks English (extremely badly), plays guitar and goes to costume party, Cheng fails completely when he tries to adapt to his lifestyle in Canton, with makeup, revealing bathrobes, high heels and dance scenes. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie big is realizing it. Lau Kar Leung is perhaps one of the largest, if not the largest, directors of his generation in Hong Kong, and Kara Hui won the best actress in the first Hong Kong film prizes in 1982. Also, it is arguably the best results for Hsiao Ho. His chemistry with Huiga is remarkable, and although he continued his kung-fu comedy flooring career, who often work with Sammo Hung, he has the perfect combination of athleticism and comedy. As the romantic tension and intrigue are built on the other side of the film, his whole face changes. He can no longer live through the world without care. He becomes a straight man and his cohorts are Kramer, Elaine and George. One of my complaints is how the comic aspects of the movie suddenly fall out during the summary. The film moves directly from the farce to the dramatic intrigue with little but changing music. But there is some symmetry. The film begins to focus on intrigue, focusing more on the character of Lau Kar Leung and ending in this way. But the last scene returns to the comedy roots of the film, drawing conclusions on both aspects of the film.
