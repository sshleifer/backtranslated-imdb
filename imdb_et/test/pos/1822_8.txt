This movie is one of my favorite films of all time and it made me a lifelong Nicolas Cage fan. In the mid-80s, I recorded this movie (if it was impossible for the VCR to do it !!) and watch it over and over again. Nicolas Cage is just great here. And she looks wonderful and doesn't affect "acting fathers" (see "Peggy Sue Got Married" to find out what I mean!). I understand all his performances against it. He was as perfect as a cool punk boy with sharp friends. The music was great. Plimsouls! Psychodelic Fur! Modern English! Men at work! Every time I hear "melt with you", I am back in the finals of this movie. <br /> <br /> What happened to his lovely defendant Deborah Foreman? And his hysterical friend, Cameron Dye? Certainly Nicolas! Interestingly, the slutty friend (Elizabeth Daily) was Tommy's voice from Rugrats (she's been billed by E.G. Daily)! Bizarre! <br /> <br /> If you want to go back to the 80s, check out this movie. This is definitely classic. As completely!
