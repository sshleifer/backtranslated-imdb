ccmovieman-1 must be a New York journalist who preferred Janis Joplin's Big Brother and Holding Company album to the Beatles White album, which was called either bad or crazy. National Velvet is a great movie. Elizabeth Taylor's performance is fantastic, and I can't even distinguish the accent, much less. Her performance is very natural, authentic and incredibly charming. The rest is great, especially Rooney and Revere. <br /> <br /> As for the dialogue with hokey or sentimental, I suggest that cc has eaten iron for too long and has lost the ability to distinguish between true straightforward emotion and human interaction. There was a time when people actually thought and talked. Not that this film has no hint of magic penetration. This is the reason why the story goes. It is also possible to criticize Oz, King Kong, Malta Falcon, Casablanca, Black Stallion (the second big horse) or thousands of other films that have an act and a dialogue that seems richer than real life. Not my friend, National Velvet, is firmly tolerant of his convictions, the tongue is not firmly in the cheek. It is almost impossible to restore something of today's captured filmmakers.
