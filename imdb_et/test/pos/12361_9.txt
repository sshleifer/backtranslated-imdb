The last person to die before New Year's Eve is cursed to drive Phantom's carriage throughout the year, taking the souls of the dead. <br /> <br /> I saw this old silent Swedish horror movie scene in Youtub and decided to watch the whole movie. It was worthwhile to find this job because it is an absolutely amazing film at the time it was made. It has a wonderful atmosphere. Old-time horror filmmakers knew how to create the perfect atmosphere. Unfortunately, many of today's filmmakers do not seem to understand how important the settings and atmosphere are, and to go for the scare of cheap jumpers. Visual effects are excellent considering the date of production. If you find a copy of it, I suggest you a clock. 9/10
