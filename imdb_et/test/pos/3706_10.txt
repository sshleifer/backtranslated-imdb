The mother should really give a different title to distinguish it from all the other films that are there, called Mom or Mom. <br /> <br /> It is a tremendously better zombie movie with so much garbage that will be cut off from time to time and all in the end as much as any other zombie movie out there. <br /> <br /> It's so different and refreshing that it's almost moving into categories. <br /> <br /> A certain old lady who takes a horrible back who just happens to be a meat eater who then infects an old lady who also becomes a flesh eating a zombie or ghoul, which is not exactly defined. <br /> <br The story is in sin when his son understands what he has changed and when he first tries to help him by supplying "food". (I'm no longer talking about being afraid to insert a spoiler!) This is one of those "silent" movies, not blasting weapons, explosions, robbery, car driving, etc., What makes so many movies the same scrap, but still with enough moments to to satisfy spooky fans, while also adding a sadness story, with a nice sense of humor, rather than some of the horror of some so-called horror movies. <br /> <br /> It's a particularly nice atmospheric film at the beginning of the movie, where the old lady sits alone in her room with just the company's Christmas tree and looks so "innocent", but what she gets! The Lord! <br /> <br /> The movie's pearl, and even if not your thing, should look at the real horror blower at least once.
