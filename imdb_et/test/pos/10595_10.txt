a totally brilliant movie from the CKY team ...... (not jackass boys ..... johnny knoxville, chris pontius, steve-o etc in this <br /> <br /> movie). OK, maybe they're not the best actors, but that's not what you call a serious movie ...... but hey there fun and totally funny. who doesn't want to see that don vito is dressed as a Roman emperor! <br /> <br /> complete stuff if you like viva la bam or CKY ............ all-powerful HIM, CKY, and others ...... check out the extra features of DVD, especially Brani freestyle with. <br /> <br /> Chinese rap number two ...... seriously fun ..... ...... check out this movie ........ you will not regret it ... ...... 10/10
