This is one of the greatest films ever made. Brilliant is operated by George C. Scott and Diane Riggs. This movie is so disturbing and extremely deep. Don't be fooled into believing it's just comedy. This is a great satire for the medical industry. This is not a beautiful picture. Healthy patients are killed by incompetent surgeons who spend all the money in the hospital. And yet, you really believe it's a hospital. Manufacturers were very careful to include real medical terminology and actual medical cases. This movie really shows how difficult the hospital management is and how bad things were already in 1971. I loved this movie. P.S. - I noticed that an incompetent, wheeled dealer surgeon played in LA Law as a company manager. A young doctor played Lou Grantis. I also noticed that the registration sister has appeared in Becker and other exhibitions.
