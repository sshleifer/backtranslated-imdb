If you are looking for a movie that doesn't take you seriously ... when Haggard is for you. I have to say before I write anything more that if you haven't seen any CKY (Camp Kill Yourself) video, the film is probably not AS funny. My advice is to watch the videos that Bam and his friends did. Haggard doesn't take himself seriously and it was never a goal. Throughout the film, you have occasional moments that have nothing to do with a plot that can get annoying but not something that is out of control. Even through all that is focused on the plot, the story of Ryan Dunn's character comes up quite nicely. The plot I've talked about is based on a true story (mostly) of Ryan Dunni's former girlfriend. Brandon Dicamillo is the best character in the movie. He has many talents and knows how to make people laugh. He stole the movie when you ask me. In general, I love this movie for its simplicity and straightforwardness. This is a Bam movie player who is not normal. Haggard is full of fun quotes that my friends and I have been using for the first time ever. I've seen the movie 6-7 times and still have new things. The soundtrack is just as good. Everything from Gnar Kill to New Order and some techno. Just don't go into the movie with great expectations, let it all open and then judge what it is.
