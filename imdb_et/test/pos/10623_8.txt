In the light of the comments, La Pianiste seems to be a lot meaningless for the emotional banal. I find it difficult to understand, given the excellent results of Isabelle Huppert. Huppert is thrilling - he succeeds in delivering a woman who is extremely full of hate and deception. <br /> <br /> The film is wonderful and appreciated. It would be so easy to imagine a leader as a ridiculous figure - consider a scene in a porn shop, for example. Somehow Huppert can do this, partly because of his excellent performance, but also because the director makes his surreal life real and identifiable. <br /> <br /> Don't forget this movie. This is one of the most amazing and interesting movies (and performances) I've seen. <br /> <br /> Trust Boris!
