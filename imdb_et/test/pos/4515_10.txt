Kite Runner was beautiful, terrible and very touching. I especially loved the two children of the film and the father depicting the father. It really made me go back and read the book again. <br /> <br /> Music was a great part of the film's fabric. When a soundtrack appears on the film, I buy this book for a second reading. It is also a visually stunning film. Cinematography was excellent and added to experience. <br /> <br /> The Brazilian word "Saudai" is very well described at the end of the movie ... "this deep longing feels against someone or somewhere that is very sweet, but also hidden by sadness." (Antonio Carlos Jobim years ago given Definition). <br /> <br /> You saw it at a small cinema for pre-screening. I would like to see it again on a very big screen with a complicated sound system. <br /> <br /> Cannot wait for official release. friends.
