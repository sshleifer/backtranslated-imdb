Columbo is a guest lecturer in criminology. Pupils invite him with his post-class reunion. Passing through a nearby parking house, they discover their own ordinary teacher who is dead from a wound wound. (No, Columbo wasn't after the man's work.) As a classic project, Columbo's students involve their swimming. <br /> <br /> Two pupils whose viewer was initially convicted were in the classroom in the lecture hall. In addition, the parking cameras' surveillance camera tapes show that someone other than the professor entered or left after leaving the lecture room unexpectedly. <br /> <br /> Reversing the usual routine, Columbo is what is the evil (?) duo who wants a progress report and an ear to their theories. Forensic evidence is almost non-existent. The case solution depends on some potential and interesting happiness. <br /> <br /> At first sight, Columbo seemed to have swallowed the guilt of the whole culprit; however, in the case of repeated viewing, it turned out that the small details were not at all. <br /> <br /> This reviewer has not yet been "Columbo Goes to College".
