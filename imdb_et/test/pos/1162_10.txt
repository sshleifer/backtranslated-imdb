This is one of my all-time favorites. All participants do a good job. Comparing this film with "Arab Lawrence" does not justify both films. The level of "wind and lion" is much lower, with fantastic actresses who represent a warm atmosphere from the heart. Activities and beautiful pictures are also offered, all of which make me a favorite film.
