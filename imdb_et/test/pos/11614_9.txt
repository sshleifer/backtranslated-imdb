Karim Hussain's art / gore masterpiece - this cat is definitely attentive. We have several longer vignettes in it, with some shorter blends. All in all, it is a very powerful film based on its intense graphic design and symbolism and it is not meant for all viewers. <br /> <br /> The film starts with the short name OVARIAN EYEBALL. Very short segment with naked woman naked. The invisible woman's hand covers the face of a lying woman with a red cloth and makes her abdominal incision, from which the eyeball is extracted. I have not commented too much on this because of the brevity. <br /> <br /> HUMAN BOOK is one of the films that are lynchpins and it is a completely uneven image of perverted action by a disturbed man who has an affectionate love for a pregnant nurse. This is one that has to be seen as believing. I say this film has some of the best effects I have seen in the indie horror film, but the theme makes it an undeniable experience for most (not me - I live for it!). > <br /> REBIRTH could cut out this movie together. This is the weakest segment of the film and it has a bunch of naked people who burn bloody holes in the field and not. Very short, but this one type of blow movie momentum. Think "P is Christ" or the paintings of the Virgin Mary's menstrual blood. This publication is a very serious sexual / sexual violent / gory image and is certainly not for anyone who is offended by sacred celebration. <br /> <br /> Unconscious cruelty is one of the best films I've seen in the extreme horror band it's a very sharing film among fear fans and film outlook in general. Some call it a trash, some call it brilliant. I don't see much of the middle ground. I thought this movie was a pretty fucking original and I would recommend it to anyone who is rocky enough to try it. 9/10
