"Traffik 1989" is an emmy-award-winning 6-part mini-race from the UK, which was an inspiration for the Oscar winning Traffic 2000. The five-hour film breaks down the opium / heroine trade from the transfer of seeds from Afghan fields to a spectacular junkie "main runner" in an apartment in England. "Traffi" does not provide entertainment value through dramatic stories of interleaves, but also gives an overview of international drug trafficking at all levels, responding to who, where, how and why the issues of an aging and unstoppable drug supply / demand machine. Synergistically entertaining and educating, "Traffi" turns out to be an age that takes teenagers and up. (A)
