I remember hearing this movie and how it played in almost every Toronto theater. This is a group of girls who are not accepted by other colleges in their college, so that they start their own creation and, of course, call it H.O.T.S. It's a fun movie that's just broken with nostalgia! Lots of fully blessed t-shirts, vans, fighting and soccer game showdown like no other! It has been compared to the "animal house", which is a good movie, but I have nothing to compare with H.O.T.S. She has her own fun and distinctive brand. If you are looking for a classic T n'A movie, look because H.O.T.S. Girls are rescue, boom-boom-short and all!
