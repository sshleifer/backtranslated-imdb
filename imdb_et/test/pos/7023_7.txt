Jennifer Gray seems to be the most unpleasant romantic leader and this is probably the reason why this beloved movie is such a solid fire. It is all very good if Montagus and Capulets, together with desserts, such as dancing and schadenfreude-baiting, are the family slings of Jewish society, but usually it has to be an X-factor. <br /> <br /> Swayze is likely to make this film secure by his harsh, post-Travolta movements and temperament, but it was won by this curly Penelope Pitstop, which brings the dream to an impressive market. Super (dated? Maybe "immortal") soundtrack helps, and of course, imaginatively, intelligently puts the film away from the resort's everyday life. 7/10
