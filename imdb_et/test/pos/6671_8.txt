* May be spoilers * No doubt one of the best dramas, if not the best I've seen. Is Prot an alien or just a crazy bugger? This is the question you ask yourself during the movie. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey is just as amazing as Jeff Bridges. You can't sometimes win these types of exhibitions and humor. Some of Kevin Spaceys' activities in this film are very funny. For example, when she got up in the tree and when she spoke to a "queen" mental patient, how she hid half her face around the wall and just watched. , right from the start, you're hooked, and if you really love drama, you won't break. <br /> <br /> 85%.
