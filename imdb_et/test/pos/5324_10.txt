Every role, up to the smallest, is cast and behaved braviga. <br /> <br /> The extraordinary Jena Malone will never take it wrong. His two stars mark him in this movie. Ryan Gosling may be the best actor in his generation. Chris Klein gives his best result. It is a way of thinking and conversation that provokes a movie that teenagers and young adults should see. You mean and talk about this movie in the days. Highly recommended.
