I had the gentle power of this film and the mood it created was very moved. I think it could have got a lot more credit than it was. I agree that Michelle Pfeiffer should have been a candidate, but I think that all the performances were outstanding and that Michelle Pfeiffer and Jessica Lange depicted the deep affinity and conflicts of the nurses with emotional depth and sensitivity. Although I didn't read the book, I found the King's modern concept very cool. I'm sure I can't see the game again in the same way!
