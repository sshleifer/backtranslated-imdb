The film can certainly be narrative, but it is by no means an ideal tool. Literature best suits literature, as the reader can provide the imagination needed to complete the structure. The film is best judged by looking at what it is: a group of images that are grouped together. What Soderbergh does in Ocean's Twelve is a blend of unbeatable film technology and a free-flowing American film in the 1970s. Looking at the recently posted comments, most people waited for the usual heist movie, a la Entrapment; it seems that people are not really capable of tiring romance, which is a hidden tension between leaders and a ridiculous plot twist that is designed to awaken the audience. Soderberg's leading ability is only to see this film, but the forty-meter-high close-ups of Pitti and Zeta-Jones do not damage it either. True petting for those who love flashing light fixtures, and disappointment for those who are trying to film something that is not.
