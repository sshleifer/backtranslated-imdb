it was very deep very sensitive. This is my favorite all the time if you don't see the movie deeper than this incredible movie. Susan Sarandon made his role as a matured mind actor and he understood his role. He deserves a prize. He convinced me with a nun. The music was very impressive and sensitive. Really I liked this deep masterpiece.
