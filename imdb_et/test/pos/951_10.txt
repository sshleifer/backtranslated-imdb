if u haven't seen Vijay "Ghillli", "Gilly" or "Ghillie". look at this. wow. its devastating fun. I don't know if Dharani (brilliant director) was serious or not. There are tons of hot guys in it, look, someone calling Velu "Maachat". The one with brilliant ribbons is devastatingly hot. His teeth are also excellent. Vijay stones. Trisha shouts every 5 seconds. It's very deep. Look at it, you won't regret it. There are some big laughs in it. If you're not talking about Tamil, then learn it. Then you get all the internal jokes. This is one for the whole family, except maybe you have to skip violent bits. I've seen this movie eleven times ... and counting. <br /> <br /> Wow!
