I was particularly pleased with Delly's review of this film and I agree that Howard is not the only "damaged" sign. Howard is quite ruthlessly "buildable" by the script, but there is no evidence that his previous employer is actually dead or, if he is, he killed. Howard doesn't know or do it. Terras and confused when you see that she is there, she burns. But he will never harm Helen Gordon, no matter how he is. Indeed, he responds to the fear of Helen's incantation spell and the fact that he has scissors, he continues to tidy up and welcomes the restored Helen to the almost pathetic "I'm very tired. I think I'm going home." Frankly, I don't think he's a psychopath. Surely a sick puppy but not a psychopath. <br /> <br /> Howard's problem is that he has no real male identity. He wanted to serve his country, but his mental state denies him a place in the army. He's just roots and isolated: no woman, girl, no home (again, at least as much as we know). And she does the job of a woman - "The floor is my specialty". Helen's niece ruthlessly strikes this pride in her thoroughness, crying harshly that she wants a man with real work. Also, although he finds himself heavily attracted to Helen, he cannot or does not want to do more than intimidate him by making a strong sexual passport. He is remarkably powerless - unable to fight, can't work, can't be loved. <br /> <br /> However, Helen is rightly scared. He tries to contact him, but he finds that he does not respond normally (ie outside his rose-tinted memories prescribed by his wife Nedi), inadvertently pushing all Howard's buttons to lie to him in an attempt to escape. <br /> <br /> Both characters trapped in the building, trapped in fear, neuroses, rage and memory deserve compassion. I know that sudden termination is disappointed by some reviewers, but I felt it was well installed because it offered characters of its kind. In my opinion, Helen has been released from the past. When Howard tries to call her husband's army, Helen's nasty reaction is lifted. He undoubtedly thinks that the "holy" of Nedi's property has been violated, but hopefully his need to keep everything "intact" disappeared when his own struggle is in danger. Maybe he can move on. <br /> <br /> Howard is also freed - his endless anger, hurt, and violence cycle. Whether he moves to treatment or to jail, is controversial, but I hope it is the first. <br /> <br /> Great performances from Ryan and Lupine. I prefer "On Dangerous Ground," but it's also pretty good.
