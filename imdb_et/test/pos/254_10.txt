I looked again at the second time on MS Gundam 08. It's so much better than Gundam Wing. I can't wait to get a DVD and see what was out of the series. It's nice to see that Gundams are actually moving along the land. Someone was thinking about writing this motion script. <br /> <br /> Look at it today.
