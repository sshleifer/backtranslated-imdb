I remember it like young people. We attacked the pub and watch it or record it and spent weeks playing with each other. <br /> <br /> We called one of our companions "Zipmole Watkins" after a wonderful episode by Daniel Headbreak by the Back Street Abortionist on the nose "restyling". <br /> <br /> Lots of good points "Remember 5:30 in the morning when you get only white bread from a brown man. It's a simple guy!" - Gandhi as a local merchant. <br /> <br /> Tony woodcock was definitely an episode they taught Ralph (Daniel Peacock) to be a bartender. It's not good Amanda I never do it as a bar man "Helen Lederer teaches her to ask people about the game" Watch the game last night? I thought Woodcock was playing well. "After a series of unsuccessful conversations, the hairless hair of Arsenal was sitting in the bar:" Look at the game last night? "" Yes. I thought I was playing well "<br /> <br /> We still have wonderful stupid features -" Reg and Ralph ..... or ....... Ralph and Reg. Reg, Reg. .. Reg Reg Reg Reg "<br /> <br /> Lots of very surreal stupid moments and very surreal songs from Flatlets - Back Street Abortist is a personal favorite with a big ending line -" And he notes your packages "Back to Sender" <br /> <br /> Good old Danny Peacock - you added a lot of young people to a drink sir. <br /> <br /> ** Update - I found a few episodes on the tape - uploading a Gandhi sketch to YouTube **
