This is a "revised" report by Riverdance that takes place in Radio City Music in New York. Of the three Irish "dance" musicals I looked at in the mid and late 90s (which included the first "Riverdance" and "Dance Lord"), I liked it the best. <br /> <br /> I thought it was better than the original in Dublin, Ireland, because it adds segments that are mostly good, it's more variable and colorful, and it removed two of it with an original that was not from the beginning besides good. This is just a very strong example of a few weak points. Certainly there are some songs / dances that are just "fair" but none who is poor, which is amazing given that there are a total of 20 numbers. <br /> <br /> Cast is similar to the first Riverdance main exception from Colin Dunne, who replaced Michael Flatley as a prominent dancer. Both are very talented. The main difference in their vision, with Dunne, is a bit of a furry black-haired man, while Flatley is a pure shaved blonde. I like Dunne, because Flatley's ego is so big that he's irritating from time to time. Fortunately, the female manager Jean Butler is still there and it is nice to see: what a graceful beauty and talent! Butler and the other women have the biggest legs I've seen with dancers. I also liked dancing and two guys from the Spanish flamenco speaker Maria Pages: Daniel B. Wooten and Ivan Thomas. One number - against these two pairs with Dunni and two other dancers -0 is called "Trading Taps" and it is fantastic fun to watch, perhaps to highlight the entire exhibition. I have no complaints about violinist Eileen Iver. <br /> <br /> The "fast" Irish songs here turned to me the most. I appreciated the audience who did not come to the show with shrieks and herds, like women in "The Lord of The Dance" video.
