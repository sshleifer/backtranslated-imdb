FIERCE PEOPLEi from the opening scenes (the interaction of the tribal tradition, photographed by the father of the young storyteller Finn Earl, showing why this South American tribe Ishaniani is so acute) is the direction of the film is blurry: do we look at the dark comedy of comparing the lives of New York streets with non-civilized peoples or is this a more serious intention? But as the story evolves, it becomes a clearer boundary between entertainment and philosophy. The direction of Griffin Dunne's Dirk Wittenborne's adaptation of his novel may be somewhat careless at times, as it inhibits the development of a rational plot, but ultimately has a strong enough final impact to hit his holes. <br /> <br /> Finn Earl (Anton Yelchin), our narrator, lives with his coke-dependent masseuse / sexually obsessed mother Liz (Diane Lane) in New York, waiting for summer when he wants to visit South America with his anthropologist's father. The father he knows only about letters and videos) when the drug bust drastically changes his life: one of the wealthiest clients of Liz, Ogden Osborne (Donald Sutherland), rescues his family and moves them into ten acres of real estate. and power. In return, as Osborne's personal masseur, Liz and Finn can live in the mansion with the "dirty rich" Osbornes - daughter of Mrs Langley (Elizabeth Perkins) and grandchildren Bryce (Chris Evans) and Maya (Kristen Stewart). Osborne and his doctor run Liz on drying and with Finnish bonds between Osborne and his grandchildren, and despite the difference between the poor and the affluent, the living situation works for a while. Incidents are changing for hours, and the Finn is attacked and raped by a Finn, which is a turning point for the film and the Finnish view of the Osborne family. Osborne reveals his past to the Finns and together they can discover the truth about Finni's worrying incident - as well as the abundant class of acute illness. <br /> <br /> The film uses many tribal actions during the film. drawing some disturbing parallels for some more complex scenes. For the viewer who works well, but if the director chooses an adult regalia in the context of the Osborne Heritage, the term seems to be forced to "get". Maid Jilly (Paz de la Huerta) and the different subplots between Finland and the introduction of obese slowed critic Whitney (Branden Williams) draw the edge of credibility by emphasizing the line between wealthy and lower classes, but performances: Sutherland, Lane and Yelchin are strong enough to make us movie outdated forgive. Not a big movie, but one of many worthwhile ideas that collided around the screen, which often seems to have disappeared in its struggle for direction. Grady Harp
