I've never read this book, but I've always heard about it. So when the movie came out, I had to see it, but never. Now it has come out on a DVD and I have rented it for a few weeks. Last night it finally rose. I am very glad that I did it. <br /> <br /> The film is incredible in this movie. Landscape etc. ... everyone made you feel like you were in Kabul. Action was all very good, although I am sure some emotions have been lost in translation. And the story itself was good and clean and exhilarating. Yes, this story was very sad but at the same time uplifting. remember when I think about it. Show me Afghanistan in front of the Taliban. She showed me a place that was beautiful. He showed me a place with good-hearted people. I am a community that was like a family, with some bully. <br /> <br /> Anyway I recommend this movie to everyone. This is one of the best I've ever seen.
