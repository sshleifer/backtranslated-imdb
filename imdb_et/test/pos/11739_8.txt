At second sight, it's still a great romance, which I think is much better than the movie associated with my 2-DVD set, Leo McCarey's Weepie classic "Memorial". However, it seems to have been a bit unsuccessful (only 6.2 in IMDb and many critics abandon it). As sad as it is an intelligent romantic drama with two good ways, Jennifer Jones and William Holden. If something were to be memorable for the film, colorful cinematography and unforgettable musical score. I don't like Valentine's Day, but it gave me a pretext for watching this movie again and I'm happy about it. Although I still think that the death of Holden's character has been too heavily anticipated, taking the latest scenes, this movie is very mobile and I really enjoy it.
