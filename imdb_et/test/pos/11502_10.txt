This movie is great. The best thing I've ever seen in my life. Ingvar E Sigurðsson is the best Icelandic actor and, of course, Hilmir Snær and Bjorn. Great music and sound. Cold hard reality man fighting with many problems and people in his life. Black humor blends with an excellent example and the style of European art films, it works, it is one of the best Icelandic films. I'll tell you. "Look at this movie, you won't regret it." I gave her 9 stars. If you see one Icelandic movie in your life ... Look at it
