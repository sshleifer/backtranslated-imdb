PEOPLE ARE STUPID.You should not be delighted if Paris kills the pipe head! This is the usual rude! What did Paris do to you? What if it's you? You wouldn't want people to rejoice because of your death! Anyway, it was really nice what I liked and it was cool when Elisha's finger broke. It was weird that they didn't have 2 sons who had a tree and everything. Paris and a man from Cousin Skeeter who makes out.Lol.K bye.
