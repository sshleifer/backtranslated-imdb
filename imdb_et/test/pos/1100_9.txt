I'm surprised that the title of this movie is confusing. Obviously, this is the study of the nature of modern love. This suggests that love is love, when it is good, but where people reserve the right to bring themselves up, and when they get tough, they get out and go for something else. <br /> <br /> This observation has a generational effect, as it follows from generation X, makes comments on the generation X, and finally it is directed at the X generation. It is disappointing that love has changed what Baby Boomers, the parents of the X generation, have changed. had caused marriages and family life and gave the generation X an innocent and rich childhood that it finally enjoyed. <br /> <br /> The X generation's attitude to love is, of course, flippant, but decision-making and engagement have been interrupted, the biggest accident being X-generation children. It turns out at the end of the movie and was so sharp that I took a week to recover from this epiphany's shock.
