Many teen sex comedy movies come and go without a lot of fanfare, but every so often movie can come with honest, funny, fun and memorable movies. The last American Virgin is a special film that has found its place and stood in time, combining all four ingredients. This film follows the misadventures of the three friends (Gary, Rick and David "The Big Apple") for the first world of sex and true love. On the way they learn a lot about the lessons and the value of true friendship. We follow the hopeless romantic Gary (The protagonist) in her quest to win her dream girl, leading her to an uncertain path with a surprise twist at the end. If you have not seen this happiness yet, see that all the movies are memorable with 80's songs all the time, so that things move smoothly. L.A.V. it really is the original text, which is the rarity of films in this genre.
