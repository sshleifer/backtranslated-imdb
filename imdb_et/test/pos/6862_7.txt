I found a movie I was expecting. Although I'm tired because I have a fear of needles, I started to wait. So if you are not in needles, blood, human body and some good medical fun, put this movie back and rent another one. As the other user commented, I was also in a comforted movie in German. I'm an American who just moved to Germany to stay in the family and see it lying on the shelf. I love psychological thrillers, and I'd say it's somewhere on this line. The character gets into the places and feels wrong. Trying to complain about your way out and find the truth, things get a little sticky and others aren't so sure he's on the right track. So throughout the movie, who's anatomy is kept, look at the look and round the next corner.
