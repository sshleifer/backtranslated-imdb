This movie was much better than I expected. ++++ Jean Peters works as a pirate in a truly satisfying job and decent work in his sword fight. (To the extent that he has double action, it's hard to say ... but Peters himself probably does it a lot and does it well.) ++++ A good and serious script could have been a great movie. But it is basically cheesy. Still having fun. ++++ Not up to the regular Jacques Tournier movie, but definitely over the usual Jean Peter movie. Color is typical for its 50's, ie. too harsh and not realistic. The actors of Blackbeard and his first companion and drunk doctor were good. Louis Jordan was a bit weak. I don't think Debra Paget was right. Certainly, Jean Peters and Debra Paget were probably the two best-looking women in the 50s.
