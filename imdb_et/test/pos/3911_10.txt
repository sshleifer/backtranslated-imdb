I loved this movie !! I've been waiting for this movie to come out so I can see it. I saw it opening the evening and loved it. Some people told me that this movie was not good and stayed away, but I thought it was great. The actors did great and it was scary and made me jump. Paris Hilton did an excellent job for his first film, all giving him a hard time when he made it big and had no great role to play. The set was great when it was made of all waxes and how it was made. The two brothers did a great job and were great in terms of death. The killers were really scary and made me want to close my eyes and not look at them. I can't wait for this movie to appear on the Video so I can see it again and again. A review of my review is to see this movie if you like Hororr movies and you're not sorry that I loved this movie. I'm giving this movie out of 10 out of 10 ROCKS !!!
