Philippe Garrel makes us breathe in the forgotten atmosphere of Nouvelle Vague, which has almost disappeared from the remains of his old glory, but is ready to come back. Those who are a little less familiar with the director's themes, on the other hand, can very well know how obsessed it is about the weakness of reality because of the lasting loss. That's why "Les amants réguliers" show us parallel stories about "amour fou" and the bullied revolution destroyed under the leadership of young French students. <br /> <br /> The first part of the story is May 2006, about the dramatic events in France that appeared with stunning sequences, a kind of cinema verité that puts the student in the uprising other than the enviable light of the pitch-black background. The peculiarities of black and white photography used to describe the battle between the students and the police can be said to be many where high contrasts provide an unrealistic atmosphere and the darkness is closed to the secret of these fascinating bodies. The images that are completely without words indicate the actual consistency of the myth of the violence of raw materials, which is increasingly emphasized in the astonished reality of film training. The individual does not read anything here: he tends to disappear in the mass. In these fighting scenes, the importance of mass-recommendation, the rage of a juvenile attack, the violent eulogies of violence, even if they are intended as separate units, are really important, except for any emotions, the cold and entomologist's intention to catalog their insect from afar. <br /> <br /> The second part of the story is described more quietly and intimately. Standing on the horizon is an irritating portrait of a self-centered generation in search of their lost time, which is completely unattractive to the individual values ​​of men, inclined to turn their opium between opium smoke and make a recent defeat at the funeral of his funeral. <br /> <br /> "Les amants réguliers" from time to time seems to be highlighting the shadow of the great Robert Bresson, which Garrel is particularly sensitive to, uncorrected, and devoid of main argument. perspectives on human disappointment that may hurt the truth. In my opinion, the story tries to penetrate deeply into the story when a person lets himself go and play things through his ear, he probably finds that he can bring out his own blind with terrible and irreversible consequences.
