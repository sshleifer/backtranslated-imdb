I don't know why critics do this strange and macabre. I really don't. Dark -yes, odd - no. It's sad and a lot of emotions, especially Pinguin's story. They say it has S & M elements, but I really can't find anything except the Catwoman whip. <br /> <br /> This movie is deeper than its genre and the villains are not just some crazy clothes like dressed in disguise. They have strong motives with strong feelings. Catwoman (Michelle Pfeifer's great performance!) Not just a sexy chick who likes to tilt jewelery - she is in her personal crusade and Pinguin. Danny DeVito). Again, I think Michael Keaton is the best Batman and he's wearing his costume well. <br /> <br /> You can fully see that this is Tim Burton's film because he has an unusual style and a very talented man. But music is also fantastic and suited to emotions.
