I don't care what some comments said, this movie was funny. The thing about this movie is that you can't wait for anything but entertainment. It's not an intellectual comedy, it's a smart popcorn movie. The three main cast members are big and work very well with each other. Shatner is a forerunner of a former, former TV policeman who has been raised by Russo to train the police to be "TV police". These are the most funny scenes. If you want to have fun and just laugh, check out this movie.
