I'm not really t.v. Observer - except for ages 6 to 8 and "general hospital" was still Luke and Laura - but there are some exceptions and I certainly think "Queen of the Queen" is one of them. Every decade it is a classic and I think this exhibition must (or damn-well) be the best of this decade. Its comedic timing is awesome and can sometimes be right odd. "More serious", the actors are more than able to deliver fine - and not so fine :) - the complexity of their characters without moving. One comment wrote that it could take a few episodes and I agree; it is definitely one that grows on you, but when you are in, you're pretty much hooked. And for good reasons!
