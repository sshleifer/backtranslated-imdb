Paul Bettany played a big role as a tortured father whose tragedy girl dies tragically due to illness. For that, he deserves all the credit. But the film was mostly exactly that Darwin's adventure was supposed to gather data about his theories, because the incomplete stories offered to the children and the controversy over his ideas were completely missed. <br /> <br /> Two things disturbed me terribly: the soundtrack, the amazing sound of which is a virtually exhausting viewer in the throat and movie trailer, showing some beautiful landscapes, the theological connections between him and his wife, and the enthusiasm of his best friends when they are preparing for battle blind against faith, thus presenting the film incorrectly. <br /> <br /> To put it plainly, the removal of movie trailer scenes from the movie would be uneven. child's death and the difficulties of his parents. It is clear that not what I was waiting for in a movie from Darwin, although the film was beautifully interpreted.
