I had the privilege of participating in a regional premiere in this area, one of the funniest British films ever, the plot is fantastic, focusing on a young girl who involuntarily becomes her ideal man at a computer fair, while creating a copy. The self, who falls in love with him, is full of jokes, both visual and phonetic, and has a bright and fresh feeling, and the actor is of excellent quality that appears in the UK on July 2. must see it !!!
