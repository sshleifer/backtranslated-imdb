The Coen Brothers are really surprised by the three escaped in captivity. Although it is based on "Odyssey", an ancient work by Homer, you don't have to read "Odyssey" to track the story. Brothers Coen are woven with pulp and aura of pulp! The soundtrack is characteristic of the film, although it is like the soundtrack is a product and the film is a wrapping paper. Every character is perfectly used and pondering back to the old days when the films were rich with character actors, whose appearance in the film adds wealth, texture and authenticity. George Clooney is great because he is hairy Everett Ulysses McGill, who is an honest con committed to language and vocabulary comic and love. O Brother, where Art Thou is the best Coen movie, as well as Clooney's best efforts. Clooney is good enough to justify the nomination of the best actor, such as Tim Blake's Nelson imagination, Delmar's friend, while the film itself deserves the best movie.
