I agree with the Mexican monster, which is the weakest of today's Scooby Doo films, mainly because of the weak plot and when all this was predictable. However, Loch Ness Monster is a remarkable improvement, with great animation, and Scottish beautifully looked beautiful. The music is good and the plot is well thought out. Plus, there are some great dialogues, and the voice acted was fabulous, Casey Kasem's consistent pleasure in Shaggy, and the beautiful Scottish singer Sheena Easten's pleasant surprise visitor starring role. In fact, my only complaint was a strange accent on one or two voice members, except Easten, whose accent was real, and somehow the Loch Ness monster was not as well designed as he had the potential. In general, it is a solid and enjoyable Scooby Doo film. 8/10 Bethany Cox
