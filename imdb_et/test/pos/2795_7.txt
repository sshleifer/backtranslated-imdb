** SPOILERS AHEAD ** <br /> <br /> It is really a pity that such a well-produced film is such a disappointment. I thought it was full of (foolish) clichés and <br /> <br /> that it was trying hard. <br /> <br /> For (American) men there: How many of you spend your girlfriend on a bed and make a monkey <br /> <br />? (Married) For Girls: How Many Of You Have Suddenly <br /> <br /> Stayed Nymphs, But Not With Your Spouse <br /> <br />? In French: would you really ask somebody <br /> <br /> if you're "à la fac" if you know they're not speaking French? Don't you use <br /> <br /> a more common word like "université"? <br /> <br /> I lived in France for a while and I know and understand <br /> <br /> Europe (and I love it), but my (German) roommate and I found it <br /> <br /> pretty offensive. It looked like a movie funded by the European Parliament <br /> <br />. It had all the differences he was trying to interconnect (not a bad thing <br /> <br /> in itself), but the result is at best inconvenient but actually ridiculous-- too <br /> <br /> many clashes it wouldn't really happen. Then all the other parts destroyed <br /> <br /> the end of the movie - the last 10 minutes. Why don't Xavier <br /> <br /> speak to Erasmus students with whom he meets in Paris? Why is he just walking? Why does he just go away from his job, is it "<br /> <br />" freedom "? And finally, should the new Europe rest? <br /> <br /> A number of people who smoke and lurk all day? Is that what it consists of? <br /> <br /> Moreover, the action was quite terrible. I can't believe Judith is Godrèche's role and action. Why did he do as he looks like Emanuelle Béart? At first I thought Xavier was fine, but afterwards I thought he was pretty bad. <br /> <br /> And all this is really too bad because technically (opening credits, <br /> <br /> scenes when he asks what papers he needs) it was really <br /> <br /> good (except sound editing around British siblings), and the soundtrack was also great. So the form was good, but the content was pretty terrible.
