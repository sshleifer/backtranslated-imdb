The film of the 1990s with Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger is rightly praised for the praise and I enjoyed it very much, but this original television is just as good and in some ways more suitably cast. Claire Bloom is not a dirty joy, but she is still confident and throws her cover to her favorite author (played by Joss Ackland in one of her best performances). <br /> <br /> Quieter, calmer and less emotional than this is Attenborough's movie, but it's fair, a wonderful game full of meaningful dialogue. You still fell to this version, but you may not have musical clues to turn you off. <br /> <br /> There is room for both of them - and having seen it on stage, I would say that Ackland / Bloom is a bit more loyal. But they're both great.
