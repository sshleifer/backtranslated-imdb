I need to be a little skeptical when I entered the cinema to see OSS117: French comedies nowadays tend to be so pleased that only the most stupid are high scores in the country's office. But I was surprised that although humor does not always reach Monthy Python levels, many references to the French vision of the world in 1950, represented by OSS117, are fun and that the director managed to revive the style of film making at this time with amazing fidelity. In short, a little good surprise, not to mention the excellent performances of the different secondary actors. And at least once, the style of Jean Dujardin (which can get the nerves of many people) perfectly matches his playable character.
