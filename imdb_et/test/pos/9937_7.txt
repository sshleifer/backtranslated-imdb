Opera (the title of the United States is opera fear) has somewhat fallen after some of Dario's other films such as Phenomena, Tenebre and Suspiria. (I still can't find Infernot.) This is one of those films that has a big first half, but in the middle it's like someone started to let the air out of the scenario and the logic slowly. <br /> <br /> The main plot includes a beautiful opera singer spoken by a spoiled obsession fan. this killer will kill the closest people in the most unique way. he ties and drags the tiny sharp pins of his and the tape under the eyelids, so that when he tries to close his eyes, he goes out. it forces him to look when the killer usually murders his acquaintances in brutal and goronic Argento fashion. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, around the middle of the movie becomes sluggish and illogical. (This is especially aimed at the motivation of the killer. I have still not fully elucidated why he is such a nut.) The end is especially in the worst possible way from the left. <br /> <br /> But in about the first hour or so it's some of Dario's best movies and the camera's work is breathtaking. too bad that it couldn't keep it up. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7
