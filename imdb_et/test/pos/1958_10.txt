I hope the writer, director, editor and composer (and don't forget the producer) will read it ... because their work was truly unbelievable in this film. Let me start by saying that I have nothing to do with this movie. I'm just an ordinary guy who's been a fan of this movie for about 12 years and seen it about 8 times. <br /> <br /> Every movie touches every second. Each scene is classic. Operation is real. The film is honest. These characters can be associated with people, not with actors. <br /> <br /> This story follows three different killers in different stages of their lives. The story is carefully thought out and each subline is intertwined and woven, ending with a message that leaves us thinking about the right and wrong values ​​that each of us carries. <br /> <br /> Crispen Glover, Daniel Roebuck, Dennis Hopper and Joshua John Miller (as a 12-year-old boy) give absolutely amazing, real performances. I've seen this movie about 8 times and I get so absorbed to forget that I watch the movie. It's so good. Great work for everyone who worked on it. Great work. <br /> <br /> Music is great and haunted. With regard to the selected wave, carefully timed editing and pace, mood and tone, and even the subject, the director made some of the best decisions about the film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This movie is pretty. It's honest. This is a real movie experience I never forget. You may not be related to the subject, but it is something you cannot ignore. Ultimately it is human people ... and everyone can be involved. I recommend this movie to fans of drama, arrest and horror over almost every other movie.
