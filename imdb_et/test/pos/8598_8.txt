Well, where do you start? I stumbled over it in 1993 and just hit the "record" video recorder, more than anything else. "Citizen Kane" is not sure ... but if you have had a bad day and have a mood that crashes through something that is not too intellectually stimulating, then I would suggest that it may be your "thing" <br / > <br /> We have a lot here - a big title, more stereotypes, if you can shake, unconscious comedy, all the time and more, more, more! David Hemmings plays the opposite of the diameter of his role in the classic "Blow Up" of the 1960s, still in a hormone-stimulated, but not "fairly" similar role. <br /> <br /> John Philip Law is an easy slut The actor who sees the log appears unlikely, but it would not be fair to see how he warned about 5 minutes before accepting the role. <br /> <br /> Wexler as "Amanda"? Suffice it to say that it was his only and only movie role! But the real star of this movie is Ethel Evans, who plays a, do we say secretary (?), Where is the moral and ambition of some inclined cat. The way he manages to reconcile his present life with his comic husband in the future is, in fact, quite touching, earthy, sharp-on-the-way. <br /> <br /> I love this movie when I'm for this mood ....... and don't touch it with the proverb if I'm not. <br /> <br /> Tissue it to keep a (relatively) straight face when filming. <br /> <br /> "Classic" Edward D Wood Cinema School!
