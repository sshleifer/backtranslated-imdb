Surprisingly good documentary. My surprise was mainly due to the fact that the title messed up with me. I assumed that this would affect the impact of the drug culture on film making, but this is not a much more ambitious and intelligent film than could have been expected. Demme has done a great job from the late 60's to the late 70's. From the "Easy rider" and the collapse of studio effects through all of their introspective "real life" films, where brilliant young directors tried to express themselves politically, sexually and artistically, men and their studios made money until the beginning of blockade and the return of governments. As a person who saw the "live" movies of Britain and the rest of Europe in the sixteenth and then the revolutionary US films of the 1970s and is sad that the sequel is so much more, it was the most exciting film. Interview clips are measured (thanks to the DVD, full interviews are available as extras!) And movie clips well. I am also impressive that someone who has just arrived, "Joe," is that this important little movie gets well.
