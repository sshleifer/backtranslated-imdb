Heya Denver fans! Animation is a classic of comics and one of my favorite (and yes, it was also broadcast in Europe. Including my little Central European country, Slovenia! = :) Oh, how do I miss the 80's cartoons !! Frankly, they were better than today's children. More imagination, creative, fun, good morals, more substance, great story and great character voices. Today's computers do not have all these features at animated shows. So all of you who agree and want to bring back all the exhibitions, so that today's generation of kids will see the entertainment that these cartoons bring to us, sign in to the side who posted, and write down the best cartoons for 80s repetitions! <br /> <br /> http://www.thepetitionsite.com / 1 / me-want-80-year-old-child-comic-kids-show channel <br /> <br /> Carpe Denver! =) <br /> <br /> Down
