During my trip to the Youth Forum I was a channel channel until I found Tommy Boy in TBS. Since I've never seen this movie, I wanted to watch it. My roommate, who has already seen it, told me, "This film is classic." After seeing the whole movie, I came to the conclusion that he was right. <br /> <br /> "Tommy Boy" is always funny from start to finish, thanks to Chris Farley and David Spade comedian. Farley is a rebellion like the character of a title, a spastic doofus who simply lives through life if it is not important. His slacker-esqe was soon stopped by his father (Brian Dennehy), a wealthy "Break Pads King", dying of a heart attack on his wedding day. This brings Tommy with the help of his sarcastic childhood friend, Richard (David Spade), to sell enough breakers to rescue the company. <br /> <br /> The main reason why Tommy Boy is working is funny things leading. Farley is the funniest of this movie, the second more fun person is Spade, and the third is Rob Lowe, a movie villain with bad luck. Another funny guy is Dan Aykroyd Ray Zalinsky, known for the extraordinary car parts. <br /> <br /> Another reason why the movie works is a lot of fun. Chris Farley has fun moments and David Spade has funny comments and one liner. The movie's gags (some related to deer and airplane) are ridiculous funny thanks to director Peter Segal (Naked Gun 33 1/3), writers Bonnie & Terry Turner <br /> <br /> 70s exhibitions) and cast. <br /> <br /> "Tommy Boy" is a really funny movie, although for some unknown reason most movie critics (including Roger Ebert) find it terrible and uncomfortable. (Interestingly, when their sense of humor died.) I recommend "Tommy Boy" to those who are big comedy fans. Thank you very much, roommate.
