In "Hoot" a new child arrives from Montana to Florida. First of all, he faces the problems of mixing and dealing with traditional local temptation. Soon he will know a bigger problem: the franchise restaurant chain is trying to build a place in the city, just where many owls live. The appearance of this movie is a family film, but it is more radical than it seems, because it shows compassionately how Roy and a couple of friends do not abandon the offense (including private property vandalism and briefly robbing the head of the restaurant chain) for environmental protection (rescue of owls, not less) . These activities can now be accepted or not, but at least the film has the courage not to blame its convictions. Good, solid film, total.
