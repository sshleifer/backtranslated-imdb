I don't know why I haven't heard of this movie before. This is a really great comedy (I'd say farce, but it's been too good and I wouldn't want to underestimate that quality). The comedic character of Kedia Bates and Rupert's pair of Kathy Bates and Rupert's general differences explores the general differences between mid-crisis, inequality with gays who cannot recognize their long-term trade unions. Everett has a great impact. Forget about Julia Roberts and Rupert; Kathy Bates and Rupert should make another movie. Anxiety, acerbic and outrageous girl Maudie (Meredith Eaton) is a truly wonderful character. If you liked the city movies, you would like this unique wizard.
