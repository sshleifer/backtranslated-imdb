(WARNING: SPOILERS!) <br /> <br /> Five young people ignore the warnings of the forest keeper George Kennedy and hike up to the foggy Oregon hills, where they are lurked and polished by a couple of large, deformed, bred twins. When only two have left, Warren and his girlfriend Connie return to their animal instincts to survive. The movie ends with Connie, pulling her throats down the murderer's throat, strangling her to death. Very powerful when somewhat overpriced back is slippery, the efficient use of light, sound and photography makes it higher than the usual FRIDAY THE 13TH deposit. Lead an attractive, pleasant pain, especially with Deborah Benson (where is he now?) And Gregg Henry, this casual companion of Jeff Lieberman's SQUIRM (1976) and BLUE SUNSHINE (1977) must not miss.
