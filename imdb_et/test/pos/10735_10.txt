No, it has nothing to do with sitcom "Seinfeld" or its eccentric and fun character with Cosmo Kramer. In reality, "Kramer vs Kramer" is a beautiful drama film that is undoubtedly one of the best kind and one of the biggest films. I'm glad it won more Oscars than "Apocalypse now" because it really deserves such glory. <br /> <br /> "Kramer vs Kramer" is a great movie, so well done and so well balanced that I don't want to change anything about it. There's nothing wrong with the movie. This is the highest quality film. And this is also a test of time. Not only does it not seem dated, but its cultural impact is long-lasting and its realistic story is as great as it appeared in 1979. Timeless classic. They don't make such films today. <br /> <br /> This movie is dramatic, realistic, simple, yet brilliant, intense, powerful, sweet and even tragic and sometimes frustrating. But it also has good humor. He has no special effects, but who cares? It's not a movie or a place to discuss such a thing. For such a movie, such a thing would be pointless and absolutely unnecessary. The story is very interesting. The chemistry of the actors is just perfect. All actors are big, but the 3 main ones are the best. Brilliant actor Dustin Hoffman has his greatest performance here as a lovable but distant work for Ted Kramer. Meryl Streep is great when Ted's wife Joanna. And the lovely little Justin Henry is amazing as a loving but sometimes stubborn son of Billy, Ted and Joanna. <br /> <br /> Music is all instrumental and wonderful. The open song (guitarist Frederic Hand) is great. The rest of the soundtrack is mostly Antonio Vivaldi's classic music and it's just dazzling. <br /> <br /> This movie also has amazing character development. Take a look at the character Ted Kramer: a carer who changes after being left without choice, an amazing father, but taking care of his son, trying to adapt these new responsibilities to his work after Joanna's wife left. By doing this, Ted learns the most beautiful things in life, but also understands how life is, the problems that accompany her work, and the return of Joanna who wants to take care of her son. But even Joanna gets better and the end is an unexpected surprise when she first sees it. <br /> <br /> This movie also includes some things, such as courtroom scenes, where both Ted and Joanna see a brutal character. murders of lawyers. Another thing to see is when poor Billy falls into the gym with his toy (airplane) in the jungle and gets seriously injured in his face. But then again, the scene is very well done and the next one is very intense: his father runs fast and crosses numerous blocks, ignoring traffic to bring his son to hospital. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a movie that is a good lesson. <br /> <br /> It should definitely be in the Top 250.
