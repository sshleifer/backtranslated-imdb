Beguiled is a pretty satisfying film for those who are following the above-mentioned things. It's a disappointment for Clint Eastwood's dead fans. Although Eastwood does his best in this atypical role (except for the fact that his character is a charming female woman he is not so familiar with), his character is a vague nature that goes from being a sort of fallen hero to a manipulative and unsatisfactory woman who eats (that to say it), it is too much for everyone who saw him playing the heroes in the best Western tradition, morally impure, but still without the dark side. I think he can pull this unlikely part out, but those who really steal the show are two rival women, a school teacher, Geraldine Page, and a student leader, played by Elizabeth Hartman. <br /> <br /> We see that every person has a potential devil and a potential witch for every woman, especially when it comes to sexuality and sexual desire. Hartman Edwina is the world's most beloved, innocent girl, until she is saddened and acquired by John McBurney. This causes both the tragedy and the secret lust of the director, the forbidden fruit. He carries a great and ugly secret about his blood relationship with his brothers, who he still does to idol. The fourth factor in this "sacred" spiral of love is the evil Carol, played by Jo Ann Harris, who attracts John away from his breaking in Edwin and bed. <br /> <br /> The whole story of this movie is a kind of gothic feeling that makes it quite rare in the western genre, but a popular thing in 70s movies. The unique achievement of the Siegel / Eastwood team and the movie with no weak heart.
