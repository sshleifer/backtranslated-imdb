I've seen this movie more than once and it's worth it. For those who love to overcome martial arts and internal conflict, this is a worthy choice. After seeing the film, I wanted to be a more productive member of the society because I could associate the path of approval and the necessary way with the inner confusion of the girl. Of course, Mr Miyagi always gives his sage. 2 thumbs up!
