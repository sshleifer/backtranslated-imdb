A movie about two Australian girls - Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight) - and what happens when they become a girlfriend of two surfer boys. <br /> <br /> I tried this art cinema here in America in 1981. I was still a teenager technically (I was 19 years old), so I was interested in how Australian teenagers acted. There is nothing new here. It shows the usual teenage adventures dealing with dating, sex, suicide, etc. I always knew what would happen before it happened, but I was never bored. Interestingly, despite the accent and some changes in clothing and hair, these teens are not very different from American teenagers. They had many of the same difficulties and hangings. It was also based on the book of a true surfer girl and her real life adventures and (I heard) it was a faithful adaptation. The actor was just OK, but the actors were attractive and well done and quite interesting. So it's not a crafted masterpiece, but a pretty accurate picture of what it is like a teenager and trying to be with popular kids. I'll give her 7.
