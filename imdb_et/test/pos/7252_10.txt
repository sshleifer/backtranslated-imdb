This movie is great. Stylish, fun and good actor. I saw it being described differently as "lock, stock and two smoking muskets" and "reservoir fops", both of which are excellent descriptions. The plot is simple, but it doesn't harm pleasure. Carlyle is an excellent vibrating tree and Miller is a great drunk gentleman. Sets and costumes are stunning and music and camera work are unusual for "costume drama". Sense and sensitivity are definitely not !!!!! My recommendation? Go look, sit back with a huge popcorn and enjoy the time.
