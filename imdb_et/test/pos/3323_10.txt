I first saw this movie in 1959 at the Hoyts Double Bay Cinema in Sydney when it was 15 years old. I loved it then and still. The ensemble's cast is great - these days the actors acted "naturally" and "felt" in their respective roles. The "glossy" period of the film - the connections that still relate to the modern world, but now the sexes are at the same level, women should not be allowed or should not be allowed to show the type of treatment previously shown. The soundtrack music is wonderful and it is a pleasure that Film Score Monthly released CDs in January 2005. Unfortunate scenes were cut before release - even two hours you want more! I've registered with Amazon for a DVD (they now have a special page). Watching this movie in CinemaScope after forty-six years of panning and scanning is great. Twentieth Century Fox, please see the creators of your fifties catalogs for the production of CinemaScope DVDs - there is a big market. Waiting for the arrival of the United States from March 2004 on the Vanity Fair Special Movie, which has said it is fifteen pages with many photos. Greeting.
