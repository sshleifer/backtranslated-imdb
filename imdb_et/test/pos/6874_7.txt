The almost wonderful mix of comedy, romance, and medical chaos is the 50-fold swinging single doctor who is tired of going to rock concerts with amazing air heads, looking at the patient at his age he met in his round. Julius Epstein's scenario shows quite a lot of complexity, although he does not have enough material to fill the last third of the picture, and the film can almost slip. The subheading on the hospital that is being investigated for its poor business issues has not been satisfactorily worked and it still seems very compressed. But Walter Matthau and Glenda Jackson are a terrible team, Richard Benjamin and Art Carney are very supportive. Director Howard Zieff keeps it all, and even if Epstein's lining-up liners feel Neil Simon rejects, Zieff is really thrilling. The results are dry and sometimes quite sweet. Followed by unsuccessful TV series. *** from ****
