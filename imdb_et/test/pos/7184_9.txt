I was a little scared when I went to the cinema to see this movie. Indeed, it is always difficult to make a movie from the comic and the first episode of the two biggest hero adventures in France was good, but not fantastic. Finally, it is very funny from the beginning to the end of unexpected gags, some comics, timings, great FX, great selection, amazing landscapes, amazing everything !!! <br /> <br /> How do they manage to translate all French names into English or German because it is definitely French, but how does it work in another language?
