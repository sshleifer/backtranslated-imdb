I was very impressed with this film, if nothing more than comedy. It may not always be the most complicated humor, but I found it suitable for every scene. <br /> <br /> The movie's flow is definitely a bit confusing, sometimes almost confusing, but it is so bad. Sometimes we look at a bit of strokes and other scenes revolve around the decisive discourse of relative attitude. It may be a bit frustrating for certain viewers, but it brought me closer to the dilemmas of the irregular chaos characters. <br /> <br /> The actors are very good. I'm a big fan of Andy Richter, but I wasn't over the head because everyone else seems to be. He did very well, but Julianne Nicholson and Lauren Graham stole my exhibition in my own way. Jay Mohr works as expected when you see him in other movies. I've always liked her. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is very funny and offers some nice bases for some type of relationship. In the case of relationship issues and problems, some movies try to surprise. There is nothing surprising about the conclusions provided here, but their entertaining dating is interesting throughout the film.
