PINK FLAMINGOS is the title of highly crafted sick films that is an undisputed classic. Of course, the camera work is trembling and out of center, the story is confusing and slow, and the character of each movie is disgusting and despicable, but PINK FLAMINGOS has a certain playful charm and a brilliant satirical sense that no other film is suitable, though this movie is really offensive, then reading the description in the movie is much worse than actually seeing it. Only John Waters can do rape, murder, sadism, cannibalism, copropagia, and almost every person who is known to people is completely fun. This movie must be considered credible.
