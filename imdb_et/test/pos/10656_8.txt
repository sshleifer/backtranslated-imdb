There are only a handful of movies that were made on such a large scale and made such a difference in the art of making a film. <br /> <br /> "Bronenosets Potyomkin" is one of those movies and it should be a list of someone who wants to know more about cinema history. <br /> <br /> Grigory Aleksandrov and Sergei M. Eisenstein led this groundbreaking film that documented the horrors of the Russian battleship. When the sailors finally accept their superiors, they are accepted and supported by the locals. Things are stupid when small soldiers are sent to a small business to take care of business. Next, one of the most mysterious scenes in cinema history. Anyone who has seen "The Untouchables" and "Bronenosets Potyomkin" knows exactly what I mean. <br /> <br /> In general, I think this film raised the bar making the film just like "intolerance" a few years earlier. If you don't care about quiet movies, do yourself a favor and see "Bronenosets Potycom". <br /> <br /> If you don't like quiet movies ..... see "Bronenosets Potyomkin". <br /> <br />
