"Hitch" is a nice surprise: romantic comedy with romance and comedy. Most romantic comedies range from medium to terrible because they are not funny or romantic. "Hitch" takes actors like Will Smith, Kevin James and Eva Mendes for a fun, light-as-feathers journey that actually made me laugh and, yes, a little "aww, sweet!" <br /> <br /> Meet Alex Hitchens (Will Smith), named Hitch. He has himself proclaimed "Doctoral Degree"; He helps hopeless men like Albert (Kevin James) to win men like Allegra (Amber Valletta). Unfortunately, Hitch has to deal with Sarah (Eva Mendes), a gossip columnist who created a date to break a doctor ... <br /> <br /> 'Hitch' is actually pretty funny, and it even does a normal slapstick scene because the cast is so energetic and clearly fun. I have to think about why Will Smith hasn't done more with such movies. His sharp and fast fire is perfect for this genre, and his chemistry with Mendes and James is wonderful. James is a real discovery; I've never seen my "Queens King" show, but it's funny and affectionate, and he proves once again that fat white men can't dance hip-hop (Smith's answers to his experiments are fun). Mendes is hot and bouncy (not so, geez) as Smith's perfect encounter and Amber Valletta is as sweet as Allegra. <br /> <br /> 'Hitch' is not perfect; it's too long and things are going to be too "dramatic" near the end (although it is redeemed by a happy ending full of funny dance). But is it a great refresher of the romantic comedies of cookie cutters that hold the theater.
