A few years before SCREAM broke the horror / horror genre of fun, self-conscious young things, knowing all the tricks of what to do and not to do in a precarious situation, a small film produced in Russia was hit by grandiose grievances without theaters. <br /> <br /> This movie was MUTE WITNESS. Unknown Unknown (Except for the extremely short pulpit of Sir Alec Guinness, whose scenes were supposedly filmed eight years before the actual filming of this film), this story told Billie, a quiet make-up artist, who works in Russia to produce and staged the film. sister by the boy Andy. He is not aware that the set is closed when he goes into his stuff and involuntarily stumbles into a porn field that becomes extremely bloody. Terrifyingly, he warns of the presence of murderers in his presence, and finally rescues Andy, who takes the police by warning his home. The problem is that there is no body, no evidence that something like that happened. Nevertheless, the mysterious inspector seems to be on Billie's story ... <br /> <br /> And to say more, the crime would be. MUTE WITNESS is such a film that needs to be viewed in the same way as the most sophisticated, smart thriller, because as much as it is a triller thriller, it pays for films like WAIT UNTIL DARK and Hitchcock's best camera chips, dead humor, Americans who react in foreign countries is powerless, and nail biting until it seems like something has to snap. Even if the story becomes somewhat unlikely due to the fact that the story suddenly becomes the focus of even more conspiracy, the film will not be able to try the audience with cheap shots (such as the unexpected appearance of a person). in a camera with a crash that is a violin), but the fear of the unknown and death is just a shadow. Very smart.
