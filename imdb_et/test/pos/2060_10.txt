I feel very sad for some people who have reviewed this movie. It is obvious that their standards are so high that they can never enjoy the movie simply for enjoyment. Or maybe they have the pleasure of choosing derived films; I'm looking for no reason to dislike them at all? <br /> <br /> Long Kiss Goodnight is an action movie that is in every sense of the word. Of course, the plot has large enough holes to guide the party through, but none of them are enough to stop the film flow. I've never been a big fan of Geena Davis, but I was impressed how she was able to create two very different characters - Samantha Cain and Charlie Baltimore. In my opinion, it was not even necessary to change your physical appearance to distinguish these two ... his actions were more than enough to do the trick. <br /> <br /> More than anything else, this movie was Craig Bierko. In the other hand, Timothy's character could have been just one interchangeable villain. His decision to play him with a more casual approach was just the opposite of all the action scenes. Often you will not find an actor who can express his facial expressions so well ... point case: in the freezer of the scene Charlie and his daughter. If most of the films had become an "revelation" for unnecessary dialogue, Bierko's eyes spoke all the way. <br /> <br /> Basic piece? Thin to be true. Apparently, the average housewife who suffers from amnesia slowly discovers that she was an assassin. As his memory returns, the people who want the assassin dead. Is he really Samantha, baking housewife or Charlie, a cold bloody assassin? Or maybe a little bit? For me the long kiss was a goodnight enjoyable trip.
