ManBearPig is a pretty funny South Park episode. It tells Al Gore and his speeches about global warming, replacing only global warming with ManBearPig (a fictional monster with men, a bear and a pig). it is in the school church and Stan feels regretful so he and the guys decide to stay with him. At the end of the gore, they get trapped in a rock cave where he believes a person is and they are stuck in the days. Meanwhile, Cartman finds treasure, but wants to keep it. ManBearPig is a global warming and generally a funny South Park episode. <br /> <br /> 8/10
