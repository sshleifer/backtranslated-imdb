Helen (Kate Capshaw) owns a seafront bookstore in the unique city of Loblolly. Divorced, Helen has a young daughter who is going to rest in the summer, giving her a little more freedom. Working at Helen Shop is headed by Janet (Ellen DeGeneres), a man-crazy village rumor with eyes on a beautiful firefighter, George (Tom Selleck) and two young students, Jennifer (Julianne Nicholson) and Johnny (Tom Everett Scott). One day, Helen stumbles upon a romantic, delicate letter of love and suspects that Johnny has written it. Waking up to the wind, Helen and Johnny start off for a little while. But the letter later lands in the hands of others, including Janet, who thinks George has sent her, and Johnny, who imagines Helen has done it for her. And goes on and on. But actually, George's eyes on Helen and Jennifer are hard for Johnny. The curator of the city museum can also have a secret love. Were such things as they were out? This is a lovely movie with a great device and capable stars. Each major participant gives a pleasant result, including the addition of Blythe Danner and Gloria Stuart to the aforementioned persons. Also, the most beautiful of coastal decorations, costumes are quite well chosen and photography really is really good. There are some surprises, including fine homosexual development that may not be appealing to all viewers. But for those who love romantic comedies, it should be included in the list of good choices for each genre.
