"Strike Force" or "Librarians" is a fun action movie that doesn't take you too seriously. William Forsythe stands for Simon, who is looking for the lost daughter of a prosperous client. She meets Sandy (Erika Eleniak), who is also looking for someone - her sister. But there are evil bad guys. The worst of all of them is Marcos Canarious (Andrew Divoff). Marcos loves to kill people. So now, Simon and Sandi have team members to lose the villains. The whole cast is great when Divoff steals the movie. Ed Lauter and Burt Reynolds' stick have also come. If you are looking for a good action film, watch it and have a good time.
