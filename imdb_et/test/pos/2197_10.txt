I have this video, as well as a concert version of music with Patti Lupone and George Hearn with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. George Hearn is fantastic in my book, like Angela Lansbury and composer Stephen Sondheim. This music is operative and shows a lot of ingenuity in the composition. I hope that this VHS will be available on DVD! Hearn's performance is strangely sympathetic. One annoying performance is a young woman who sings Joanna's role. I believe that this performance took place at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles rather than at Broadway, and I am not sure that the minimalist set was used in New York as it was in this production. But I found that scaffolding is being dragged across the stage to be "imagining" the streets of London. I highly recommend this movie.
