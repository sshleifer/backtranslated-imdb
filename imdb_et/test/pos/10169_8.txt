Alfred Hitchcock shows the originality of his 1934 British film "The Man Who Knew Too Much". This same story of 1956 is much easier than the previous one. Hitchcock was happy when he was with his companions who went with him from one movie to another, thus maintaining a standard in his work. Robert Burks did an excellent job with cinematography and editing George Tomasin shows his talent. Ultimately, Bernard Herrmann sees the culmination of the picture in London's magnificent Royal Albert Hall. <br /> <br /> James Stewart was an actress who worked well with Hitchcock. In this version, he plays with Indiana on a vacation with his wife and son. When we meet him, they are on their way to Marrakech on a local bus and begin to intrigue. His wife is lovely Doris Day at her best. He was a well-known singer before marriage and now he is the perfect woman and mother. The film has some good support, Brenda DeBanzie, Bernard Miles, Daniel Gelin, Alan Mowbray, among other things, doing a great job of portraying their characters. <br /> <br /> Although this is a "lightweight Hitchcock", one cannot fail it. "The Man Who Knew Too Much" is a change in the pace of Hitchcock fans.
