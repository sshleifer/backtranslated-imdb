Sixth (and last) movie box. Well, I see I'm the best of the last. Ghoulies IV. Originally I did it again like in February, but I decided to make a new one. The Ghoulies series is pretty awesome. I know there are people who don't like them, and that's fine. It happens to be my favorite. Yeah, I know the actual Ghoulies don't show up and they are replaced with 2 boys in costumes, one of which is Tony Cox from Bad Santa. Now, on the film. <br /> <br /> The films focus on Jonathan Graves, who is the main character of the first film by Peter Liapis. the past behind the occult. During the first part of the film, we meet Alexandra (played by a very hot Stacie Randall) who interacts with a demon outside of Faust who is Jonathan's dark side. Faust asks Alexandra for a red gemstone and something gets frightening, releasing Ghoulies from outside. <br /> <br /> I think Jim Wynorski did a good job of driving. And Chuck Cirino's music is also funny. (SPOILER AHEAD) At the end of this movie, Ghoulies say there is Ghoulies IV, Part 2, or Ghoulies V. I hope the sequel will come and I hope Jim Wynorski returns straight. I agree with GimboTheGhoulies.
