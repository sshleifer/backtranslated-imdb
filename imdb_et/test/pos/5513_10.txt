Frankly, this is one of the best horror films I've ever seen. I was fascinated by the story imprisoned by Captain Howdy and my seat edge for the entire journey. I don't understand all the negative comments. <br /> <br /> The body has already been thoroughly discussed; Captain Howdy is an online predator who creates meetings with teenagers, kidnaps them and introduces them to his favorite and body-changing and piercing pastime. Dee Snider is Captain Howdy and he is one of the most terrifying psychopaths ever created; maybe the most frightening because he is so human and you have a feeling (especially if you have a body change at all) that there are people in the world like <br /> <br /> But the biggest reason I liked the movie and the reason why it's so terrible that Captain Howdy becomes a hero. The roles are clear at the beginning of the movie; The victims are innocent, the cop is a good man and Howdy is pure evil. However, the second act has changed things a little. You want Howdy to be evil, but it turns out that he is really just a victim of the circumstances and maybe a good and a bad one is not obvious. It's frightening to find yourself delighted by the "bad" boy. Certainly there are two different "actions", but this film works so well because the two things are back. The first act is a typical psycho-thriller, but the second act is the most troublesome because the viewer reacts to the situation. I don't think it would have worked quite the same way as the second act was expanded and it would have changed to a queue. This is the first horror movie EVER to give me nightmares.
