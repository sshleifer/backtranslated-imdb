Short description of the plot - Duke Duke (voice of Eva Gabor) is a well-polished cat with three small kittens. When their owner, a wealthy elderly woman, known as Madame Adelaide, realizes that her time is over, she decides to write her will, leaving everything she has to her cats. Edgar listens to this and is deeply offended by the idea that cats can all destroy her and her plots with the Duchess and her kittens; he overalls dinner for one night and then leaves them on French land. Duchess and his kittens interact with their element on the street's smart cat, known as Thomas O'Malley (the voice of Phil Harris, who made a big bear Balloo in Jungle Book); after passing Duchess, knowing he is a single mother, O'Malley decides to take them home, because the Duchy actually falls under O'Malley, as the bond of the dependent substitution family evolves; Chaos and Chaos Culminating in O'Malley, His Brothers' Streets and Edgar's Violent Collision. Also featured are British Geese performances, American Southern Canine Dogs (which they make in France) are a mouse that sounds much like "Alice In Wonderland" rabbit (actually expressed by the same guy who sounded Winnie the Pooh) and the horse. Sometimes it's a slow pace, but still an enjoyable Disney business. Includes a memorable "Everybody Wanna Be a Cat" musical that is sung by the late Scatman Crothers (better known as fans of the 1980s, such as Jazz on Transformers). Of course, if it is done now, it would probably be a dark social comment about the division of the class, represented by the gap between the well-bred and well-fed Duchy and the street-born O'Malley.
