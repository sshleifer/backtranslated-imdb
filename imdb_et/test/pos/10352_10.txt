When I saw it on television, I was nervous ... what if they confused it? Millions of families, like mine, who live with a brain-damaged person, are my father in my case. I looked at it with my mother and we both ended up crying, it was so precise and caught up in the way the family knew, as well as someone who had suffered from brain damage. The actors were all wonderful and I had no complaints, my mothers said she couldn't think of it. I hope that this program made many people know what it is like brain damage and what it is for families. More such programs should be done, I was surprised how good it was and it really shook me emotionally.
