I'm not usually a drama / feeling good movie-type guy, but when I saw a "radio" trailer, I couldn't resist. It's not just a big movie, it also has a lot of action. Gooding Jr. of Cuba did an excellent job, depicting James Robert Kennedy, "RAdio". Ed Harris also did a fantastic job as Coach Jones. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw comedy in it. So a good story, a great actor and a little comedy will give "Radio" 10 out of 10!
