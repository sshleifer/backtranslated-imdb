Are the seaside resorts sad, harsh places they always portray as films and novels? Certainly, this film, together with the modern "Don't Look Now", depicts Venice as a particularly dirty and decadent tourist trap (see "Just Married" Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy for a lighter mental approach). If I've never been to Russia, I can't be sure, but it makes a perfect place for Luchino Visconti, one of the greatest stylists in the world cinema. Having seen the film I wish I could have read a short story by Thomas Mann (which also inspired Sir Benjamin Britten's opera). Since I don't know the story and the film has little plot or exposition, I don't know how Aschenbach (Dirk Bogarde) is a young obsession with Tadzio. Is he homosexual? Pedophile? Or is his longing for a beautiful youth something more innocent? Perhaps Tadzio reminds him of what he might have and now he knows he's never. Those who complain about the slow pace of this movie would be caught up in car crashes and kung-fu: 2 hours and 15 minutes are not particularly long, and it is moving slowly but hardly slowly. The film benefits from Gustave Mahler's flourishing music, for which the Aschenbach character is clearly justified. Dirk Bogarde gives a moving presentation and the film is decorated by Silvana Mangano, one of Italy's magnificent ornaments, as the mother of Tadzio.
