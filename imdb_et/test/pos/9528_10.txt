I always try to show this movie on TV, which is luckily quite often. But I forget this video. As it is, I know practically from the heart of the scenario, but it does not prevent me from shouting, actually it probably adds when I cry, knowing what is next. It's such a lovely movie - well done, well cast, good photography. I love it. One of my ten movies.
