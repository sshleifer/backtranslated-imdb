I think every critic who appeared in "Tommy Boy" in 1995 should go back and watch and learn that it's not a bad movie at all. Each critic puts films by Chris Farley and David Spade. Yes "Coneheads" was funny, but it had one assumption and "Black Sheep". I agreed with the critics that this is one of the worst films. But "Tommy Boy" does not belong to the "Coneheads" category, which could have been a bit more fun and "Black Sheep", which is a piece. It's very funny and fun. I agree with the critics that Chris Farley was not John Belushi or John Candy because he claimed that these boys were idolized and these boys were a gene for comedy, but Chris Farley was very funny and I wish he would be longer to prove for critics, Yes, he wasn't John Belushi or John Candy, but he was very funny. Scenes between Farley and Spade, when the nemesis is laterally fun and the prerequisite is laughing waltz. It is very sad that Chris Farley is no longer here to laugh at us, but we have movies like "Tommy Boy" to remember when he was really funny. "Tommy Boy" is one of the best comedies of the 1990s.
