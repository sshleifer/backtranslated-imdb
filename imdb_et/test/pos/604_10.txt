Jim Henson's Muppet Movie is a charming, funny and brilliant film that can be viewed and enjoyed by adults and children. I feel this is my favorite children's film because it combines great characters, great story and great enthusiasm that it is irresistible. The plot includes the Kermit frog (called Henson) and his Odyssey throughout America to follow his dream of Hollywood. On the way, he meets Fozzie Bear, The Great Gonzo (my favorite), Miss Piggy, Rolf and DR. Teeth and electric chaos. <br /> <br /> This movie has so many good things I can't even say. But it is memorable and every time I find a doll or a beanie, I think of this film. Look for suitcases from Mel Brooks, Dom DeLouise, Paul Williams, Madeline Kahn, Bob Hope, Richard Pryor, Steve Martini, Edgar Bergen (and Charlie McCarthey), Elliot Gould, Carol Kane, and Orson Welles. Excellent and remarkable, one of the best films of the 70s. A ++
