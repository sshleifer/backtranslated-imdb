I got the chance to talk to co-author Rebecca Cammis at the 2002 High Falls Film Festival in Rochester, NY. He said his style was to be completely open and forbidden in filmmaking, but he was very happy that he was so strictly limited in the narrow quarters of the group's home. Narrow corridors and small spaces were shot professionally and realistically, which would have disappeared with more controlled and deliberate camera work. <br /> <br /> Sister Helen herself is a remarkable character due to her own tragedy of life, an unusual combination of caring, harsh and street-smart. The way the film introduces our past is great, spending only a few minutes of careful choice. <br /> <br /> First of all, I can't praise this film for praise. It's really a cinema treasure and a human treasure.
