This movie is similar to "Better Dead" because it has some of the same characters. But this is not quite as good. It's pretty funny and enjoyable, it's something "Better ... that I like it, it's better. It's for men who go to Nantucket to spend a summer vacation there. While they meet the girl who's trying to save the house from this man, who wants to change this lobster restaurant, this guy does not look like lobsters, it causes one in a boiling water in a scene and puts a stethoscope so that he can hear it, the girl and the boy who wants to prepare a restaurant is broken, but it brings big boat racing showdown, such as summer, though it works a little better here and fits the picture is a bit better, although what is the actual boat races at this time? Did they have any strange charm? Mostly this movie will laugh with a good clip, but "Better off dead "was still better, and the jokes worked better.
