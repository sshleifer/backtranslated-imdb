I saw it last week during Bruce Campbell's book walk. I thought it was amazing. Almost everything I expect from Bruce Campbell's sci-fi movie. Its fun and very funny. Ted Raimi was also fun and very funny. The plot is crazy, the American businessman goes to Bulgaria and is killed. Stacy Keach plays a mad scientist who rescues / brings Bruce Campbell back to life, implanting half of the former KGB brain. Bruce Campbell spends the rest of the movie trying to get his death and has many internal arguments between him and the KGB agent. The movie has all the great sticks and humor of Bruce Campbell. The film is somewhat predictable, I knew when she was killed, she shared her brain with her killer. But I wasn't watching this movie because I thought it would have an Oscar winning script, I went to see it because it was Bruce Campbell's sci-fi movie and I was not at least disappointed. I highly recommend that you see him on your booklet or wait and see it next month on a sci-fi channel. Although before the movie he said that the Sci-Fi channel cut some movies into TV-friendly. If you are a Bruce fan, I highly recommend it.
