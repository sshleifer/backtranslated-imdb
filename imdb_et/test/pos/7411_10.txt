"Pharaoh's Army" violates the formula. Instead of selling clich√©s and big letters, it relies entirely on the excellent functioning of a strong casting, the strength of a well-written script, and an exciting and bitter story. The result is a raw and realistic film that moves quickly with a heavy emotional stream. One of the best I've ever seen during the Civil War, and I think it may be a debt to be an independent movie joy (if you like this movie, try to see a similarly brilliant indie civil war movie "Wicked Spring". also). <br /> <br /> "Pharaoh" simply tells the story of a small expedition / fodder team driving to the Confederate farm to accept the provisions, but eventually one of the men was hit by the accident. These are tensions and relationships. Nothing happens, as Hollywood writes; this film comes from a mind that talks about high-quality film and history. A great dialogue and plot exposition are moving along a film that looks very professional, but often doesn't feel like watching a movie, listening to more stories. <br /> <br /> The film has an incredible performance by Chris Cooper, who shows amazing versatility in his role in studying his role. He changes, but is always at the height of credibility and is easily emotionally involved. Patricia Clarkson has an equally meaningful and realistic role that many actors would worry about. He shares the interesting chemistry of Cooper and, where he is heavier, is still as easy to identify. The rest of the majority is quite capable and well performing their roles. <br /> <br /> Art design and kit are wonderful and personally love cinematography. All this is a periodic photograph of the civil war, where the camera is a strong contrasting color and shade, and a tin-like metal tone, but always keeps the natural look of rustic nature. They seem to have used natural light, but whatever they use works beautiful. Everything seems to be where it is, it seems time is something I rarely see in American films. Actors are active in the 19th century, not as old clothes of the 20th century. <br /> <br /> In particular, this movie is very personal. I think it is an indie that he can afford. The film is almost perfect with an excellent script that generates and explores the relationships and personalities of these characters and allows them to grow in a situation that is so bad. It won't work if it's all over, and it goes without points without the usual and untapped techniques used in all war films these days. It's brave. It is based on its characters, fantastic script, human emotion and cold, that civil war was not all CGI, big stars and thresholds.
