Working as a projector in a cinema theater, I have the opportunity to watch each of the outgoing films. When I first saw the "Black Snake Moan" trailer, I laughed and thought, "Great. Second" Snakes "on the plane" Samuel L Jackson movie. "Of course, I wanted to see it for a laughing factor. Many people have rated this movie too fast, based on the title I love this movie every second. It talks about an older man and a young woman who both go through harsh times and can reach each other. The story is really touching and sends a great message about life and about it, Of course, I don't recommend it to a young audience because of some graphic material, but if you are looking for a great story and real action from Sam Jackson, Christina Ricci and yes, even Justin Timberlake, I encourage you to look at "Black Snake Moan."
