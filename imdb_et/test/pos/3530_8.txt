On September 29, 1990, small but important milestones were celebrated in recognizing horror strikes. It was the date when the BBC1 sent (the only time I knew) Jeff Lieberman's super-horrible 1981 shock, just before Dawn, and it made me feel great. Almost twenty years later, I am pleased to announce that I have finally received a special edition of the two Shriek Show / Media Blasters and it's just as crappy and disturbing as I remember if not. br /> <br /> The plot, as usual for genre frames (and it was Lieberman's first film as a "rental tenant", although he at least removed the entire religious cult from snake handling from the mumbo-jumbo scenario) is a bit thin - five pleasant twenty times including Chris Lemmon, Jack's son, inconveniently tense white steps) stab into tight Oregon woodlands to make a spot on the campsite and look at the ground it is inherited to one of their number. But just before Dawn stands out from the imitators, Lieberman does not waste time on showing us how things are in this mountainous area, where a complete innocent skewered and drunk preacher truck is pushed down the hill and comes to the flame when the film begins. Young people come to the picture in a cheerful Winnebago, Blondie's Heart of Glass soundtrack and before you can say "Texas Chainsaw Massacre!" they have been exposed to the front bumper with innocent deer and had their first flavors from the heavy maniac that was responsible for aggression from disaster. Forest ranger Roy (George Kennedy) warns them that things will go on as they go on, but they will go on their journey, refusing to give sozzled preachers a ride, even though he is clearly frightened and finally relaxed everywhere. Needless to say, things are going down here. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is not a short bloody horror and well-treated scenes, for me, the most remarkable moments are those where Lieberman lets you extend and extend your camera. Slowly, from apparently harmless kids who look in the desert, or just let it stay for a while in a dense, amazing human-dwarf forest. He makes Oregon's exterior look intimidating and safe as Kubrick made Overlook's spacious interiors in Shining and Brad Fiedel's score (discriminating against a terribly distorted racket that moves over headlines) remains an intrusive right, emphasizing the slowly increasing nuance and elegance of slowly increasing danger. There are a lot of surprises, the Deliverance nods when a tree of a baby and his freaky, a disturbing family, and a really strange killing technique, just before the end of the movie, were discovered. I won't break it for you. I have said enough. <br /> <br /> The reason why this undervalued horror game fell through the cracks and became a cult object is not difficult to identify for breakthrough strength, but hopefully it will be discovered and appreciated for years - it deserves to be.
