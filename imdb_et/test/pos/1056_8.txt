Although this is a Christmas movie, "Christmas in Connecticut" could have been done every season because it is a story of a soldier who spends the idyllic type of Marta Stewart. That's what he thinks. In reality, the lady depicted by Barbara Stanwycki is a popular magazine column with the farm and her husband's life. He does not have a farm, a wife or a baby, nor does he have many recipes he publishes. They belong to the restaurant owner. When his nonsense editor Sydney Greenstreet requires him to entertain his soldier Dennis Morgan, he will support his boy to use his farm and will lead himself and the restaurant. There's even a baby ... well, there's more than one. Chaos occurs and charade is getting harder to play, especially when Stanwyck falls in love with Morgan. <br /> <br /> This is such a wonderful movie, and even if you are seriously depressed, "Christmas in Connecticut" can lift you out of it. Barbara Stanwyck is wonderful because her career wife changed her home. Although he was not as flashy as Crawford or Davis, he was able to do any task - he could be cheap, elegant, warm, nasty, cold and / or sexy and he made it easy. In addition, it is always attractive and appealing. Dennis Morgan is a beautiful and charming solider; as an extra bonus, he uses his Irish tenor. Fianc√© Reginald Gardner is all in action, and you can say she's not quite right for Stanwycki. S.Z. Sakall as a fake uncle / true chef is fun, especially when he prays Stanwyck for a pancake audience. <br /> <br /> I can imagine what effect this pleasant film had on the end of World War II. It must be a real beacon for better times.
