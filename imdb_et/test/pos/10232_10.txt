Why didn't such films criticize this movie? I can't get it. It's just my favorite Clive Barker effort. "Hellraiser" is a bit too rough around the edges (the film never leaves a stupid house) and lets the face of "The Lord of Illusions" does not move at all !!! I've loved writing Barker for years, especially his "Blood Bank". Amazingly fun. She has a witch side that is completely different from Stephen King. He freely interferes with his homosexuality and odd religious and occult elements. I love love love it. I also understand that Barker is as much a dark fantasy writer as he is a horror writer. And fantasy just isn't my bag. Makes me sleep. There is always. I also think Barker works best with short stories. His novels tend to bother a bit. It was my experience when I tried to read "The Damnation Game". It started well. Then I thought 100 pages that "where is it going?" because it didn't go ALL. <br /> <br /> I read "Cabal" (book based on Nightbreed) and thought it was good. I like developing a character like Decker. How the mask talked to her and checked her. I like how Barker just puts it. Black and white. There it is. He gives him the simplicity that is attractive and plausible. When asked why Decker kills, he says (simply) "Because I like it". Probably Jeffrey Dahmer said at some point. <br /> <br /> But I liked Nightbreed better than Cabal. I adore the visual attention to the details Barker gives to his films. ADORE IT. I think it's just pretty. The Lord of Illusions also had that part. Some drawings at the beginning, during the nightclub. It's like all the vocabulary Barker dreamed about the Nightbreed world. I would like to know how much his design was pure. I know he is an AMAZING artist who has his own style and language as an artist. <br /> <br /> Nightbreed is also (in my opinion) BArker's most fun movie. It moves very quickly. Well edited. It doesn't drag like the Illusia Lord is a bit. Very fast. Everything in this is just perfect. It also works as a fantastic and scary little movie. At first, killing things that kill a family and then torture an old man in a shop is really scary. This mask is scary. I would be curious as to whether Barker has designed it. It's not just a Hokey Jason or "Scream" type mask. Something about it is really disturbing. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's a great flick. Be sure to check it if you haven't seen it. Highly recommended. One of my favorite horror films. I think Clive BArker's the best. However, it is scary and violent, it must be warned
