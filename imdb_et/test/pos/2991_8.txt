With this staircase, it's a delicate film of young love. Yes, it is true that young love mostly does more than deserves, but why aren't people under "Romeo and Julia"? Paul and Michelle are good behavioral models compared to them. <br /> <br /> Yes, they flee and create the ideal life, but it's a movie, not a real life. Paul is more interested in sex than Michelle, who has been badly involved. Finally, they have sex, but no one is forcing it. The film does not let children know that sex can cause children. One thing in the movies is nudity. The camera does not focus on it, but it does exist. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, Paul has a good chance to find out. "Paul and Michelle" divorce them for a while. If you don't like ending the movie, think about yourself. Alternative ends are not just DVDs.
