"Throw Mom's Train" is a simple dark comedy with lots of laughs. Billy Crystal plays a frustrated writer on the verge of collapse; Danny DeVito plays man in crystal writing classes. Crystal's former husband is * hag * to put it well and Crystal hates her. DeVito, who senses it, offers Crystal one night: DeVito kills Crystal's wife when Crystal kills DeVito's mother's mother. Crystal can't, of course, refuse, but afterwards, it gets into the heart. And as things play, we see what happens when you try to throw some mother on a moving train. <br /> <br /> This story is an interesting character study; story about evil, greed, revenge, ego, trust, doing what is right, but most corruption. We see that Crystal's collar writer is becoming more and more accentuated by the events that come into contact with him, and he says "yes" because of DeVito's constant wilting. But we know she wanted to say "yes" to her subconscious and she's happy she told DeVit. <br /> <br /> This movie is a bit of a dark gap between Hitchcock's immortal "Strangers is a train," and he respects the film early when in a theater that plays "strangers on the train". We see DeVito, who watches the movie, and burns in his head. He gets the idea. Throw in a train! <br /> <br /> Billy Crystal gives another convincing and strange comic performance, like a struck writer. He has all beaten him, that his inner emotions come out and he agrees to throw a DeVito mommy train. <br /> <br /> Danny DeVito managed this movie perfectly. To create a world of corruption and illness, it uses just the right comic darkness. All are demented, but not extreme, like some other dark comedy. This is just the right touch of darkness, which appeared through the "Rose of War". <br /> <br /> Not only is "Throw a Mom's Train" just a story of corruption and morality, it is also an interesting character study. Be sure to pay for the TV. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 5 stars - <br /> <br /> John Ulmer
