Swiss scientist Franz Tobel smuggles his home country Sherlock Holmes so that the Nazi agents who spy on him will not get his new bombshell. When he arrives in London, he goes with Holmes and Watson, but goes to visit his girlfriend Charlotte Eberl, where he leaves Holmes a clue of seeing his bomb, which he has divided into four parts, but Holmes's eternal nemesis, Professor Moriarity, is also looking for a bomb to sell Nazi, and robs Dr. Tobel and Charlotte of the clue, the dance-maker code series, which both Holmes and Moriarity are unable to fully identify. Finally, Holmes will discover the code and get the fourth part of the bomb, but Moriarity has the other three and the showdown is inevitable. Very good entrance to the Holmes series with lots of secrets and ideas. Depicting Atwill The Morianier is more sadistic than the mysterious variety described in Doyle's northwest (or George Zucco's play of Sherlock Holmes adventures), but the Atwillian actor's skills make his Moriarity quite a benevolent man. The script and the direction make it enter between the two characters of the cat and mouse game, and this is one reason why this entry is so good. Great work also in cinematography. Assessment, 8.
