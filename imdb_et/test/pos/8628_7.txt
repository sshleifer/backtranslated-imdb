For us, Abbott and Costello are something you need to give the mood. I'm very happy when I saved it - my wife remembered it when she was young, but I've never seen it. The family wanted to look at something that was not too serious before going to bed, and it was chosen. Our daughter has been watching many old movies with us. He mostly ignored it at first, preferring to check his email, but he started to enjoy himself - many times laughing out loud. 55 years old. A monochrome introduction that blends with a full-color fairy tale. It's a fun story of all the familiar stories that include a small song and a little dance with everything you expect from Lou and Buddie. a very fun evening!
