Great story and cinematography. Poignant, biting social comment. <br /> <br /> Great effect. Well filmed and worked. <br /> <br /> However, the parallel action between the current and the travel guide (though it is very well done) occasionally pulls a little too much (about 3 hours) and exceeds the interruptions the story flowed. <br /> <br /> I first read the book as a child and enjoyed these parts of giants and small people - but the book lost me when he was swimming on the island and the "yahoos" land! Well, although the adventure picture may seem like a children's story, it is actually a very adult story full of the symbolism of moral decay in England during Jonathan Swift's author's film.
