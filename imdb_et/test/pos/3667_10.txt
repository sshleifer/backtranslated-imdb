Too bad no one got smart to release it to movie theaters. I never appeared on a cable connection. After the first shock of realizing it, it's not like any other movie you've seen since bringing the baby you need to let it wipe and drive with it. Not until it is over, you realize that it includes issues that are not only fine but important. Alienation, denial, fulfillment of wishes, beginning. Cathy Bates owns this movie, she has never been better. The whole thing is the feeling of the plot and the things they do without meeting, unless required, like Julie Andrews bits or Jonathan Pryce camp videos. If you are not open, you will not get it. (See Mark Adnum's strange overview of his dedication to Stephanie Beacham, his career, and his brothers OBE to introduce vegetable oil or something to the natives of the islands.) Considering that I can also spend time with Amo Gulinello's constellation as a television station intern or a Jack Noseworthy shower. So, cast aside all the previous film comedy concepts and have a good time. I love it.
