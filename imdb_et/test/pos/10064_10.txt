I had seen this movie before, but I didn't remember that it was fantastic: it has a fun plot, Madonna fumbles around the city, etc., causing embarrassment. And music is just perfect! And a happy ending! Who this girl is a great choice for a romantic like me. In my opinion, it may even be the best Madonna movie I've ever seen! 10/10
