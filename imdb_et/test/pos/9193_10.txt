Someone watched the movie for a waste of time because he was expecting "Brazilian and Portuguese beautiful landscapes", but then everything seemed to "wash" or gloomy or something like that. I believe that this person did not complete the whole part of the film. It's a reality. The purpose of this film is to show that life is not really ideal and to show what people in their lives go through for family, love and survival. The young man leaves the slum of Sao Paolos in Brazil to go to his mother's home country after his death. He discovers that everything is not free and that Brazilians are viewed by local people in Portugal. Finally, he finds life, love, but the story does not end as expected and it is not a "fairy tale". The most popular part for me was Gal Costa's final song "Zeca Bailero (Honey Baby)". It works so well with film; especially the end.
