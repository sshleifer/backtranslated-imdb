The 1956 man, who knew too much, is an extraordinary entertainment. For those who prefer the original 1934, I say it is faster and wittier. However, although the American version was (heavily forbidden!) Big budget, I believe it blows the British version out of the water. I think this is one of Hitchcock's 10 best small contests, given that he made over 50 films and many of them were the biggest ever. I find that I love so many things: <br /> <br /> 1) James Stewart, America's favorite everyman for so many years, is doing a great job to play the unfortunate father here. He can make every movie enjoyable and working with such a pleasant character in such a thrilling story, he was very entrenched. There is nothing to compare in the original Leslie Banks. <br /> <br /> 2) Doris Day. Yes, Doris Day. Despite all his criticisms, I think he makes a loving woman / mother an extremely sympathetic person. I disagree with the negative remarks about his character; just because he's soft and gentle, it doesn't mean he's obedient and helpless. I don't want to spoil anything, but he does it himself after his spouse has failed. He gives the story warm, which was not in the first, and to those who care that this version is the way to go. And I loved Que Sera Sera; I think it's one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard and served in my Oscar. This raised the film to another level. <br /> <br /> 3) Albert Hall. I don't think it would be too long; I think the break built all the time that this terrible direction of Crescendo and Hitchcock in this scene was absolutely brilliant. And the assassin was really scary. <br /> <br /> 4) The end brought a smile on my face; Even after the above scene ended, I found the rescue activity exciting and it was nice to see the charming family again. The last line of the movie is very amusing. I don't think the movie started slowly; Hithcock tried to get to know us and like McKennas and he did a great job. I wasn't a big fan of Hank, but I had no problems with him. Because Hank was Ben and Jo's boy, I also cared about him; it is not like he was dirty or something. <br /> <br /> I didn't find any big mistakes and so many great and smaller virtues in this movie. How to go!
