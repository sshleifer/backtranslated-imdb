Finding an amazing movie has become extremely difficult, I thought this movie was a good thriller. <br /> <br /> Perhaps there would have been better production values, but what I liked was intercourse and twist. I had real reservations before the film (because of the cover). I was afraid it would be too bloody and passionate. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Although there are many frightening parts, there is also a lot of tension and drama. <br /> <br /> Dead Line's operation was better than what you would expect from a micro-budget horror flick. The characters were believable <br /> <br /> The movie is really exciting and quite frightening at times, so it keeps your seat up to the end credit roll. good example) 8/10.
