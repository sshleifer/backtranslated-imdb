This landmark movie can now be seen in two different versions of Grapevine's video output, which also includes a translation of Selma Lagerlof's novel in English based on Swedish folk song. The first version is Swedish editing under the title PHANTOM CARRIAGE. The second version is the reconstruction of how it was shown in the United States under the title published by Metro. The actual US press release has long disappeared, but a detailed overview of the New York Times tells us how scenes were reorganized for domestic release - and both are interesting to see. Each version of this film was presented in an organ choir by live artist Blaine Gale in Salt Lake City organ. These performances were recorded in real time with the Grapevine Video DVD along with the novel and notes on the two versions. Although PHANTOM CARRIAGE follows the order of the Lagerlof novel, in some ways it is easier to monitor the NON-POWER SYSTEM. Seeing two different edits is an education on how silent films can be effectively changed to get rid of in different countries. <br /> <br /> Some viewers watch this movie as a horror movie, which is definitely not the case. It is a moral game that has supernatural tones that were used to get home. The leadership and leadership of the great Victor Sjostrom were ahead of their time. It's easy to see why M-G-M brought him to Hollywood to run films like Lillian Gish THE SCARLET LETTER and THE WIND, as well as Lon Chaney HE WHO GETS. In America he was known as Victor Seastrom. He also celebrated the leading role of Ingmar Bergman's WILD STRAWBERRIES, giving a masterful job. Bergman was greatly influenced by KORKARLEN or PHANTOM CARRIAGE in his earlier days. <br /> <br /> This is a powerful movie that is worth discovering and learning for a while. Grapevine video release is a great way to do it.
