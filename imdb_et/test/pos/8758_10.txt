In this 6-part ministry, four drug trafficking in Europe are intertwined. In Germany, a businessman is arrested for drug trafficking and his wife is trying to save his family by continuing the illegal trade of his spouse. In the meantime, the British Interior Minister will travel to Pakistan to negotiate the package of aid he expects to stop the flow of drugs from that country. Even if he does, his own daughter will give up heroin addiction by tearing his family apart. It is a ministry based on American film and mini-equipment. The original is much better than its two slopes. Third world poverty and despair are described very well. It's harsh, uncompromising and brutal.
