I've recently seen An zhan. Not because it was a Hong Kong movie, but because I was looking for a change in movies produced here in the United States. In my humble opinion, I believe that the film can easily compete with the action glasses produced here, except for the traditional idiocyncracies of the Hong Kong film. What still disturbs me was the nature of the Chief Inspector. I still don't understand why serious movies coming out of Hong Kong must have a full-idiot-comic character, but I can live with it if the film is good. The characters are plausible even when they are not. The story is fast paced and really sucks you into it. The actual cincher scenes for me were two bus rides that the early morning takes. Generally a really solid film.
