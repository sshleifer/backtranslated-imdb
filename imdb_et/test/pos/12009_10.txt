I grew up outside of Naila Germany (where they landed), every movie detail was 100% authentic, the power lines they flew, the nervous neighbors, the grandmother tell the kids that they can't watch western German television, etc. This movie brings back many good memories for those who are Europeans, the big production of Disney ... The same movie in German is Klaus Lowitsch and Gunter Meisner, who use their voice to translate the English version into German. The German version also uses biscuits that are local background noise in Germany to find out that you are in Germany. I showed this movement to many of my German relatives and they really liked this movie. he made a prototype balloon that they had to give up because the materials used were too porous and the other 2 balloons they used to escape. The burner problem was solved when they turned the propane cylinders upside down.)
