I saw this stage when it was transmitted in 1983 on PBS. I was at a local theater at that time and I saw quite unbelievable things from Dell Arte players, but Bill Irwin put me on. <br /> <br /> I was most impressed by the size of a man (he is quite tall and beefy) who was able to hit himself in a small box without adjusting himself and moving over the stage to run dead without sound. if he decided not to make noise, he is amazing! piece. Those who saw this example recall that when he stepped up from the box and fell on the floor with his hips and limbs, he pulled himself up at the top of his head like a string and not only his feet, but a full ballet point and made it in one liquid, seemingly effortless movement. Just take into account the strength, grace, balance, and focus that such movements have to take in order to do as he did! Add your strong and credible characterization skills to your physical wealth and have the perfect actor / performer. My jaw dropped to the movement and my heart broke into the puppet depicting to be more than just a lifeless thing in the box. <br /> <br /> Harmful (yes, "tragic") would be a better word) in the inaccessible form of this work, I have noticed that a large part of PBS's work is not available on tape or DVD. Sometimes a PBS show is available for direct purchase for a limited time immediately after the transfer, but they rarely remain on the market for a long time. There are, of course, exceptions, but these are mainly documentaries of science and history; rarely does the work of art work for a long time, assuming that it has ever started on VHS / DVD. I don't know why it should be; Certainly, PBS could use the revenue from home media marketing for their show, but they don't use it much. It's a shame. PBS has many things I want to have, but pieces such as "The meaning of the flight" are, I am afraid, a one-time, once-in-a-lifetime treatment that should not be repeated repeatedly in PBS and can never be available for home media purchase. It really sucks. I'm glad I got it when I did it. <br /> <br /> Yes, our local library got a copy of "Air Traffic Control". And yes, it was stolen.
