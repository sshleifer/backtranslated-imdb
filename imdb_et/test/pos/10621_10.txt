Yeah, I felt like I could see it afterwards. But only the next day I began to see the true shine of this creation. I don't repeat a lot of what has already been said by film reviewers, but there is another area I want to touch ... ** SPOILERS ** Why exactly did a teacher put a pocket on a broken glass student? Most reviewers have noted that this only reflected his cruelty and response to an unsatisfactory result. I have to agree. Watch the scene again. Huppert moves into tears when he looks at his pupil playing the stage. The student is a pretty expressive girl (shouting and scaring her fears) - just the opposite of Huppert's character. The film will later appear on the scene after the girl is injured when Huppert discusses the accident with her mother. Mother, visibly upset, says, "We gave up everything so she could learn the piano" and Huppert immediately clicks "You mean SHE gave up everything, is not." Huppert saved this young expressive student simply from his fate. He didn't want the girl to get like HER, repressed and tempered, condemned the concept of justification ... to gradually kill the soul for perfection. Maybe he saw himself years ago before things got worse. Maybe she wanted her to flee when she was at that age. Does he destroy a student's life or just release it? <br /> <br /> For me, this realization made all the difference experienced through this movie. Brilliant.
