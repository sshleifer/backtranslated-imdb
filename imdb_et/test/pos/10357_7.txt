Brain of Blood begins with Abdul Amir (Reed Hadley). Deadman's country is dead due to cancer due to death, but when he dies, the Gemini breaks down without being guided by a doctor, so doctor Robert Nigserian (Grant Williams) and one of Amir's devotees Mohammed (Zandor Vorkov) have developed a plan To bring Amir's body to America, where crazy scientist Dr Lloyd Trenton (Kent Taylor) transmits his brain to a fresh body and a little plastic surgery that no one will ever know he was even dead. Things do not go as planned, though when you reach Amir's brain during transplantation, Trenton's pointless assistant, Gor (John Bloom), brings the body that fell from the balcony, Trenton needed a strong living body and there is no more than he decides to use Gor's body as a temporary stop until a more suitable one is found. Unfortunately, when Amir wakes up in her new body, she is not very happy with what she sees, I mean you would be if you knew your brain was inside a badly burned freak? <br /> <br /> Also known as Brain Damage, Brain, Creature's Revenege & The Undying Brain is this lowo exploit flick produced and managed by one and only Al Adamason & frankly, I'm offended by miserable 1.5 rating Brain of Blood on IMDb, personally I think it's terrible fun so bad that it's good. The very fun script of Kane W. Lynn & Joe Van Rodgers is like a loop and stupid, as they originate from a sloppy blood-soaked brain transplant for crazy mad scientists, ranging from 7 feet of acid-scarred freaks, playing toy cars up to 4 feet of dwarf medicine. From the basement to the roof, from car accidents to murder, Regina Carrol robbes ridiculous ridiculous women who should mention themselves during their discovery credit that teenage girls imprisoned in prison in the basement laugh - a fun fun ending with some deep meaningful speech! It's all here & Brain of Blood is a high-quality cheese that has been stamped on it, if your bad low-budget fan is entertaining, this movie should be just your "black" at the top of the movie list. Despite being a low rating of 1.5, I am proud to admit that I liked the Brain of Blood a lot, I thought it was an absolute hoot to watch, it slows down a bit at the end of some too many people traveling around. especially until that moment when it was like a rocket, it is only short in 85 minutes, it's hard to guess that harsh parcels and I just think it's a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> This is a masterpiece by director Adamson as far as I am concerned with Dracula and Frankenstein (1971), which he did a year ago. Those who have seen the Adamson movie in the past know that there are no existing values, cheap special effects and carton kits, and that everyone adds fun, this film manages it between the incompetence and the seriousness of the fine to create a memorable viewing experience. I love the Kahl Open Game, which is obviously just the Indian Taj Mahal photo with statueque people in the foreground! Regina Carrol's hair seems to be an independent entity, it seems that it changes the styles between the frames and is honestly scary, don't start with my make-up work that she has to wear a color spray! There is another fun moment when we see that Amir's body has been transported to America, which is the usual tin foil, why did I ask myself why!? The effects are different, there is a terrible looking fake-spider, Gori-burned make-up work is pretty bad, though there is a surprisingly gory brain removal that is actually quite impressive. <br /> <br /> The blood brain budget has to be practically nonexistent, I have to admit that I thought the Trenton lab was quite good with different computers and medical devices, although the rest of the movie is cheap and nasty. The production values ​​are small, the music is taken from the second film Beast of Blood (1971) and the actor is terrible, but fun. <br /> <br /> A blood brain can be the best title for a movie that is ever and as much as I'm worried about, it's a very fun piece of nonsense that I had a great time to watch and laugh. They just can't / can't / don't do that anymore, it's impossible to recommend to someone who is looking for a good movie, but bad film students should enjoy it. I liked it, but then I'm just weird.
