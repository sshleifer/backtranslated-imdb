I have a video shop with hundreds of documentaries. I've seen them a lot and love all the great information there. Only a small handful, though even close to providing information as important as it is. I've read through other people's reviews of this movie and can't help but notice that the main things people criticize are irrelevant. For example, "It's very one-sided" Such pathetic criticism, every society you look at, you see the other side and if you need help, go to globalpublicmedia.com. "It's the same people over and over again" Uh can believe these people are experts, so maybe they're the best people to chat with. "The filming style is all the same, the main shots with a few exceptions" If you want to flash and dazzle, check out Micheal Moore if you want to look at documents like this. As you can see, none of the information contained in these complaints is relevant. My guess is that these people are just missing and don't want to give up the SUV there. <br /> <br /> My suggestion: Look at it. Learn about it and continue your education on such topics. This is very important for EVERYONE.
