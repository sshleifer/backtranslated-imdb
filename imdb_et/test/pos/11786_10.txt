I just want to say that I was happy to find these comments about the show. I have tried on the internet to find information about the exhibition in the past without luck. I loved the show. I find it hard to motivate to practice, but this exhibition made it fun. As another comment mentioned, it is not as complicated as it is today. It was the perfect workout that got the job done! I'd give something so I could only buy a copy of one workout. I remember many moves, but not nearly everyone. Please try to get it back and make it available on DVD. It is so nice to know that I was not the only one who loved this example! Thank you for making your day!
