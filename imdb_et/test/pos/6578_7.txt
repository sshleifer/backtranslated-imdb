Bad Earth is a different Finnish film. But things that make it different are copied abroad. Some of the stories are from Amores Perros, Jackie Brown and Elephant. Scenes are taken from different angles again. The evil land is a good movie, but it's not so good that the hype said, "Realistic film, no happy ending and business confirmation." Some participants did a good job. Sulevi Peltola was as good as a vacuum cleaner. Jasper Pääkkönen also shows his skills. But Mikko Leppilampi was so flat. He is an over-priced actor, he is a beautiful and nice man, but not the best actor in Finland. But if you like Finnish movies, it's worth seeing the Bad Land.
