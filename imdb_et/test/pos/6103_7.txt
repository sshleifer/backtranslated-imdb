(There are spoilers) Driving on a lonely country road in one rainy afternoon Joanna Kndall, Margaret Colin, is confused for a short while and runs around a little girl riding a bicycle on the side of the carriageway. By doing what he can to keep the injured youngster comfortable, Joanna turns to the local service station. Before she can give her name, Joanna hangs on the phone to return with the girl and see if she is all right; then and when the nightmare begins for Joanna. <br /> <br /> A heartbreaking drama that can affect anyone of us when you try to do the right thing, but they are influenced by the words and feelings of the people around you. Returning to the accident site, Joanna says the road police have been driving it. Before she can tell them what happened and her involvement in it, Joanna starts thinking about her. <br /> <br /> What would have been a tragic accident at first would be to hit and run in front of Joanna when it is hidden behind. Worse still, he has to live with what he saw almost every day from the little girl's family he ran down to Kelly Corey, Dallas Deremer, who goes to the same school as his two daughters Mindy & Holly, Gretchen Esau & Kira Posey. Joanna's life begins to leave when she tries to keep the truth about her friends and family, not to mention Eaton's police, about what she was about to be a little Kelly accident. <br /> <br /> You can easily see how his friends and neighbors, as well as his wife Doug, Drew Phillbury, hit and run, Joanna. These words did not allow Joanna to admit what she did not only for her own, but also for her two daughters and her husband. Feel that people they are familiar with as friends and neighbors for many years are abandoned. <br /> <br /> Joanna, who is losing her mind, is trying to get her friend Nancy Grayson, Sherry Hursey, Kelly hit and accidentally, trying to plant her ear, which she disappeared in Joanna's house, in an accident place. Then he understands what he is doing and suddenly stops, keeping him worse off the bad situation, not wanting Kelly an accident, but also the innocent freedom and reputation of Nancy in his conscience. <br /> <br /> Margraet Colin delivers excellent performance as a fault driven by Joanna Kendall, and you really feel she sees her eating and not knowing what to do. Wishing to turn to the police first, Joanna has the right to lose the law. When he finally got, Joanna became the most hated and despised man in Eaton. <br/> <br /> <br/> <br /> <br /> If Joanna's husband is not himself, he will feel like he is either smoking or even communicating. Not after any million years, Doug would have thought Joanna was the one who ran a little to Kelly and left her to die on this rainy road! Seeing his face, shaking his mouth, when he said the truth, said it all. <br /> <br /> The last minutes of the movie knew a lot about you, knowing what Joanna went through, not to hurt the suffering of Kelly Corey and her parents, and how she must now see the music for what she did and must live with her the rest of your life.
