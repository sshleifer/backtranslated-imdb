I am a professional musician inspired almost 20 years ago to start playing guitar after hearing Jimmy Page Led Zeppelin II. Although I do not play the same genre or style, the influence of this person has been enormous. Now, almost 20 years later, I finally saw something more than a not so good song that remains the same. Again I have seen so many bands, some small ones - some current "masters". There's no band, no, somehow, EVER hasn't been able to pull the magic that you can really taste when watching this DVD. <br /> <br /> Robert Plant may be a little bit from time to time, and you may almost feel the annoyance that he forgot the lyrics, but that doesn't matter, I think - especially in the era. Bonham's genius appears more on this DVD, then on all albums with Zeppelin, Joy or Lord Sutch. JPJ is quite common - but the magic of this DVD is how well four of them are together. The world loved to imagine they were in black magic (k) etc. - it was only Page. The magic (I notice that I say so much) is that this DVD has a rare look at the raw material of 4 young boys who can play perfectly, no matter how sloppy they actually play. It doesn't matter. <br /> <br /> Fast distribution. The first of these two DVDs is where there is real magic. You should be able to feel the power and rawness of Zep in their early days. At the end of the second DVD page, Knebworth sings his peace of mind. (It's no secret that by that time he was heavily dependent on heroin). So I would recommend the first disk to ANY music lovers and the second to the only true Zeppelin fan. <br /> <br /> I can go too far for some guitarists, but I'd say after that, the page is certainly more creative and more inventive than Hendrix. Yes, I said that. And if you do not agree - see DVD.
