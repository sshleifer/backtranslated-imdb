I watch a lot of movies, but now my genre is one of the Asian horror. I just bought this DVD and I first found an intriguing but confusing movie about "Janghwa, Hongryeon" because I hadn't understood many stories. But I saw a message in the IMDb Board entitled "Masterpiece Explanation (All Your Questions Answered) Faster Load", written by opiemar, and I was really impressed that the high quality of the explanations provided by this user for the missed points story. I would like to congratulate the opiemer for his excellent work and suggest that he write the correct summary of this movie in IMDbis to help and guide other viewers. <br /> <br /> Finally, I agree that "Janghwa, Hongryeon" is an excellent Korean film, but I don't give my voice to ten because very few people can afford to see the same movie more than once, as this movie requires, and without the great support of opium, I would not understand the story as a whole. I plan to see this movie again in the near future. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Medo" ("Fear")
