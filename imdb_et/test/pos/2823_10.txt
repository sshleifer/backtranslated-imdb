This movie makes you think. This shows how the weaknesses of a woman can cause a nightmare for others. His physically aggressive behavior is more common in men than in women, so I felt even more uncomfortable to see how the leader acted. I think women might think about this behavior, but I don't think they will. The dark scenes added a bad feeling that was supposed to be hidden. I was released when the prisoners fled. I hoped the end would bring a satisfactory solution, but it wasn't. Maybe it's more realistic. Life seems to run in the same direction, instead of creating a new riverbed that runs up.
