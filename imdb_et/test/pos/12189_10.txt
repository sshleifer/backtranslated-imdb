Lestat wakes up after the 100-year-old sleep setting to the sounds of new music she wants to be, and the band "Vampire Lestat" is born. His desire to end his loneliness and his "living light" attitude with his music, anger with his companions vampires and awaken evil that has fallen for thousands of years. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for those who are looking for a real book-to-film customization. Those who have read books and are waiting for it on the screen are enormously disappointed. This movie likes those who really enjoyed the movie "Vampire Interview". <br /> <br /> There are some holes and contradictions in the plot, but overall this movie is satisfactory. Stuart Townsend depicts Lestat with sensuality and sexuality that was missing in the previous film. The relationships depicted in the film were very sexy and crisp. <br /> <br /> In this movie, this story has forced you and pulls you in. Casting is wonderful. Loved this story and movie. If you like sensuality and sexual tension, then you love this movie!
