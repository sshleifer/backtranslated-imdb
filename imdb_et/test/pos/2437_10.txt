It was sweet, introductory to most intelegent Sailor Soldier, Sailor Mercury. It consisted of a new "in croud", Merciurios. At first he wrote a letter of love to Am, which would be a letter (naturally) and now Ami thibi-Einstien and he is attractive (He was looking like Umino (Melvin)). It was halarios (expesialy Minako's "It's not a skin of my neck" scene (HOT!)) Well, I like the Bishojo Senshi Sailor Moon Series, I think it's the best anime ever !, but this movie was nice, funny, but not as adventurios as Sailor Moon R-It was rather an S-film. I saw this @ Sailor Moon Univewrse with a real player and it was pretty good. (All Over)
