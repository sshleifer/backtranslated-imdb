Hell to Pay is a bit bloody for my taste, although it is no worse than many movies. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the parade of flavored stars and the western landscape and all; but the story was very weak and I couldn't see it all. The music that comes with the film more than a gradual film does it. <br /> <br /> Where were the musicians who wrote this music? They are awesome! Since the beginning of music, it's far better than anything I've heard for years. I think it may be the best I've ever heard! Although I did not like the action of the film, the music created the exact emotion needed for each scene. Credits were opened while I was traveling to the old west and I really felt like I lived through the old days with music. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely worth buying and a beautiful view of the music and memory lane to see the old western stars again.
