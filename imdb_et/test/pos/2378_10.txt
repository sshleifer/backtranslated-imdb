Four unfortunate women leave London harshly to spend the castle of the Italian Church, Echabeth von Arnim's novel alive in this charming little film that shows beautifully literacy and ensemble virtues. acting. All the elements come together to produce a film that, although almost forgotten, still creates a sense of respect with the appropriate resolution. <br /> <br /> Actors who are excellently recognized by everyone. Ann Harding is a free-spirited woman who wants "Wisteria and Peace" far from foggy London. Katharine Alexander plays a quiet housewife who wants elegant responsibility in the form of a palace hostess. Jane Baxter is a beautiful young man who temporarily escaped from men's admirers. Jessie Ralph steals every scene she is like an old lady who just wants to have her memories of the past. <br /> <br /> The men in the story are well cast. Like Miss Harding's husband, Frank Morgan has a rather difficult role as a successful writer with a disturbing change in personality. Reginald Owen, as Alexander Alexander's husband, is wonderfully pompous as a man well-equipped for England (his fun attempt to take an English bathroom in an Italian bath is even funny with Charles Jules and Rafaela Ottiano as the castle's harried servants). Finally, Ralph Forbes, one of the best forgotten actresses for decades, is joyfully eccentric as a female gentleman. <br /> <br /> Cinematographers are familiar with the unrecognized Ethel Griffies who is the owner of the Hampstead Housewife Club.
