This event defined the era of wrestling entertainment, which I think is not the same today. Colored characters - in their stereotypical group - brought a certain amount of charm that society has since raped and overexposed. There was a bit of innocence in the wrestling. The child could watch it, despite Jerry Springer's episode. <br /> <br /> Looking back (I was 5 years old), although I loved both warrior and Hogan, I think I enjoyed Warrior more of his mystery. Hogan was a branded hero who showed an impressive public reputation. The Ultimate Warrior, on the other hand, was a few words of a hidden man who was an extreme hero to a different audience. <br /> <br /> This competition was as exciting as the boy because of the duality that comes out for every fighter. I had a place for both. Since there was bloodshed during this long and difficult battle, the stakes were high - at least for me as a child. Due to the same comment, Hogan's defeat made him more human - I remember he was sorry. <br /> <br /> All of the emotions that play a juvenile boy in a soap opera have made them Wrestleman VIs. a great time to witness this game.
