It is hard to believe that it was led by Fritz Lang, because he mostly led criminal dramas and secrets. This film is cast, including Robert Young, Randolph Scott, Dean Jagger and John Carradine. Scott plays a legal who is trying to go straight and leave his old gang and shatter Jagger's life. Jagger is working on a Western Union telegraph in a company that plans to bring out a telegraph in the West. Jagger hires many men to make sure it is done because they have to worry about Indian attacks and bandits. Scott is responsible for men and Young is a telegraph expert who can not conquer a weapon but can drive. Scott meets his old gang who wants to stop them, but Scott can't tell anyone. It is pretty good west and Lang should be directed to some more westerners.
