I would recommend that only Valiant is one of the most original and intriguing and in some ways wonderful movies that Peck never did; bold, surprising, and one of his few of the finest western countries (- of course, not a Western country, but a military chronicle that is sometimes better). The budget is quite low, but very original and striking. It is one of those who is sometimes treated as a real powder; movies that nobody has told you yet. You say it sounds intriguing or interesting? And it goes beyond your expectations. <br /> <br /> In summary, does the script show an unusual level for Westerners? And it somehow reminded me of the inclined ULZANA; Peck also looked like a nice step. and there are many unexpected touches like kissing a blonde babe and flirting with whom she has decided not to marry, maybe feeling that she is fair and repulsive ??? <br /> <br /> Even the genre? ONLY ?? there is so much more than a military story, it is also an acting drama, a temporary film, a commando / action slide that can be imagined strange. a bunch of soldiers in a special mission to fight against a possible local attack and stop it? - Crazy crazy decision not to take all available forces to the point where these origins could be stopped? - And this plot never takes away the route? The interests of people, people and their causes and actions will never disappear. <br /> <br /> The word Pecki about yourself; he appears with the brio, and although I usually find his famous films rather uncomfortable and boring, on such small trips, I find that all Peck's harsh and even cool glamor are inviolable. He was an unusual star. <br /> <br /> I recommend this extraordinary movie.
