I got it just and it's a great movie! I love it! Although Jane Brightons' voice at the beginning of n is so irritating because her braces did not open her amazing mouth ... but you have to see that this is the perfect movie! things he says here are so funny and very cute !! and I'm sure Aaron will probably say some things in real life because I don't know, it just seems like that! ha ha is part of a movie that is really funny ... his wen jane's little sister will meet him ... but i cant say what will happen that will cause the sick just have to let u see for himself !! I went to Aaron's concert and it was so fun !! n he smelled so good ha ha ... i still don't think i got to meet him !!! I have pictures if anyone wants to see them! Steph
