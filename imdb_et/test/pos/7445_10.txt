Have you played the game? Do not worry. This is for Final Fantasy VII fans who won the game, and no other will appreciate this rare film. Want to watch and love it? Buy a game, beat and watch it. When is the last time a great movie based on a video game? Well, that's it. <br /> <br /> The story will take place two years after the game and short summaries will not be given to refresh the memory (though I doubt many will forget), and will go on an hour and forty-one minute adventure. <br /> <br /> All of your favorite characters are available, even Cait Sith. Voice action is great in the Japanese version, each character is perfectly cast. The cloud sounds harsh and admires, Tifa sounds still strong ... Aeris is perfect, she sounds exactly as I imagined. Cait Sith sounds less cute than I imagined, but worked well. <br /> <br /> Label models are excellent, excellent textures and lighting. The environment is breathtaking and battles are choreographed in a way that makes the Matrix blush. Amazing camera work, for example, is cycling where your eyes just scream calmly and your lungs are breathing heavily without consent. <br /> <br /> Music is a typical quality of the Umitsu, which means its excellence. The Advent Children's graphic leap is accompanied by well-known stories that are very well connected with the visual aspects. There are even inside joke fans that includes music, it makes you smile for sure. <br /> <br /> I don't look at it with subtitles because I'm half-Japanese so I can't say subtitles are good. In Japanese, dialogue is very good and every word sounds like real living beings, not just actors. Impressive. I will look at it one day again with subtitles to see the differences, because I've played both the release of Final Fantasy VII Japan and America. <br /> <br /> If you are a fantasy fan of Final Fantasy VII, buy this movie on the day it comes out or pre-ordered. If you haven't played but want to see this movie very badly, don't waste your time: buy the game, take it off and come back to this DVD. I'm not telling you not to look at it, but play the game. This will make the experience much better and will not leave you dust that scratches your head. <br /> <br /> Come back, old friends - it's time to go on an adventure with your brave comrades!
