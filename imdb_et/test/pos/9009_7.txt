Spin-offs who do not know are usually not successful because most of the original characters are missing. <br /> <br /> Here they are not, and you could not ask for a better ensemble, essentially a foolish little comic, which is not meant to be anything but entertainment. <br /> <br /> Mr Manoux, replacing David Spad, is doing an amazing job of preserving the Kuzco ego, but it doesn't seem as annoying as Spade's character (Spade has been doing it for decades and after a while nerves). He has a softer voice, but it somehow fits. <br /> <br /> Eartha Kitt, who repeats his role as Yzma, is great. He has not really received much praise because he was Batwoman centuries ago, except perhaps his spicy part in Boomerang. It's funny how much the character looks like it. <br /> <br /> And Patrick Warburton. There is no way he can be funny unless he was extensively wasted in the Black Man. 2. I have been a fan of Seinfeld for him, but unlike this character he plays a real pleasant man who is breastfeeded without doing so nice things. <br /> <br /> Animation is really beautiful, because all Disney is usually, but sometimes the character is a bit too candied. Oh, well. Two of the three are not bad.
