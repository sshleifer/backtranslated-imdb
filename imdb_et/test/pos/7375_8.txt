I saw this movie in the free air channel late at night and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. As a fan of horror, I often watch such midwives films during school days. Usually, horror films shown during this time are usually not large. "Campfire Tales" is definitely not in this category. Campfire Tales is basically an anthology of short stories based on widely known legends of the city. They are assembled together with a law involving teenagers who talk about them around the campfire. This campfire site is mysterious in itself. But this particular story is weak and confusing, probably used mainly to create other horrible stories. <br /> <br /> There are three stories in this movie (four when you first read "Hook"), all of which are truly spooky and well done. I especially liked the third story (The Locket), which was attended by a man whose motorcycle breaks into a mysterious household. This particular story works well when you are suddenly amazed by the history of the house. In addition, you will complete the story! The first story ("Honeymoon") was also very horrible, although the second story ("People Can Lick") was somewhat flawed. <br /> <br /> Being a veteran of horror movies, I'm not usually overwhelmed. This movie did the job well! What I particularly liked about this movie is that it is divided into three short pants. This means that the film does not move towards creating or creating hours or letters before actual bloodshed begins. This makes Campfire Tales ideal for dreams, parties, etc. <br /> <br /> Campfire Tales is a horrible, horrible horror movie that makes your heart more than once. This is definitely better than the crap you often find these days (Blair Witch 2, Urban Legends: Final Cut ... bleah!). Find a copy and see it ... if you dare! <br /> <br />
