(My Synopsis) Rae (Christina Ricci) was a high school bitch and nymphomania who connects Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) to meet her needs. Ronnie has to report to his national guard unit and leave Raest alone. Rae is not alone for a long time because she is a city tramp that has a powerful need to connect with a man. After the party, Rae will take home a friend who will kill him and throw him toward the road. The next day Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) finds Rae and carries home. Lazarus gives Rae medical care and believes he can save him. Rae is like a warm dog, so Lazarus puts him and his radiator around a 40 pound chain to keep him looking for men. Lazarus has his own problems because his wife has just left him with another man. Lazarus turns to his blues music to relieve his pain. <br /> <br /> (My comment) The film has a deep meaning when it comes to sex and violence. The film has a different feeling. The story is raw and almost puts you in the movie as if you were there. The 40 pound chains have a good metaphor and a symbol of beauty belt. You don't give love to anyone, but you keep it for your true love. The chain may also be parallel to the woman who is attached to the kitchen, but Rae did not boil. Rae just wanted to have sex all the time, while she couldn't. I think Craig Brewer (writer and director) has made an extraordinary film and Samuel L. Jackson sings the average blues song. The story is emotionally charged, fighting one race, race, religion, music, and sex. (Paramount Classics, Running Time 1:56, Rated R) (8/10)
