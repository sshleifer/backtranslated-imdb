Fun full romp, full of stupid, if not sometimes cruel jokes. Not the best movie, but definitely worth a look. David Niven and Stewart Granger are their usual charming societies with Granger as a particularly pleasant and brilliant gentleman. Ava Gardner is as wonderful as always, with such a pleasant character that is absolutely inevitable. The story is typical but full of jocular surprises, especially with regard to unusual relationships between Granger, Gardner and Niven.
