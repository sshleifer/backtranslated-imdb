It was one of the best films you could find as a child. I lived with The Chipmunk Adventure from 4 years old to 8 years old. The story of this movie was: Dave goes on a business trip to Europe and sticks boys to Miss Miller. Playing 80 days in the world playing a video game, two villains, Klaus and Claudia (brother and sister), rounded the patches and chips for an adventure where children keep their way around the world with a balloon. What they don't know is that the "game" is actually a diamond smuggling. And when the frogs were found at the airport, it was pursuing tracking! And it ends in Klaus and Claudia jail and Alvin, Simon, Theodore, Brittany, Jeanette and Eleanor with Dave and Miss Miller. But I warn you now, it's musical and pretty damn good. Most people hate musicals, but I'm not one of those people, I frigging love music, like Rocky Horror, fat, music sound, cats don't dance, and almost nothing (except My Fair Lady). If you see it, share with your children (if you have anything)!
