This is a film that may have to be seen several times to capture all of its beauty and intelligence (such as the Franken curse from 1957). If you don't like an odd, non-mainstream movie, beware of this masterpiece. For me, the artwork of this film alone is worth the purchase price of a video clip. The story is a bit fantastic, but it seems to be a reality in our world today. The film produced in the 1980s has proved to be a prophetic vision of what Big Government and Big Brother want to steer and follow. <br /> <br /> There are lots of slower sections and it can be quite difficult to catch the dialogue in many scenes {thats why I watched it 6 times now}, but if you can digest all this, it may be worth your time. <br /> <br /> The film is basically a world where people have developed into robots that have lost their individualism. They are only concerned about accumulation and acquisition. The film's hero has not survived this disease and has not been labeled or watched by a big brother. His mission is to release a secret drug into the water supply, which makes the human robot's thinking and permission an individual part of mankind. <br /> <br /> Yes, its a very low budget, but the time when the computer effects and sound effects are very unique and the paintings are completely exciting. If you have an open mind, this film should be impressive and its prophetic visions are cool.
