I had a terrible day, but this movie grabbed me and I couldn't complete it ... and I forgot my dreadful day. and end ... by the way ... where is the sequel !!! <br /> <br /> The budget is probably extremely low ... but ... see what they did! it reminds me of playing ... they work basically with a tent, a "getaway", a gun, a uniform, a camping equipment and a "scanner". this is for props. Perhaps this is even a good thing, forcing actors and writers to increase and take their rightful place in the film, rather than at the center of the work, instead of excusing the CGI struggles (starwars). <br /> <br /> Cgi is good. It's not exactly "seamless" ... but imho is working. why? Because it is not too much and what is there, it does not take over with the army of authorities that people are trying to capture everything they can. it forces the imagination ... it is some relatively simple thing, with a good composition (especially a heavy cargo ship .. there is one long shot that must be at least ten seconds ... that keeps track of the length of the ship ... it must be a record sci fi about making a sequence of movies in the last ten years, a sequence of operations lasting more than 0.75 seconds, and a certain relationship with the story. It may seem old or not 'modern', but it doesn't seem stupid and it doesn't take away . <br /> <br /> The actor is good unless the characters die too fast to get to know them, but the captain was great, but some of his scenes might have used a different shot. stomping on the body, I like to think the captains are calm and control ... what happened in this scene? Did another team worry about losing it? did he feel losing control? <br /> <br /> Now, n agu plot .... mostly it's good ... why? Because it's not trying to explain itself. It just happens. It's called a "planet," its secret, can I get it? No one knows why there is a shape and they can't find it either. A mysterious cult? A strange scientist with a tattoo? What do you expect in less than 90 minutes? It's not war and peace. And thank God, it's not a Star Wars either. There is no midchlorosis, 5 minutes of dull dialogue with no story. The characters are stranded and can only think of a few basic things ... this is not an excursion where they find it to be leonardo davinci or a child like a space migrant. It's mysterious and I liked it. I don't know why, maybe I can find out more about these men because they don't know what's going on, and I don't ... they don't talk much about the mess of the room or they have magical boxes that tell them what's going on. In fact, I would like to say that one of the weakest moments is when the "traitor" enters the team and tries to "explain" the cause of the planet, the cult, and the like. has some of the weakest dialogues in the film, imho, and it interrupts the stream and some characters look unnatural in this scene. <br /> <br /> OK, sometimes I felt it was a little mysterious. Like, why did the man fly with light through his eyes? It was strange. Just weird. "Hamlet" ends ... again I would have liked some of these signs to be better known. And would it have been so hard at the end of the 30-second rescue? It's not a serial show, it was a movie and we like closing movies even if they have a sequel. Imagine a Hamlet who doesn't have "angels flying for your rest" <br /> <br /> Anyway. What can I say. It was a worthwhile dollar, which I paid in the supermarket's red box machine. It was also imho, better storytelling than starwars parts 1 or 3. As I said, it sucked me, who wanted to know what was going on, and I couldn't finish watching it.
