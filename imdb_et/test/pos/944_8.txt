My mother Frank starts with a warm, friendly comedy about a medieval Catholic woman (Frank, a short Francis, played by Sinead Cusack) who shakes himself as a student of his son's university. Most of his friends and family are terrified, especially his son (Matthew Newton), who is busy falling in love with his best friend's friend (Rose Byrne). Meanwhile, Frank has raised his bad English tutor (Sam Neill). <br /> <br /> Matthew Newton is a completely disarming David; a relaxed and natural role, even when the character is dense. It generates valuable goodwill by directing the audience to some of the more uncomfortable and wide-ranging comedy moments of the film. Not long after a year and a half, Mark Lamprell, a writer-director for the first time, directs his film to a more emotionally darker emotional area and gives Cusack a real chance to shine. <br /> <br /> Supporting cast is full of familiar and welcomed faces (Lynette Curran, Sacha Horler, Nicholas Bishop) and all principals (including more traditional Sam Neill). Although my mother Frank is just a bit over, it offers more than promises and is a true Australian crowd.
