Looking at the last 2 episodes, I remembered my TV add-on from my childhood. It showed the wild west, very dusty and dry, and there is a small salon, the man enters the bar / lounge, he is thirsty as hell, lips cracked, etc., He has just walked through the Nevada desert and has no drunken water on days. He swings at the barman "gives him potato chips" Although he eats it, we can feel how he gets, we hear a voice in the background that says ... "Keep that thirst, build it until you can't hold it any more ...... ....... then blow it off with TEAM "The man runs TEAM (soft drink). It seems that a few dozen bags of potato chips are thirsty so intense that I can no longer hold it, there are more turns in season 2 and season 1. End ends with many questions, but hopefully we ask many other questions we know we know in the 3rd season, but I doubt I feel I feel that LOST is gaining momentum for more than 3 seasons, when people behind the camera continue their good work. <br /> <br /> I'll watch it look. <br /> <br /> From Pakistan with Love
