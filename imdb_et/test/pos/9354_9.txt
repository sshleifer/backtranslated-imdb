An extraordinary film that deals with a highly proportioned subject in a very balanced direction. Dmytrik was a very good director, at least for what I can say about this film and Murder my Sweet, but HUAC was seriously affected by it as other film directors and actors. It's ironic that Crossfire did not take Oscare because it is a fine example of how to make a big budget with a small budget. All this movie is extraordinary: a well-written script that uses extensive setbacks, great light, great lighting that seems to be more than just the right thing to do. What else can you expect from a top-notch movie? Can I add that the note is used here for its style and I can add some financial benefits. But it proves once again that what was originally considered a B movie can be more influential today, that most of the hard-working A-films, which over time lost their audience. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a noir film itself and it raises serious questions about what noir really is. This style is definitely a noir, especially for luminaires, but the theme goes beyond the "noir genre" recipe. You can see things from the opposite perspective and argue that anti-Semitism is only a pretext for criminal investigation, because there is real attention around murder. It would have been as if Robert Ryan had not been fulfilled. In both cases, the film has a lot to offer and it is a pity that the director really had to suffer for his former beliefs in America during a truly "noir" period.
