Especially after watching MATRIX! * SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> After the Matrix, with all its ridiculous fantasy offers, belief-robotic characters with its superpowers, it was refreshing to see the real people with the real movie at real risk! I took care of these people and although some stunts seemed a bit much, it still felt like "it's possible" verses "what a fool video game" (like Matrix) <br /> <br /> movie is not brain surgery, it's very straight on. Some things are predictable, as knowing that someone will be modest and someone dies early. Pretty obvious, but so, WHAT? The first 15 minutes set our cause, our motive, as our main goal. <br /> <br /> I like that Theron and Walhberg had no scenes of excerpts. I'm glad they didn't go there. They kept it in a funny dialogue. This guy is FUNNY! <br /> <br /> This is a movie I buy from a DVD. It's fun, fast and fun. The only thing (and I think this is a big deal) is that we really do - rooting bad guys. This group of protaganists is already the wrong side of the law. Not a good message for a child - parents, please explain it to them. <br /> <br />
