I'm not going to generalize and say it's the best love story of all time, as some have said. It's great, people know this movie very deeply, you love it, I believe ... or just hate it. I don't want to say it's the best because it's just too wide to make such a statement. But I feel very passionate about both the English patient and millions of other people. <br /> <br /> Prizes say it all. <br /> <br /> I disagree with the critics, on many levels, but those who chose it could no longer agree. <br /> <br /> 9-Oscars. <br /> <br /> 41-win. <br /> <br /> 37 other candidates, the story of love is on the cluster. Director Anthony Minghellast, a story that breaks on the screen and, as Mr Peterman (T.V.S. Seinfeld) said, "Elaine, I just can't take my eyes off it!" In this case, I disagree with Elaine's response. But the story builds and takes the time it takes to decorate this case. The filmmaker (John Seale) also won many awards, as did. So far, I have not paid particular attention to Juliette Binoche. Well, not quite true, I loved his performance "Sabrina", a lovely story about somewhat complicated relationships, next to Harrison Ford. But it was just a very different character for him and he was so deeply talented as he is, just shone in his fine and graceful direction, he was just what this movie was looking for, I'm really glad it was his performance and not another actor. Ralph Fiennes was also a spectacular figure in Laszlo De Almasy. After seeing it, I had a new respect for his ability! What you can say apart, look at this picture again. (*****)
