I & Pa Kettle's characters were very popular and controversial. The films that offered their family paved the way for the television systems that came after it and tried to emulate their winning formula. One obvious reference is "Beverly Hillbillies", where a new home was bought with oil, not a competition. One could even say that the 1980s sitcom Newhart borrowed its idea from this series of rural actors upside down. However, he does not know if the Washington-based author Betty Macdonald, who created these characters, did not do more harm than good. His portrayal of mountainous characters makes them the backdrop of many jokes about their alleged disobedience and laziness. (The real life family that Macdonald based on Kettles successfully complained ... claiming they were ridiculed and humiliated by their ridiculous references.) Of course, this comedy and situations bring us a lot of laughs and fun moments ... and political correctness As we know it today, it wasn't in the 1940s and 1950s. But I think Macdonald could have made these signs more meaningful, and Universal International could have shown their screenwriters more dignity on the screen (there is such a good taste). More realistic moments are when the eldest son Tom has shamed his rural heritage but learns to accept his parents and siblings for who they are. Kettles, for their part, have to realize that they are not suitable for the modern world. It's not a joke ... it's a sober truth.
