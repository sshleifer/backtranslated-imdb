I was very curious to see the initial six-hour miniatures that Steven Soderbergh's last film was based on, and now that I have, I'm happy to say that one is no better than the other. They are both intelligent, inclusive and very fun. The only real advantage that mini-systems have in front of the film is that it is three and a half hours longer, so we know these symbols deeper. <br /> <br /> There was no false statement about this production, which should definitely take time if PBS transmits this ministry repeatedly in 2001. You won't regret it.
