Lovely but deadly Alexandra (Stacie Randall, a stunning-looking blonde-beauty who looks absolutely drunk in black leather) must find a magical amulet so her evil demonic champion Faust can move into our dimension. It's up to fearless, tough police officer Jonathan Graves (pleasant Peter Liapis) to stop him. In the meantime, two ruthlessly failed "comic reliefs" dwarf gnome creatures are working in Los Angeles. Jim Wynorski, an expert on the use of flavored veteran cards, associates an extremely false story at a vigorous pace and does not take any of this stupidity seriously from a distance. Cast a fight against pretty stupid material: adorable Barbara Alyn Woods as a buggy, police captain Kate, Raquel Krelle tortina, sexy whore Jeanine, Bobby Di Cicco as Graves worshiping, exciting partner Scotty, Peggy Trentin as an attractive museum curator Monica and Ace mask as fun dr Roche. Mark Stev's gentle cookie cut script, funny humor with a funny sense of humor, Chuck Cirino's delicate cornball score, two dwarf boys who are obviously playing cheap cheap Halloween Halloween masks, JE Bash's usual cinematography, no tension or free nudity of a woman and sticky (less than) special effects further the delicious cheese of the main part of this cellulite, Velveeta. An entertainingly meaningless piece of gentle fear.
