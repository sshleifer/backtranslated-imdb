Errol Flynn's dirty charm in this fascinating and exciting, but historically bankrupt, famous (and some notorious) General Custer, who follows his career from his first day in West Point through the Civil War and from West to Battle in Little Horn, while competing with Grandmaster Arthur Kennedy and romanticize Olivia de Havilland. <br /> <br /> Some may say that Flynn, who delivers excellent, amazing performance as a general, is basically playing Custer! <br /> <br /> Green production (which should have been at Technicolor), well run by Raoul Walsh, died with their boots. Here are some really staged battles. It is also a real treat to see Anthony Quinn, who plays Crazy Horse. <br /> <br /> Last year, Flynn played Jeb Stuart as opposed to Ronald Reagan's George Custer at Santa Fe Trail (also with de Havilland), the second-packed Warner Brothers production is designed to make you a class of history!
