After a few minutes to pray, the second to die, Clay McCord (Alex Cord) is an unfortunate permit with ten thousand dollars of head and degenerative epilepsy. <br /> <br /> Understanding his days with the law is numbered he desperately (albeit somewhat reluctantly) exploiting the amnesty provided by the harsh and tumble territorial governor Robert Ryan (excellent performance), who wants to give up McCord's way and accept amnesty badly As an example to others, if they are a bandit hub for Escondito, the regular Mario Brega intends to kill McCord to stop it from happening. <br /> <br /> Also starring Arthur Kennedy, Aldo Sambrell and other familiar European faces, this (American) spaghetti writes and produces Western pioneer Albert Band, who is also responsible for Leone's pre-movie Gunfight At Red Sands For. <br /> <br /> Although the protagonist's "epilepsy" solution is lifted straight from Howard Hawks' El Dorado, the script is strong, pretty fresh and unpretentio us. It has a great balance between action and story, and Alex Cord is great. He should have been a bigger star. <br /> <br /> Defending a shorter (well dubbed) English version: Personally, I have passed the age where a longer version is always a better version and the end where McCord is ironically kidnapped by grimy bounty hunters after his pardon is unnecessarily nihilistic and destroys full of hope and redemption of the film's message. <br /> <br /> Call me old-fashioned, but I took McCord and felt that he earned this happy ending!
