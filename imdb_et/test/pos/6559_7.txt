<br /> <br /> Horror movie time, Japanese style. Uzumaki / Spiral was perfect from start to finish. It's a fun freakfest, but sometimes it was too cramped, not horror. The story is summed up in complex terms: carefree, normal teenage girl faces w / extremely disturbing events, because the small town where she lives seems to be under the control of spirals. Spirals are everywhere, in the air, in the clouds, in dirt and in everyday objects. Spirals drive people and they do bad things. One more thing, people become random acts. Why? Who knows or cares, people become acts, that's enough for me. It wasn't as scary as it was scary, because it doesn't have many offensive or offensive attacks when horror movies often do. Uzumaki prefers to squeeze and climb (like a snail can!), Not hit. Favorite scene: The woman is in the hospital at the sleeping place, when that long, thousand-foot-legged creature goes into the room and slowly sleeps over the sheets, over the pillow and her sleeping ear. I ran and twisted my toes. Uzumak has a handful of scenes that are really violent, but which are kind of humorous. For example, a man is obsessed with w / spirals, he gets into his laundry because he sees a spiral spin, he makes a spiral of suicide in a washing machine. The last vision we see him is all his body rolled and rubber, the human spiral w / a single eye that flashes in the middle of the washing machine. A strange picture. Uzumak has bold psycho-slopes that add to that charm and fun. I love horror movies like that. It's not about killing, la movies, it's about evil forces (spirals!), Taking you over and trying to kill you, forcing you to kill others. Films such as Uzumaki prove that there are many ways to make a horror movie and thank you for it
