The best romantic comedy I've seen over the years. Not such a slip over Ben Holer and Adam Sandler's top Hollywood things and much less syrup than Hugh Grant's epic. Julianne Nicholson and Jay Mohr are perfectly cast and both offer a smooth professional appearance as an engaging couple who decide to spend their sexual oats before marriage. Instead of just laughing at it, the writers and the director made a nice mix of people's knowledge and comedy. Nicholson is just great because the uncomfortable seductress and Mohr are doing a good job as a man who reluctantly enters the game but soon finds his enjoyment too much. We just see enough supportive characters to round the plot without disturbing the main story. Andy Richter (serious friend) and Helen Slater (single mother) are especially good. There are many meanings and emotional complexities to make it much more than a normal boy-girl. Indeed, with a little better pace and a bit more cutting, this film would have ten comedies.
