I've seen this movie more than once. In fact, El Padrino was one of the best feature films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> There was a great cast of Jennifer Tilly, Faye Duanway, Brad Dourif and Damian Chapa, who really looked like Kilo in this regard is a real star. <br /> <br /> I heard that the movie was shot for less than two million dollars. I've seen 33 million movies that can't be compared to quality and production value. <br /> <br /> Damian Chapa Why You Don't Get Bids And More Movies! SIZE WORK !!!!!!!!!! I can't wait to see the sequel, and I hope it has the same action. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Tilly has made a classical culture with Sabeva. <br /> <br /> Damian Chapa moves every way into a scene similar to the 40's and 50's movie stars. So sick to see those non-charismatic actors like Ben Stiller, who gets all those films when talent is such that has something to show. great movie. <br /> <br /> Go GO KICK NOW AS SALES EL PADRINO !!!
