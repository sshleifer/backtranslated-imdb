I have to say that in general, Barbie Movies has impressed me. I have a 5-year-old Barbie fanatic niece and she looks at them all the time so there's no need to say I've seen many of these Barbie holidays, but I'm not sick of them. <br /> <br /> This movie, visually has a lot to offer, especially with backgrounds, and the animation of characters for each new movie has improved. One thing I noticed in particular was Barbie's hair animation in this movie. Classical music is a great choice for excerpts and I think it's great because it creates a new generation for the classic. This movie is worth back, especially if you have young relatives. They are entertained for hours!
