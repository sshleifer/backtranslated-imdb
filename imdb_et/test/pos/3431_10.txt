This thing works at all levels - it is intense as a thriller, full of Lars von Trier's respects, but also a very own movie - and it has a message: happiness comes from within, the best personally wounded soldier who practically (And, believe it or not, humorously) breaks down the entire film through the limb limb, while apologizing to others for their introduction. You're laughing at him, but you're gonna fuck him. The central character is a well-meaning, but clumsy writer who spends the entire film trying to help those he rides with his friends from Stockholm to Berlin right after World War II. It binds parallel stories together and screws people in the process. If you say that things are going wrong, it is underestimated - and structurally, all the characters are completely in conflict with one another. It's like each one has the opposite - just as dense as anti-matter bounces. You don't believe sick things that you laugh at. To say more about qualifying as a spoiler - all I can say is the shame that this movie hasn't been published in the US, not even on DVD. Probably told me the Americans wouldn't get it - what's nonsense because we can't just do things like South Park ... If this movie is marketed in the US, it should be sold in black and white comedy because that's it . Overall, sick and twisted, but fuuuuunnnnnyyyyy!
