Fantastic movie! Wow - it's really curative. I can't believe I discovered a pearl of such a movie. <br /> <br /> A pretty young girl who travels south to Florida meets a friendly older couple with RV after she has a holiday stay. But he learns that things are not as they seem, and the couple gets a little awful after spending some time on the road. <br /> <br /> Everyone who was there was just so perfect for their parts, almost believe you look at it in real life. <br /> <br /> Newbie Emily Grace did a fantastic job as a truly cute but somewhat shy Alice. Emily gives you the feeling that you understand what she is experiencing, and see how she got into the evolving movie. I'm sure we'll see Emilia in more movies in the future. <br /> <br /> Contrary to what some others have said, lighting and photography are just perfect. The editing was also well done - just the right way to bring pictures from the road to give you the feeling that you are traveling along the road with your journey. <br /> <br /> I didn't see it on the big screen, but I can urge everyone to see and see it. More of these movies are * exactly * what we need. <br /> <br /> SF
