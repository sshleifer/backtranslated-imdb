I haven't seen this beautiful movie in 50 years, but I'll post any comments on it anyway. <br /> <br /> Although the JACK WEBB movie was undoubtedly meant for entertainment only, showing a mid-range training, Parris Island is realistic as it is a difficult character - it was said that the military was afraid that the film didn't want recruitment. It didn't work that way. The film showed that entering the navy was a greater challenge than most young people ever thought, and (guess what?) King's challenge was just what many boys wanted. I personally knew a lot of men who joined the Navy soon after they saw THE DI. The recruitment centers were suddenly so long that the Navy had more employees than they were able to do. <br /> <br /> So it goes. In America, there are always young people trying to make the best, while slackers and losers are slipping through. <br /> <br /> What we are not in 2007 are films that inspire patriotism, commitment to commitment, positive values, and more. What we do is films that inspire the head and the air heads, the beer drinkers, the other negative values. Exhibition # 1 is that airborne teens travesty and epic SUPERBAD beer is now # 81 on All Time Great Films. Values? What do you mean, values?
