In the last days of 1999, most of all have died in Taiwan. The strange plague has ruined the island. Cockroaches are said to be spreading the disease to their victims as a psychosis where they act like insects. Finally they die. Hole takes place in a crumbling apartment house (which is especially well-designed; betting designer!). His two main characters live directly above and below each other. The woman on the lower floor and the pipes in her apartment leak violently, threatening to destroy her food supply, not to mention her mystery. He calls the plumber to go out and he accidentally strikes the hole through the floor of a human apartment. These two have never met before and come across a hole. <br /> <br /> The script is quite brilliant. Few movies are funny at the same time, but remain completely human, deeply exploring the human situation, especially the feelings of loneliness and despair. Tsai direction is just beautiful. Like many other Taiwanese leaders, it takes a long time. But to say differently, Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Tsai doesn't use them. Actually, I don't know if I've ever seen them better. They are always effective and never annoying. <br /> <br /> It would be wrong to watch this movie without mentioning musical numbers. Yes, Hole is also musical and great. In the best scenes of the movie - which says something, considering all the other scenes - the man predicts that the woman is a singer, almost a cabaret singer. These numbers are completely choreographed, often a backup of dancers and singers. In the stroke of the gene, Tsai is these carefully produced numbers in a crumbling building, signs of apocalypse and decay. It provides both a sin and an absurd feeling. <br /> <br /> Hole is a movie to be seen. It should be a cult class, if nothing else. Before I saw it, I was told that this is a decent film, but probably Tsai Ming-liang is the least good. Well, if that's true, I just can't wait to see you! 10/10.
