Affable ambitious cartoonist Hoops McCann (John Cusack's wonderful entertainment) and his best friend George (deliciously deadpan Joel Murray) go to Nantucket for high school graduation in summer. Hasses, George, and several newcomers come to Cassandra's help (Demi Moore's most charming), a singer whose family house is threatened by the greedy Beckersted clan. Writer / director Savage Steve Holland often offers a funny and frighteningly loud, loose, stupid, but still funny joke. Persistent madness has a real pointless, kind-hearted and infectiously viable vitality that is impossible to dislike or resist. What's more, lively and enthusiastic gaming adds enormous joy: Bobcat Goldthwait as spastic Egg Stork, Tom Villard as his silly brother Clay, Curtis Armstrong as the sweet Ack Raymond, Mark Metcalf as a rich rich. Aquilla Beckersted, Matt Mulhern as Average Teddy, Kimberly Foster as a Jerking Cookie, Joe Flaherty as Gung-Ho General Raymond, William Hickey, a harsh old man Beckerstedena, Jeremy Piven as a cunning preppy tease Ty and John Matuszak a stray biker Stan. Isidore Mankofsky's sliding cinematography, hip-thrashy soundtrack, Cory Lerios 'cool rockin' score and funky animation are all equally excellent. One of the funniest scenes: an egg in a Godzilla suit that terrorizes a cozy dinner. Absolute hoot.
