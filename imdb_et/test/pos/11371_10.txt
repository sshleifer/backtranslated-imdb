Okay - it was a black and white and probably a 2 inch tape - which means the BBC swept it, right? But I think all these years (1960?), Which is the perfect piece of history, inspired by the most innovative editions and wonderful actors who are full of youth and cruelty. <br /> <br /> WANT IT! Do you read this, BBC? Find your original 2-tapes or 35mm film, deal with actors and directors rights and reissue! I know I know some of them are dead, some of them missing in action. <br /> <br /> Where else can I see Mary Morrist as "a snake's heart packed in a tiger hide?" Where else can I see Paul Daneman doing this: "Now is the winter of dissatisfaction ...."? Or Robert Hardy speaks of "this idol ceremony"?
