Four friends are one of those films you expect without having to find yourself in the loop. You move it away, but then you hear Ray Charles' song "Georgia Mind My" and the images and vague feelings start blinking on your edge of the consciousness and then you remember that crazy movie that made you laugh and cry almost at the same time. <br /> <br /> Why is this movie so memorable? First of all, at least for the people who lived through it, because it strikes so well - its crossed hopes, its advancements, sincerity, and above all the emotional roller-path that leads to terrifying nostalgia. And then it just works so amazing. Danilow, all the annoyance and passion, Georgia, as difficult to understand as the will, but enchanting, but Louis and the disabled room who have the charm to save, who attacks life and enjoys a smiling smile every moment, because he knows only too well that it may be his last. <br /> <br /> How long has it been since you saw a movie that made you really care about the story of people? Even if they were far from perfect? The film introduces you to people whose choices may not be praiseworthy, but the film is not immoral, but allows us to assess the human condition in all its diversity ... even minors have a well-defined personality and history, which is why this film seems so real even when when some activities and reactions may seem up ... because that's how life is when you think about it. And why this film grabs you with a character's complexity. Really amazing and satisfying experience.
