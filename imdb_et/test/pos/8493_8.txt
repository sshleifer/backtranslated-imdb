Let's get a mistake right from the top - the movie should be much longer. Ray Charles was a wonderful, exciting man who led a difficult and complicated life. It just couldn't match this in a standard length movie - or even touch it. Considering that the makers of this film made an admirable (and I am sure quite tempting) task to produce a film that could not tell the whole story, but managed to bring out a representative sample of man and his music. Ray Charles's strengths appeared throughout the film, and his weaknesses were neither amplified nor covered with sugar. We could have wished for another hour of life after 1980, but I think it would have tended to respect the film, and even though it would have allowed us to solve a number of things that were hanging at the end, I think the balance was better than the one presented. <br /> <br /> Now the big question: what are the Oscar criteria? Woman and I have seen several films in our years, but we immediately agreed that we had never seen Jamie Foxx equality. The line between the actor and the character was not vague - but it disappeared completely. We had heard a lot of hype before seeing the movie, but it was amazing. Foxx WAS Ray Charles. You weren't looking at the film's feeling that you were watching Foxx, who made Ray Charles's outstanding work - you looked at it somehow believing or realizing that you were watching Ray Charles himself. I don't know how to do it. We were completely blown away. I testify that we have not seen any other performances for the Oscar this year, but that is not really important. Foxx took it to a whole nut level that we have never seen before and we doubt we could ever see it. I am not thinking of any other film I've ever seen, where a person who plays a part so fully and convincingly became a depicted person. We welcome you, Mr Foxx. We understand that giving an Oscar is much more than a performance, but whether you win, we want you to know that you have done something that is completely in the classroom and you should be enormously proud of your unparalleled achievement. <br /> <br /> PS Music was, of course, great. I noted to the woman that if there was one moment in the history of music that I would like to have, I could have witnessed, "What am I saying" (Kansas City, isn't it?)? The film did an excellent job - just wish I had been there!
