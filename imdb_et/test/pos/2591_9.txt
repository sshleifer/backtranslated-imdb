It is these three central comics (Rabbit Fire and Duck! Rabbit, Duck!) And it's the three weakest, though quite funny. It just depends on one paw, that's too much. Still a good comic. I feel compassion for Daffy in what is rare to me. Daffy is so clear that it gets painful from time to time. Great cartoon great series. Recommended.
