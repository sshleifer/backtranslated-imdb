I saw this movie years ago and I never forgot it. The topic is very timely. It was this morning at TCM and I mean why this wonderful movie is not VHS or DVD. I've been looking for this movie thoroughly, but I can't find it. I believe that if enough people request it, the movie will eventually be put on a DVD. It amazes me that such stunning from Quinn and such a powerful plot is not yet available to the public. The fact that ethnic cleansing today exists in many parts of the world is changing the film for both teachers and students. This film is a great teaching tool of the past, but in many ways as modern as "Crash". Based on earlier comments, I see this film as a deep impression on everyone. Again, too bad it is not for sale.
