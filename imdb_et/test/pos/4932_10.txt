When I was a kid, I loved "Tiny Toons". I especially loved "Tiny Toons: how I spent my summer vacation". I thought it was laughing on the floor. A few years later my friend had a video. And I thought I'd watch it for the good old days. I was still laughing on the floor. I think Plucky and Hampton are the best. They decide to go to "Happy World Land". And they finally have a crazy adventure. All the sketches are funny. I'm still looking for a video. So, if anyone has any advice. Please write me. <br /> <br /> This is one of the funniest cartoons I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 10/10
