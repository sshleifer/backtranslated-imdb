Scooby Doo and the Mexican monster were undoubtedly the most modern animated features of Scooby Doo. Loch Ness Monster is a remarkable improvement. <br /> <br /> This time the gang reaches Scotland to see Highland games and visit Blake Castle, home of Daphne's ancestors. And don't you know that the castle is on the "wonderful" fisherman's side of Drumnadrochit, on the shores of Loch Ness. <br /> <br /> During their stay, they meet some interesting people. First of all, Fiona Pembrooke, a scientist who has thrown all his money into finding a Loch Ness monster. <br /> <br /> Sir Ian Locksley, Commander of the National Heritage Museum of Scotland, is his incredible believer of Nessie. <br /> <br /> Haggarts, on your cozy Inn Loch. Sons are a couple of local jokes, always outrageous. <br /> <br /> Del Chilman, a wild, paranoid hippie guy who is convinced that the monster is out there and won't let anything be found. <Br / And finally, Duncan MacGubbin, the captain of the dock, who has seen Nessie too many times. <br /> <br /> Most of these characters are stereotypes that are a bit annoying because it teaches younger audiences the burden of nonsense and giving the wrong impression. But if you can get yourself immune, you're fine. Being from Scotland, I can't help but fight the terribly imitated Scottish accent. Fact: We don't sound like that. <br /> <br /> Nessie, which is rather demonic than normal, will soon appear and cause confusion. It looks like the gang has a second secret. Following are the usual pursuit scenes, hints and Shaggyi clever masks. There's a lot of laugh. Animation is great, with some atmospheric scenes and locations. And the plot is much better than the Mexican Monster. <br /> <br /> The only bad thing this time is music. I leave Louis Febre's score and the songs here are pretty rotten. Where Are The Hex Girls When You Need It? <br /> <br /> Area 2 DVD is crystal clear 1.78: 1 anamorphic widescreen (area 1 not) with Dolby 5.0 sound. There are some good additions. Definitely worth getting.
