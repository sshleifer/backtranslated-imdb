The film's Hindi version is 121 minutes. The film (based on the Tagore novel) set in Bengal at the beginning of the 1900s draws an analogy between British colonization and subjugation of women. An educated and beautiful woman, Binodin becomes a widow within one year of marriage, but she does not accept the restrictions she has placed on her society. The film has this beautiful look, but perhaps Aishwarya Rai, out of her depth, depicts Binodin's strong character with a subtle combination of idealism and indignation. The Binodin ideal does not come into contact and as a result, the analogy between women and colonization is somewhat buried.
