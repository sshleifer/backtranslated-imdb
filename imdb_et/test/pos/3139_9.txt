Wagon Master is a very unique film among John Ford's work. Mainly because it is the only one based on John Ford's own stage, a story developed by Frank Nugent and the son of the director? Patrick Ford and the scenario have changed and the director's personal opinion on this is the Wagon Master film, John John, called "closest to what I wanted to achieve", to say that he says little, but as Ford admitted to Lindsay Anderson, his favorite was however, my darling clementine and none other. <br /> <br /> Wagon Master has all the ingredients you could find in John Ford's movie. Wonderful cast, giving your best, you don't have any bigger stars except the most skilled participants? Ben Johnson. Very peculiar little characters offering a mandatory comic, and the Wagon Master has quite a few of them, such as the horn of a sister Ledyard (Jane Darwell), but very inspired by concerts. And last but not least, the legendary Monument Valley with John Ford's fifth mileage after Stagecoach, My Darling Clementine, Fort Apache, and He wore a yellow ribbon. <br /> <br /> The film begins with two friends' cowboys Travis Blue (Ben Johnson) and Sandy Owens (Harry Carey Jr) are hired as wagons captains or commanders for the Mormon settlers caravan going to Silver Valley, a place for them as permitted land. On their way they have joined a very special Dr. Locksley Hall (Alan Mowbray) with two beautiful women who are allegedly his wife and daughter and who call themselves actresses. They are moving in the same direction simply because they have recently left the nearest town and have no other place. Nothing particularly unpleasant happens before they get into Cleggs, a gang of a dangerous family, consisting of a father and his three sons, who are on a march in the city, where they recently murdered and abducted. <br /> <br /> Overall, the Wagon Master is not more than one valuable pearl of John Ford's superb western necklace. Must see. 9/10 <br /> <br />
