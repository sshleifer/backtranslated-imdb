I was expecting this to be good after I saw some great moments in the ozone and read a lot about it ... but this movie is brilliant - smart, very bright (emotionally and visually), perfect at all moments. Every movement is there for a reason, everything fits so close and first to true and honest. it is a film about beauty and innocence; its simplicity.
