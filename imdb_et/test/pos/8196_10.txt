After watching the film a few times, I found so many touches and emotions in the dialogue. Jing Ke, Assassin has become one of the favorite films of all time. This fine Chinese actress says more about her eyes and words and movements of the economy, then any big screen American actress today. The Emperor, Qin, is brilliant when he directs the audience to believe in goodness in his heart, but to unleash the most brutal acts to the people around him. Promises he does with incredible passion and broken evil fists. Gong Li, like in almost every movie I've ever seen, is just fantastic. His screen domination is so graceful and emotionally charged. <br /> <br /> If you couldn't say, I loved this movie. <br /> <br />
