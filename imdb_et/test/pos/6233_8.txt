After a group of young friends are dropping off the beaten track while driving, they alone accept the offer of a local wax mannequin by a local museum owner, Chuck Connors. If they are horrible on the roadside attraction, their friends will lie down with a disguising rune who can bring the dummies of the museum to life. <br /> <br /> A bad tourist boy is a demented cross from Texas Chain Saw Massacre's Leatherface and Anthony, a terrifying boy from the classic Twilight Zone episode "It's a Good Life", while the plot is a mix of the aforementioned TCM, Hitchcock Psycho and Wax House Elements. However, the atmosphere and the realization of the tourist field are so completely turned off that it is practically impossible to compare with other earlier films. <br /> <br /> Continuous inventive and unpredictable treatment by director David Schmoeller, his own script gives the film a clear nightmare quality and the Connors' grand left-handed appearance, Pino Donaggio's incredibly horrible score, a set of removable jaws with truly undisturbed dummies and super sexy Tanya Roberts, who spends the film (and, shortly) on a small denim of hot pants and a hobby-hobby figure, a tourist trap is completely unforgettable and ultimately a cultural experience.
