It's such a fun and touching version of the classic story, also quite intelligent, not "We Tarzani, Sa Jane" school at all. <br /> <br /> This is a famous story about raising a child in monkeys in monkeys. The headed British couple (her husband pregnant) is after a forest wreck in the African forest. After the parents die, the baby is raised in the jungle by the monkeys. Twenty years later, this young man (i.e. Tarzan) rescues a wounded Belgian investigator who can return him to health. Belgium finds evidence that his savior is a young Lord Greystoke and returns him to his legitimate possession in Scotland, where he has to adapt to a civilized society. <br /> <br /> The film is divided into two parts. In the first half, we see Tarzan in its jungle environment. Since I'm not an expert, I don't know what the realism of depicting the life of his non-human primitive community is, but it is definitely fun. For me, the other part is more mobile when Tarzan has to respond to his real family, develop language skills and adapt to aristocratic British society, while Jane (Andie MacDowell). He is depicted as a "noble savage", whether in the wild or in the elegant Edwardian halls. In contrast, the upper crust is depicted so often much more barbaric than the jungle Tarzan on the left. He transmits the real sense of confusion and conflict that has been torn between two different worlds, his original monkey family and the new person. Sir Ralph Richardson, one of the old British legends, is brilliant, as always as Tarzan's grandfather, Greystoke's sixth ball. The film focuses more on Tarzan's struggles to adapt to civilization and its internal conflict than its jungles. This unusual old classic make it a typical dramatic adventure as well as a moving personal story. I was not surprised to note that his manager is the same person, Hugh Hudson, who also led the fire, another great film.
