Most of this political thriller was mainly presented as a mill film, which had a somewhat better development with many great characters that were very welcome until the twist of BIG and the powerful climax that resembled "the silence of lambs" or "The Sixth Sense". Reese Witherspoon as a lost Egyptian spouse and Yigal Naori, a heavily armed interviewer, is a distorted woman offering strong performances. Unfortunately, Jake Gyllena is given a more two-dimensional character and has to fight the stereotypical presentation of an emotionally torn CIA analyst in many other films. Early, there is a nice scene with an explosion similar to 'Saver Saver', a silent scene that was used to reflect one of the consequences of violence. The script also gives a little more look at the "enemy" mood, but does not allow the audience to really understand much, allowing the audience to re-stereotypically characterize. Cinema and photography are also somewhat devastated because, unlike the absence of "Jarhead" or "Blackhawk Down", a crisp, raw visceral performance that does not allow the audience to actually be in the movie is a distance that keeps the audience from realizing the intensity of the emotions that appear on the screen. In general, the film ultimately redeems itself, providing the audience with a measured glimpse of the complexity of using the United States and the possible complications and consequences that may arise from its use. Ten stars eight.
