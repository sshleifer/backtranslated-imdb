This Norwegian film starts with a man who jumps over the subway and probably suicides. But the next scene shows that he arrives in a lonely bus desert. He meets a man and is sent to a mysterious city where he starts working as an accountant in an aseptic modern office. Contributors seem nice when they are guarded, he will soon meet a girlfriend, but the city seems strange because food has no taste, alcohol does not make you drunk and there are kids. Is it a dream or is it in paradise or hell? Though sometimes the movies look like the Twilight Zone extended episode (even after ninety minutes the film looks a bit long), it makes sense. The best scenes are those where exaggeration is minimal, as when people are involved in interior design in banal conversations and retreat from discussing deeper issues. I always thought that in developed capitalist societies there is something inhuman, as they try to push the basic demands of human nature. And this film is best when criticized by this lifestyle. Unfortunately, the film reaches a great length and the director does not seem to know how to finish it, but most of the time is worth it.
