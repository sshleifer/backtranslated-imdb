I don't understand why critics would subdue this movie. It's a teen movie that's really serious, which is rare. I testify that there are moments that are very delicate, but it is young for love, it must be real. My biggest complaint is Chris Klein. Although he was funny at the American Pie, he is probably not ready to become a more dramatic ticket, but he is very uncomfortable looking at some of his "mama stuff". Hartnett and Sobieski, on the other hand, show remarkable depth and credibility, as do the parents. Although the script is closely mixed with poets who show poetics, the actor does this job. Powerful images are displayed on the control sports screen. Beautiful cinema, nice music, great young actors, I was impressed and I'm a fucking critic when it comes to teenage movies.
