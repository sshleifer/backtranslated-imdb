It covers almost all areas of the creative process and runs through three stages chronologically, with the emphasis placed on production. There are documentaries that go into more detail and cover the other two groups better. It consists of works of art, scenes, movie clips and many interviews. If the runtime is just over two hours, the audience has the right to get a lot of information as it is almost as long as the film itself. It can be said that a lot of time is spent on people, crafts and the results of their collaboration in second place. It's well done, tight editing. It gets into some technology and shows how certain effects have been achieved. It spends a lot of time on physical training, fighting and such. You will be pleasantly sincere people, teams and actors. The Ultimate Matrix 10-Disc also comes with nearly three hours of music, a simple system, individual track selection, and BTS material with around 38 minutes of value in addition to the title. However, the original edition has several very short additional features, including queuing clips, previews of Animatrix and Yuen Wo Ping blocking materials (full pass pairs of the biggest martial arts sequences with stunts) and near-accurate cinematography with the same shots and angles of these bits ready for the silver screen effort) . The language is quite strong, but rarely, almost non-existent. I recommend either of these versions to anyone who enjoys this concept, and / or want to know how they first put together. 7/10
