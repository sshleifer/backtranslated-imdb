This film is absolute gold. If you haven't seen it, do it. Mani Ratnam comes out again. This film also introduced me to Nandita Das, although everything in this movie seems to be. My only regret is that I have never found a copy of the lyrics with subtitles. We are led to the peaceful beaches of South India in the jungle of northern Sri Lanka, as well as from the fear of war to the love of the human heart. Beautiful, subtle, witty, a couple of hidden surprises awaiting the viewer, this movie is back and forth again, and the story inside the story, The Umbrella, is done as well as watching the scenes from the drawings open in the book. Cute. Look out.
