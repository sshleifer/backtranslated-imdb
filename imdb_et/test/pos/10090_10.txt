usually the film may have such factors as "awakening", "good feeling", "expediency feeling", "plot", etc. There is always something that can be taken out of movies, but it is just a matter of good reason. , I have it in my collection. The "two sister stories", as they call it in my home country, are a huge feeling and finally (mostly) a self-evident plot, I love horror films that emerge around the house. Others, "Haunting", "Hell House's Ghost", is another great example I remember because the film had a very rich color, just as the house was decorated with characters in open glowing daylight scenes, unlike most horror movies that usually use desaturated shades and gloomy surroundings (I think Honogurai mizu no soko kara, Dark Water, which is another show) that gives this film a sense of aesthetics and joy if it wasn't more, in the gripping moments, because the characters are extremely believable, this can be partly attributed to the familiar situation of this film, maybe it is easier for both domestic issues and oneself than the actors have agreed and the participants are extraordinarily fine in nature. to allow them to reach their terms of interpretation instead of presenting everything linearly. a positive aspect, and maybe it's an interpretation of my movie that makes me enjoyable. I'll definitely watch this on DVD.
