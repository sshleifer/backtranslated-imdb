I loved the movie I just saw at the Philadelphia Film Festival. In March 2005 I went to India with two friends and this movie was very real. I tied everything and enjoyed every moment. The characters are plausible, the story tends to end and realistic, but not sentimental. I also liked the discussion with the director after the show. This film shows very well the blending of two worlds (East and West), but not full blending. Supporting casting was wonderful, depicting the life a tourist meets in India quite realistically. Humor is subtle and sometimes dry, and it makes it even more realistic because it is woven into everyday characters. It is so easy to identify with each of the situations depicted.
