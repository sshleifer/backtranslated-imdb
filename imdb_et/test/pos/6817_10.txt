I was happy to see Joshua Leonard screening for this remarkable short film before it premiered at the 2005 Sundance Festival. In the twelve short but subtle minutes, Leonard leads us into a life-changing road as he tries one of the most controversial social and ethical issues facing our society today. The film is an elegant direction, moving performances and a heart-shaped story. Kelli Garner and Lucas Haas radiate as two lovers. And Leonard proves in his first dramatic narrative as a leader with a good future. I feel this short should be expanded into a feature film. Talent is hard to describe, but when this debut film shows you know it when you see it!
