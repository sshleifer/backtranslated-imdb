After five years of imprisonment, Tony le Stéphanois (Jean Servais) meets his dearest friends Jo (Carl Möhner) and Italy's Mario Ferrat (Robert Manuel) and they call Tony to steal a couple of jewels from the famous jewelry window Mappin & Webb Ltd, but he refuses. Tony finds a former girlfriend, Mado (Marie Sabouret), who became a lover of the gangster owner of the nightclub L 'Âge d' or Louis Grutter, and humbles her by beating behind her and taking jewels. Then he calls Joe and Mario and suggests a safe burglary. They invite an Italian safe specialist and an elegant wolf Cesar (Perlo Vita) to join their team and create the perfect heir. They are successful in their plans, but D. Juan Cesar is doing things wrong when he gives his lover a valuable circle. <br /> <br /> "Du Rififi Chez les Hommes" is a great movie noir, definitely one of the best I've ever seen. The scenario has credibility, supported by Jules Dassini's fantastic direction, the amazing performance of cast and large cinema. Jean Servais has excellent results in the role of a criminal whose principles are guided by the rules of the underworld. Heist's famous long silent sequence is amazing and extremely tense and is definitely one of the best in cinema history. I read this great movie on my favorite movie list. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Rififi"
