Stan Laurel, it has been observed, first made a real name, appearing in the short parades of popular feature films in the 1920s. He proves that he is a great comic actor and performer "Mud and Sand" (Rudolph Valntino's "blood and sand" parody), but I think that this movie really does not because Laurel was a big satir, but because it Allows the audience to jump into comedy familiar with the situation and scenes. Then Laurel can be let go of her inspired gags without having to create a context with or without it. I watched it a day after watching "Blood and Sand"; it certainly improved the experience to find out what is being paralleled and where. <br /> <br /> Scene where Laurel's character (Rhubarb Vaseline, if you believe name cards, or Rhubarb Vaselino, if you believe her name is written on a chalkboard) will deprive her mother of money for a double, a twin trick is funny in itself because it is a great gag, but it is especially funny when the viewer is aware of how he takes the air out of Valentino's extravagant and melodramatic promises to give his mother all the desires he wants. <br /> <br /> This is the best Stan Laurel solo job I've seen. It's just funny - even more if you have had the opportunity to see the source material.
