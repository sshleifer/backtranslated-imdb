After the "horror movie" returned (Scream is not scary!) I was not very hopeful with this three budget horror movie. But I was positively surprised! The man it's scary !!! The first 2 stories are just brilliant. The first new couple to ride in the dark forest with their RV when they got tough ........ (see movie)! The second story is about a disgusting man obsessed with a little girl who has been alone at home. I know it doesn't sound special, but it's scary. I promise you. The last story is not scary, but not only bad. It's a biker and haunt. In fact, the stories are based on real city legends (I think Kevin Williamson can also steal ideas). I'd say it's ever more terrifying three-speed-horror movie!
