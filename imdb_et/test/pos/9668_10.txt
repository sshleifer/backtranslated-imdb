It's a bright series by the Simpsons. Following a family when they live through life and problems, and so on. Somewhat less realistic than the Simpsons, someone talked about baby and dog? Family Guy goes where SImpsons or Futurama dare to go past the worst jokes and more joyful hands. And believe me, it works! Almost all gags hit the mark and they have you sewing (especially random, frequent setbacks!) When my brother first showed me this, I wasn't hooked, but after a few episodes I was hooked. You have the 2nd 10/10 really brilliant exhibition. Dogs to Seth Macfarlane for this show. :)
