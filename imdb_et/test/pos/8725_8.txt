Well I would say that this is a very pleasant and somewhat touching film, despite its shortcomings. I didn't believe for a moment that Matthau was the first dentist. It also seemed that Hawn's character was recovering from suicidal depression quite quickly at the beginning of the film. Not to mention the whole thing seemed quite ridiculous. But the movie is successful because of its good pace, humor and its stars. Matthau may not be a dentist, but he was as much fun as usual. Bergman brought a lot of sensitivity to the film (especially during the scene when he and Matthau left for a drink) and a lot of humor. I believe it was his result, which made my brother know this film after questioning a few scenes. Hawn's performance is remarkable, though the Oscar could do it a bit. Basically don't take this movie too seriously and enjoy yourself.
