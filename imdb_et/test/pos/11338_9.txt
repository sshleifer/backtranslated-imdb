Like many Wong movies, many people find they are bored and confusing. Well I like it and I like this movie. I went out and rented it on a DVD and watched it 3 times. This is a very exquisite film that offers an intoxicating experience. for those who didn't enjoy it ...... you just wasted 2 hours of your life ... too bad ... muahahahahaha.
