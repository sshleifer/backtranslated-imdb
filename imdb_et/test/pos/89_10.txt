This is the beauty of the cinema and it shows more of the Quebec culture than probably the other work that comes from the la belle province. This will bring everyone to the first person of the culture as long as you want to glue the hair and live, breathe and eat everything Maurice Richard. The book is both short and short, and I am glad that it was necessary to read both languages ​​throughout the time I studied French at high school. <br /> <br /> I thought it was great that Roch Carrier would tell this story. The thick pressure of his molasses brought a lot of realism. Animation was also good, very surreal, pointing to the idea that it is a lively dream, on the best days of fans. <br /> <br /> Again, as a cultural symbol, it is insurmountable. It almost smells that the tournament is heated slowly with wood. This whole movie deserves endless praise for being proud of being Canada, and we encourage all of us to appreciate the finer things in the family and our roots. I'm in Ontario, and this movie made me love Quebec. Maurice Richard va toujours vivre dans nos factorers.
