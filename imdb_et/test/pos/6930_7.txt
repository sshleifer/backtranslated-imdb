The prerequisite for this is that this film involves two actors (Caine and Moran) who are trying to create a gangster. The plot is at best vague, as the entire plot hole exists. However, this should not normally be important because comedy should wear such a movie. There are some really funny bits (mostly offered by Dylan Moran). At other times, however, there are long melodramatic scenes that do not add anything to the film. Caine's character seemed to me superfluous. Especially at the beginning he constantly quotes Shakespeare and acts as a pompous actor. It can be said that he played this part properly, but it seemed to me to be flat and uncomfortable. In general, I would say only if the participant fan. Otherwise, wait for a video or a TV.
