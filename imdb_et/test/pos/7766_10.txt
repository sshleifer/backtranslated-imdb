I'm trying to be diverse when watching my movie. I can get into "pride and prejudice" as easily as I get into "lost laws". Love Jones is my favorite of all time, this is the standard by which I appreciate all the modern romantic comedies of the city. Being very well, Nia and Darius are on the Lakeshore Drive motorcycle as one of the classic 3-second movies of all time. Of course, it never remembers. When it came out, it would still be a new paradigm for making modern urban films, good actors, weapons, and more. The film industry is somewhat disappointed with me, you have a random drumline or Roll Bounce or Tyler Perry's "Why am I getting married". So if I have to see "my people" on the screen very professionally and stylishly, I love Jones. For many people and opinions about this, the best film has never been made. But this is my personal best. My favorite line from Love Jones "Baby, I just want to come and talk!"
