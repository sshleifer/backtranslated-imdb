Funny movie, I had a nice look at it. The star (Cuneyt Arkin, sometimes credited with Steve Arkin) is a popular actress in Turkey. He has played a lot of harsh roles, epic swords and romances. It was fun to see her international cast and some real bad looking gloves. When I remember, it was also in English, which made things even more fun. (You will definitely see the language of John Wayne speaking Turkish).
