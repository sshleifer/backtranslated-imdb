I just saw this movie and recommend it. This is a very good plot, it has your full attention, the actor is great, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good. A very good movie for really great and unconditional love. The character of Tom Wilkinson is a person who is not ready to start the trial, but he takes the matter as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a play that makes you feel angry and suffering of character. Emily Watson's character is very strong and she only has a quick look and you understand everything. I'm not saying more because it is better if you have to enter the story.
