This movie is a pearl! This is the story of Juliet, a very ordinary cleaning industry, working in a large yogurt industry and the same president, Romuald. He does not recognize him, he does not take anyone to know until several plots put his business away while he was hit. He's lost, nobody turns and nobody trusts when he discovers Juliette. Like a cleaning woman, no one pays her any attention, so they say and make accusations against her that she is smart enough to help her helplessly and unhappy. <br /> <br /> For years I have been watching the DVD and for the last comment in September 2007, it was hoping. Unfortunately, I can't find a DVD, does anyone know if there was / was one?
