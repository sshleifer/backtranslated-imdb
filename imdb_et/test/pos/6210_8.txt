Tom Garner's story opens to his great funeral and is spoken of through elegant setbacks, as told by his faithful lifelong friend, Henry. Henry and his wife discuss whether Tom was a great man and a genius, or a totally worthless fool. The film is beautifully written, behaved and guided, and I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> Tom was a tremendously rich and successful owner of the big railways, dominating his board and his competition, terrorizing his employees. killing strikers. Tom's ambitious wife, Sally, was responsible for all Tom's success. When he met him, he was illiterate and completely satisfied with his job as a railroad track. Sally teaches her to read and take over her trackwalker work when Tom goes to school. He begins to rise one step at a time through the railway hierarchy until he finally takes over as president. <br /> <br /> But when Tom becomes a business center, his marriage to Sally gradually falls. His spoiled son casts him and takes a much younger woman (aptly called Eve) with predictable catastrophic consequences. Tom is fully successful in his business; his personal life is a catastrophic failure. Like "Citizen Kane", Hearst's symbol of the heart is the best and worst capitalist system. <br /> <br /> Spencer Tracy is fantastic in the role of Tom Garner and the authenticity of business events. Colleen Moore is also a great Sally; both ages are beautifully intergenerational. The film was written by Preston Sturges, but there is nothing like the scoops that Sturges became famous for.
