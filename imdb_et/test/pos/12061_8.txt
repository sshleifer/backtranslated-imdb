I like this series. its funny and unique style, sometimes a controversial comedy, is a fresh competition for the genre. Although it is sitcom, it stands out for what may be an uncomfortable subject. <br /> <br /> Every aspect has comedy turns and the show is really great. my favorite song is dad's pretty strange comments. his rants crushes the program and gives a really good flow. not perfect because sometimes comedy is not funny and participants sometimes look for an audience response, but otherwise this program is good. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this program and I am very sorry that it has been canceled. please do another series and finish it properly
