Since 1981, Nintendo has made great video games like Super Mario and Zelda. Most ideas would be a bit boring in 20 years. Nintendo games never seem boring because they always add something new. It went to arcade games for Wii and I heard that the new version of Wii is scheduled for release in 2011. Changing Wii games is so different that you actually do something, not just sitting on the couch by pressing the buttons. <br /> <br /> And I have more good news. Super Mario Galaxy 2 will be released in 2010.
