I have been watching Buffy Vampire Slayer and really did not start to love the show until the beginning of the 4th season. This episode "Hush" was in my mind alone in the dark just after midnight when my windows opened and the wind hated after the storm. The writers of this episode did an excellent job of scaring me about the devil. I was scared of the whole episode I just finished 2 minutes ago. It does not matter what this episode achieves almost without dialogue. If you have never given this example, at least this was an episode. If it doesn't impress you, there's probably no episode. <br /> <br /> BTW My Heart is still racing ...
