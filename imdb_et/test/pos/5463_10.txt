as a former TV editor, I can say it is as authentic as it gets. This even led the Letterman manufacturer (probably as a source) to leave (eventually) in real life. Letterman was outraged (OK, so one funny thing is when he throws a soft ball at his tire roll, his entire production), but the basic information is fun, since Letterman's stupid offer when he decided to leave NBC Leno with an agent who doesn't had been ready for a long time, but who allowed him to show his (almost catastrophic) departure from his famous loyalty. If you don't understand why Letterman is jealous today, look at this tape.
