This film does not only concern feelings and human emotions, but also everything that could be, but it is not. Poetry in films can be terribly boring and annoying, but this film is admirable. Not to mention the amazing Irène Jacob, the great actor in France - one of the best. When the movie ends, you can only feel sorry. After all, if something is really big, we want more (Well, K Kieslowsky's second big movie with Irène Jacob we can always look at La Double vie de Veronique)
