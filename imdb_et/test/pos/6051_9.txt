Being a Marine, I can tell you that D.I. is the exact same image that depicts the Marine Corps boot camp and how boys become men. Jack Webb is great as Sgt.Jim Moore, a tough but fair drill driver on the island of Paris in North Carolina. The film focuses on one recruiter who does not seem to be involved with the program. The latest film, Full Metal Jacket, also shows life in basic training and is worth seeing.
