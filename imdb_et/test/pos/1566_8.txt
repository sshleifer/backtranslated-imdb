Six of the seven people who took the time to comment on this movie have very positive answers. One negative review resides (or did) on the first page of the movie's location in IMDb. <br /> <br /> I found "What Alice Found" is one of the best films that almost no one has heard of this year. This is a 6.4 rating is misleading and may prove to be a more complicated topic than movie quality. Who would think that a movie that is said to be truck stop prostitution would be worth? Guess again. <br /> <br /> For me, Alice was a positive psychological thriller. I was almost on the edge of my seat. This is a very credible story with a realistic script and is very well cast. In a fairer world, actor Judith Ivey won a prize to keep you from being good or bad. <br /> <br /> Ignore the rating and watch this terrible movie. (And by the way, I want to have a soundtrack album there.)
