I think this is Pauly Shore's best thing, he played this part perfectly. I really enjoyed this movie, Patrick Renna is really funny when Zack is a tedious little brother. Son In Law is a good comedy worth your time, but the only thing I wish Tiffany Thiessen was to farm a chick instead of the one they were.
