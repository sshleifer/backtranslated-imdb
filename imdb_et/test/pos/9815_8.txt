This bittersweet slice of magical realism was a checkered production history (director / writer replaced) and a refilled box office, but it's a tender film. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazzello are pre-teen brothers whose flies mother (Lorraine Bracco) captures a middle-spirited alcoholic (Adam Baldwin). During the drinking games, Baldwin Mazzello physically abused him and manipulated him in silence. But when Wood's cotton stuff happens, the boys put their heads together and hatch a fantastic solution to the devastating dilemma of Mazzello. <br /> <br /> I love movies that interfere with fantasy and dark reality. They are rarely successful financially ("Lawn Dogs" is a similar example), but they are usually original and intriguing. <br /> <br /> Drunk Baldwin has been shot from a low-child perspective and his head is deliberately cut under the top of the frame. This device allows us to judge him purely as his actions and as a completely physical forest. Both Wood and Mazzello are great, and they pull us into the dark, frightening world. <br /> <br /> The headline "radio" is a small red wagon that kids transport their stuff. dream. <br /> <br /> Seriously interesting things.
