As you can say here some comments, the mining can be the very last, unless there is a big DVD edition or TCM plays it again! It's a kind of "our gang" movie with many different kids. MGM was definitely a music studio - when musicians, dancers and singers were not contracted, they were tapping. Heifetz was one of the most expensive ..... that makes it a little for charity! The reward he received during this time was outrageous. Another music movie Jose Iturb (Mexican pianist) played nearly 100 children who played some simple voice on 100 piano ...... so those skeptics who think that toddlers aren't musical are wrong: I was one. <br /> <br /> As everyone writes, "Frankie Smith" - a good-to-be American - (Gene Reynolds) was a bad but good child brought by the music school owners from the streets. Do you believe that Walter Brennan ("Prof. Lawson") of all these western films was a school operator? Joel McCrea ("Peter McCarthy") and Andrea Leeds ("Ann Lawson") were the bigger stars "They hold music", along with many well-known appearances (many of whom went into their characters). As others have commented, almost all of the orchestra's children (in fact, the Symphony of Meremble from Los Angeles) made great advances in their lives as musicians (studios) and other companies. <br /> <br /> Sad to say that there are not many young people orchestras today - a sad mistake. Children with children are usually so busy trying to keep their heads on the water and many do not even know what is happening with the children at school. Musical instruction can be expensive and almost everyone would have a football team ..... <br /> <br /> This is the cheapest Jascha Heifetz concert you will ever hear in this movie. .... these days, a quarter. His playing is brilliant, even if he looks like he would be somewhere else ..... emotional. According to the agreement, all Yo-Yo Ma concerts are so happy that you want to go straight out and buy a cello ..... this guy has a good time .... like kids on the street during the concert when they start playing at his school in Heifetz. <br /> <br /> All orchestral numbers played "kids" and make it sound easy. I love this type of movie - their plots are so simple that you don't take two days to find out if you enjoyed or understood the movie at all. We need such new movies - nothing can be done but inspire younger children to play other instruments than guitars ....... Bravo!
