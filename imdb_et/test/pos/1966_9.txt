The river edge is not a PLEASANT movie, but it's incredible. Having looked at it many years ago, I think it would still be able to hit if it was released again or rebuilt. Maybe there has never been any inertia of the youth in the suburban film like this amazing movie. Given that it is based on a real story, it is even more disturbing. Very well acted and just UNPLEASANT many times to watch, but also a little known masterpiece and a truly important film. It should be obligatory to look at what is shown nationwide in all high schools. Fantastic.
