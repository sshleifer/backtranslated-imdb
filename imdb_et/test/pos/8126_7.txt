This movie was a pleasant surprise because I didn't expect much. I did not know that some of the actors have since been capitalized in capital letters. In my Matrix move, my book is not a plus (I hated it), I'm sure it's a career for Hugo. James Purefoy is in it and Jennifer Ehl is great and wonderful. Sometimes it seemed like a Carnaby street romp 30 years later, but I enjoyed the Janis Joplin clothes store, which has blended with contemporary thinking of sexual and gender blur. A realtor who has an erotic relationship with his lists is fun. The Iron-John Men's Meetings are a bit dated, but I still loved them. It is the social satire sex comedy in the best way and reminds me of some old movies "Carry On". The British know how to make sex comedy and this is an old tradition, unlike the United States, which is too rude to really understand that sex is funny.
