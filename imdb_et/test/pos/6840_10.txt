In the DVD era, you might think you could find quite a bit of any piece dedicated to celluloid and in most cases it's true. WHY, why is it so hard to find this great little flick that obviously makes people who love royalties as loving respect (which has never fallen into the land) that most genres of films. Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman are HOOT in this and superstar-in-the-doing Carla Gugino (KAREN SISCO, SIN CITY) makes her now a trademark of red hot babe / good acting routine. <br /> <br /> This movie is really all for movie fans. Steroid b noir, smart and steamy JUDAS KISS succeeds in every census. <br /> <br /> Please Columbia TriStar PLEASE release it on DVD soon !!!!!!
