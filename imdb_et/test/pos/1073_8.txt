mondovino is a moving and rewarding documentary. There is a big difference between a wine producer and a small wine in the wine world. it is not just about the size of your vineyard but also about money and power. if you have enough money to place wine on-view ads and rent wine, unless it's important to your property size. in today's business world too, wine often has to be mass-marketed and suited to people's tastes. which means that the wine of its origin has been filtered several times. mondovino shows the commercial side of wine with the mega producer Robert mondavi and the wine specialist of Michael Rolland, who is shaping the wine according to today's critics like Robert Parker, who is also in the film. now these men are not evil or false, because they have done wine. but they have a powerful big scale. as we all know that power is breaking. Mondovino also shows small wine producers such as Aime Guilbert from the language language and Hubert de montille from Volnay to Burgundy. These wine producers are not hungry growers, but just like all the big wine producers, that is where the grapes come from. its best example is not a wine producer, but a Haitian man working for a wine importer in Neal Rosenthal. The area where grapes are grown is important that the leading hand who knows it is an important real wine.
