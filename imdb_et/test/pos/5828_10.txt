Yes, this show was a lot of male frontrunner, and yes, over the years, the line lines were up, melodramatic and very unreal, but it wasn't important because the show is great. You really deal with the characters and every character, no matter how small or big it is completely cast. <br /> <br /> I can't imagine anyone unless JK Simmons plays the neo-Nazi racist rape leader or anyone else playing Tobias Beecher except Lee Tergesen. Transforming her character from season 2 to season is amazing. However, MADE Oz OZ was characterized by CHRIS KELLER (played by Christopher Melon). He was not in prison with anyone except Beecher (well, with the exception of Ronnie Barlog, but it was only for Ronnie to stop playing with Keller's loving son Beecher). Their relationship surpassed the sex and Tom Fontana made us look after the two and want the two to be together. <br /> <br /> I loved Verni's soft spot for my children during the show and how Fontana's sympathetic symbols from all those horrible criminals we grew up, even Simon Adebes. <br /> <br /> But some of the plot's features were totally unbelievable and unreal: * A boy who builds a bomb in oz * Boys who stand out in their windows in their shops, looking at other men who draw something in their mind - over the top. * Drug entry into the oasis * All users of the detoxification group used or sold drugs, and Sister Pete did not help anyone for six years. * People die in the gym, supply the cabinet and the kitchen. * Nobody suffered Ryan's mother * No one is fighting with Cyril outside the boxing ring (except of course Vern) * Two inmates whose tools remain in the elevator shaft alone and one of them dies without research. * Karl Metzger (guard) kills and nobody is investigating. * The governor holds all his press conferences in prison * All prisoners must say that I want to see Glenn or I want to see mcmanus and they are not being asked questions. * People die every week in Oz * Outside people kill someone and get 20 years, up to eight passwords, but when they kill somebody, they almost immediately die. kitchen or post office - inmates both departments do not ask questions. * Using outdated drugs to replace prisoners when time to deliver * Ryan has no friends or associates, but he can never hurt, kill, rob, rape or beat. * Boys should never get into the toilet or throw away. * The NBA scout comes to prison for recruiting an NBA player (yes yes) <br /> <br /> But with all these shortcomings, this show is still fantastic. It is terrible, brutal, sexy, nervous, raw and innovative. Dean Winters, Scott William Winters, JK Simmons, Christopher Meloni, Luiz Guzman, Adele (a man who played Simon Adebis), Eammon Walker, Lee Tergesen, Terry Kinney, MUms, Man Alexander, LL Cool J and so on. Everything is fantastic and worth it. <br /> <br /> I recommend renting it on DVD. The sixth season will be the 9/06 (next month). The first five seasons are on the DVD - watch them and watch them again with an audio commentary. I loved the director's commentary on Chazz Palmentar. The order in which Andy Schillinger ran down the coffee tables and then fell into the hole was fantastic, the top spirit !!!! Kudos! And Kathy Bates, who runs the family business and the famous wrestling world between Beecher and Keller - just amazing !! Brilliant !!! It should be so weird that Melon will come to Terges private with the Kathy Bates icon in this one scene! Wow! Pulled it out beautifully, pun meant! <br /> <br /> Waiting for Oz: Next Generation !!!! (like Star Trek, etc.) C'Mon !!! Let's get started!!!!
