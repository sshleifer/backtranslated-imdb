Mr. Bean, who starred in the legendary Rowan Atkinson, was a huge hit in the 1990s and I probably saw it for the first time in about ten years, right after its end, so I saw again. I certainly didn't have many fans at this time and didn't see too many episodes. I didn't come to the show until my later teens, just a few years ago, when I looked at each episode. Unlike the previous one, it made me laugh several times and since then it has always been during episodes of repeated viewing! <br /> <br /> Mr. Bean is a mysterious, self-centered, antisocial, extremely naive buffer whose best friend is his Teddy! He is quite isolated from society and life is not easy for him because he is constantly fighting for very simple things! This is because it lacks the very basic knowledge and the child's mind. He finds himself in various problems wherever he goes, and he comes up with very strange ways to try and solve the problems he is facing! Not only does he often cause problems to himself, but sometimes to other people, which he often does not realize! In other words, Mr. Bean is a catastrophe! <br /> <br /> The humor of this exhibition is very visual and the dialogue is very small. Gags are almost always a sight that is mostly about what the exhibition is. Although there may be occasional weakness, I would say that most of them are funny, often fun, (there's so much highlighted)! Although "Mr. Bean" is certainly not the most complicated comedy ever made, it is still great for those who love visual humor, and because of the very limited dialogue you don't even have to speak English fluently to enjoy the show, so it has got such a worldwide reputation! The exhibition lasted a few years, but the episodes were made very gradually, so only fourteen were made. Nonetheless, it is a classic series and deserves this broad appeal!
