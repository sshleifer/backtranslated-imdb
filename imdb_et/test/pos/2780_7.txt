I look at many students who are now enrolled in a student exchange in Barcelona and are disappointed if they do not have such an exciting time. <br /> <br /> The movie was enjoyable. Of course, it is always a pleasure to see Audrey Tatou. <br /> <br /> However, I have a very big problem with this part of the movie. Lesbian roommate tells Xavier that women want to be physically dominant (what I'm asking for) and show her some sort of butt-moving movement that guarantees a woman. Xavier then tries the butt of a married friend - who is going to say "no" - tries to grab the ass. Maybe he wakes up "yes yes" and they go to the park on Guell's bench. I found it really offensive. In addition, it is very stereotypical. How often have we seen scenes where a woman says "no", but obviously it doesn't mean that? No resources no. Grabbing wounds / physical dominance does not make it right. It fully supported stereotyped rape sales. <br /> <br /> I wasn't even sure how to read the next scene where she talks to the lesbian about how it worked and how next time she just called. suck, slut "(or something like that). Did she really think she was forced to force her to know a woman who didn't know her feelings? <br /> <br /> This part really destroyed my movie.
