I have to admit that I didn't expect much of this movie. I was surprised that I really enjoyed it as much as I did. The script was not an oscar, but it wasn't terrible either. Mark Wahlberg worked great. Jennifer Aniston had a great supportive role and it seemed beautiful than ever. What made this movie for me music. If you don't like the 80's glammetals or hair bands, you probably don't like this film. It's all about rockstar. Some clich√©s were present but didn't create the movie at all. I would recommend it to anyone who likes rock and roll, and remember to stand up and shout !!! 8 out of 10 for great action and awesome music. <br /> <br /> Jason
