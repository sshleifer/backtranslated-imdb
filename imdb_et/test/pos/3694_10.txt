You know, people who make comedies so often forget about it are really disgraceful. Well, not this time. Unconditional love is all. Barry Manilow and the dwarf in Cathy Bates as a romantic leader ... and it works. It works not only, it works very well. Actually, I think it's perfect. I laughed so hard that I think I was hurting myself, but the main characters were so human, so honest and so real. But is it not where big comedies come from? Don't mean real feelings, true emotions, and the ability to feel real pain? Well, they do this movie. Unconditional Love is a movie that you shouldn't miss, especially if you need a serious laugh or are curious at all that a red raincoat will see a psychotic dwarf.
