it mixes me with critics and their opinion. I usually take what the critics say about the film, mostly before the film is seen. <br /> <br /> I saw it, however, without knowing anything about it. mainly cast. Kevin Spacey and Don Cheadle are the two most recognized and, in my opinion, the best live actors. and ryan gosling is also rapidly expanding. His reality and the humanity that he mostly expresses in his images makes the audience truly believe his character and whats-i. I've always found the yen malone pretty cute from donnie darko, and if she decides to continue doing similar roles, I'll bounce that I'm not complaining. this movie really brought me. I believed it. the actor was a top class. as expected. the actual film left the audience the ultimate goal of a good movie; thinking and thinking that comes after the final credit credit. I think I have to look at it again to critically refute this movie. I know their reviews should be taken with a pinch of salt. at least I know now.
