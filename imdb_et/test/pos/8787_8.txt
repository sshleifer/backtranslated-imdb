You can't help but admire Hitchcock's early work. For example, "Saboteur" is so slick and fast that it is hard to believe that he made this film over 60 years ago. There are some propaganda elements, but they are so well-knit that it plays beautifully years later. You'll also get some previews of what Hitchcock would do later - like using a national landmark as a background. This time it is the Statue of Liberty. Of course, "North by Northwest" is Mt. Rushmore. You also recognize things that "Saboteur" later "on the back" and "vertigo", but don't give up the show. Robert Cummings is great as well as oh-so-charming Otto Kruger. Look at Hitchcock's mini-west in this. It happens quickly so it doesn't blink.
