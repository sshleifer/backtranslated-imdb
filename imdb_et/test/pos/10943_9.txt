I think there were too many actions in the end? Don't you think that? There was romance, an adventure that, just as I said, put 9 on this movie, but it was too long. I liked Reeve a bit. I didn't understand why he had to die. I thought one of the girls would die too, but my lucky! No one else I liked died! How about you? What did you like? I saw the movie twice. And after that I bought it too. It was worth it! Who did you like (person)? The book was really cool. And actors and actors. Everything was perfect ....... What was the end name? Does anyone answer my questions ... please, please?
