Simply put, Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly were remarkable. The film is less of a raw material for Darwin's beliefs, and focuses heavily on his relationship with his family, mainly his wife, Emma and her daughter Annie. <br /> <br /> Toby Jones is a great move, like Thomas Huxley, a great advocate of Darwin's beliefs, and the rest of the task is to share the time with Bettany and Connelly. <br /> <br /> But these are the two that carry the movie. Their actual chemistry appears from beginning to end, but evolves as transcendence when Darwin grabs his demons. The scene in which Darwin associates the completion of Jieno Orangutan's story with his dead daughter Annie is completely captivating. The TIFF World Premiere Conference was fascinated. Bettany's performances are recognized in a short time as one of the best years. Similarly, the great work of Connelly plays a man of a religious woman, Huxley in the words "killing God". <br /> <br /> The film moves slowly across Darwin's ghost spectrum, enjoying Bettany's and Connelly's every detail. <br /> <br /> Great.
