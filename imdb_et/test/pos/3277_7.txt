A good old-fashioned western flight of vengeance and revenge, giving a twist and gravity to injecting a black social history. Mario Van Peebles, head of the OK, Billy Zane (seemingly unstoppable) army, is a gang of great attacks, and their adventures are plausible and fun. There are some nice spirited setback scenes that create the character and backdrop of the hero, a good shoot-out that will end when our heroes protect the city on attractive white areas, and even Stephen Baldwin is not in this enjoyable, quite powerful western part of the bad.
