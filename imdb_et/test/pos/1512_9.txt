Fulci is one of my all time favorite Italian splatter leader. He is also a very good narrator, who mixes fear, supernatural and psychedelic topics very well. This movie was really his last big story before he led such disappointments as "Voices From Beyond". The story is simple, because Fulci plays himself, a horror. It seems that after years of filming tears and gore films, Fulci begins to suffer when he begins to kill hallucination. He decides to see a psychiatrist who makes Fulc's conviction only when he persuades people. <br /> <br /> Fulci used several pictures at the same time. These films do not believe he was leading, but he certainly produced. Some of these films are "Massacre", directed by Andrea Bianchi (Burial Ground), Fulci's "The Touch of Death", "Murders Secret" and I can't remember the rest of the movies. <br /> <br /> Nightmare Concert is a very underrated movie, even by Fulci fans. But I loved this movie and I've been watching it several times. It is sad that Fulci couldn't manage anything, but after that it is a great movie and I recommend it to a Fulci fan, whether you like it or not. 9/10 stars
