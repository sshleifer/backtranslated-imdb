As an American fan of gentlemen's league, I had to wait months to finally see this movie when it appeared on the DVD, but it was worth it (excited) to wait. "Apocalypse" is fantastic - funny, freak, smart, hell, full of jokes and secret references to the TV series; Basically everything you would expect from gentlemen. a little hesitant. Of course, this device has been used by fictional characters who enter the real world against these creators, in particular Wes Craven's "New Nightmare" and Stephen King's "Dark Tower" books (where the king himself was a sign). Gentlemen entertain the fourth wall to break and even add a new element: another fictional world ("these days"). Soon all three realities have been beaten and the result is inspiring: Geoff Tipps has been robbed in the Middle Ages (and is trying to meet Queen Victoria Wood); a real gentleman's league in Royston Vasey, facing letters like Pauline and Dr. Chinnery; David Warner calls out homunculus from Bernice Church. I've heard that some people didn't like the "king's evil" sub-section, but I found it fun, especially the character of Reece (who felt led by Judit's third "witch" series). <br /> <br /> that I find that although Hilary Briss, Geoff and Herr Lipp were planted firmly at the core of the film, they were given other familiar characters, and that Bernice's confession was fun at the beginning, listening back to the first, faster, sketchy of the first series. Pauline and Mickey are suitcases (not Ross) strange), although I would have loved to have seen more of Mrs Campbell-Jones.Papa Lazarou is considered like Tubbs and Edward. All three are used very sparingly, giving their little screen time to an almost magical feeling (and just what HELL is doing). Papa in the cage, like an oblong hairball? According to the DVD's comments, "hair of oily hairs"). /> <br /> The film looks incredible, but what's new? Music, as always, is breathtaking. I was glad to hear Joby Tal bot's new interpretation of musical music and its easy re-working of a majestic, beautiful piece that closes both the "Apocalypse" and the third episode of the last episode. <br /> <br /> I have some small complaints - it would have been nice to see more old, familiar Royston Vasey and I felt that the stop-motion creatures (beautiful, by the way) were a little underused. However, both questions are justified by the film budget, so they are understandable. However, if I loved Bernice's new church, it would have been good to see the last battle on the street (gentlemen's original vision as commented). <br /> <br /> Generally, "Apocalypse" is amazing, especially if you're a series fan. I can't recommend it enough. 10/10.
