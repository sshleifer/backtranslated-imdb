Being a big fan of Stanley Kubrick's watches, of course, was "a question about that", which I had to see. But I put it too long, because some of my friends destroyed it with comments like "very boring" or "nothing happened" "a waste of time". But when I saw pictures of the mysterious black monolith on the Internet, I was allowed to see a glimpse of the fine experience of 2001: A Space Odyssey. In my opinion, there was no doubt that I was going to rent this movie the same evening. <br /> <br /> It turned out to be the greatest visual experience of my life. Of course, watching a very good painting or picture can be wonderful, but watching a movie with a similar virtuoso in every frame adds a whole new dimension to it. My God ... I like a lot of friends, but I'm sorry I can't share with them what makes my heart excited and makes my spirit like a bird bird. This thing, my friends, is a beauty. As this film shows, our technologically advanced, intellectually low, consumer-oriented fast food in the western society is terribly underestimated. This does not mean, however, that I reject these rapidly evolving societies or look at them (and I do not do Kubrick), but only that they can be so much more than just people stopping for a moment and taking the time to accept the beauty of the world that we live. And what better way to do this is to slow down the elegant pace of this movie and let yourself get into that place between waking up and dreaming. <br /> <br /> When we go to this place, it is possible to get a "natural high". This is something our spirit can do when we meet pure and unlimited beauty. And in my life, this "natural high" or "spiritual orgasm", as some or "samaddhi" call others are more intense. Yes, it's more intense than a normal orgasm ... actually several times more intense. Many religions have argued that this particular feeling proves that they are right. Are they right? For me, the answer to such a question is limited to the impenetrable mystery of the universe. In my opinion, the film is trying to bring the same mystery through the portrayal of the black monolith and pointing out: "Except for one very powerful radio broadcast directed at Jupiter, the four million year old black monolith has remained completely inert. Its origin and purpose remains a mystery." what Bowman is experiencing is the same as I experience when I look at these great visions. <br /> <br /> I can imagine that the mystery may be frustrating for those who need immediate fast food responses to major ontological questions. However, instead of giving us comfort, awareness of the simplifications contained in these responses is constantly irritating us. The subsequent suspicion and discomfort refer to our deeper intellectual activity as the source of this problem, but in fact we are only guilty of a simple answer. However, this film shows that if fast ontological statements do not give anything but doubt, we can always rely on phenomena to make the world a little sense. From the moment you realize that beauty is something that can really only be presented to us as a phenomenon and never a "thing", the mysterious black monolith is no longer annoying, frightening, or irritating, but becomes exciting, fascinating, and perhaps even comforting. We do not need an answer to what really is there to get in touch with one of the greatest forces in our lives. If we can let the mystery be what it is, even accept it ... we can finally rest our souls. I'm pretty sure that a movie that contains so much beauty and so much philosophical and artistic depth can never be overcome. Especially now that the biggest director who ever lived is no longer with us.
