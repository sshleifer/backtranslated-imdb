For the first time, I met Arthur Penn's 'four friends' at HBO late in the evening. Having never heard of it, I waited very little, but watched that I was interested in the composition of Penn and Scriptwriter Steve Tesich. Over the next two hours I sat in a mesmerizing look at this incredible talent theme and the story they used. American Autobiographical Story "Four Friends" of a young immigrant who caused the turbulence of the 1960s follows the story of an Eastern European immigrant (brilliantly Craig Wasson) Danilo since his arrival in the United States. a decade that changed the American landscape. Danilo accompanied his journey with his friends from Georgia (radiating Jodi Thelan, in a role he unfortunately never became equal), Tom (Jim Metzler) and David (Michael Huddleston). "Four friends" cover me too much territory to try to explain it here, but if you haven't seen this movie, then please find a copy (it's just released on DVD) and watch it. You don't have to be disappointed. Tesich script is wonderfully poignant? sometimes funny, sometimes incredibly sad, but always exciting and honest. The penny directs a definite hand and obvious love for the period and people whose lives we follow. The cast is evenly excellent. This film should have made Wasson a bigger star, which is really one of the most wasteful talents of this country. Jodi Thelan, not your usual brainstorm Hollywood sexpot, warms the screen in a performance that makes the audience love its character as simple as movie characters. The fine performances of Metzler and Huddleston can easily be overlooked in the shadow of these stars, but they are excellent and can help you capture the film. Miklos Simon and Elizabeth Lawrence, as well as Reed Birney and Lois Smith, are also great Dioilo parents. I haven't had a copy of "four friends" since I first saw it for the first time at HBO. It has been and is one of my favorite films of all time for more than 20 years. I can't recommend it and feel it if you give it a chance, you know the same way.
