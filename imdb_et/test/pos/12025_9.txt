This special Bravo is one of the cleanest entertainment things I've ever seen on television. Unlike Me First & The Gimme Gimmes (the world's main Punk-Supergroup / Cover-Band), Dan Band really needs to be evaluated. <br /> <br /> The Dan Band is only one joker-on-paper singer-singer singing girly songs and adding free words. When you listen to their "Dan Band Live" CD, it all gets and it gets old. (I just bought it because it had some songs that weren't special on the TV.) But what made Dan Finnerty a Hollywood cult hero is his amazing stage. This man wears his audience every second where he is on stage. And backup artists are also a big part of the visual punchline. As far as the actual band is concerned, they tend to remain outstanding, but are certainly much more energetic and enthusiastic than your regular salon-action band. Hopefully, the DVD version will soon be released - almost certainly some songs were cut, and while heavy censorship adds a bit of involuntary humor, it also removes INTENTIONAL humor. <br /> <br /> If in some ways it makes sense for the world, Vegas casino owners will soon be fighting for who can build Dani's showroom faster. <br /> <br /> "Re ------- member of my name ... FAME!"
