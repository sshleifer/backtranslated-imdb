I've always been fascinated by movies. Here's something to see actors and actors from 100 years ago. Because of today's high-tech special effects, I tried to imagine and imagine what it was like to watch a movie at the time of its original release. It helps to understand the misery of early cinema. <br /> <br /> "The Life and Passion of Jesus Christ" is a very charming Pathe production, originally filmed in 1902, but expanded and eventually released in 1905. famous religious lands that come to life, separating title cards, and you have a pretty good idea of ​​what this movie is about. For example, the scene where Mary and Joseph are resting in Egypt is almost identical to Luc Olivier Merson's 1879 "Holiday to Egypt", directly to Mary's meeting in the famous Sphinx. Although some of them find that these "live paintings" represent an unimaginable outflow, I found them very charming and very nostalgic. <br /> <br /> Sets and costumes seem to be staged in time for Christ's life. Maybe for today's hectic game. Molded makeup is very theatrical, so the closeness of Jesus is almost comic. Again, where others may bother about their inconvenience, I was quite charming. The biggest shortcomings have been made during this time. The people of John the Apostle and 12-year-old Jesus change in the middle scene, surprising the audience. <br /> <br /> The best unintentional humor in the movie is the birth of Jesus. Baby LITERALLY appears like a magic in the lap between Mary and Joseph. Maybe it was just my spirit when I looked at it, but I laughed out loud! If only a child was born so easy !! Seemingly, the actor who plays Mary sees the boring through the whole scene (actually through the whole movie) as if such a thing happens every day! My times have changed! <br /> <br /> As simple as this movie is today, it's really a miraculous window to the past. I recommend it! <br /> <br />
