This is a delightful film. Elizabeth Taylor does a wonderful job, as does Mickey Rooney. The film just makes you happy. It is inspiring and although some parts are a bit too sentimental, it is easily forgiving. I can watch this movie over and over again. The end result is exciting every time I see it. We highly recommend this movie.
