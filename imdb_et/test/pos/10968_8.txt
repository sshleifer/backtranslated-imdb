I had never seen John Cassavetes's movie until two years ago when I first saw China's BOOKIE KILLING at the Berlin cinema, which I found interesting to put it in a diplomatic, but not so special way, I wanted to see more of his work right away. Since then, I tried - emphasizing tried - to look at his other work, especially SHADOWS. I have to admit that it took me some time before I really enjoyed the movie. First I was shot in a polished, raw and improvised way in Cassavets, put me down somewhat and thought of this original - absolutely - but faulty and dated experiment. But now, after the review, these small flaws make it so fresh even today. <br /> <br /> Shot is a minimum $ 40,000 skeleton with six people, where SHADOWS monitors tension and life. Three siblings in the African-American family, where three of the three siblings, Ben (Ben Carruthers) and Lelia (Lelia Goldoni), are light and capable of wearing white. Cassavetes insisted that the participants keep their real names to reflect the real conflicts within the group, but saw that the film was about human problems, not racially. Cassavetes shot the film in ten minutes and beat it with editing, responding to "seamless" Hollywood production values. Cassavete was the main inspiration - at least in the style of cinematography - of the Italian neo-realists, but they also recognized Welles's pioneering spirit. The use of amateurs and improvisation may resemble some of Italy's neo-realistic directors, but with Charles Ming's ans Shafi Had's bebopskor, the film looks very different, very American, unlike anything that has been done before. <br /> <br /> Singing with Girls, "I Feel Lolly-Pop" (or something) feels back in the years of light, old history. But no matter how this year may seem, it is a capsule of the late fifties of New York today. I think this is one of the first films that aspiring filmmakers realize they could film an independent movie without Hollywood, improvised and without a real budget. Shymow Cassel, who acted and participated in SHADOWS, claims that Jules Dassin was NAKED CITY (1948), which was the first to inspire them all, but I think it was what really opened up outstanding independent American filmmakers. br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 8/10
