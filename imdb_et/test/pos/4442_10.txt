Throughout his career, Lucio Fulci made many great films and the way many of them performed with a spider, giving him the decoration of "Gore's Godfather". Although not torture is made by a duckling before Fulci became known among gorehounds, it is not all that is gory; this is definitely a sharp and nasty little thriller and for my money - the best movie ever made by Fulci! The torture of a duckling is really a head and shoulders that go far beyond the Giallo genre in terms of production values, and unlike many of Fulc's later films, everything about Giallo is great. At the center of the plot is the small rustic community where the bodies are starting to rise. Murder is even more shocking because the victims are just young boys. Shortly after the culprit was blamed on the innocent people by the police, Andrea Martelli arrives at the village and decides to start his own investigation into the murder. Soon Martell will encounter various suspects, including a sexy young lady named Patricia, an evil priest and a local witch who enjoys wax effects and adheres to them. <br /> <br /> Although this film may not have gore loads, it has two Fulci nastes sequentially to make up for it. The most nervous thing is that the corpse kills the woman's attacks at the cemetery, while the image of a man falling from the rock and catching any number of stones can cause some stomach. Torture in ducklings contains absolutely great Italian language. Barbara Bouchet (my personal favorite) is incredibly sexy in Patricia's role and she can flex her muscles more than she did in many later films. Tomas Millian is traditionally excellent, while the rest is illuminated by Irene Pappas, Florinda Bolkan and Marc Porel. The on-screen cinematography is stunning and Fulci really gives the viewer the impression that he puts a lot of care and effort into each scene. The story plays slowly, and it's always interesting because Fulci doesn't let the movie go too far from the average plot line. There are not many secrets about murder identity; but Fulci manages to almost end up guessing and not torture a duckling doesn't need high. In general, it is a shame that Fulci didn't make such films any more. Don't torture the duckling's best and best job and I insist that every Giallo fan will see it!
