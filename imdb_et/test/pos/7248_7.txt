Anyone who has seen the trailer of this movie is sorry to think that this movie is out and out. In fact, it is a lightweight, though not too funny, couple of road masters. <br /> <br /> There are many mistakes in the movie. The script and the plot are weak and the story of the love aspect is strange boring. Nonetheless, it is quite enjoyable, thanks in large part to two Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller. These two good actors, especially Carly, are always good at watching and have good chemistry between them. <br /> <br /> Director Jake Scott is the next generation of the family, whose brothers Ridley and Tony have given us films like Alien, Blade Runner, True Romance and recently GI Jane and the enemy of the country. His debut is directed at the energy and enthusiasm that keeps the film worshiping, though without a strong cast it was unable to work well. <br /> <br /> In short, if you are looking for a simple pleasant movie that takes an hour and a half, you might want to do a lot worse than Plunkett and Macleane. On the other hand, if you want to make some fine, historically accurate and thought provoking, go elsewhere. 7/10
