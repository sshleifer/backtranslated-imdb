My two best players are in this movie - Robert Ryan and Robert Mitchum. <br /> <br /> Ryan could play something from Shakespeare to Arthur Miller and play it perfectly. In this movie, when he starts his speech, "... people who have names like Samuels and others with names that are hard to say" are chilling to watch him. <br /> <br /> Robert Young is a police officer who has been called to investigate the murder of a Samuel (Sam Levine) civilian in a bar with several soldiers. Mitchell is a related soldier - his wallet is found in the apartment. But Mitchell is a gentle soldier who has disappeared from his wife. <br /> <br /> The story is from different angles. Mitchell and Samuels attack friendship and go back to the Samuels apartment. Samuels seems to feel the loneliness that Mitchell knows. "For years, you have focused on one peanut and now it's gone, you don't know what to feel," he says about war. <br /> <br /> Ryan is great as a psychotic racist Monty. / / <br /> Robert Young (with Dick Powell) was an actor whose career was rejuvenated by the film noir. "Crossfire", "They Don't Believe Me" and "The Other Woman" are excellent examples. <br /> <br /> Robert Mitchum is his usual modest philosophical Keeley. <br /> <br /> Gloria Graham and Paul Kelly as "odd pairs" are also outstanding in their short but telling roles. <br /> <br /> This is probably the best film ever about racism.
