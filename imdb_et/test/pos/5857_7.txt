I watched this movie a little when I entered the theater. I collected from the ads that it was a thriller. <br /> <br /> What we have as a "compulsion" corresponds to "Matlock". Two teenagers decide to make a perfect murder. The victim is randomly and then carefully scanned so that no real traces of the murderers can be found. Then a number of false wires are implanted that refer to an innocent bystander. (In any case, innocent murder) <br /> <br /> Enter Sondra Bullock as an investigator. (IMDB says he's a FBI, but I can't remember it. I thought he was a normal cop) He's frustrated by the contradiction of the killer profile ("Profile doesn't fit the profile!") And the power and influence of one boy's father. <br /> <br /> He also has his own demons that have stood out in his career. But this is the only character that is really more than one-dimensional. All others are pretty flat. <br /> <br /> There are no great thrillers for the thriller. This is mostly a cat-mouse game like "Matlock" episode (which he watches at one point in the movie). The turning is that there are two kills. Who is the real murderer, Justin or Richard? It costs you eight bucks to find out.
