In my work as the only nationwide non-profit organization, Security On Campus, Inc., dedicated exclusively to college campus prevention and student awareness, I see too often the university's type of violence and secret university coverage. the courts depicted in the film "Mute Mary". In fact, we get a campaign every month from journalists like Mary, who face many calls and requests for information in similar situations. <br /> <br /> He depicts the rape of the campus and the subsequent crusade made by Mary. The victim's roommate and student journalist, played very well by Melissa Joan Hart, was very well done and studied precisely. <br /> <br /> It was the first television movie I ever saw that I felt really mirrored and grabbed by all the different complex issues related to rape and other violent crimes on the campuses of our college and university. Although not all these issues can be dealt with thoroughly within 2 hours, this film is closer than the others I've seen.
