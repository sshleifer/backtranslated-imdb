Seeing this movie always reminds me of what I reminded me in the summer, like God! so long ago. The whole scene, including "overnight", from the canoe train to the end of the trip, is valuable, and Tripper's story of killing maniac is a city legend of my youth. A very entertaining film that was made several times better by terrible after-effects.
