The Sharky machine is easily one of Burt Reynolds' best efforts. It is also one of the best modern criminal dramas. Erotic and violent film distinguishes itself from the Atlanta story and gives you a chaotic detective (viewer) on the silver plate. Committed and Decisive, Sharky must stop the murder of a beautiful nightmare, Dominoe, who is a client of something other than normal. Before long, the Sharky criminal fighting machine opens the highest order conspiracy that threatens to injure Atlanta's internal body. As a Metro Atlanta resident, I am reminded of the excitement of the city during film production. The Sharky machine goes a long way to give Atlanta a precise image. Twenty years later, and 2,000,000 people later, the film is a test of time. Trust me, Atlanta hasn't changed. One of the highlights of the picture is Dar Robinson's bold stunt (classic, symbolic end). It was even featured in the Unbelievable, ABC reality show. It's just too bad that Hollywood doesn't make so many movies. Kick back, every popcorn and watch the silver cinema.
