For the first time, I looked back at this film at the Istanbul Film Festival in 1994. It was so good that I took a couple of friends with me and went to see this week again. The stars are very well played and humor here and there is amazing. This is sure to be a very powerful gay movie. Some scenes make you feel that you are watching friends' episodes with more sophisticated lines. I think I'll put it in my video recorder and watch it again today ...
