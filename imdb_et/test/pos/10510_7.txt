Now, I've seen a lot of B-class movies in my 15 years and I have to say that this was one of the best. Personally, I liked the real estate and the story, but it suffered from showing amateurs (although Adrienne Barbeau gave Lisa Grant a decent result). Joseph Bottoms was unable to hold his part well enough to hold it. The second performance that really fits the film was Barry Hope (Barney Resnick). It starts with an avid real estate agent who takes the house through an Asian couple to find out if there is a dead girl in showhome shower. It progresses with detective speculation and introduces key symbols with reasonable grace. I think that for every person who is undergoing a surprising drama, realtors override the overwhelming gory scenes, it's really a pearl ... XD Who am I kidding? It's not that big, but it's worth checking out if you're mad bored.
