I haven't seen every movie Burt Reynolds has ever done, but that (what I just watched the third time) can be his best! It only suffers from some slow stretches; Burt may have tried to make it more "artistic" than it should have been. On the other hand, he succeeded in avoiding the presentation of many conventional clich√©s in the role of a "harsh cop" (for example, to record a scene where he was trying to kiss Rachel Ward for the first time, or fear), and expresses the indestructible Henry Silva just before the final show. In fact, Silva and these two ninja assassins are the most memorable villains of the 80's police thrillers. The film also has some strokes, a surprising amount of humor, brutal and thrilling fistfight and many well-directed shots. (***)
