Although I have definitely read this particular book by Agatha Christie, I do not remember anything except the name "Abernethie". This is a good thing, because seeing this story without knowing how it plays enabled me to reassess Agatha Christie GENIUS: the main reason why she misleads you and then pulls out the carpet. his success and timeless. In addition to its stories, the success and timeliness of this series is due to excellent product values, beautiful spots, great music, top-notch acting, elegant leadership, and so on. All these virtues are available after the Funeral. . Advice: Be cautious from the start - the tips will fall all over, even in the opening order! Unlike peaceful English-rural areas and some small humor, there are also some pleasant moments. Must see mysteries and just a very good movie. (***)
