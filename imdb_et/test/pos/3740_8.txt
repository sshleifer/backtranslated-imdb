When you discover something, the trip is so much fun, much more surreal, and so much emotionally galvanizing than when you finally reach your destination. The fall of love is probably one of the wealthiest feelings in the world. You feel you're energized, animated and alive. You just want to be around this person every day and your voice gets excited and sometimes awakens. Love and all the physical and emotional side effects associated with it are pure bliss. If this is going to happen, you have to guess, but when you start your journey for the first time, you can't compare it. <br /> <br /> Diane Lane and Richard Gere play Adrienne Willis and dr. older people. In this film, they begin this mystical journey together, where love and emotion discovery help to save them. <br /> <br /> Lane is dealing with a typical jerk. a former husband who still loves him, but in his eyes, only because the woman with whom he deceived no longer wants him. Just as he hurt him, as much as he does not like him, is part of what really weighs him back. Why would you ask? For life and love is sometimes replaced by comfort intelligence. Yes, this man deceives him, but he has kids with him, he built a life with him and is obviously still with him. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere plays his recently divorced wife and alien father. He just lost the patient because he reacted negatively to the anesthetic. He is now against his family and he is accused of being charged, but he is tempered for this problem. This is what brings him first to Rodanthe. Although his lawyer did not tell him that he was forced to visit his wife's wife, Rodant. He is at Inn, where Adrienne takes care of. Soon they will find the comfort of each other's hands and discover that they may have another chance in life. <br /> <br /> Now it sounds like a simple idea for a movie and although it may be something you are. You saw or read earlier, Gere and Lane just your movie. Diane Lane illuminates the screen with her smile. His eyes look dark and the life he brings to his character is worth it. Gere's character is slightly different. He's hardened and bitter. It takes Adrienne's pain and passion to get her out of the shell. He quietly blames his intense relationship with his son, and he blames himself secretly for death. Outside, he says to everyone who hears it is not his fault, and that he was one of the 50,000 accidents. But deep down he eats him. They find each other at a time when both need someone to listen to. <br /> <br /> Gere and Lane have been in the movie before, but it's the first time they love. They were married with disbelief, but here they play lovers of each other when people have abandoned them in their lives. They have a spark and a real chemistry. I'd like to see more movies with them. In fact, I would like to see more movies with Diane Lane, but this is one more story. <br /> <br /> Rodanthe's Night is a very passionate and romantic movie about two lost souls who save each other. They both get better, they both become stronger people. I enjoyed it enormously and would recommend it to anyone, not just to couples. This is a movie about redemption, liberation, and other opportunities. <br /> <br /> You will also be asked to bring some Hankies. <br /> <br /> 8/10
