This dark (but hopelessly viable) black and white bright comedy is a real crowd joy that will make you laugh (just as your eyes are unbelief). <br /> <br /> This is an old psychopath train story, but it is of little importance as the thriller part of the movie seems to be almost a counterweight to the antiques of the great comedian Robert Gustafson. His unhappy, almost incredibly optimistic soldier refers to both compassion and Schadenfreude in a way that almost rivals Chevy Chase. <br /> <br /> The thing I liked the most is that the joy and inconvenience of train journeys alternate between unlikely and fun. They add the most welcome feeling of reality and recognition. <br /> <br /> This thriller comedy has indeed borrowed most of his "arrest" from Hitchcock and, in my opinion, should only monitor the value of this comedy (which is indeed high). In addition to Gustafsson, Lars Amble is firmly anchored in cynical worth, which is the price of the entrance alone. <br /> <br /> We heartily recommend.
