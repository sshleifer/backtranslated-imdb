Even in the case of sci-fi, this movie is a little movie. Alright, more than a little bit ... My first thought after I was watching was that I had just lost my mind. Darko fans never want anything other than Richard Kelly's movie because they are their clever cult standards. Donnie Darko is the past, it's over. <br /> <br /> Richard Kelly loves to create movies that make you feel stupid that you don't understand the deeper meaning when you first watch them. Frankly, I had to check the box twice before I liked it. <br /> <br /> Deeper meaning - (to save you from sociological psycho-babble) People are self-serving, we make decisions that can destroy our lives and not open a post without a return address. Summary: The creepy old man tells Cammeron Diaz when I press a button to kill someone you don't know and give you a million dollars. Of course he pushes it and as horrible is horrible old, he gets the money. The film then becomes an unusual film. To write fingers ... The button is pushed by the supernatural strangers by Diaz and his wife in a difficult experiment to give the morality of mankind. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie's readiness to ignore the general movie instructions. It's different. Its intense. It has a deeper meaning (though its philosophy 101). It leaves you guessing. Nothing to Stop Hollywood! <br /> <br /> I didn't like: why should every technology form another form of life prevent this ridiculous scheme? What god like alien suffers for that? Diaz was good, but was the country accent? They live in Virginia. <br /> <br /> I give it to 7 because Kelly didn't pay as much attention to detail as her other films. Generally a good flick.
