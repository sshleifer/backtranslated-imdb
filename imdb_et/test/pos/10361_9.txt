This movie definitely shows something and sheds light on what is happening in most of the institutions today, and shows how one gurl can do things with his newspaper, his editor fully believes in him, and does not make anything important because it would harm his friend ... and if it was the right time, he took the necessary steps. <br /> <br /> The overall score of the movie was 9 because it was all that means it keeps you entertained, and moreover, they have been working very well with a television movie, its truly high-quality action that deserves a lot of credit.
