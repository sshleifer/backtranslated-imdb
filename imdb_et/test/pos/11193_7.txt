"Far" is a Turkish way of life that follows the daily activities of two adult male relatives; one photographer and the other unemployed. There is little doubt that the author Nuri Bilge Ceylan is a remarkable talent. But this little stranger minimalist artistic drama is so full of empty filler and so lacking in story or something engaging or provocative that it will probably only turn to the most enthusiastic devotees of the cinema, and the main currents should look elsewhere. Personally, I quickly grew up with the slow pace of the film and quickly found myself through empty spaces - and there is much - between dialogue, plot development and abandonment. "Distant" is a very beautifully made esoterica. (B-)
