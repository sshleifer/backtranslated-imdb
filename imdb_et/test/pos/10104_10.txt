I saw this movie for the first time two years ago in the cinema and loved this dark story about two teenage sisters who lived at home in their big house with their father and mother-mother. Their relationship with their mother is at least, tense, that the gradual mother seems to be increasingly unstable in the battles with younger girls. The film is inclined to the oriental style with ghost effects and horror, adding a strange and amazing aspect to the story that is not clear at first sight, but more interesting. <br /> <br /> The direction is incredibly good and the actor is stunning, with the step-mother turning the movie in a very pleasant mood. The big house adds superstition and has enough points in the movie to jump out of place. This film clearly shows me why Korean cinema is the most original in the world at the moment. You just don't get anything like that in the West, unfortunately, and I really see that it will affect filmmakers around the world in the next decade. <br /> <br /> Very advisable to see my real joy and intimidation ...
