It was a very strong look at prejudices and group thinking. There are great actors casting considerable work. Sets are beautiful and just a little stylized. The direction of art is top-notch with great cinematography. The story is tense and shows how bias and bigotria can flourish easily. It interferes with its realistic violence and the defense of a relatively typical community. I was very impressed.
