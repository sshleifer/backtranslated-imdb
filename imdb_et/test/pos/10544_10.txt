At first, a romantic movie seems to be in which a girl meets a boy and falls in love, but the idea is that this film feels like others don't know. The first time I saw that I didn't see it full because I had to leave. But as I walked I thought I had to see it again, but I had no chance for that. One year went by until I saw this movie in a non-free channel and I saw it and I saw it I saw it once, twice ... up to 200 times and not joking. I knew all dialogues with the charter and I don't know why I saw it, and I saw it in everyday life and never got forever. I don't use the movie more than twice. The law is very good. Gerard Depardieu is a talented actor and katherine heigl too. I would like him to be a good movie because I think he can do it. , this is a movie that I can't take out of my mind.
