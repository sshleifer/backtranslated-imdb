Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau must be one of the best friends ever working together. They have made a lot of movies together, I think they are both fantastic when they work together in the movie. The sea is a fantastic comedy movie I think I can watch. I'll give the movie out of 10 out of 10. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are remembered when the movies they did together are on television. Unfortunately, they miss. God bless you both.
