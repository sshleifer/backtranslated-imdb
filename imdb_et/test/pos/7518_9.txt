Anyone who goes to Manhattan Hospital takes his life. It also includes hospital staff. <br /> <br /> I had never seen a hospital before, and I was interested in how the characters and situations of this parcel were to another Paddy Chayefsky masterpiece Network. The characteristic features of George C. Scot are both Al Schumacher and Howard Beale. <br /> <br /> She is a hospital administrator and she is mad hell and is not going to take it anymore. She is a stranger to her wife and children. Diana Riggis has a Faye Dunaway type character to pull her out. One roll of hay with her and she is shocked back by reality and the fact that she still can help the world. <br /> <br /> But first he has a real problem. Someone kills hospital staff, four of them in 48 hours. And the nice part is their deaths, which are largely due to the general incompetence of medical bureaucracy. Here is comedy. <br /> <br /> Barnard Hughes, Diana Rigg's father's person, has the actual Howard Beale type. His end is not as dramatic as Beale's. <br /> <br /> Back in my working days, this part of my job was to pay for medical supplies. Some of them may be as slippery as you can find in a hospital. The black comedy satire was a real bite for me. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott was the best actor, but having won and refused to accept last year's Oscar for Patton, he wasn't about to get a second chance. He lost Gene Hackman for a French connection. Still, his role is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Try to look back at the Hospital Network and see how many similarities you notice.
