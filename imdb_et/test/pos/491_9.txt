Hello <br /> <br /> Terra is a sensational film. The hero (Wesley Snipes) and the villain have performed their role fairly. <br /> <br /> Movie sequences are better than Matrix! <br /> <br /> Wesley Snipes is one of the best silver players. <br /> <br /> If u like action / vampire movies, this is ONE. <br /> <br /> The theme is pretty good considering the fact that so many vampire movies have been made before. But these are the best of them. <br /> <br /> Enjoy driving.
