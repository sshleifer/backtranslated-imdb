This is the best movie I've ever seen. And I've seen a lot. I'm not even a Troma fan. I've never heard of Trom before watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I had already given up hope of seeing a big movie until I saw "Tromso and Juliet". This movie is a dream. Shakespeare would probably be proud of this classic adaptation. There is sex, violence, humor and satire. It breaks a lot of taboos. <br /> <br /> This movie is neither nasty nor stupid. It's hard to describe in words how this movie is smart, funny, exciting and funny. The music is great and is perfect for every scene. The characters are very plausible and the actor is great. I really take care of the characters. <br /> <br /> This is definitely not just for Troma fans. It's for all people with a sense of humor and smart and credible entertainment, not totally stupid and incredible mainstream movies that don't dare to do what this film does. <br /> <br /> Bad reviews only prove that this movie is great and something extraordinary. You love it or hate it. Like all real works of art, not all people have understood and appreciated it.
