I've been trying to commemorate the name of this movie for years and years. Finally, read something today, 03/09/2005, which mentioned the name of Stacy Keach, and reminded me that I have seen the movie he had at the Atlanta Film Festival in 1974, so I made a Google search for Keach movies and found The Gravy Train . We had to see Duddy Kravitz at the film festival, but for some reason they couldn't show it and instead replaced The Gravy Train. We were terribly disappointed that we couldn't see much hyped Duddy Kravitz and heard nothing about the Gravy train and heard nothing about it. <br /> <br /> But I remember we were pleasantly surprised at how good the film was, and remembering it was quite humorous. I'd like to find it on tape.
