Clayton Moore made his last official appearance on Masked Man's director Lesley Selander's epic adventures "The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold", which, along with Jay Silverheels, played his faithful Indian scout Tonto. Selander was an old hand under the leadership of Western peoples for 40 years in films and television, with over 100 western credits from his director. This fast-paced horse opera, in turn, took a revolutionary perspective on the depiction of its Indians, who have gradually accepted Hollywood in the 1950s after director Delmar Daves set up on the track "Broken Arrow" west of James Stewart. Racial intolerance is the primary theme of Robert Schaefer and Eric Freiwald. Having written 13 episodes of the "Lone Ranger" television series, Schaefer and Freiwald knew the profound knowledge of each formula but raised the stakes of this theater tour. Our vigilant heroes are flying to save the Indians who have been murdered by white horses for no apparent reason. The mystery of the identity of these assassins and the reason for their killing has appeared quite early, so you don't have to guess what's going on. <br /> <br /> Although Selander saga violence is a modern standard, the fact that Lone Ranger lets a bad guy to kill in one scene, not a wound, and that a dirty dame makes a double crossing accompanies a bite of tomahawk sinking on his back was quite cruel. The television series never went to that length, and when Lone Ranger used his sixty, he fired the gun out of the cabinet's fist instead of kicking him. Another difference here is that the Indians are attacking one of the robbers and torturing him for information, but they are never lifted by the culprit for the robbery of this henchman. Douglas Kennedy did not have the bad shape of Lyle Bettger, who was threatened by masked man director Stuart Heisler's "Lone Ranger", but he feels good enough as a coward who kills one of his henchmen without any mistake. threatens to disclose his name and his crown identities to fake Indians. <br /> <br /> "The Lone Ranger and the Lost City" will open up as a hidden main character when it comes to the hidden Texas Ranger and its transformation into Lone Ranger by serving Tonto. This two-minute extension is a great way to start a series-based character, so that everyone, including non-Lone Ranger fans, is on an equal footing. The primary plot was about a ruthless gang of white carrying bags and called it "surprisingly" Hooded Raiders, starting with killing Indians with them and stealing the medallions around their neck. Lone Ranger and Tonto come too late to intervene, but they find a hidden child near. Having a child and a dead Indian, they drive to a nearby Spanish mission led by Padre Vincente Esteban (Ralph Moody, "The Outsider") and turns over to the child and the body. Initially, Padre has to give Indian girl Paviva (Lisa Montell, "Gaby") that a disguised person means no harm to them and is their friend. Padre sends Tonto to the city to get a doctor, Dr. James Rolfe ("Gun Fever Dean Fredericks") and Tonto will immediately worry about a paul city lawyer, Sheriff Oscar Matthison (Charles Watts of "Giant"). ) who violates the Indians. Tonto tries to see that a doctor who treats prisoners in a sheriff jail, and Matthison's men, gets him tougher when Rolf intervenes and returns to the mission. <br /> <br /> Finally, Lone Ranger and Tonto can capture one Hooded Raiders, but Indian Redbird (Maurice Jara, "Drum Beat"), and his companions abduct the commanders and bring him back to his village. They put him out and shot him with arrows to let go of his tongue. Ross Brady (Douglas Kennedy, "Hell's Crossroads") and William (Lane Bradford, "Devil's Canyon") and Brady are using his Winchester to kill his imprisoned man. Little did Brady know that his henchman was talking. Lone Ranger and Tonto won't get long and reprimand Redbird for their healing. Redbird tells them what the man said before his death and Lone Ranger decides to hide him so he can know more. She masks a gentleman's hunter with mustache and artificial southern accents. Despite its short 83-minute working time, "Lone Ranger and Gold of Lost City" is no excitement or surprise. Selander keeps his activity in full gallop. Dialogue is more meaningful than memorable, because Schaefer and Freiwald are pushing the plot more often than spring surprises, but there is one big surprise associated with a good Indian theme. There is also a scene where Lone Ranger rejects his credit for justice, available to everyone under the law at a time when Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Earl Warren had started court judgments that recognized and alleviated the conditions of racial segregation, civil rights, separation of church and state, and police arrest in the United States. One of the things that distinguishes "Lone Ranger and the gold of the lost city" from its predecessor is its epic scale, with setbacks to the Spanish conquistador age and with a small science fiction associated with the destructive meteor. In general, Lone Ranger's stories were limited to the 19th century without dragging European history. No, Lone Ranger was not the first movie to deal with Spanish convoys. Robert D. Webb's Golden Seven Cities (1955) concerned the search for Spain in southern places, but West of Selander won the Gordon Douglas '' Gold of the Seven Saints '' (1961) screen.
