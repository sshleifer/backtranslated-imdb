Commissaire Mattei (André Bourvil) is one small weapon who loves cats and her boss police in Paris is a philosopher who knows that even the police can be guilty sooner or later. That's the movie. And expensive robbery at Vendome. Corey (Delon) brings a plan to jail, Vogel (Volonté) joins her and helps her with two hard guys after her because she took money from Mafioso Ricos (Andre Eycan) while Rico took her Coreys girlfriend and left her five years in prison alone. Corey and Vogel find the third man, Jansen (Montand), a former police officer and sniper, who opens a special hand-made ammunition hole by locking the security lock. The perfect plan and cooperation, but they have to sell the harvest and Mattei is hidden in the role of the buyer. The ring closes. Driving to help each other is photographed by their cat-loving Matte and his little pistol. <br /> <br /> Melville took 20 years when she said she was going to make a robbery after she didn't get a RIFFIFI contract. Melville wrote in a script and film in southern France and Paris. Great Henri Decae is like a regular lighting operator. This is before the last picture of Melville, who died after another movie with Delon in 1972. <br /> <br /> Melville actually wanted Belmond to replace Volonté, he didn't like the Italian at all, but Volonté-Vogel is a great refugee and gives Bourvil the most convincing performance. But remember: Melville notes that Volonté is an instinctive actor, strange character, very tiring and completely impossible on the French set. Melville didn't like her at all and didn't want to work with her. <br /> <br /> Melville is wrong. Volonté gives the most lively character not so much interesting signs. You see what he knows about Matte and his little dangerous weapon and all French dogs in the winter 70. Wild actor. <br /> <br /> André Bourvil, who died near filming. He was also not the first choice but certainly a great substitute. He alone carries the hunter's instinct through the film and finally gets his guilt again guilty. <br /> <br /> Jansen has entered the jewelery shop with a rifle and tripod at night, but end up risking to hit freely. When he meets Delon for the first time, we already know that elegant Jansen has a serious drinking problem. After the abduction, Montand gives up his share of the catch and mentions to Delon, who looks at him, that he only got into the red circle because he wanted to get his wardrobe inhabitants. Delon doesn't try what he means. Audience recalls that he saw Montand on the big arena in his haunted house that fights helplessly with a nightmare coming out of the wardrobe and attacking him. At that time a very rare scene, one reminiscent of a long time. I bet that this stuff was once so difficult to organize and direct at once, when no one imagined making digital movies in the coming days. Great art in handmade art. <br /> <br /> We will definitely remember the team, as the actors, still seem to be less popular than Melville after 33 years. What's wrong with that? I'm afraid these three participants (three criminals) and their police hunter are not interested. We learn too little about Corey and her death for 5 years from her beautiful girl (Anna Douking). Montand is still a big sniper, but what he's got was drinking funny creatures in the wardrobe. Delon acts as if he was a samourai in an earlier adventure, Volonté is the luggage compartment of the American car of Delon and a great movement, and Mattei swells to see, a great actor at his life. But how could he ever suspect that everything is to blame? <br /> <br /> In the interview, Melville says there is no woman in the movie. Not in the very red circle, but I remember well the fun-looking woman Anna Douking (without future career). We're in the 70s. In fact, the woman rises from an old mafioso bed who does not carry anything and walks slowly to the door to listen to her old lover Deloni's voice. Bardot did something like this ten years earlier. This time he led Melville. Well done. <br /> <br /> RED CERCLE has definitely added some, but not many, sparkling gems to the film's history. The kidnapping of Vendome and Montands is surprising that the wardrobe and the inhabitants of Volonté flee Bouville under white lingerie and carry their trousers carefully over the stream. It's too little to get a big gangster and a robbery movie. But 110 minutes have never carried you and this is a high level game. And there are probably some secrets you learn when you see the movie over and over again. No secret is that we are all guilty and the late Francois Perier is also highlighted. <br /> <br /> Michael Zabel
