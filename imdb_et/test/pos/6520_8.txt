Dan Dailey gives sincere and colorful activities like Dizzy dean. His character is very vivid and captures the dean's background and the taste of limited education. The course course around Dizzy Deans rises to fame and to his unexpected trip due to the deviation he chose to ignore. His wife is perfectly represented by Joanna Dru, who gives a woman who loved and supported a ball player who rose as fast as "dizziness". The portrayal of Dizzy's later career competition is honest and uncertain, reflecting his ills resulting from his bad education and colorful language, both aerial and aerial. Dizzy was quite characteristic and Daily has breathed her story with an admirable skill. If you liked this movie, I recommend the comedy "Kid from the Left" (1953), where Daily plays down and out, his young son (Billy Chapin) is idolized. The day again grinds the ball player in a completely satisfactory way. I heartily recommend to Mrs. St. Louis baseball fans everywhere.
