I was watching it with my three children - 12 years old (boy), 10-year-old (boy) and 8-year-old (girl) - and this movie was a good old-fashioned family adventure. Although it is definitely aimed at the child's market (it is said to be 5-13), it was definitely traceable and as a parent it is a pleasure to find a film that turns to many age groups, but it is suitable for the whole family - especially the younger children. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Ricky, a bit of a joke with vivid imagination (which can certainly be seen in his dream sequences) that fix during robbery and big art theft. fly during a Washington school trip. Ricky's father is an aircraft engineer, so Ricky knows not only the design of the aircraft but also the surface of his computer's flight simulator. This is convenient if the pilot and the co-pilot have failed through a lot and there is no one flying on the plane. I don't want to give up the plot any more.
