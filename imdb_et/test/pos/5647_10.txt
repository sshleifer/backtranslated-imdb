Kon Ichikawa lived through World War II and saw its impact on his people in Japan. But so did the writer Shohei Ooka, whose book was an inspiration for Ichikawa's film, the fires on the surface. It is a film about men of war or, more generally, wars in general who lose their humanity. The soldiers who are in this story through their fields and the jungles of the Philippines are almost completely hopeless, if not already. This makes the Stone Zone a picnic: at least they had certain things like the food they have. <br /> <br /> They have little or no supplies, supplies, or ammunition, no backups, no sense in the fight they've invaded. They do not even get proper hospital treatment unless they are no longer able to walk or lose their limbs (for example, say you have tuberculosis, are on the road). But it is indeed with one of the soldiers, the private Tamura prism, that we fully understand the vanity of war, both the lack and boredom of its empty scene, and the flashing of intense and cruel violence. > <br /> In the movie, Tamura just wants to get medical help. It is at the outset and, according to his senior officer, he is already eye-catching and the expression that has dried up over the years - that he will die if he does not find the hospital. In fact, he does not get together with some soldiers: at first, there is a group that seems to be sort of, with its actions, but indeed it is driven by a force-hungry wealthy who just wants a Tamura salt, and later with two other stray soldiers who are part of a group that used to be abducted at night. <br /> <br /> The story is not straight, but it doesn't need to be. The Tamura Roads in the Fire Areas are spoken in vignettes, little stories when he appears on a seemingly deserted enemy village. The two populations are coming back to get supplies, and Tamura throws them up. This is an amazing scene, because so far Tamura has not seen her with any direct * false *, but she does it in this scene, not so much evil, but fear and despair (it is also a violation of how she gets salt). Scenes gather so wonderfully and devastatingly, just like the simple task of finding a pair of walking footwear that seems to be there, or if Tamura later finds out in her movie that her teeth are broken and out of the lack of complete hygiene. > <br /> It should also be mentioned that this is a ghostly realized film Ichikawa, taken from fields and forests, in cinematography that fills everything we see in black and black and white-hot white. Acts are authentic, not just emotionally, but by the look of their own looks and despair, like Ichikawa, to have all the film survive strangers, as well as wildlife characters; naturally, by the way, I mean cannibalism. Its shock is double; First of all, the soldier says half-jokingly early to eat other soldiers to Tamaura, who asks if this is true and only in response to getting a "do not ask" a cautious word and another depicting a cannibalistic self from a mountain-hungry hungry man pulling the intestine out of her lap and tells the hero straight, "You can eat me when I die." <br /> <br /> This makes it particularly brutal when it comes to a director who shoots short "action" scenes. I argue that they are more brutal than "Ryan Ryan" in depicting violence in the battle, carnage that is completely random. The scene I am pointing to, and that simply involves struggling to look, is how we see slowly from around 20 soldiers, a fire of attack that kills only four or five, but it just happens so fast and the soldiers continue walking the same way indexing. It's not the only terrifying murder that has been shown - if you need blood there, it is sprayed across the screen like something that is completely macabre - but it drives the point completely. <br /> <br /> Every actor is amazing (especially Funakoshi, who seems to be both peace and the most frightening in what he sees most in the least), all the big kits give something else that is a terrible experience, and all this is the ultimate goal of anti-war film: how can or why do people fight in such wars? It's almost too frustrating to enter words, and so Ichikawa pushes her nose straight into her arms and blood and demands that we take it in, so maybe one day it will never happen. Or it can count on the end of such a gloomy and big movie.
