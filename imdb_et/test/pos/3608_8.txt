To tell the truth, I went to watch this movie just because Nicolas Cage is my favorite actor. People may not agree, but it does equally well in bad and good movies. I haven't seen a movie with Penelope Crus before, so I wanted to see if he's a good actor. So, here's what I think: <br /> <br /> The film is good (never read the novel). Some moments were really exciting and ... unexpected. In total, you will find the plot quite simple. So the only thing that could record a movie, which (an experienced viewer knows that from the beginning) either ends tragically or happily, was both Cage and Cruse. And it was big, big, big! In the last part of the film, I even liked the actress's rather broad accent (Spanish, but for those who don't speak Greek, she is OK, and she looks like a Greek girl). In general, the movie is very enjoyable and has a lot of irony (fans of classical music will definitely have some fun for a while) <br /> <br /> I'll give it 9/10. You should see it!
