Now I have seen some episodes of Gentleman Leauge, which I found fun. When I brought the movie, I wasn't sure if I knew enough about this series, the boy was wrong. This is one of the best comedy movies I've ever seen, and Leauge's wise making is a movie. It has a very good and funny plot, but also uses a few deadlines, because it doesn't make too much confusion that would have destroyed the film. Even if you've never seen a gentleman's page, you can laugh at this movie and it's a movie that can be viewed more than once and it's a great movie with your companions. It really deserves to be reviewed in 10 out of 10.
