I don't know where this movie was shot, but since it was photographed, this authenticity deserves this story. This is the story of a young young woman imprisoned in Japan in South Asia at the beginning of World War II with another group of English women. There is no prison camp for women to be forced to take a month to go, because the Japanese do not know what to do with them. The essence of the film is the courage and resilience of English women and the courage of an Australian soldier who is trying to help them. This movie is very long, maybe 10 hours, so you can watch it in the series shown in PBS, which actually adds an endless sense of journey that this woman makes from England to all this remote island and finally to Australia. The story, the cinematography, the location and the participants combine to make the film disappear. My only question is why it's not published on DVD!
