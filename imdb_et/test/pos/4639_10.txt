Like many other comments I read, I have been reminded, I loved this movie when I was a child. My sister and I had a copy of Beta (before VHS) we wore. Of course, it didn't help our parents to sell BetaMax in garage sales. Since then we have tried to find a copy. As a second commentator, I finally found a copy of a local video store. The owner did not participate in the copy after many experiments, bribes and nickname attempts. GOOD NEWS! I bought a completely new copy of the newly released VHS from Midnight Madness for $ 9.99 on Amazon.com two days ago !!!! Finally, Disney has awakened. Now that they only revive the song of the song ... If you love the movie, grab it. If you haven't seen the movie, it's worth a look - completely stupid humor, but a lot of fun (Stephen Furst is fun).
