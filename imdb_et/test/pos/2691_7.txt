Recently, I started watching this exhibition in syndication and found a bit of a blow and a flaw. Some episodes are stupid - Doug is upset about some trivial / minor things and is stupid. <br /> <br /> However, others are quite fun and sometimes touching. These include those episodes that correspond to the complexity of the characters. For example, "juvenile overweight friendly man marries a sexy woman" topic is found in several sitcoms. (Carrie also has something to do with her, it looks understandable. Not just a mill's sexy girl.) But Carrie has a edge - she can look good but she has too many personal qualities that aren't too far off and she admits it is easy - for example, one episode revolves around being willing to be coworkers. Personally, I find that she is sexy, but you have to be the right person to live with. Amlike Doug is a good game. And also look at the simple things deep. Maybe not as much as Doug, whose nirvana television is watching and eating a great snack on his big screen, tv. next to, but not the cultural gal. This lack of excess sensitivity is one reason why they have no children. <br /> <br /> Of course, neither of these simple pleasures is anything, and it adds to the charm of the exhibition. They live in the life of a regular working class in Queens - that is realistic in that sense. And generally, the price of a fun and pleasant sitcom, especially. if you just want to relax. Finally, it gets a little tired so it's probably good. It was a good run. See also, Becker.
