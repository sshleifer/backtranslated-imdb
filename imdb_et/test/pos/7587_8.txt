Having seen the Summer Stock function on this short VHS tape, I made it again every Sunday on TCM. It marked the debut of 15-year-old Deanna Durbin and 14-year-old Judy Garland outside her two older sisters. These two teenagers present their musical talents "Il Bacio" with Deanna solo, then with "Waltz and Swing" from Judy before the two tops "Americana". The small plot of this 11-minute film is about Edna's possible unemployment (the actual name of Durbin she has dealt with here) in the parking lot of her grandfather because it is small. With the help of two girls, you can guess what's going on! Contrasts are marked not only by the musical choice of Garland and Durbin, but also by their height, momentum and movement. Despite the fact that they are doing quite well at the end, and it is almost surprising that MGM chose Garland, while Durbin was already signed with Universal because it was short, but was briefly refused because his debut (three smart girls) was early stages preparation. Judy himself makes his first feature (Pigskin Parade) by the 20th-century Fox, because MGM decided which movie he would put into the next letter. It would be the Broadway Melody of 1938, where he would show the stop number, "Dear Mr. Gable (You made me a lover)". But back in this short time, every Sunday gives a warm and wonderful look at the two stars who, at the beginning of their legendary career, are aware of what the future holds for them ...
