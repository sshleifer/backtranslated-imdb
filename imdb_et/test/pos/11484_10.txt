I watched this movie at least ten times. I do not agree with the previous comments. This is the language in the cheek film, and some of the mode is designed to be style. Men like Paul Cowley are few and far away, women, like Linda, are unfortunately a dozen. The sad thing is that, although similar relationships, as it rarely lead to murders and frameworks, are all familiar scenarios. The boy worships the girl, the girl does not know she exists, they grow up, the man sees the woman down and down and rescues her. The bottom line, she never loved her - she came on time and used her. Thomas is great, but enough Paul. His portrayal is sensitive and touching. Madsen is perfect as a femme fatale. What I really was was the last scene. Paul says he finally shouted, but not his wife, Linda, but for an unknown girl she had looked so far many years ago ... and longed for ... and loved. And I loved Thomas at the end.
