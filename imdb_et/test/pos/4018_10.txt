An interesting film based on three of Jules Verne's novels. Given today's special effects and advanced computer animation, this film is a historic marker of cinematic ingenuity and imagination. Karel Zeman has revived lithographic images of original Jules Verne texts. it must be for classical science fiction and for historical players. <br /> <br /> I give this movie in 10.
