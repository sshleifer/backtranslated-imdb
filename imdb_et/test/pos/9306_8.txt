The fat man and the little boy were the code names of the two atomic bombs that were reversed in Nagasaki and Hiroshina. How these films came and were in the hands of America is the story of this movie. <br /> <br /> Definitions are code names of two plutonium and uranium bombs. The fat man was a plutonium bomb and one was overthrown in Nagasaki and the Little Boy was what was used in Hiroshima. <br /> <br /> The film is mainly a conflict between General Leslie R. Groves between the US Army and physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, who led a team of scientists who developed a bomb toward Groves. With the two men so widely different from the background they were, the conflict was inevitable. Newman does not play his credit with a man whose position he would have little to do with the caricature. Groves is a soldier with a background in engineering. He wanted to fight the command because trained military specialists would naturally want this greatest war. But thanks to his engineering background, Groves was able to manage the Manhattan project, which was what the code was encoding. So, Newman has decided to contribute to the war effort. <br /> <br /> Most of us met Dwight Schultz from Team A H.M. Murdoch, a pilot whose grip on reality is at best weak. If you were only familiar with the A team, you might think that Schultz had a great comic book future. <br /> <br /> Instead, Dwight Schultz is one of the best actors in the English-speaking world. dramatic parts after leaving the TV series. The life of J. Robert Oppenheimer was a complicated person who recognized the dangers and benefits of atomic energy. The problem is also for him. Later, Oppenheimer got into a real relationship because of his left-wing political views and companions, all of whom knew walking in the Manhattan project. <br /> <br /> Some of the smaller roles that stand out are Bonnie Bedelia like Mrs. Oppenheimer, Natasha Richardson, the Oppenheimer Communist mistress, who got her with Oppenheimer in such a jackpot later, and Laura Dern's sister at Los Alamos site. The best is John Cusack, who, like Michael Merriman, is a composite of some real scientists, who can be precisely called the first victims of atomic times. His scenes with Laura Dern, especially with what happens to her, take on a real boost. Fat Man and Little Boy introduces facts and allows you to decide what might have happened if their alternative use had been taken.
