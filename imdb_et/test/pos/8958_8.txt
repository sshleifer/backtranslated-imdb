Especially good cinema story about gays, exciting former teen star, now waiting. Sexual ambiguity is being studied here in real and real human face. This and discard the serial meter, and you have love and man. Well illustrated drama, strange sense of humor and mystery. The scenario is liquid and plausible. The performances are much higher than average and the story is sharp. <br /> <br /> It's definitely not everyone's ideal idea for a movie, but for those who value something differently and slipperyly, it's very worth your time. Highly recommended.
