Although it is not the usual word in the usual sense, it is more useful than any film that is full of smile but has no content. I don't think that Bergman movies can be categorized as narrow genres, even the lightest ones are quite complicated. In spite of this film, a slight touch creates a series of marriages and shortcomings and what happens when the flames begin to die, and so on. I do not personally communicate with all these questions, because I am sure others will do it. But the film's atmosphere is extraordinary, you almost want it to stop. I have to admit that Bergman of the fifties had blessed me, being familiar with most of his later ground-breaking efforts. Before Nykvist, von Sydow, Ulmani, etc., the champion made some of the richest, warm and touching movies I've ever seen. Although this is a long-lasting blow, I have seen such a love of human nature, its complexity, only in Fellini's films of the same period. Along with the summer day smiles, it makes sense to learn to Bergman fans to get the full picture of a person's ability and those who love the cinema. Rest him in peace!
