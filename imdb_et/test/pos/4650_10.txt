Fun, clean, cordial, and quoting. What else can I ask for in the movie? This is my favorite movie of all time. Since I was a little girl, I have dreamed of owning a blue bath with a flame and an observatory. <br /> <br /> Funny clich√© characters make this movie so fun. Wonderful comedy chemistry between Stephen Furst (Harold) and Andy Tennant (Melio) make up most of my favorite films. And who didn't love Flynch's hopeless discomfort? Don't forget that Hari Krishnas has Leon's Crown Airport: Dancing, Singing, and Playing Tamburin - Invincible! The tips are genius, the locations are classic and the plot is timeless. <br /> <br /> The word wise, if you didn't watch this movie, if you were little, you probably won't be able to place your heart today. However, give it a chance that you may find that "It doesn't matter what you say, it doesn't matter what you do, you have to play."
