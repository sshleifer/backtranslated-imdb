Maybe it's just a personal affection for this version of Mika Waltar's novel screen or affection for Egyptian things (I grew up to love the grandmothers of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts), but I think Maltin is a pretty good movie. Product values ​​are high in terms of color and cinematography, and it seems that some effort went into historical authenticity (a large part of this novel, I am sure). Purdom is indeed a bit stiff in leadership, but it can be accepted as part of thege. Victor Mature is well Victor Mature. Peter Ustinov is pleased to see a role he has always played so well and weakly. The performance of Bella Darvi as Neferi is a classic camp and I find that even Michael Wilding's rather dry image of Akenaten has its own complaint. <br /> <br /> The historical strangeness of Akenaten monotheism, a short journey into the theological history of ancient Egypt, is interesting, as is Akenaten itself, and it is worth reading; the religious wars shown here are actually based. <br /> <br /> An interesting footnote about Darvi, whose name was Bayla Wegier: he was a Polish emigrant, whose producer Darryl Zanuck and his wife Violet took their wing. I believe they could even accept him. His name, Darvi, is composed of the names of Zannuck and his wife. He continued his career in France, but never achieved great success, and died in 1971 after his rather unhappy life. <br /> <br /> In total, it's an interesting movie and enjoyable to see the visual values ​​alone. American Movie Classics occasionally shows it in a letterbox, which is an important story for storing scale and wiping.
