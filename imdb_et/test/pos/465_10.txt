One of the best films I've seen for a long time. Bechard has the opportunity to look at things that are completely unique and this film doesn't disappoint. <br /> <br /> This movie is always believed, and with seemingly taboo themes keeps you glued to the screen. There are no bad guys or good guys, Bechard ensures it. The characters are so sophisticated that you feel for everyone, care about what they have gone through. <br /> <br /> Bechard's attention to detail is balanced in this world by "FAST FOOD MOVIES" and some issues can cause some inconvenience - you love the feeling you give. <br /> <br /> I've heard that he said too often that there are no new stories. Thank you, Gorman Bechard, for proving it is wrong. <br /> <br /> To watch this movie, work, don't walk.
