When I first saw Colleen Moore, it was in a great series of "Hollywood". There he was in 1980, his hair struggling, as it was in the twenties, sparkling wine, spiritual and charismatic elderly woman - with the definition of "presence". Then I saw his fabulous silent comedy in films like "Ella Cinders" and "Orchids and Ermine". Then the disappointing "The Scarlet Letter". And now he is "The Power and the Glory", giving an amazing power, working professionally alongside one of the best actors in Spoken Cinema - Spencer Tracy. Moore and Tracy give such great performances that the story hardly seems important. Both actors live in the film from youth to old age - and this is mostly done by acting alone with minimal make-up and hair changes. Moore is almost recognizable in an elderly woman, and the scene where she finds her husband sees a younger woman, one of the most wonderful scenes I've ever seen. He does most of the scene without dialogue, meaning his silent actor gives him an edge, even over Tracy. Contrast this with his strange comic that plays in another quiet sequence when he is a young woman and Tracy tries to offer her. Amazing! What this movie shows more than anything else is how shameful it is that Hollywood lets this remarkable actor slip through his fingers and spend most of his life retiring.
