There is no way to compare this movie with any other film, because nobody has ever done anything like that and no one can ever do it. And it should be seen in the theater to fully appreciate it. At least it deserves an excellent sound system. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie on the day it was opened in 1968. I went because I like science literature and wanted to see a "space" movie. Remember, this movie was made before the first month of landing. <br /> <br /> There we were sitting waiting for it to begin. But SURPRISE! There were no comics, upcoming sights. For a reason, the owner of the Cooper Theater decided to play "Star-Spangled Banner", where the lights were still up, so we all stood, never did it before or after the movie, and then we sat again after that. Then the theater went completely BACK and the strange openness barely began to emerge with the blank screen. <br /> <br /> Openness ended and my place started in VIBRATE when a blue screen appeared on the MGM lion with the first deep bass notes, and then my minds were overwhelmed, hearing for the first time in my life "Sprach Zarathustra". The race had just started. <br /> <br /> (I recommend you watch this movie in a room at DARK where your subwoofer showed up as high as possible to impress in this theater.) Of course, it took quite some time before reaching space and the next movie was something other than scientific literature film. INTERMISSION (a good thing, very little appreciated and not used these days) and we all looked at each other in wonder, we tried to catch our breath and then we traveled again before. <br /> <br /> I saw it another 7 times in the next year, always in a pretty full-sized theater, like all theaters before multiplexing. I could have been "high" once, but I didn't go it over again because I was "beating". I went because I knew I could see a work of art. It was SO DAMN BEAUTIFUL; the sound you feel in your bones, followed by a terrible silence; Sights Imagine And Imagine; Turning to HAL affection. And of course WTF Kubrick was really trying to go over with me? Years and years, and many more views later, I understand it as I ever think. Read someone's comments if you are looking for someone to explain it to you or search the web for "explanations", this is not my goal in writing these comments. <br /> <br /> What I hope you have to encourage you to look patiently, enjoy the beauty of watching the most beautiful music you know about sunset (such as Gayne Ballet Suite or Blue Danube); taste it as if you were a wonderful meal, drink it like a fine wine; see and listen to the clues and hidden symbols that are there. And then make your own conclusions. Stanley Kubrick WANTED wished you some things that he found beautiful and wanted you to think where you were. man, came and where you headed. <br /> <br /> If it is too much work for your brain and you can't see or hear the beauty and mystery of Kubrick's movie, then grace is my dull, but your life is as meaningful as a tapir or a pre-monolith monkey . If you want a meaningless escape, it's not for you. <br /> <br /> But if you like sunsets, thunderstorms, harmonies in music, mysteries and sensuality, and you may have an open mind, this movie adds something to life.
