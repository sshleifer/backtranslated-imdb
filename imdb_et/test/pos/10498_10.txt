I saw this movie some time ago and it doesn't look like it. Does anyone know where I can get it? I feel it's worth it again. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to say I've never heard of Chloe Nicholle so far. Yes, he can act. When I first started watching this movie, I saw it in another movie, Sex Spa. The plot seems to me to be similar, but the roles are the opposite. <br /> <br /> This is the first movie I've seen in Dru Berrymore. I looked at some of his other films and I feel he looks better than a blonde. <br /> <br /> I agree that this is a good introductory film. Not too soft. Not too hard. You have to start somewhere.
