This is a peculiar hero / capricious film that seems to be predictable at first and will surprise you up to the last scene. The main winner is the knee who goes to work in a small carnival where he has paid to kill his wife's divan's husband, Divana, who then falls on him. He is tempting, complicated, and deadly, and he gets lost and reopens like a magician trick. The other props of the film include his double husband / employer (played by talented Armand Assante), some domineering dominant mobile phones, and the most important parcels of the wallet. Just like the old "shell game" where you have to guess which peas are, you can guess who has the money, and as the victims of those players who run such games, you probably think wrong. Dagma Dominczyk, like the lovely Divana, is a talented performer and remarkable whether she is dancing around her shoulders around her shoulders or working without hesitation on all the orphaned unhappy men. Norman Reedus is good because a young man who has been exhausted by the beauty he could kill. Don't read her because she's smarter when someone gave her credit. This strange film is worth it.
