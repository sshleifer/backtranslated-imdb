I first saw the opening of Otto Preminger's "Porgy and Bess" on television, probably for some time in the early 1980s, and my younger self found it somewhat slow despite this timeless music. I turned it off <br /> <br /> Last night, extremely rare, copied on a printed screen in L.A Cinematheque, and it was a little revelation. The performances are strong and memorable. Dorothy Dandridge brings to her a lot of vulnerability, strength and exotic (at least according to today's standards) eroticism. Sidney Poitier is uncomfortable with the film, but her performance is terrible, as is Pearl Bailey. Even better is Sammy Davis as an amoral, cat-like Sportin Life and Brock Peters as a stranger to Crown. Still, I'm not a Preminger fan, leaden - and much easier to see - "Carmen Jones." Porgy and Bess are far less controversial - although this may be related to the fact that the source material is much better. <br /> <br /> As seen last night, it is strong, but not all moments are quite alive, and blending is obviously a blur with Catfish Row (nicely made by Oliver Smith) and real-life. some short parts of the score seem unduly popular. <br /> <br /> Moreover, if it doesn't reduce the reach of filmmakers - Preminger's decision to shoot almost completely from a wide picture, without close-ups and from time to time medium-sized shots, which are undoubtedly unchanged and can be "tiled and scanned" on TV even the widescreen DVDs are doomed when it deserves to be restored. On smaller screens, we can't do much of the details that are crucial to how Preminger directed the film. <br /> <br /> Mi x heard odd last night. Many songs, especially during the "Summertime" opening, seemed too soft and instrumental. Maybe it can be restored with restoration. <br /> <br /> It's a film racial issue. Personally, I do not see anything wrong with it, at least in today's context. At a time when so few films were strong African-American characters, it might seem like a deplorable choice for a big budget Hollywood movie. And although there may not be much "empowerment" here, these are recognizable people who are not racial stereotypes. These are opera characters who make bad choices because of tragic signs. That alone made it a huge step by then. <br /> <br /> In a modern context where strong and heroic African-Americans are less rare (although they are still not ordinary), these characters do not seem to be more or less than human. They can really be poor and minors with any ethnic background. <br /> <br /> Next to Thorny politics, the original work is undoubtedly one of the great achievements of American music and (on the other hand) theater. Poitier, Davis, Dandridge, Peters and yes, Pearl Bailey, were all amazing performers we never see. It is less than perfect, but nevertheless the solid film clearly deserves visibility and appreciation.
