Over the last century, much progress has been made on gender equality, but not so much in the world of films. I'm not talking about what's going on behind the camera, I'm talking about the taste of the audience. The "chick flick" idea today is alive and well, but there are still many action and horror films that are primarily men. Of course, there are men and women who enjoy movies that are beyond their typical demographic, but there aren't many movies that have calls. Hitch, the last Will Smith vehicle, is trying to change this trend, being a chick flick that throws a man into perspective. <br /> <br /> Smith stands for Hitch in the title, Alex "Hitch" Hitchens, a "date doctor" who educates men on how to turn to a woman and who has a successful date. Hitch enjoys his work and loves to see that men are fulfilling their goals with a woman of their dreams, but because of the bad experience of college, Hitch is in love. As the story emerges, the film introduces two seemingly distinct stories. Hitch's last case is Albert Brennaman (Kevin James), an accountant who is very interested in one of his clients, the beautiful heir of Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta). Hitch has doubts about Albert's capabilities, but if his customers' wishes seem sincere, Hitch supports them. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Hitch Castle Colonel Sara Melas (Eva Mendes) will meet with her strong-minded woman. However, your doctor will not be able to follow his advice when following Sara. Things become even more complicated when Sara's work leads her to study the relationship between the accountant and the heir. Is Hitch able to balance her private life and her work? And more importantly, does Hitch believe in love again? If you are a true film fan, you have been in your life at least once when you have complained about the Hollywood movie's redundancy and called something new and original. Hitch is not this movie. But most movie fans also admit that from time to time a formal film can only work on an entertaining level. Hitch answers this movie.
