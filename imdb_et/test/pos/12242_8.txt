Spoiler Alert <br /> <br /> I've never seen any comments about the movie that I disagree with the comments people made about it. One could learn from the critical views of this film. As an educational film I appreciate it because it teaches "how to succeed"! We don't watch movies for learning; we usually look at entertainment. As entertainment, I appreciate it as low: the end is downfall and brain / intellectual. The result of this conflict is my eight stars. The film is followed by television news producer Jane Craig (Holly Hunter). The network manager introduces Tom Grunnick (William Hurt) to investigate the anchoring of air news. Tom amazes people humbly. Another potential news anchor has been waiting for years for its air opportunity, Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks). Altman knows all the news, inside and out. <br /> <br /> The network manager wants Grunnick to be in the air and Jane claims, saying Grunnick isn't ready, he doesn't know the news. They don't listen to her. Forced to place Grunnick in the air, contact Jane Altman to get news about the news and send Altman's comments through the earpiece to Grunnick when Grunnick talks. We observe a sharp contrast between the words of Altman / Jane Craig and Grunnicki, as Grunnick writes everything that Altman and Jane Craig say in their ears to make it understandable, pleasant and entertaining for the audience. Altman gets the chance of air and the network requires him to look for a new man under Grunnick's guidance. This new (news) who guides him? This is something that Altman sees no justification, but agrees reluctantly. <br /> <br /> Grunnick trains Altman and excitedly stating hundreds of Altman shortcomings in appearance, sound and vocabulary. Altman never held these things before he became a news expert. The complexity of Grunnick's teaching makes Altman a panic sweat attack ("Flop Sweat"). Finally, Grunnick becomes the anchor of the top network and Altman leaves before dismissal. But Grunnick does not try to make romance with Jane Craig because he discovers from Altman that Grunnick is sometimes forged to make people like that. It turns him off. It sends a message that in relationships we want people who are genuine and not trying to please them. <br /> <br /> This movie sends a message that getting people alike is the most important skill in the workplace, but that's especially true in Broadcast News. Many people comment on how it is sliding in television updates and how Grunnick looks good but buggy or all in style, but not content. The opposite is true, Grunnick had the skills and a very sophisticated intellect to make people similar to him, including the mood to know exactly how he appeared and sounds when he is on the camera (He instructs Altman to speak for each sentence)). Grunnick's mistake, which pays him for relations with Jane Craig, is that he is too forced to be pleasant and frustrating. Many people call Altman very intelligent or brilliant. The Altman by Brookes is not as intelligent as the Grunnick and "Flop Sweat" scene shows that his mind could not handle the complexity that Grunnick is about to air. The Altman is frustrated by the fact that he knew the news and Grunnick benefited more than he liked. There are also people who comment that these things are exclusive to the TV news industry. The notion that winning friends are the most important skill in work is obviously not popular, but my experience shows that this is true in most jobs. As an education on how to succeed, this film is fantastic, though unpopular. Educating, yes, but it has no uplifting end.
