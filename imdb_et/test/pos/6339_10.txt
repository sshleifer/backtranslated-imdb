An excellent episode, Dean showed that she was not just a good taste when she chose her girlfriend Cassie, but also showed that she had a heart and could only love one woman, and she was not just one man who loves and leaves em! Aweso e episode. Tell them about it. I only hope that some way they will return to Cassie's relationship next season (if next season is ??), I would like to see that he returns to his "supernatural" life, especially Dean. I also like choosing an African-American woman as a special lady in her life that somehow got away. I hope they did not screw it up and put an end to it as the episdoe ended. The girl who played Cassi was really a spectator and it was good to see the WB branch we all see in everyday life - interacial coupling that has become common and acceptable (eventually!)
