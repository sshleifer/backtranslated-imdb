"Alexander Nevsky" celebrated the return of filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein's filmmaking after the exile period, and what he has produced is a bald face propaganda film announcing Russia's superiority to Germany. <br /> <br /> There is a very small plot: Russians unite fighting Germans; Russia wins. The film is, in most cases, an expanded assembly of battle scenes, mixed with some moments of German brutality (such as a rather shocking scene showing German soldiers throwing Russian children under a devastating fire). It was Eisenstein's first sound film and it is clear that he had no idea what to do with the media. Indeed, this film seems to be rather a silent film with some sound added. There are some dialogue scenes, but they sit on the screen quite alive, and it's all turned off as if the actors were in reality not at the same time as they were filming. Eisenstein mostly uses sound as a pretext to transfer Prokofiev's current results, and it is indeed one of the biggest assets of the film. <br /> <br /> Tell what you want Eisenstein's ability (or lack of) to direct the actors or talk about his movie in a more narrative form; he knows for sure how to change images and music with maximum effect, and "Alexander Nevsky" looks out their shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Rating: A
