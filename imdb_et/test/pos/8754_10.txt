The best thing to say about the movie "Traffic" is that it drew attention to the British British British mini-series "Traffi". As many people have pointed out, the current film suffers from a narrowing of the story to adapt the short-term attention of cinematographers and the switch-over time of theater owners, who measure the success of the film through the sale of overpriced food. <br /> <br /> For the first time, I registered this mini series in 1990 when it was shown on public television and watched it several times. Throughout the documentary series, there is a strong element in tragedy and punishment, as all characters move towards their possible destiny. The strongest of these three stories is that the Pakistani family is forced to find a way to keep the body and soul together, after the army burns as a poppy in favor of agricultural politicians. Family difficulties are similar to those of the rickshaw pusher family in "Joy City". Ultimately, the farmer finds a job, but he compromises his pride and honesty. <br /> <br /> The Pakistani film segment is of special importance today, fighting against Al Quaeda supporters, and provides some insight into support for the disadvantaged movements between poor Pakistan and Afghanistan who rarely receive money in these countries. The film shows that farmers hardly see 25% of the aid that should encourage them to grow other crops. <br /> <br /> America's failure to see anything other than black and white - good guys v. bad guys - it is interesting to see another view that has no black and white but gray tones. <br /> <br /> Possible spoiler. The only problem I had with the story was that the things that happened earlier, like in real life, are the fiction they had to pack "bad guys". Moreover, it was a beautiful job that we see too rarely. The cast was outstanding and the German and Pakistani locations helped the film to "feel" different (something that the Germans saw as something else in the other World War II films).
