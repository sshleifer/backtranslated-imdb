I honestly don't know why so many people hate this movie, I've always thought it was one of my absolute fools. fighting the tiger and his men, teasing the pirates, all the skit, where everyone tried to avoid each other in the house, is pure genious ... ok so he didn't have the necessary kick ass final confrontation, but the manchus were pretty good. I'll give him 8/10.
