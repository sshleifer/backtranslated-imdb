This is a very realistic film. This is the most realistic thing I've seen in the youth of the city. The participants were great. I watch more of Gomez's movies. I've never heard of a movie until someone recently mentioned it. I bought this on a DVD. I was impressed. I haven't seen anything in Philadelphia close to life. It's really close - in fact, one scene with an accident (I don't break or give details) reminded me of the almost identical situation in Philadelphia. At first I thought Gomez took the scene of this real event, but then realized that he made the film a few years before that situation. I also agree with the view that this film did not attempt to put its complaint to Hollywood. Gomez also led the "laws of gravity" - I am eager to see it.
