The wounded Tonto stood alone to protect the three innocent lives. A devilish woman who puts a deadly plot. Racial tension. Smart Indians. <br /> <br /> These are the things we rarely see in the TV series, but this movie adds them all to the mix. Although this is definitely a Lone Ranger movie, this formula just blends so that those who are tired of the series will probably still enjoy it. Definitely recommended for every fan.
