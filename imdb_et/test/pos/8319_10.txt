This series, when Dinosaurus lived 65 million years ago. The Dinosaur is very real and moves very realistically. It is also very interesting how climate change is changing. <br /> <br /> I am very interested in how dinosaurs lived and died. I am also interested in how dinosaurs behaved. <br /> <br /> The color of the dinosaurs is interesting to see and discover. They think what color they had. <br /> <br /> The most interesting is why dinosaurs died and what happened after that. The BBC has made an excellent series of dinosaurs living and dying!
