The fact that, after 50 years, it is still a very observable film, says a lot. It is more intelligent and interesting than almost all the latest films in the same genre that have a nice sense of innocence. I'm not a big fan of this type of film, but I can look at the whole thing, making it a good movie to watch someone who may not share their taste in movies. I liked the black and white palette, the great casting, the smart hunt-scene that keeps you away from what the trick they'll draw next and end like everyone else. Tracking the Sequence of Thieves makes the mind of the power of silence, which, unfortunately, is so low in today's cinema.
