Tweety is sent to his train by his old lady owner. At the same time, there is also Sylvester in the trunk. <br /> <br /> No time has Sylvester captured Tweet, but the trainer will come back and hit "hit" the cat, "as he calls him back in his cage. He puts Tweetet in a" safer place "and tells the cat," Now, remember: no tricks! "Sylvester puts his own halo and sees it innocent. Yes, right. <br /> <br /> I found the most funny things but did not include Sylvester as Tweety, but the" viscious dog "located next to Sylvester Cat gets her mouth in her mouth and pays a big price for a big deal. Sylvester just doesn't learn, but that's one reason we love her! (I know many IMDb reviewers don't like Tweet, but I like both main characters - They both break me!) <br /> <br /> Here, too, the train and transient landscapes are beautifully illustrated here - a really nice visual.
