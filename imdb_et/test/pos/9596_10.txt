Did I hit this movie about the most unlikely success? , from the lower league, from the football team. The primer is thick and fills some very small turns. Intercut with 70s pictures and comments. I was amazed at the fun of this shift. <br /> <br /> A great show includes a wonderful Tim Healy as a mad (drunk) driver, worshiping everything that makes his team win ...? I remember bits like stolen secret files that Don Revie (Super Leeds united and england manager, all others hated) are from Bostock United (underweight men) who, in his detailed report on his opposition, made a statement in Bostock United's FA Cup final just saying "Sh -te ". <br /> <br /> A lot of other footwear is long before the fantastic "Mike Basset - Football Manager" where Ricky Tomlinson plays. /> <br /> With Gung ho English, who beat the Germans, in football. Well morally.Although the score lines say differently, "Escape Victory" (I still cheer as England score) <br /> <br /> And thankless eternal grind following the really bad team Micheal Palins "Golden Gordon" "Ripping yarns" series (with Terry Jones) was invited to Bostonworth United if you are interested. <br /> <br /> Bostock Cup-even Nick Hancock has seen a high copy of my biographies and low is not counted (probably someone - Mr. hancocks-error) <br /> <br /> Play it again or sell me a copy - PLEASE.
