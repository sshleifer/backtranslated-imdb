I liked it, welcome, watch this movie again, because I'm sure you have the clean what I miss. Amazingly cast, not over and not cliche. Uses a tragic event to reflect a number of relationships between individuals involved (or disconnected) in each relationship and perceptions of life, their relationships, life and how they are confused, joy, hurt, and disappointment discovering that things are not what they felt about them. First of all, I thought there were "observers" and "observed", but this is not the case, we are all somehow related and our perceived separation is only in small degrees. I recommend the film to everyone, especially to teaching, social work, religious counseling, and all other breathing people.
