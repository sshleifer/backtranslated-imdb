Some people don't like Led Zeppelin, but fortunately there are a number of people who aren't unbalanced with WAY. I am a 2 or 3 Led Zeppelin fan proud converter and the only reason I got it is because of this DVD. <br /> <br /> One way someone can listen to "Stairway to Heaven" or "Immigrant Song" that doesn't love Zeppelin is outside of me, just playing guitar and not like Page ... It's like a Christian and Jesus not pleasant. My friend was like "Led Zeppelin sucks!" and I was like, "Oh yes, look at it!" After a 2-minute view of the White Summer / Black Mountain Side, he was added to the screen and never said Zeppelin was already bad. <br /> <br /> Incase that you haven't followed to work on a metaphor I call this DVD from the Led Zeppelin Bible. The monitors kept high and used them as a nondescript pagan converter. <br /> <br /> Of course, some things are missing, such as "Over Mountains and Far", a good version of "Immigrant Song" and I really don't need 2 versions of "Whole Lotta Love", but what the hell, I'm taking. <br /> <br /> Because there is nothing "The song remains the same" that it was compared to 10 and even if it were more comparable, I would have given it.
