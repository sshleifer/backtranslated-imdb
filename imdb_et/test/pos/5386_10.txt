I saw "Heaven-Ship" ("Himmelskibet") at the 2006 Cinema Muto Festival in Sacil, Italy. What a great movie! This Danish steampunk saga is the first March trip to Mars, an era in which the wireless telegraph is not perfect. The spacecraft is not a radio and heroes are taken back from the horsecart. Even the titles are joyful ... some of them are written from the original Danish rhymed coupons. <br /> <br /> Performers' performances are ridiculous, largely manual eyebrows. But they are amazing, easily crossing the Georges Melies decade earlier (or "Die Frau im Mond" in ten years). Of course, the simplicity of the plot. The spacecraft team consists of seven thin men and one fat slip. Guess what cracks. Interestingly, everything in this film (except dubious professor Dubius) believes in the divine. Even martyrs. <br /> <br /> Impressively, scriptwriters have the point of recognizing that traveling to Mars is not confusing: headlines show that scientists have two years to build their spacecraft (with a flywheel) and six months to reach Mars. There is one very impressive design that needs to be choreographed during the construction work: dozens of workers are throwing themselves in the workplace in different directions, without any hesitation or collision. Danish scientists baptize their ship "Excelsior" ("packing materials") and set a course for Mars, although the Moon and Venus are closer. When a ship (which is traveling horizontally rather than vertically) lands on Mars, it is welcomed by Marsboerne - Mars who turn out to be Nordic blondes, all highly developed pacifists and vegetarians. (Being a very advanced butcher, I miserable that part.) <br /> <br /> Well, if Mars has both the atmosphere and the Earth's gravity. On the outside of the Martian landscape, the visible size of the Sun from Mars is the same as seen from Earth. I also couldn't see that all the wise martians are men. In fact, female parents are thin here: both the Earth-born hero and the Mars maid are the mother. Mars are talking about universal language, wearing ears on their clothes, and greeting the Earth's visitors on Earth's Earth ... which of course keep their North Pole up. <br /> <br /> This Mars maid is Marya, a playful Danish actress. (Cheater, I have some Danish!) We see Mars dance, which can be twee or ridiculous, but is actually pretty touching and beautiful. Mars' funeral scene also has one shot that reminded me of the "Seventh Seal" sequence. I wonder if Ingmar Bergman saw this movie. <br /> <br /> "Himmelskibet" has some drawbacks, but the weight of its production and its other features is much greater than its drawbacks. Ole Olsen, who is called credit (and who appears in a short prologue) is not associated with Chic Johnson's Vaudeville partner "Hellzapoppinist". I'd give "Himmelskibet" to 12, but on a scale top 10 ... so 10 out of 10 will make this joyous trip to Mars, a blonde for the planet!
