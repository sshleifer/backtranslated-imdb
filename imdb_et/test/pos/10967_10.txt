John Cassavette, in his first film, obviously as a picture of the New York shoestring, said that he did not even have a dialogue script and in 1959, equivalent to Larry David's Curb Your Enthusiasm - all participants know what to do and say, and even when they speak, they have right to look. In other words, it is one of the most realistic images of the generation of the generation, understandable in jazz and talking about racial tensions. Black siblings are the focal point where one tries to get better concerts than the average strip club and has a sister who is much brighter than her, who intertwines with a white man in a relationship that breaks both sides. However, the film is not only about that; Cassavettes wants his characters to travel around New York (which was not made in many films in 1959/60) and his storytelling style is similar to the day's improvisational jazz artists. Date to be sure, but look at movie fans; Martin Scorsese called it one of his most difficult influences.
