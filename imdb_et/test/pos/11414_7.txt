I don't look very much for "horror films," but one night I sat down and watched it with my relatives. Now we are teenagers, so we tend to entertain a lot of things, but to be honest, doing this wasn't really very good, especially at the beginning. One of the lines that stood out was when Scarlett says to Jill and Tiffany: "This is ... high school!" while the next scene shows that Jill goes aside from this college list ... At the beginning, many parts reminded me of a bad, poorly written, badly behaved Lizzie McGuire episode. But when the story moved on, and most of the time only moved over to Jill, I was able to appreciate the film more. Camilla Belle did the movie very well and I think other actors and actors destroyed her movie. And I have to admit that it was one of the most frightening movies I've ever seen. No, no, in the dark corner and in the possession of the dolls, there were no big monsters and white faces, but what made this movie more frightening than those that contained these things is that it can really happen. And this movie really reminded me that it's really scary ... We all know we're not dead dead in our lives, but the idea that the murderer is inside the house where babysitting takes place. really happens. The only mistake with this movie is that it is one of the clich√©s of the movies I've ever seen. All this has to do with all the horror movies have ever taken the keys and the car started, the shadows in the corner, turning the corners of the stairs with distance, turning around and seeing the dead body, ending the deadly scene quickly waking up from the dream and so on. It was very predictable in heroic scenes, but I would generally give it 7/10. It's definitely worth it. By the way, this is my first review, so I don't know if any of these things are spoilers.
