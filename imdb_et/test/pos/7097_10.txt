This movie was a very good Universal Monster movie. He once again celebrates Lon Chaney as Wolfman and Glenn Strange as a Frankenstein monster. Oh yeah, this jerk John Carradine is back to Dracula. I like every actor of this movie. I especially liked Onslow Stevens as dr. Edelmann. (It's written with 2 n) I thought a good nonsense doctor would have been understood as Talbot was. One scene that I think is very good is the scene when Dr. Edelmann thinks when he changes. Everything that disturbs him blinks in front of your eyes. A good doctor doesn't say his evil side says yes. This is the only reason I didn't want Dracula characters to be completely removed from this movie. I thought Dracula had nothing in the Frankens house. When his symbol is removed, he would not miss him. In this film, the doctor's blood is contaminated with Dracula, giving him his Jekyll and Hyde curse. I hate John Carradine and I don't think he should ever have played Dracula. I don't mind other actors who played the Frankenstein monster after the great Karloff because they did a good job. But when they get another actor to play Dracula, it stops there. John Carradine thought he was so high and powerful. They offered him the role of Frankenstein Monster once and he turned it down because he thought he was too educated. I can just imagine Carradine playing The Monster, who claimed with the director, "I don't have to take it out of you, I've done Shakespeare." John Carradine was not Dracula and he's never. Sorry John, Bela Lugosi is the one and only Dracula. God thanked them for returning Bela as Dracula to Abbott and Costello. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this movie. It will not deceive you and you will enjoy it as the other. This is a great addition to the monster movies. If you are a collector, do not leave it out. <br /> <br />
