First, let me say that this movie is not for everyone. This is a very strange topic. The lone spinster discovers the eternal life of a young man in a park by his street. He notices that he is sitting in the rain and invites him to dry and warm up. The man is not talking and the woman assumes he is deaf. Yet she is fascinated by her and is sexually interested. She finds her strange and continues her silence, though we will find out later that she has not silenced her and tells her sister everything that is happening between her and her wife. I will not hand over the rest of the plot. If you find this movie, look at it. You can't take your eyes off it. What makes it so interesting? Well, it's completely unique. I've never seen anything like this and watching these two is very uncomfortable. Especially if you find out what this blissful, boring, obsessive spinster is capable of. You won't forget it soon.
