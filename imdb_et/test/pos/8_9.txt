I am a tiny officer in 1st grade (E-6) and have been in the USCG for 6 years and I feel this film is a strong Coast Guard. There were only a few scenes that were far removed. The most far-reaching was when PO Fischer (Kutcher) went down into a drowning ship to pull the captain out of the engine room ... it would never happen. Swimmers are not allowed to enter any ship regardless of circumstances. Secondly, the handheld (supposedly in Kodiak) seemed more in the NASA control center ... we have no gear that hi-tech would have. Thirdly, Airstation's captain would not lead search and rescue cases like 10 people. In fact, it would be E-6 or E-7 as a SAR controller and maybe 2 other support staff like an assistant SAR controller and a radio observer. Otherwise, the film was dead, I think they should have added more CGs and their roles instead of search and rescue, rather than air-based prices. Some of the scenes in "A" schools reminded me of their days of the dark things I did and what my younger days struggled with.
