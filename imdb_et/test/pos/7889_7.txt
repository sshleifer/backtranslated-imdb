WARNING! Read this movie after watching the movie! As the 'Easy rider' released a year ago, Joe is trying to show what happens when a counter-culture and a general (though right-hand) America meet: a violent ending comes to an end. Although this movie is largely a traditional "old fashion" American morale slowly displayed, compared to the 60s lifestyle that is on-head-feel, it is also a comment in the upper middle and lower middle class and their inability to meet in the middle, as shown, when Comptons meet Currans. Boyle Joe represents the generation that is stuck in the 1940s and '50s, where' Kill mommy comi (or jap or hippie on this issue) is okay as long as it helps and saves America. Joe and Mary Mary are archetypes of Archie Bunker and Dingbat's wife Edith. This film, which is forever known for its violent (but not bloody - at all blood), is uneven, however. Joe explodes (literally) the Hippie generation (literally) with them to penetrate their numbers to find Compton's daughter - how clearly she should have rejected this idea, but surrender a separatist idea for the sake of sex. If he is betrayed by theft (read: the trust of the older generation to the newer generation), he lashes through a meaningless chain. Perhaps the observer of Hollywood's waitresses expects that the observer will ultimately wait for the death of blood vessels, but firing a bloodthirst will have some effect or realism. "Joe" is not a great movie, but it is an interesting display of the alienation of the screen and culture, and the display of the extreme screens of animals of the generation gap.
