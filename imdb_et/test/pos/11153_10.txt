I was five years old when the show debuted in 1958 and later it was a regular viewer. I remember that I really enjoyed this example with "Remember Beaver", "My Three Sons", "Ozzie and Harriet", "Dick Van Dyke", "I Love Lucy", "The Real McCoys", and so on. Now I'm on the DVD "Donna Reed" for the first season and the first two episodes. Donna Stone has been shown to be an intelligent, well-groomed, problem-solving, calm, homely mother, similar to the June End and unlike Lucy Ricardo. In episode 2, I especially like how Mrs Reed becomes a substitute, trades with her dress for sweating and boxing gloves, teaching her son how to physically protect her against a much larger bully. Although none of the neighboring mothers, including my own grown up, met exactly the idealistic standards depicted by Mrs Reed, it is refreshing to see good behaviors and smart decisions at the end of the day, contrary to today's accepted norms of vulgar, selfish and indifferent. I can't imagine that their parents would say to Jeff and Mary Stone that crossing their neighbors is fine, leaving the dog scratching the whole day, or telling his mother to "close" the supermarket in front of everyone.
