"100 TRAPPED PASSENGERS ... 3000 VENOMOUS VIPERS!" Almost you have to admire how much "no chance in hell of fulfilling this promise". I can admire the shelter hucksterism more than they did in the movies that well, you know, were good or at least worthy of fucking. Haha and that's what I like about these films. They're garbage. You put them in the toilet and then rinse. The price is worth if you are a fan of cheerfulness. It can become a cult class for many fans. Gore scenes are effective, I can't say much, it's a Z flick that parody is a new movie with Samuel L. Jackson, hell, it may be better for anyone to know!
