Like me, who was born long after the late 1960s, we can only learn from that time with cultural objects, of which "hair" is one. Certainly it is well done. One can feel how things were for the hippie culture. Probably the most impressive scene - at least for me - is when a group breaks the party of rich people. With regard to the last scene of the film, it can be interpreted as a symbolic ending for everyone represented by the 60's. <br /> <br /> But as one interprets this movie, it is important to realize that although the 60s themselves may have ended, their characteristic movements are still in small enclaves. This is a time that people will not forget right away. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is what I definitely recommend. Milos Forman scored another great one here, right between his two masterpieces "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and "Ragtime" (so why did he later make a girl like "Man on the Moon"?!). Starring John Savage, Treat Williams and Beverly D'Angelo.
