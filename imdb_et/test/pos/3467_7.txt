I went to "Rory O'Shea was here." I like this film better than I expected because of the great pains and powerful performance. This is a film about the friendship of two young men with disabilities. Rory is a free spirit young man who wants to be independent, regardless of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy. He can only move his two fingers, but he can talk spontaneously and help his new ball, Michael, who has cerebral palsy and is significantly speechless. I think it's enough to start crying with drama. Well, that's it. But with inspiring messages and deeply moving performances. It made me look at my life for the things I take for granted. What would I do if all I can do is move my two fingers? I feel grateful for what I have and what I can do. This is a good flick, though it could have been better.
