This is one of my favorite West. What's cast! Glenn Ford plays its role in ordinary lightweight, controlled, but firmly. Ford plays one of the smallest livestock farmers in the shadow of a powerful anchovy that wants to swallow the whole territory. Edward G Robinson plays the anchor house's looted patriarch and Barbera Stanwyck plays his cunning wife. There are many activities in this western part that are quite impressive, the scenery is tasty and typing is taking a breath! I would say that this western country was able to budget It seems expensive. One of the great western parts of Glenn Ford.
