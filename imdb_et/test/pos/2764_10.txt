I saw it on the big screen quiver and loved it - cheeziness and everything. Recently, I found a copy of the video and checked it again. Badly done, sure ... really fun, definitely. It still includes entertainment. It's much more fun than the boring Disney version ("Alive"). The only thing "Alive" did was special effects. If you are a B-film lover, I suggest "Survive", not to mention all the other Rene Cardona Jnr films ... and the Mexican wrestling made by his father (Rene Cardona Snr). "Survive" has long been over for treating DVDs. Are you listening, all you folks at Anchor Bay ...?
