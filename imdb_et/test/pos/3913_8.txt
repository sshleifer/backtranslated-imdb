I think anyone whose stupid is dangerous is to be a wax mannequin so they can play football or they don't want to leave their car. > Boy, Wade, who "went to the hairdressing salon and asked for He-Man's hairstyle," wasn't my type, but it's a really lovely scene with eyebrows and facial hair waxed. That's too little maintenance for me. <br /> <br /> Also fun, but not my type is a big sunglasses greasy man who looks like "only Elton John gay", but this whole plot doesn't go anywhere! <br /> <br /> Blake was hot, I saw him when he wasn't so his girlfriend who was a fake Paris Hilton in a bad wig (Chihuahaua is not in his handbag, but it would have been very valuable). I don't think such girls go to football games. Nick car thief is the sexiest! One of the best parts is where football lands on it and instead of throwing it back, it slips off the cigarette and burns football. Look, it's just such a man. He has a sister who can see a loan with his white female beater. Her bras show like a half movie! <br /> <br /> Mostly you just want to wax your legs and never go to football games after that.
