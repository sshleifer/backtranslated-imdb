Many have never said never before because it is not an official Bond film. Nevertheless, it is obvious that the producers followed the fruitful formula of the bond. Although the film does not have a pre-credit order, it is clear that the training at the beginning of the film is intended as an introductory scene. It would not have been possible for the EON to stop the manufacturers from adding a credit pre-order and title, although without the introduction of a barrel of weapons. <br /> <br /> Sean Connery is an immortal secret agent and this film is definitely better than Dr. No, Thunderball, only twice and diamonds are forever. Although the NSNA is meant to be a remake of Thunderball, it is a huge improvement. 007 spends more time on the terra company and the film has a more diverse range of exotic places. <br /> <br /> There's some fear in this movie. Barbara Carrera is impeccable as the odd Fatima Blush. One of the best scenes in the film is the coup d'Ã©tat between Bondi and Fatima in Nice, preceded by a dynamic motorcycle flow through the city. Klaus Maria Brandauer plays psychotic Largo and Max Von Sydow is free from the melodrama that other Blofeld's actors have promised. <br /> <br /> NSNA tends to focus on Connery rather than Bond's character. At first it is said that Bond is aging and is inactive. It seems to refer to a 12-year stoppage of the Conner Bond. Bond promises to "never" work in a secret service; hint of Connery portraying Bond. Manufacturers seem to have tried to injure Bond's official franchise. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, this movie is definitely worth it. This is the last time Sean Connery played James Bond, but his presentation convinced me he should never have said "ever again".
