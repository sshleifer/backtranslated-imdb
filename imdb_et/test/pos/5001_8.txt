Originally, I saw this movie when I worked as a music library in the summer. If you've ever worked in a theater - especially in the summer theater - you really enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some moments in the movie that are very bad, but in general it is a lovely respect for the theater and why people love it.
