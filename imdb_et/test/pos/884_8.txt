Although I saw this movie in Korean, and therefore does not understand this language, the pictures definitely say more than enough. What I can do about this is the story: Two great swordsman winners will become the king's guard in their service. One of them finds that he is against the king's roads and starts murdering important men. The other must wake him. This movie is visually great. The sword fight is great. And the film has an exciting ending. I hope this movie will be marketed to visitors to Western cinema. Of course, it will appear on the DVD.
