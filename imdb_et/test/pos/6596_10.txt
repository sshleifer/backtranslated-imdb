When I was twenty, I was Hershey, PA and part of Middletown Skate Tea. We did nothing other than skate trying to find out what we read on the Skateboarder Magazine pages. A few local mountains gave you all the speed limits you could handle. At that time, Mike Weed, with Russ Whats-his, was a hot spot where Z-boys were on the tail. I had a GT (GrenTech) plastic plate with Power Paw urethane wheel (open bearings). <br /> <br /> My parents said they'd move to California this year and travel home to travel. hunting. I was a very good son in the summer and I asked if I might have been awarded a REAL skateboard from California. They gave. It was a glass fiber glass with the title Surfer Magazine logo. Wide trucks and big red wheels (exact bearings, don't know). They got it on Oak Street, a surfing place in Laguna Beach. <br /> <br /> When I got to California (all 13), Anaheim had a concrete wave and Carlsbad had a great park. Soon came the Skateboard Odyssey mission in Viejo. Inside Park with every possible scenario. All the time I read about Stacy, Shogu, Tony and Jay. This flick was the right money and a wonderful experience to watch.
