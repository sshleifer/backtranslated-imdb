Ninja Hunter (AKA Wu Tang vs Ninja) is pure entertainment from start to finish thanks to its outrageous characters, meaningless graphics and the absence of any kind of claims. The authors of this film have given us a true OTT masterpiece that must be seen as credible. <br /> <br /> The plot centers are located around Wu Tang's cable, Abbot White, who wants to destroy Shaolin monks and become the ultimate martial artist. To do this, does he work with the Ninja clan, led by three masters? gold lam√© ninja, white dirty ninja and black ninja ?? and will destroy the Shaolin temple and most of its inhabitants. However, there are some survivors. Their task is to pass on knowledge of Shaolin's fingerprinting to a new generation who needs ninjas to restore peace and order, and defeat Abbott White. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Abbott White is hard at defeating the enemy because he is able to make himself virtually indestructible by sucking the vitality of warm naked chicks (excuse some welcome nudity!). <br /> <br /> Other observer shops are a very impressive battle (despite some acceleration), some very amazing equipment (the golden lamina ninja mentioned above, the Abbott White's Yin Yang suits and even some assassins carrying the Swastika tunics), the ninja who turned into a flying carpet, plus some good cheese. And I almost forgot to mention really impressive eyebrows in this movie? this is certainly a good reason not to pass this gemstone.
