I never heard the architect Louis Kahn until his documentary. In this almost two-hour documentary, which is going very fast, her son Nathaniel Kahn is studying her father's life in Estonia from the North Philadelphia slums to the University of Pennsylvania in West Philadelphia where she studied and taught. He travels to Bangladesh, Israel, Connecticut, Trenton and California to La Jolla and New York to explore his father's creations. Personally, Louis Kahn had three families, including his wife Esther, who refused to divorce and their daughter Sue Ann. Nathaniel includes her family members. Louis has another half-sister Alexandra Tynge from her father's previous relationship with Anne Tyne, a fellow citizen. Louis' passion was his art.
