I actually watched the movie several times. And what I want to say about this is the only thing that made this movie a high rank, which was Burak Altay's incredible performance, but nothing else. Not even those stupid models called Deniz Akkaya and some of these popular names in the movie ... Burak is definitely very talented, I've seen some of the jobs he did and was out of. Although it is a kind of horror film, it does a great job in comedy films and dramas. I bet most of you saw the movie and television series of Konmali Konak, these two would go ... Everything I say is better to watch the new works coming from Burak, you see. Keep a good job bro, lots of love.
