I thought this movie was suitable for little girls. It was about a magical place where Genevieve and all his sisters could do what they wanted to do most. Most of the little girls would like this story, even though there's a thought about death. Although no one dies, the king almost doesn't, but little girls don't understand it, so it adds a perfect story. All events are added, creating a large plot that can have meaning when you dig deep enough. This story is perfect for little girls and as it is a barbie movie, kids can have more fun with it, especially if they have their own barbies. Everyone can have fun with it because it is so cute and understandable. In general, I think this movie is a good movie for everyone, especially for little girls, and gives someone a smile at least once during that time.
