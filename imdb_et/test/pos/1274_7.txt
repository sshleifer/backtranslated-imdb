Surprisingly good film, given the circumstances of its production. Has performances from no-name actors who compete with the planet's top technology (unfortunately no one has left a career). <br /> <br /> The god of Christopher Nolan is also characterized by a similar ability to write a perfect dialogue. Dialogue is what carries the story of a person who loves people for the material of his books. Well shot, very well edited, even better written and amazingly well done. <br /> <br /> This movie contains all the great film needs except the people who have seen it. 9/10
