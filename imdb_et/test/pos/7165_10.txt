One of the unfortunate reality of post-Soviet Russia was that people's welfare did not change much during the Soviet era. As we see in the "window of Paris", most people are still depressed than ever, while they are encouraged to go for money. <br /> <br /> Then all the music teacher Nikolai Chizhov (Sergei Dontsov) will find a window leading to Paris. He and his friends are of course quite surprised at what they find. This movie is one of the funniest discussions about Elvis Presley and Edith Piaf I've ever heard. So watch this movie. You're sure you love it. It's a kind of predecessor, "Being John Malkovich".
