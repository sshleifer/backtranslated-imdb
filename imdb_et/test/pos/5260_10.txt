People who do not like this film are faced with it - for academic people who do not keep the original, it is completely enjoyable. <br /> <br /> My husband, who had never seen the original, said, "I don't want to see a girly movie." I assured him that "women" is just a great movie, not a girl movie. He had a great time. He was very glad he went and enjoyed it more than the "boy" movie we saw the day before "burning after reading". <br /> <br /> SPOILER: I think the new end is better. Maybe not quite that fun, but it was beautiful. First of all, I couldn't understand why they had made some changes to the plot, but when I got to the end and Debra Messing gives birth and brings the first man's movie, I cried. This is one thing to love about men? they are our sons.
