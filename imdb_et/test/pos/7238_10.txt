This movie is truly unique. It really captures the spirit of the game, but makes it a modern generation for entertainment. Romantika between Tromeo and Juliet was plausible and erotic, not many adjustments. It's so funny that I almost laughed. <br /> <br /> Like most of Troma's face, taboo themes, gore and sex, and more add some very good actors and Shakespeare plot. You really need to see this movie to believe it. <br /> <br /> There are some mountainous jokes on credits (the best credits I've seen from Hot Shots) in Troma Shells both in jokes and in general satire and shakespear. refs. And Lemmy tells of Motorhead's house. I borrowed this movie for a friend and I was almost impossible to get it back. Troma is the best, this film is a pearl and goes with all five of my best favorite films. <br /> <br /> Although this is not a movie you would look at with your mother and you could offend people. For those who get bored with the mill's cinema run, you have to see such a movie.
