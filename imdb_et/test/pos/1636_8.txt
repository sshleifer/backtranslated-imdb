Yes, I know my title sucks. I didn't think of another title. x] Ice is a great first season episode. Very interesting idea and good action. The whole worm was, in my opinion, really horrible. I've never been an insect fan so all insect episodes are horrible for me. x] Anyway, continue this episode with a good and bad thing, <br /> <br /> Good: Parasite. Awesome! <br /> <br /> Finally, Mulder trusted. Awww ... <33 <br /> <br /> It was a good idea to put another parasite in your ear. If somebody told me they had to put this thing in my ear ... I think the whole cab would be dead. <br /> <br /> Bad: How was the dog alive for so long? <Br /> <br /> How did Huffman not get these black spots? Or maybe he did it, but nobody saw it ... <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Very good episode, especially for the 1st season.
