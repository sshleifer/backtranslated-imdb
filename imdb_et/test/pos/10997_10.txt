This movie is not your typical Hollywood price, although the election is so bad that I tend to be away from movies rather than disappointment. But this small low-budget gem is a lovable and enjoyable and certainly a possessor. The actors are as diverse as the ones they represent, the Buffalo setting is charming (what a beautiful city is) and the story tells you. The lack of voluntary violence, gender and the word "f" does not diminish the least! Take the kids, take your grandmother, take a break from Hollywood! I'll give him 10 out of 10!
