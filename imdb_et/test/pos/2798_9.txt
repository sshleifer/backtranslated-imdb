Clich√© avoidance is one of the main achievements of this film. If you hear the story vaguely? Erasmus students with mixed nationalities sharing a flat in Barcelona? you predict a set of euro stereotypes in an exclusive tangle. Two tout! In fact, it is a finely appreciated comedy from a young French Xavier who tries to understand human relationships. There are some minorly observed minor roles (arrogant French neurologist, English-speaking girl, Xavier's hidden mother) and some fine visual humor, especially in open scenes that mocked the bureaucratic complexity of application processing. What Does Xavier Know About Relationships? Nothing is positive. Usually, instead of a happy ending, is the unfortunate final of the "Identity"? Xavier has "all the friends he did. Nevertheless, this very enjoyable movie deserves great success. I saw it in Luxembourg with a diverse Euro network who enjoyed themselves at the end and even welcome.
