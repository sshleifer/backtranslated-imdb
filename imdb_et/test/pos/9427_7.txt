Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) and Professor Moriarty (Lionel Atwill) take part in the struggle to check out Switz's latest inventor of bombing. Holmes wants to protect it from the British while Moriarty has not been sold to the Nazis. Although many fans are undoubtedly disappointed to see Holmes' 1940s war settings, this film proves to be a truly entertaining entertainment that does not peace in military propaganda, as it might have been. Dennis Hoey's inspector, Dr. Watson of Lestrade and Nigel Bruce, tend to steal the show, as their peeling methods offer a constant comic. Sparring between Holmes and Moriraty is colorful and well thought out. Atwill does Moriart well enough, even if he is not as memorable as some others who played this role. <br /> <br /> Although it does not give the fans a lot of new or excitement, this is a wonderful escape from the reality that I find somewhat relevant in 1942, which reflects many of the adventures of the 1930s and 1940s, but is a more compact and less repetitive plot. And all this has been done, but still remains the Sherlock Holmes spirit.
