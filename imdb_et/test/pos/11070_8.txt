I thought Nick Gomez was looking at the sharp streets of New Jersey, where car jacks are always high, both thoughtful and entertaining. It's as good as movies like Boyz n Hood or Menace II Society or Absolute. I thought the actors and scenarios were right, he had this sharp realistic feeling, and it was very atmospheric, be it for purpose or raw coincidence. I liked this movie a lot, the undervalued pearl found on television and glad I captured it. Watch this movie when you get a picture. If they don't have a DVD, they should release one. Well done by Nick Gomez. IMDb rating: 5.9. My Rating: 9/10
