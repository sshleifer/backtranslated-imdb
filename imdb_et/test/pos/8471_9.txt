I'm not saying something new when I say "Ray" was great. When I tilt this movie, I have to mention something that differentiates it from other films. Very rarely is the film made by the actor (s). "Ray" just made Jamie Foxx. Without Jamie Foxx's excellent performance, "Ray" would be just another interesting and informative biopsy. I always thought Foxx was funny because of his days with "In Livin 'Color" and "Jamie Foxx Show", and I also knew he was talented when he used his show ("Jamie Foxx Show") show your musical talents. But I never imagined that he could take away such a role. I don't know much about action and what they go through to get a character or other things like that, but what I saw from Jamie Foxx was very impressive. He created himself in this role and made Ray Charles an actor instead of Ray Charles. Ray's story was great, but Jamie Foxx gave it a life.
