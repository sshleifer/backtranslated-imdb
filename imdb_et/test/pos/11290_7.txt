Although not important for the film, it is a myth of creation. God (a sad, bloody figure on a chair) cuts his organs with a straight razor and dies his slag. Mother Earth rises from her body and absorbs her seed by giving birth to Man. However, it is very unlikely that you will see anything without reading the synopsis, and this is not particularly important for the film you are doing, because it is a rather surreal artwork that is all dark, processed black and white. The sick, gloomy atmosphere has been created by harsh photography and minimal sounds (mostly dripping water, storms, scratches, etc.), but every scene goes a little too long and so the film as a whole. It could have been a short movie, and killing God was very good and extremely horrible, especially the first thing you saw, but it is hard to be patient when it goes so long and you don't even make that message you see most of the time. <br /> <br /> However, it is a good film for original style, images, atmosphere and content.
