I didn't wait much for this movie except for the B-film gore fest. Fortunately, I was presented with a very well made film that skipped it and was able to keep it running throughout my run. It was an impressive achievement. The action was sure to create signs that you care and associate; and while some find the movie slowly, it forced you to think about what you would have done in the same situation. It was accompanied by some fine camera work and the directors brought it perfectly together. Then there is a great effort that is worth your time if you prefer development and tension over gore.
