.. especially Lambert. This is imperative for Burrough's Tarzan, which I read as a child. I've read some negative comments about this movie and couldn't think what their question was. They probably didn't see the movie I did, or they waited for something similar to the Saturday afternoon series. <br /> <br /> It was Tarzan, which was a novel and filmmakers should be praised for handling the source material and taking it seriously. Lambert was great. I still think he is one of Hollywood's least appreciated players. It was a film he shone. <br /> <br /> Photography and monkeys made by Rick Baker were amazing. You certainly felt like a jungle. On the 2nd side, Tarzani's attempt to be civilized indeed pulls you into an emotional conflict that he was forced to resolve. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie
