Historical drama is one of the areas where the British simply can't win. So even though I'm not a big fan of the genre, I can usually convince you to watch it if it's British and decent. <br /> <br /> I've never read anything about Sarah Waters, of course, something I should do. So I really didn't know what to expect. I had heard that the lesbian love story would be, but not much more. Looking at it, I found it more interesting than I had expected. Too much to say, the plot has turned up unexpected and well-designed. Although there were too many twists somewhere, it took me time to get everything straight. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are good, the participants are very strong, and the pace is decent, although I found it to be a little slow in the last half hour. But it may be for me, I usually have a problem dragging the movies after the plot is more or less finished. All in all, it is quite enjoyable for three hours. I recommend it to anyone interested in historical dramas.
