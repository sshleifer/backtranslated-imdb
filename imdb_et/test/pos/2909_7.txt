The intelligence and scope of this film cannot be impressed, but the lost opportunities are also disappointing. <br /> <br /> I found the script great and Edmund Purdom's vocal talent is quite impressive. But as an artifact of this time, the film suffers too much from Hollywood specimens, especially poor casting, too much lushness in sets, and too much pretentiousness. Edmund Purdom (who plays the character of the title) is so uncomfortable with his physical behavior, I suspect he had been in Shakespeare's theater before. <br /> <br /> So when people read the movie, I offer it as a great candidate for rewriting, especially if you poured the Egyptians into a truly Egyptian!
