I love foreign movies and this is one of the best. I don't see it as a comedy, as it is listed, and I think it's a comment about how we see others around us. The leading role of the film is not considered mandatory, because it is home to a big company and people say and do things around him all the time they wouldn't say to others. <br /> <br /> Leaves him with a lot of information that can only make mortal. :) This actor is wonderful as this character and it is an amazing story. There is a story and almost a lot of songs inside the story of this movie. I just hope that if someone decides to make an Estonian / English version of this movie, there will be no three men and a baby vein that will definitely serve FILI, A must see .....
