Christopher Nolan had his own goals. Following a very narrow direction, he pulled out in this direction something that reminded me very little about the "line of poverty" movies, like Ullmer back in the 40s. It is only at this time that he is able to apply respect - a black-and-white photo (given the budget of a given string of shoes, but also for the dark cracks of those characters) and a slick male colleague and a beautiful-in-aa-gritty of actors (John Doe lead lead) led femme fatale) - keeping it in the 90s, where several thousand dollars and specific choices in places and music and such things may be possible. This and also the movie-noir mood put Nolan together on the plot's crafty web, maybe even more than Memento. If the latter was a work of psychology that discovered the past with the customs enriched by the customs of the inch in the past, then there is a non-linear structure that aims to show how far someone, like Bill, can go through as dark a path as Cobb, only in an environment where toes are not designed to someone who isn't really twisted and deeper into the game. Cobb is of course. story and getting there I wasn't even sure where it would go when it could be some sort of unconscious area in Slacker, where Nolan drove his character to one of the British people in the city. But building Bill's ties to Cobb is going to happen quickly and wonderfully, as we see right when Cobb approaches Bill at the cafe to ask what he's following, almost everything we need to know about both - and the first robbery he brings to him. Soon there will be a good result on the horizon, which is really all about Cobb and her lady (just called "The Blonde", maybe too obvious to honor a dude, but why carp). But it has appeared in a way that really was my guess, because the manipulation of narrative worked even more to raise questions not so much about why. Density increases even more, as participants understand their important points as characters, as Alex Haw is brilliant as a true sociopath who can barely hide his "deep" ideas about what he can actually enjoy in burglary, and Theobald, who has such behavior can never be as intelligent as it is, but is more intelligent in such a naive way that there is no possibility in such an environment; Russell is almost too easy, even a face that sends Ana with a shake of Savage's head. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Nolan is also a cameraman with style, leaving nothing to add to the atmosphere and intercourse because fade-in / fade-out is not too fast to leave a lasting impression, but it's enough to add the script " This-May-Leading-Everywhere ‚ÄùLogic. He follows it in a hand-held form, as he knows where his limitations are, and yet it is fantastic to keep important things: close-ups if necessary (one I love is a small mirror of Russell's face) and a fairly simple techno story that never hurts. Sometimes, as mentioned, it is never quite clear what "modern" vision is about something that looks like an eternal and solid paper story with mental and moral uncertainty for low criminals, which for me is virtually irresistible. Simply put, this is one of the great calling cards I've seen in recent years from the filmmaker, and I hope that this is something that fans of the future work of Nolan are looking for. Or even for those who think that the razor has gone through the fast editing of the mainstream and the big gun (even in independent films), it is 71 minutes bright.
