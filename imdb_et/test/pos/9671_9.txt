Seth McFarlane is a true genius. He has created an idea that is witty, culturally sharp and just completely fun. <br /> <br /> For those who think that his "offensive" social or cultural issues do not give a meaningful comment, it just causes "insult", may you mention this quote: <br /> <br /> Peter (coming stem cell laboratory): How long was I there? // Guard: Five minutes. // Peter: Why don't we finance it?!? <br /> <br /> Why really. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the family member that you are not only more fun on TVs (with the possible exception of a very loved, many missed futurama), but also quite smart
