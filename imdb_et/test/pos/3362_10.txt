In my opinion, the best time for the Fathers Army is always the best laptop in Britain. I believe that if you look at just one episode exhibition, you can't fully appreciate this episode (it also includes a movie). You must at least look at the series of the exhibition, enter the characters, explore the surroundings and the situations in which they are. When you look at the exhibition, it will be of interest to you. Now the film has some changes in the series that are a bit disappointing but still work. See the first or two examples before viewing it. You don't have to be disappointed. A good episode to watch is "No Spring for Frazer"
