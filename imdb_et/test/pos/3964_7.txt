When the "Accepts" trailer first appeared, many people were excited to see it ... very excited. Who could blame them, it seemed fun. But that's exactly the thing. People were accepted, looking for a good movie, but if you think it is not acceptable what type of movie is a good movie. It is meant for a movie that enjoys its crowd without much effort. This means that for those who expected a big movie, you need to think about what could be done about such comedy. Think about it, and you really enjoy the movie (because you lose your idea that the movie is fantastic.) BOTTOM LINE: Watch the movie and have fun, but don't look for something new.
