While reading some other comments on this movie, I was reminded of both good and not so good aspects. In general, I have to say that this is one of the best films I've recently seen in any genre or country. What's more, it avoids the use of many of the more recent international cinema traps, such as making a nice picture of the landscapes or "hip", "fun" or imitating American films like pulp. The film is unique in many ways. First of all, it is a film about relationships in which sex plays a role (unusual, especially for foreign films). It is also a film about two men's relationship with each other (also unusual - not "friendship", no homosexual tension, no ego / phallic competition). He uses little dialogue but communicates enormously. This is a simple story, yet full of sophisticated details that every person can easily understand and versatile. I didn't find the film dark or depressing (everything seems like watching Hollywood's happy end movies all the time), but rather a true reflection of people's emotions. For example, in a scene where Mahmut realizes that his cousin has disappeared, you see his sense of relief that the cousin has disappeared and yet regrets that he has rejected him. Who hasn't felt such ambivalence - losing a friend or mistress or in some other situation? It is rare to get such real human emotions in a film of non-clich√©s. As far as culture or Turkish film is concerned, I feel that it strikes a very difficult balance with the greater effort made by the Turkish film - the reality that applies more to this place - to do it against the Turkish city. Europe, a greater contrast between the state and the city) and a universal human story that does not necessarily have to be set in Turkey. In this day and age, where people all over the world consume and fetish culture, this film does not try to attract "turkish" or try to "tough" or "this is how Turkey / Istanbul IS". And there are cultural elements. I think the comparison "lost in translation" that someone did is pretty good. Everyone, at least in the US, was frightening about this movie. I personally thought it was mediocre at best. had to deal with "disorientation" that happens to people living or traveling abroad. Even if the film should be humorous, the characters and their motivations and crises were never clear (even in the case of a "lighter" film or comedy, this is necessary). I am treated to a strangely orientated story from a stranger from America: go back to "far" because it is the idea that it is bad or too slow or no plot, I'm sorry, but people who say it do not know anything about making a film and maybe nothing human, not insult. You don't have to be a movie enthusiast or a cultural figure to evaluate this movie. This movie is two hours of your time!
