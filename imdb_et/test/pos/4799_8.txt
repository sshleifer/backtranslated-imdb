"Nazarin", directed by Luis Bunuel, presents an extraordinary view of religion in Mexico. Julio Alejandro, Director and his remarkable partner, said the film was a Mexican cinema on an international map after winning the Grand Prix this year in Cannes. This is a disturbing film because Mr Bunuel delves deep into what is wrong with the church. This young priest is seen living in poverty in an urban retirement pension. He doesn't have enough of himself, but he doesn't mind leaving the coin when a beggar appears in his window asking for help. At the same time, he takes his little room a prostitute that has hurt another woman. Andara, the woman pays her goodness by burning the room and the whole building! Nazarini is seen as a rural begging for food. Andara and Beatriz, two of her old town prostitutes, follow her. The life of Nazarini is equal to the life of Jesus. In fact, this sacred figure makes humility. <br /> <br /> Sir. Bunuel had no religion in mind when he and Mr. Alejandro himself made the film. It is ironic how Spain welcomed her after the release of this film, as they saw it as an indication of Christian qualities, in fact it is an acermatic satire of the Catholic Church and its ministers. <br /> <br /> Francisco Rabal, a Spanish actress, makes a wonderful Nazarine. It was one of his best roles. Mr. Rabal worked in his home country, but also in Mexico and Argentina. Rita Macedo, Andara, is also great. Marga Lopez also makes a valuable contribution to Beatriz's portrayal. <br /> <br /> A great movie by the filmmaker Luis Bunuel.
