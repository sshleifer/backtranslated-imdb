A real horrible story full of cold colors and sensuality, this film does not match what it promises. It is probably based on an old ghost story and maybe based on a simple assumption. Most of his imaginative and truly captivating, but almost the same Oshima has lost interest in it and brought it to an end. <br /> <br /> The story is simple - the woman and the woman her younger mistress will kill her husband so they can be together. But their lack of nerves and the returning ghost condemned them to insanity. Beautifully treated, with imaginative scenes and lovers' passion is beautifully decorated. But too often, a film cannot really fulfill its promise, just as Oshima would lose her nerve in the same way as lovers. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching a movie to see how Oshima combines his great skill as a filmmaker with some of the tricks of exploiting the film to draw the audience, but unfortunately this is not a true classic film like a woman from Onibaba or dunes.
