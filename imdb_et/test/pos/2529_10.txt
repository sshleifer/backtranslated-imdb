Film about government failure and selfishness of adults. The impossible effect of solving life and the associated lifestyles is not possible. Living only. Stay alive in a cruel world. The nightmare world, we are afraid to watch it because we see the truth and are afraid to see it. To see the world of despair when we are all so comfortable in our own lives and even complain about what we have not received, if it is as trivial as someone else. They, the children of the film, are desensitized. They are surrounded by them more than not. They look like sex as they watch TV shows. If one boy is a whore, he sits in Pixote's bed, looking at an empty foam, he doesn't. He wants to be a little boy and has a family, but the whore has no compassion or disapproval. "Man" film with "human" relationships and moral judgment in an ugly, scary and cruel world. Reminds us that life is not fair, but you still have a human connection.
