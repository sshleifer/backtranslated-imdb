Altman and Scorses have sex as one of the biggest American films of the last 20 years. Boogie Nights didn't make a big initial splash and I don't think it has earned the merit he deserves. The change around the film ("Some porn movies with Marky Mark") was completely worthwhile. What Paul Thomas Anderson has created is not just a stunning performance of an American dream and later loss (if such a thing still exists). <br /> <br /> For those who have lived, Boogie Nights speaks literally for the younger Eddie Adams (Wahlberg) in the last eight-year box (or confession). Eddie is just from Torrance, California, who wants more. His room is soaked in muscle, naive America. Her dreams are much greater than her potential, but not as big as her ... a special gift. His bald southern gentleman raises the attention and eyebrows of the rapidly growing, domestic adult film industry. Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds as a luminous eye papa bear) gets Eddie's hidden talent in the wind and decides to put him in the movie. <br /> <br /> Before you can say "deep into the throat", Eddie has changed her name to Dirk Diggler and has made her massive member open to the public. Celebrity and happiness make Dirki familiar as well as the fame of local porn networks. His friends and associates become his alternating family, but soon Sunday will be a picnic, like no other. Since the 70's feel-good 70's give way to coke, video to the 80's, Dirk & Co. begins. a dangerous setback. <br /> <br /> Anderson put everything he had in this famous and moving epic. It sizzles and never fizzles. Nary wastes this monumental picture and the characters and their dialogue live with us long after ELO's radius disappears. Check it out now. And then look at it again. <br /> <br /> And again.
