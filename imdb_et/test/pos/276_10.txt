I was halfway when I looked at the short film choices late at night - but I stood up from the first frame of "I Shout Love" and couldn't take my eyes off completely, for a short and perfect length. Incredibly sure of pace and performance, this movie keeps its funny / sad / incomprehensible tone. Ultimately, the credit went so fast and in such small types I had to go to work to leave the person in charge. What a pleasant surprise to see the name of a larger actor, Sarah Polley, who has been rarely seen. <br /> <br /> Kristen Thomsen (Tessa) and Matthew Ferguson (Bobby) turn rich, touching performances as a couple. breakages. When they work through the repetition of favorite moments of Tessa's time together, both actors discover the dimensions of their characters and their relationships in a way that brings their talents not only honor, but also the director's / writer's skills. The film creates a moving narrative at ridiculous moments and breathlessness. <br /> <br /> "I Shout Love" is undoubtedly one of the biggest and most memorable short films I've ever expected. It's a smart, cordial, and stunning originality. This is important.
