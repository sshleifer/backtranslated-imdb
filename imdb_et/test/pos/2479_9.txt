As for fake documentaries (anyone?), Then it's the best with the best! It looks very real and that is the purpose of it. In the light of recent events (Guantanamo), this film is even worse, so you could say it was before that time it appeared in the 70s! <br /> <br /> Can only hope that such a government does not exist! Are you looking for terrorists and interviewing people like that? Of course, the people interviewed seemed the same (70s mentality): screw politicians and politics in general. Maybe it wasn't that smart to guess ... but hey, don't forget: it's just a movie! ; o)
