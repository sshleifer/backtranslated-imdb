This show has an amazing plot with good and recognizable actors (like Boston Legal Girl and Boris Butcher butcher). Even extremists and the child I thought of as a commercial may have a weak link, surprised me with their skills. This is the little thing the director needs. Like a guy who has to kick back the last episode at the beginning of every new episode, he must be fired. The narrator tells you what happened to this story. The only other small problem I had was that sometimes they take things for too long, but not as close as some exhibitions like Prison Break. Anyone know when they will continue the season?
