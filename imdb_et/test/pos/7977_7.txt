I really enjoyed hell to pay. I've been a western fan for as long as I remember, and it reminded me a lot of Westerners of the 1960s (although I was too young to see them for the first time). One thing that disturbed me about the film was constant music. It was sometimes disturbing. One thing I noticed, and I don't know how many other Gunsmoke fans noticed, was the character of Buck Taylor. It was the name of Gunsmoke Doc Adams. Instead of Gaylan Adams, Buck Taylor used Adam Galen. I don't know if it was her choice or Chris McIntyre? Anyway, I'd recommend it to fans of Western countries. Don't expect anything too "deep". Just old entertainment.
