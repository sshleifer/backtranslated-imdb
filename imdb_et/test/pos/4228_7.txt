The series of childrens games is not my favorite, but Chits' bride is actually a good movie. This time we have two dolls Chucky and his former girlfriend (when he was a man) Tiffany. Together they go on to find an object. Through the film, there are a couple of interesting scenes, such as how the boy has hit the truck and literally exploded, the sex meeting and the end between Chucky and Tiffany, which allows another success. It wasn't really a straightforward idea, it mixed a lot of comedy and was a kind of fear genre. This made the film better when comedy made with many horror films. Everything even if your childhood fan doesn't give it.
