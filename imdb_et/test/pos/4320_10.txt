* Could include a spoiler, read only after the last episode 2 * Think about it. Boys on the North Pole? The center of the earth? Looking for abnormal magnetic behavior? They also said something, "Did we leave it again?" So there was another deviation? Of course it was when the usual crashed! I think this whole island is a setting. His father created. He learned about it and was looking for his Desmond. How else can he find out what to look for. <br /> <br /> This is basically the island's magnetic protection. All this is fake. All the characters are there. Fake beard, fake doors, counterfeit medicines, fake observation stations with fake air shafts that do nothing. It's really a project, and due to the final scene of the 2nd season finale, I need to do something with Desmond, his chick and his father (and probably Libby, he's weird, maybe he really has something to do with a plane that falls, OK now I'm drifting <br /> <br /> In this episode, Henry Gail also tells Michael that he is going to get some coordinate, and he finds his rescue. This is probably a magnetic shield. "when you are gone. There is no return." <br /> <br /> I think this is quite obvious, despite the many questions I still have, and I hope to get answers next season. If you think we've learned the 1st and 2nd seasons, then I'm sure we'll get many answers in the 3rd season. <br /> <br /> Can't wait. <br /> <br /> Does anyone agree with this theory? Hope to hear from you ...
