I never imagined that I would love such films. After seeing the "hero" of Yimou Zhang, I decided to check my other movies, looking for something similar. Another Yimou Zhang movie I watched was "No One Less", after which I realized what kind of cinema I am currently. No wonder why I got "Keep Cool" right now. It's a simple, touching and brilliant cinema, I respect the director. <br /> <br /> This movie shows that it's not the amount of money that makes the movie good. It's all about what the director wants to show and how successfully he does it. The story is a very simple, typical statement of everyday life, which is additionally shown in a very simple way, the movement of the camera also strengthens the impression and feel of the film. I give this film the best rating and I look forward to the other Yimou Zhang films.
