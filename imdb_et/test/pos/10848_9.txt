This BBC series is amazingly good fun. I only saw a few minutes before I knew I had to own it and watch it again with all my friends. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone proudly, but almost anyone else enjoys it - from the cinema snob to the entertainment-hungry mass. Lead's character is lesbian, but it's still worth it if it's not your business. <br /> <br /> Rachael Stirling has an incredible leading role that stretches her dazzling range of emotions and situations. nature. Someone who saw this series never says he can't act. She makes us laugh, cry, get in and strikes her forehead with astonishment. <br /> <br /> You can't really compare this story to anything else. It is not a transformation of style or plot. It's completely your beast, part of comedy, historical drama, eroticism, age, musical, and more. <br /> <br /> You have to praise the BBC for this story. I can't imagine anyone (overly cautious and formal) ever doing it in the US. So, stop reading it and buy it.
