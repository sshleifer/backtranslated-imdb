"Just Before Dawn" by Jeff Lieberman is definitely one of the most underrated horror films. The film, although slightly influenced by "Deliverance" and "Texas Chain Saw Massacre", is extremely creepy and memorable. lets up and the atmosphere is truly eerie.The is great, Deborah Benson and Jamie Rose are great women. Inbred twins are truly frightening and insane killers. The film has been captured beautifully - it was actually filmed in Silver Falls State Park in Oregon. There is very little gore, but one kill when Verchel is clipped in the groin is quite disgusting and unpleasant.
