Well, I have to say that this movie was probably the most fun movie I've seen all year round. And I don't understand it exactly. This is probably the most pathetic movie I've seen for a while, and it makes it so fun. You can say that these people are really trying to act, unfortunately they do not do such a good job, so that even lines that are intended to be a serious tone come to sound really funny. Aaron Carter basically plays a pretty similar character in real life, but still manages to see that character, which is not at all realistic. This movie is one of those movies where everything that should sound serious comes out really funny and all the things that should be funny are just so stupid and dirty that you have to laugh because you know how hard they are trying. This movie is so bad, it's really good. I would definitely recommend it if your mood is good to laugh.
