Shirley Knight plays Sara Ravenna, a housewife of Long Island, who leaves her marriage when she discovers she is pregnant. He is going to the American heart and start again. Along the way he makes a friendly traveler (James Caan) who calls himself "Killer". Soon he will discover that a good-natured "Killer" is actually a brain injury, and he has taken a lot of responsibility unknowingly. They both drive to Nebraska, where Sara gets a job for Killer, helping roadside reptiles. It is here that Sara meets a local policeman with Gordon and soon things will go terribly wrong for everyone. <br /> <br /> It is a powerful drama of people who are divorced from society, alienated by their choices or their limits to others. Even with such a low budget and very freely moving attitude, the film is capable of all that has to be said through their clearly defined characters. Shirley Knight has a complicated, divisive role and there are moments where some terrifying action is taking place. One of my favorites is when she's on the phone, calling her for the first time to worry about her husband. It is such a tight scene at both ends and in every little gesture, and so much is spoken about him in the inflatable word. Then James Caan's "Killer" character arrives. This character is different from what I have ever seen him and he performs perfectly. It is one of his best presentations because he is very restrained and mobile. <br /> <br /> How Coppola shapes characters with short, dreamy setbacks is very smart, adding all the fragmented views to it. Rapid setbacks, which are graphical and independent contrasts, are also found in longer scenes in some important scenes. Also, since this film was taken from all over the US, it offers an authentic, authentic image to America in the late 1960s. I only know his last job on television, usually playing with a chewing mother or a tiny old woman. It was nice to see that she was so young, beautiful and so beautiful. It is also a disgrace that James Caan went on "tough" for his career, because this film proves that he is capable of so much more.
