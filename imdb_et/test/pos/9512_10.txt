I don't know what Dick was talking about steel, but I found this film one of Japan's most exciting epic. What about Armageddon or Deep Impact or this question? What I know about films has been the main cause of the mill's asteroid strikes or global warming, most of the disasters in the movies. How ever a different course took place. The move of natural resources, where the earth's crust begins to decrease so much that it takes another plot to drive. The research teams needed to create an opportunity to stop erosion far and the Japanese sinking. In most cases, it is simply referred to as a tectonic modification of steroids. I found the characters quite appealing, from the child who lost his mother, only facing his own death among unknown friends. Or a rescue worker who does everything to save lives as a result of an accident. Or a man who thought he could change his mind so that he wouldn't be such a bold devil and go with him to become a hero and save his homeland. Let us not forget how the rest of the world just pulled them all back to forget about being the world by turning their back on Japanese citizens who were looking for help. It was a great movie in every aspect. What Dick is trying to say is that this movie was not made in Hollywood, that it was made in Japan, that it had signs that competed with other players in the world, that the effect is very proud, as he mentioned, but that's all he was expecting and nothing else . He has no vision of what is important to everyone, and why this film had all the elements of feeling, glory and humanity. I thought this film was top-notch and I've seen many catastrophic movies to find out that Japanese sinks are probably one of the most original and thoughtful projects I've ever seen. I really hope that Shinji Higuchi will make another such movie. My, and by the way, I'm not Japanese, although I wish I had many ways. I am Canadian, born and raised. And an avid movie buffer in every aspect. Pre-trial visions are bitter and not worth the effort to be recognized as an opinion. Dick should look at this more open heart and mind, not just look for an eye candy that makes the content of movies look for what's more important and understand it. They may not be Americans, but the Japanese have recently made it the cornerstone of the market. That's why 25,000,000 spending is just what the doctor ordered. You heard right, 25,000,000 this movie. Now you tell me, was it worth it? or was it worth it because the American actors were not there?
