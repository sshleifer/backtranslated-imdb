Michael Radford has done an excellent job that brings this tough game screen. He has accepted the reputation of anti-Semitism and has shown us that Shakespeare knew quite well the Jewish mankind. Radford said after the screening and I agree that Shylock is his first tragic hero, his first character to be driven, due to compulsive revenge. He also rightly points out that an anti-Semitic man would not have been able to write Shylock's speech "If you broke me, would I not bleed?" Radford is a Jewish origin and has chosen good and bad from all characters with delicacy and honesty. no sign is free of errors; no sign is bad. Radford has put the game in the 16th century, giving a lush backdrop to Venetian politics and decadence to write down Shakespeare's words. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to hear about Radford when talking about a movie, we recommend taking it because it gives details of the 16th century Venetian life that illuminates many choices made and gives you a much deeper viewing experience. I hope the DVD will appear with a wide commentary. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons presents an excellent picture of Antonio, a man who leaves his previous mistake. Lynn Collins, a relatively unknown, gives us absolutely flawless, stunning and detailed work like Portia. Ms. Collins is not beautiful - he also gives Portia layers and humor before judging what I have rarely seen in this game. the rest also makes a terrible job, which Kris Marshall is remarkable for Gratiano, and the fine work of Allan Corduner, like Tubal, playing foil on Shylock. Finally, when Al Pacino pulls out his usual strong (and loud) presentation, his best moments are when the camera focuses on him and he does not say words, but you see all the emotions and madness that flow in and out of him. his fortunes are changing. <br /> <br /> If you like time movies, I can't recommend this movie enough.
