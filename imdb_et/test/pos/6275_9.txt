Miles O'Keeffe will take on the role of a powerful Ator for the first time in his first film. <br /> <br /> What can I say? - It's pretty much B-Movie Nirvana! Type is ridiculous, script is terrible, actress is hammy collection, special effects .... well don't even go there! All this movie is a real joy! <br /> <br /> Ator and Thong (his silent companion, not his underwear), who are attacked by a cave with invisible caves (definitely saved in the budget of fx!), are at the forefront of the film, Ator fights for what must be the most convincing giant snake is ever dedicated to celluloid, and of course the infamous hanging scenes! <br /> <br /> I have one question, though I have ...... at the end of the movie we see a huge atomic explosion when Ator supposedly destroys the geometric core (as the narrator tells us). .. how in the hell did Ator destroy it and lead it out? Did he remember any primitive timer / detonator or anything? <br /> <br /> Well, this illogical ending really only adds to the overall charm of the movie - they just don't do it any more!
