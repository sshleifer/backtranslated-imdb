"Crossfire" is a seemingly mystery of murder, but what distinguishes it from other similar films in the period is the killer's motif, anti-Semitism. The story highlights examples of ignorance that heats the bigotry and contains references to the "mountain bear" and the Irish immigrant, who also suffered ill-treatment due to their ethnic origin. <br /> <br /> The plot is based on Richard Brooks's novel "Brick Foxhole", about hate crimes where the victim was gay. It is ironic that this story of intolerance should be intolerable to censors who showed that the included pattern habits should be turned into anti-Semitism in the screen version. The second irony is the soldier's behavior, which seems to be proudly proud of working in the war against the Nazis and yet against those Jews. The director and producer of this film also suffered from another type of intolerance when they were on the black list after being invited to the House Un-American Action Commission. All of these points simply emphasize that the problem of the big problem in this film is deeply rooted and complex. <br /> <br /> When police captain Finlay (Robert Young) investigates the murder of Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene), he discovers that at night when he was killed, Samuels was in contact with a group of soldiers and one of them, Corporal Arthur Mitch. "Mitchell (George Cooper) is the main suspect. Additional information is also gathered from Montgomery (Robert Ryan), another one of the soldiers and Sergeant Keeley (Robert Mitchum) who was in the evening, a friend of Mitchell. Keeley, with the help of another soldier, is looking for Mitchell and, when he finds him, hears his report on what he did at night, including a meeting with Ginny Grahame, the housewife of the dance halls. Keeley helps Michell avoid arrest and tries to identify the murderer. Ginny Tremaine is questioned, but her data are not enough to prove Mitchell's innocence, but Finlay's investigations led her to admit the motive of the crime, and then she puts a tricky trap leading to her own guilty. "Crossfire" is a movie with a message and the murderer's identity appears in the very early stages of the story. The "message" is transmitted in a way that was undoubtedly suitable for the period in which it was done, but today's standards seem to be quite difficult. J Roy Hunt's cinematic art is simply great because it is low-key lighting and creative use of many strategically positioned desk lamps that combine the look that fits perfectly with the drama played on the screen. <br /> <br /> Despite being a low-budget product, Crossfire was a great post office success and benefited from an absorbable and very relevant story with great pain, two nominated for the Academy's best-performing actor (Robert Ryan) and the best supportive actor. (Gloria Grahame). Further candidates for Dmytryk (best director), producer Adrian Scott (best picture) and John Paxton (Best Writing, Custom Scenario) are just additional evidence of the legitimate acceptance of this film.
