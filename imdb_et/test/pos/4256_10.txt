If you get the chance to get this lost (many years) gem, I doubt you are disappointed. PS has a strange mix of social satire and ultra-cool blaxploitation, even slapstick hints, but it's so strange that it wasn't just before it was seen. <br /> <br /> I strongly disagree with people who say the movie is dated, especially Spike Lee's "Bamboozaled" (SP?) a few years ago, which had failed to capture the same message. (Good filmmaking, scattered script.) <br /> <br /> The direction of Robert Downy is great, allowing many of his actors to improvise, the film gets better when it goes, and jokes are relaxing between a stroke or one liner being forgiven as they are found in the Mel Brooks comedy, not just a PC. I can't believe they just said 'fun. <br /> <br /> Favorite parts, ads. The film turns black and white images of the advertising agency into a beautiful (maybe 16 mm) color and disappears. <br /> <br /> I refuse tips for spoilers, but if you have the chance to see the DVD version and see the Downey interview (just leave it after the movie.) <br /> <br /> My vote 10/10 - the darkest film in the late 60s, early 70s. Thank you to the prince.
