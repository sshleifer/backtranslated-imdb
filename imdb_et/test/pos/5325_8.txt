In this movie, there are nuances that I think many people may miss if they are not careful. You really have to follow what Leland says, and read his character to find out why at the end of the movie. It's not sure it's not sure, that's what a single viewer takes out of it. I think it was a plan from get-go, people are not meant to all understand it in the same way, it's almost about forming their own personal relationship with Leland, so maybe you will feel him a little better. <br /> The story is interesting, but its summary can never explain what the movie really is. It's a dramatic and thought-provoking, many difficult ideas, but the pace of the movie is almost reassuring, even in the case of a more intense scene screaming. I think it's probably Leland, he's just calm and almost calm, even for all his sadness. The film is characterized by Leland as it is. <br /> <br /> Of course, it is enchanting and pulls you in when you shoot it, but there are some recycled ideas. I mean, Leland has a lot of impressive dialogue, he's nothing more than typical, but he's not a prophet. Everything she says is not a revelation, many people I know have mentioned the things she mentioned, even though I've seen some things she's been watching. Leland is a unique and attractive character, which is probably mostly for Ryan Gosling's portrayal. <br /> <br /> Finally, the actor is all extraordinary, there are no real bad guys, Leland's psychologically can't be judged. Maybe understand him and life a little better. <br /> <br /> Compared to Igby Goes Down, I think it's not comic, but like its general life.
