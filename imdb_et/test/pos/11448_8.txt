The eighties produce a lot of terrifying fears, most of which were within the slasher sub genre - this made the film a lot of the rest of the beauty. The Night of the Demons is a cross between the supreme gore of The Evil Dead; and haunted the house-cum-slash flick Hell Night. Such films usually characterize a robbed / deformed madman like a leading bad man; but here we have bloody demons that are always more interesting than crazy when you ask me. There are also many comedies in this film and the first third of the film can be a simple straight comedy film. But when the symbols enter the central position; Happy funeral home, known as the "Hull House" - the film breaks the horror film you are looking for with the title. The plot line is as simple as you would like it to be, and we follow a number of kids who decide to put Halloween in the party. However, this is a bad idea when it turns out that the house is there; And the demons are going to live in the body of children! Their only salvation is on the other side of the underground stream, but finding the gates on the ground is not as easy as it sounds. <br /> <br /> The centerpiece of the movie is the Gothic Manor, where action takes place. This old old house makes an excellent horror movie location; the fact that it used to be a funeral home, but added to it. Director Kevin Tenney puts the house in good shape and it is a great job to make sure the house is in the middle and the escape is difficult. The comedy of the beginning of the film is generally very funny and I was hoping it would start laughing at first. The film has moments of comedy when children enter Hull House, but it's never too funny and it's obvious that the main purpose of the film is horror. Not that this is a problem; but the night of demons could have been much better if these elements were properly blended. The characters are pretty much what you expect from such a movie; but the actors are well suited to the film and it is clear that the young person had a good time in making this film and it translates well on the screen. The effects are good because they fit well with the film and most death sequences are well executed; it is a good contribution that most people do not forget about watching. It's not classic and doesn't see a movie; but I can highly recommend it because it offers a good time and turns to foolish horror fans.
