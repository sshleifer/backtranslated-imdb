The "snow queen" is, of course, based on the same name as the fairy tale, which has been collected (at least) in Andersen's fairy tales - and unlike many other fairy-tale productions, this Faerie spirit is retained, the achievement is not easy and understandable to many, especially among Americans. Speaking of animals, arbitrary bans, goblins, dragon and demon appearances are not interviewed in the fairytale; they are just as natural a Faerie element as they say that gravity is in the scientific world, and their cause or explanation is completely beside the story. Nor is it related to the modern Hollywood composition rules: straightforward, often smaller work grotesque linear and obvious (at least retrospectively). <br /> <br /> The common criticism of those who do not understand fairy tales is the magnificent film of a snow queen with excellent visual effects, a skillful actor and a great mood. The only drawback in the film was, in my opinion, not that it was too fantastic, but that certain parts of the dialogue were sluggishly modern and sluggish, otherwise timeless in nature.
