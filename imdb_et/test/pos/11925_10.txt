Summary of the book: Boy, Billy Tepper, about 12 years old, is the school's main distress and, if he gets out of school, he's sent off to school. His dear boyfriend in Switzerland (or somewhere else) goes over the Arab terrorists, why I'm not quite sure. Billy has no friends and likes to hack his laptop in his school database. With the help of two teachers, he prevents terrorists' plans and saves the whole school. The book was not bad, but it was so good that it was so. <br /> <br /> Now from the movie; they exchanged Arab terrorists against Cuban terrorists and made Billy 17 years old and head of his group of friends. They want to get into trouble, but ordinary teenage things. This movie was plausible. Maybe not realistic, but the characters are real. You can watch Billy, Joey and the rest of the boys and see the real kids who act as they did (or at least wanted). <br /> <br /> Great Scenes. Not everyone goes as planned on either side. Crossing the terrorists was dirty and the good guys got hurt. I'm not telling who, but it's heartbreaking (I know I'm using this word a lot). Sean Astin is great. As a teenager, he usually played the best friend. This movie once again proved that he could play a leading man, a child. The only show that might have been his design was Wil Wheaton, who was the only son of a Mafia man in New Jersey. He hated his father and everything he stood for. (Far from Wesley Crusher) Typically, this is a movie genre that I watch for the purpose of the soul to entertain; but not Toy Soldiers. The story line flows, the dialogue is usually plausible. I can't think of a moment when I found myself on the TV shouting "Oh, that wouldn't happen" A big movie that should be in everyone's collection.
