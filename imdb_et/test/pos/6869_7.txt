There's not a lot of plot for this movie. There's a rich baseball team owner who dies and whose wife goes to hospital for neglect. Not much more than that, but .... It doesn't matter! <br /> <br /> It doesn't matter because you have some real actors who give you a dialogue on life, and because you have hysterically funny scenes and even if you don't laugh, you have a smile on your face. <br /> <br /> Matthau plays with Charleys, whose wife recently died, and who finds herself in the hospitals for more women. She is delighted to taste everything in her menu. Then he meets Anne Atkinson (Glenda Jackson), who at first is a patient in the hospital (their first scene is very funny) and will meet again in the television panel discussions where they disagree with almost every topic being discussed. <br /> <br /> Charley, like Anne, and vice versa, except that she is a very monogamy of her husbands (her husband was a scammer) and they decide to defeat him - two faithfulness. <br /> <br /> I don't give anything else, but I want to mention the chemistry that Matthau and Jackson have on the screen. Usually she is not the first person to think about romantic, middle-aged comedy, but her touch with comedy is very light and pleasant. Matthau, who is more charming than ever, responds to him at every step. He doesn't have to play Mr. Sensitit or Mr. Machot to get a girl, he just has to be himself. <br /> <br /> Art Carney is a rebellion that he is practically a senile doctor. The scene where the ash of the baseball team owner is buried is invaluable. He also has a very funny scene at the car park with Richard Benjamin. Richard does not have much work to do in this film and more often than just Carney and Matthau; his role does not charge his remarkable talents, but he had to do this comedy. Highly recommended ... 8/10 <br /> <br /> PS. FYI - Matthau presented Jackson as his first actress with Oscar and Jackson presented Art Carney with the best actor for his role in 'Harry & Tonto'.
