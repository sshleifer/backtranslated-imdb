Beautiful movie. One that made me think of God, but I don't feel guilty or overwhelmed. I was thinking about death, but not afraid of it, think about life, but not hide it. A movie that gave love to everyone that I stand and at the same time condemned it to deeper devils. A film that made me think about love and all that I have lost, but for some sadness my eyes are not relaxed for some strange reason. Child, god and theater of two worlds. And a good bit of wine and irony! I recommend the most ***** <br /> <br /> "If S *** hits the fans, get a tent" Oh and we should all go camping. Everyday.
