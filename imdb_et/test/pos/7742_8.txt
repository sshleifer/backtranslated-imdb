I can't tell you what the source of this movie is, but it's one of my favorite films from Paul Mazursk (director and co-author). This is the withdrawal of Shakespeare's "comedy" but completely removed from the performance. Without touching a lot of text, Mazursky and Star Cassavettes make a visual and passionate crisis. Desperate for Cassavettes to turn around, he goes back to an island in Greece, where the locals and the island themselves knit little magic. Especially with Raul Julia, Susan Sarandon and Molly Ringwald, this is an adult fantasy that is emotionally satisfying and visually proud. And funny. It wasn't a big post office, but when it comes to DVD it sells it.
