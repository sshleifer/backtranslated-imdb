Nemesis Game is a peaceful film full of puzzles, death, understanding and philosophy. In the simplest sense, searching for answers is a movie and what happens when you finally find them. Finding answers leads Sarah Novaki along the path that becomes darker when it becomes more weighty. The final answer seems more dangerous than it is worth, but Sarah is so close that she understands it. What would you do if you were offered the opportunity to finally understand the chaos of life? <br /> <br /> The film was written and directed by Jesse Warn. Although it was Warni's first feature film, the film does not reflect it at all, but shows the story and the artistic approach to the story. The Carly Pope was a powerful leader and showed the depth of complexity that was interesting to watch. I would certainly like to see more of my work. <br /> <br /> It is based on puzzles, it is a very crazy movie. It's your thing, because it's mine, I suggest you see the Nemesis game completely. Rating: 4.5 / 5
