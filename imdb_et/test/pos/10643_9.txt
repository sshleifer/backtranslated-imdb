After reading the last Russian Tsar (Nikolai II) biography and his inability to support the army, I decided to try this movie. <br /> <br /> I looked at it completely open, not knowing it (except its reputation). <br /> <br /> These are the most impressed things. <br /> <br /> 1) Ship battles and soldiers who use attachments. More than once I stopped thinking "if it happened at that time and place, 80% of it would have been created on the computer". <br /> <br /> 2) Realism in it. This film does not give any concessions to computer-based concessions that originate from flesh-infected flesh with a sailor and his candle and legend "For the Soaked Soup". br /> <br /> 3) The slow descent of the Odessa sequence of steps is crazy. From the first fire, when a limbless man appears, you get the idea that may be wrong; As general shots are made, you will feel comfortable in your surroundings. Then amputee appears and people start to fall dramatically. However, the shots ... until the Cossacks appear in the scene and incredible shooting spots appear. This scene is easily worth the entrance price. <br /> <br /> 4) The fact that this movie is 100% unattended propaganda. When Rambo fought in Afghanistan, he had something to do with "propaganda"; only different. <br /> <br /> In summary: a film that is mixed with a bit of a slow narrative. However, Metropolis, Dr. Caligar's cabinet and this film are the perfect examples of inventive, frightening films that are remembered today for their benefits. They make really modern movies eternal and repetitive.
