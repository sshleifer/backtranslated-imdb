In 1982, two films appeared in two weeks, both foreigners. Steven Spielberg ET and John Carpenter's Thing. Two of them were ETs who won the hearts of people all over the world, although Thing debuted for the first time. As people were so strange about Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feeling of good stranger fable, they stayed away from Thing droves. <br /> <br /> It's not hard to see why. These two are contradictory. One of them is an optimistic story, which is still meant for warming up the heartbeat. The second is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints an alien's life as something that has purely decided to destroy us. I think the audience felt that ET was a much nicer prospect than the Thing tentacles and slippery saliva! As it should. Because The Thing is a rare example of a better remake. It takes into account all of the best 1951 classic features and recovers them amazingly and creatively. Indeed, Carpenter does his job so well that he succeeds in making a film that is equal to the actor Alien in every piece. And it's even rarer! <br /> <br /> Carpenter's film follows the source material more precisely than The Thing From Another World. This keeps the Antarctic cold waste in settings, as it is the perfect background when you try to create an elevated sense of isolation. However, although the characterization is a bit thin, the transformation can correct the participants' mindset and amplify the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds them. Escape from New York, throw another one of Carpenter's eternal anti-heroes. He is playing a helicopter pilot at MacReady, an Antarctic research station (which they are investigating, somebody thought). The problem begins when Norwegian chopper from a nearby station travels over MacReady, trying to push Siberian Husky into the air. the mystery of what happened, they take the husky and add it to it. Except that this Husky is not at all Husky. But the shape-changing alien. The Norwegians discovered it frozen in ice and when they melted it, he killed his team. Able to absorb its victims intentionally, it can duplicate a living entity to the smallest detail. Soon paranoia and suspicion will work through a 12-man team until someone is sure who is the person and who is not. <br /> <br /> Thing is one of John Carpenter's best films. In fact, I am tempted to say the best movie he has ever done. Even crossing the classics like Halloween and Dark Star. The reason I put Thing at the top of Carpenter's list is that it seems to be his last film that could really be called a classic. All others have felt that Carpenter is slipping it. Films that did not flow with cool complexities and dirty intensities in their earlier works. <br /> <br /> But Thing was at the top of John Carpenter's mandate. He has never caused such an unbearable degree. Not even in the wilderness attack in church district 13. On the other hand, the alien knows his presence, Carpenter relentlessly pulls up the relaxed level. And when he shoots his punches, they come agonizing. <br /> <br /> Film is a mixture of pure atmosphere and visceral horror. Approach, which can often conflict with each other, but Carpenter's hands up nicely. Bringing Rob Bottini to The Howling's fame, he puts some of the most amazing transformation effects you will ever see in the horror movie. Amorphous shapes. The semi-shaped human functions contrast with sharp jaws, spiders and fully flexible tentacles. Indeed, the effects of the film are so amazing and harsh inducing, Thing came under fire because it is too realistic! <br /> <br /> This type of thinking is completely lost from this point. This only makes the movie values ​​short. And there are many. Carpenter will only take effect when he needs it. It is in the quieter moments of the film, where it seems to be a particular story. Thing is often puzzled by the story of shadows, whisperings, and consequences. Characterization has never been one of John Carpenter's strong costumes, but it works in front of him. Because we hardly know anything about the pain, it only makes the current situation more confusing. We are never sure, from one moment to another who is who. That's why The Thing keeps it very well and keeps its secrets in later views. <br /> <br /> Special mention should go to Ennio Morricone's great movie point. A pulsating tummy every two seconds. This creates a terrible and horrible feeling that is very difficult to shake. The whole film is an excellent training for paranoid manipulation. The scene where they take blood samples to see who the person is, finishes Carpenter, you can find your nails without biting even without realizing it. <br /> <br /> Thing is a pure classic class. Even the end ends with a vague suspicion that everything is not resolved. The undervalued film that is worth re-evaluating it. And so much better than ET!
