I've never seen a movie to make it worse. And it's a shame because it's a more fun movie of the year! You think that an ad with a series of "Office Space Directors" would be enough to justify a big release! But there are no ads, no posters, no website, I doubt the stars even knew it came out this weekend. What is 20th Century Fox Thinking? Mike Judge's Sci-Fi comedy is set to 2505, but it can rise for about ten years (when things continue as they are.) Luke Wilson and Maya Rudolph are frozen in the ultimate secret army experiment and will wake up in the future with zombie inbred retarded consumers . The film reminds me of Woody Allen's "Sleeper", "RoboCop", "Apeside Planet", "Blade Runner" and "Network" and the late "Futurama". Try to see it before Fox burns all the prints!
