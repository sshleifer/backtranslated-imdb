"House Call" is a wonderful romantic comedy that can best be described as "how they did them." He marks Walter Matthau (one of his best roles) as a recently-recruited doctor who goes back to the dating scene and hits Paydirt because he seems to have a different woman every night. He then meets Glenda Jackson with a hospital patient and will be in touch with him soon. But this is one that has been seriously tested when he tells him that he is one man and expects him to be one woman. <br /> <br /> This is a sweet, very funny movie featuring Art Carney. Senior Hospital Administrator and Richard Benjamin Matthau Friend and Associate. It must see every Matthau fan or a light comedy fan. <br /> <br /> You don't have to be disappointed.
