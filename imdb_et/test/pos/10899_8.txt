"Lonely among us" is definitely one of the best first season episodes. The story, though somewhat confusing, creates a lot of tension, supported by a horrible synthesizer-controlled soundtrack. This is typically a "foreign body invasion" scenario, but ultimately it does not turn to an evil goal (death of Chief Engineer Singh for me was an accident). Two delegate species offer an entertaining frame (best make-up), finally adding a small humor to the series (the last scene). Apparently, Patrick Stewart enjoys a bit of his Picard's character and explores the new landscape as Data, like Sherlock Holmes (the second all-time classic). Special effects are also convincing and Director Cliff Bole did his job well. He is the first to try to compensate for Trois's lack of ability to act by improving his appearance. She looks beautiful in some scenes and her dress neck improves her appearance. Picard's "lightning scene" on the bridge gives him a light Star Wars "Jedi Return" (which is a personal impression but made me smile). <br /> <br /> There are also some games to illuminate the corridors (simulating the night ship) and the first moving camera by pulling back from Picard when he enters the truck space to get into the cloud ... Nice work. Clever clipping, continuous dialogue through different scenes (Troi Hypnosis Report) rounds the impression of a truly well-prepared TNG episode. The first where even Wesley Crusher seemed almost tolerable ... <br /> <br /> The end is a bit confusing, as if the producers were out of date. "P for Picard" is a little farther away and his return is too easy, but it can be set aside for many of the strong moments that this episode offers.
