This is definitely an excellent show. I don't have a cable, so I started to rent them because my friend suggested it. I thought it would be a teenage soap. But it wasn't. It is surprisingly deep. It's also very witty. It moves very fast and you are more and more kidding every time you watch it. It's a comedy-drama that's rarely done. Rory and Lorelai Relationships. Instead of the classic mother-daughter relationship, this is the best friend relationship - about mother and daughter. The characters are completely cast and everyone is doing a great job. This is definitely the best TV show I've ever met.
