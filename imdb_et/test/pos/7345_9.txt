This film deals with the issues of loss, personal struggle, and transformation in an intelligent, artistic, sensitive and visually stunning way that I was completely spent on. It's a rare gem of the film, respecting beauty and women. You have to see yourself. Dreya Weber (Jane) masterfully reveals the nuances of a remarkable, if not somewhat broken, personality, so that every woman associates. I found that the honesty of the emotional communication of the characters is very refreshing and deeply involved. There was nothing in this movie that told me about "low budget". Something. The fact that it is a low budget film is a tribute to the film's creators. The final order at the time of credit also knocks your socks. This is a brilliant celebration of Jane's choice. Unexpected and inspirational.
