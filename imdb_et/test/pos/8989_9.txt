Now, I understand that most of the people here in the YOUNG WARRIORS trash or shark it "so bad are funny" entertainment, but let me do something clear: this is actually a high quality small rental activity when you are ready to watch it in the cinema without a critical glance. In fact, it is more interesting and meaningful to provocate than the biggest part of the 80's feature film. <br /> <br /> The key is the movie theme. I am always a mammalian filmmaker who is vigilant, especially when they are purposefully trying the psychics of the involved characters. YOUNG WARRIORS may not have the intelligence or sensitivity of the first DEATH WISH movie (and yes, I think they both had these elements), but it is trying to be different from Cannon's filmmakers. a period when it is truly unique. <br /> <br /> Plot is simple (don't worry, there is no spoiler): A group of college students in a prankster will change their way if one of their family members is attacked by a tough street gang. Pupils go to the streets to fight the general street crime, not knowing who is responsible. Eventually, they acquire heavy artillery (machine guns and grenades) and stay overnight at night. But these are not Schwarzenegger species; they are vulnerable, inexperienced beginners who do almost every time they clean up the city (usually with their secret mascot). Eventually, they find out who the gang is and follow them, but then you don't expect a normal peak where good guys are walking unsuccessful. <br /> <br /> One thing that hit me about the film as strange, but effective, is that most of the first law doesn't suggest that we see any action or violence later, because it is treated like a funny frat comedy, what you see in the US overnight (where I believe it was actually shown at one point). The comedy structure really lied to me, forgetting that the VHS cover showed a man who was driving a motorcycle-mounted machine. When violence finally comes, it's not fun or cute at all ... it's shockingly annoying. From that moment on, the film becomes a full-blooded, uncompromising action yarn that contains some amazing armed forces and gore. <br /> <br /> Functional, though special, is much more patient than I expected. James Van Patten, who plays the protagonist, gives everything and his performance is surprisingly good for this film. The rest is equally invested, including always sure Ernest Borgnine as the hero's police father. Cinematic art is also above the parameter, and the scenes of action are dealt with in a degree of difficulty that I did not expect personally. <br /> <br /> I understand why some people thought this movie was worthless as much as it was an extremely big date, but these aspects hit me cool and self. Van Patten's character is studying animation and his apparently 80's style work, featured in several scenes, is a psychedelic wet dream of a retrofilm lover. I'm sure most modern viewers would quote them in very short moments in the movie, but I disagree. Also, Joe Walsh's soundtrack - which seems to have been recorded only in '83 - seemed especially suitable and enjoyable, no matter how "old" it seems today. <br /> <br /> YOUNG WARRIORS is one of my favorite 80s active films, and I would like every person interested in the genre to look out. Unfortunately, however, it is only released by VHS at the time of writing and is not shown on these days on television. A nice DVD presentation would make me moon-walk around my living room with such intensity that I'm sure my ankles will swell. In the meantime, I ask you all to go to eBay or Amazon and bind ten bucks or whatever on the old big box tape. This is indeed a remarkable cover for an ambitious trash.
