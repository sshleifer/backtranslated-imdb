watch this movie. this is really a good ride through the difficulties of making an indie movie and what happens when it blows in the film maker. there are many things about punk rock and the philosophy of its movement, and that connection to this project. so if you are an old punk american punk then you miss it .... but, be careful, there are a lot of bits in the wrong project, but they are funny from time to time. and, in fact, some of the best parts listen to people who have never participated in the pontificate of film making and who they passed through the three-year period he took. so anyone who is there to make a movie, especially if you haven't worked in a film school or worked in the field, should watch it and learn from the filmmaker's mistakes.
