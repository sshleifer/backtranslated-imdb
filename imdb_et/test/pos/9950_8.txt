This is a precious movie from my childhood !! I can still hug a hat on the hat! I remember getting late to watch this movie with my dad, usually two to three times a year. We always called it a "huge robot". Although the effects of this film are crude oil compared to today's standards, they fit the genre of this film. I am also a big fan of Japanese "Monster" movies, so this movie fell with others. It's been years since I've seen this movie and love to get my hands on this copy to share my 8-year-old daughter.
