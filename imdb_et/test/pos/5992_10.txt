Romuald et Juliette is one of the French romantic comedies where they seem to be breaking all the rules, like Trop Belle Pour Toi. Gorgeous Daniel Auteuil learns about true loyalty and love when his life threatens to fall over his ear. The film is not a story of preaching morality, but an excellent story that keeps you until the end of the last. The Richard (like Juliette) is a heroine that women rejoice - her laughter is my lasting memory of this warm and spiritual film. The underground way he has involved all his children with his parents - especially birthdays - gives the film an edge that raises it to its average romantic comedy. But it is always a Frenchman who seems to us showing how easy it is!
