In movie comedy, there is a running thread that all the big comics are just out of the law or going to jail. Think that this conman W.C.Fields is old fashioned, or Marx's brothers in the evening at OPERA, or Chaplin ADVENTURER, Mae West of SHE DONE HIM WRONG. The skirting of the law is inevitable, and when they reach the law, the results are actually hostile between law enforcement forces and comics. Think about Lloyd's first speech, WELCOME DANGER, trying to "help" the San Francisco Police Department in the midst of a wave of crime and make police Sergeant Edgar Kennedy want to kill him. Think of Laurel and Hardy as MIDNIGHT PATROL criminals. I find that such hostility is so patented in all these gigantic (and their peers) comedy that even its counterfeit title deals with it. Think of Jerry Seinfeld as one episode of his series, creating a short short Stooges, the SAPPY PAPPIES, where boys are accused of murder. <br /> <br /> Buster Keaton often pulls his opponents in his comedies to the legal forces. Look, STEAMBOAT BILL, JR., Where he's trying to let his father caliber. But he had more conflicts with the police in his shorts. In CONVICT 13, he is pulled back to prison when he is convicted of a convicted offender. In COPS (the perfect title - if you see it as understood), the great city police force repeatedly searches for Keaton, who has been mistaken for a terrorist. And in GOAT, he can't prevent most of the movies. <br /> <br /> Keaton is a tramp just looking for food. But he's totally unhappy. If he sees a stranger throw a happy horseshoe (which Keaton had previously ignored) over his shoulder and then found the wallet's purse, Keaton would try the same thing and hit the police head. The police officer chases and Keaton (as happiness does) runs to another police force, attempts to operate normally, but ends up throwing the second policeman on the first track. Soon he will have three police officers pursuing him. Shaking briefly, he walks out of a local prison window where a local murderer "Dead Shot Dan" (Malcolm St. Clair *) is photographed. At the back of the limited windows, Keaton is stupid enough to stop and watch immediately. Desperado notes it and ducks in making a picture. When Dead Shot escapes from the police, it's on Keaton's face on all the poster you want. <br /> <br /> (* St. Clair would eventually be a successful leader in quiet and early comedies, though his later biography would be in Fox in the 20th century, where his work with Laurel & Hardy was down.) Keaton flees by train another city (subtracting passenger cars from the locomotive and its offerings). This is a movie (by the way) with two famous Keaton jokes. His arrival to the locomotive takes place far, approaching and closer, and suddenly the audience sees Keaton sitting on a cow guard. The second famous sequence goes later (and may have affected Chaplin somewhat at the beginning of CITY LIGHTS). Keaton was accidentally knocked by a man who claimed to be too violent with a dog (Virginia Fox). If he sees the poster as a murderer calling him, he thinks he killed the man. In this city, he is being held by a suspicious police officer (Joe Roberts) and loses Robert for a moment in the park. Build a "Warrior" shape and the sculptor will open the horse's clay pattern. Keaton is held on a clay model, trying to preserve his dignity when the horse's claws begin to collapse under his weight. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Keaton can meet pretty Mrs. Fox, who calls her home for dinner. Only he does not realize that his father is Roberts. The movie Keaton will flee over the last five minutes and avoid Roberts when he and Fox come together. <br /> <br /> This is a funny comedy and a great example of Keaton's work at his best.
