Every movie that offers Bonnie Hunt, Sarah Silverman and Amy in Sedar-supporting pains, needs to be well looked at, and the comic actor Jeff Garlin takes advantage of the 2007 talent for the debut of talented talent, a sad-comedy comedy overweight man who knows the world around you. Familiar with Larry David's leader, Jeff "Curb Your Enthusiasm", Garlin James, who is still fighting, is a 39-year-old Chicago actress who still lives with her widow's mother. His self-esteem is so low that he can't meet women, but it's a comic way he looks at his unified status, making his dilemma. If the story sounds a little familiar, it's because the film is partly a tribute to the 1955 Ernest Borgnine classic "Marty" about a lonely Bronx butcher who lives with his hostile mother. In fact, Garlin uses "Marty" as a game James has desperately made, because he is so empathetic to the character's situation. <br /> <br /> Of course, this new millennium version has a love story, and Silverman plays Beth, a sexually persuasive ice cream parlor that takes her to the underwear shopping trolley. Their best scene is in her favorite shop, where they improvise different characters in different passages. Hunt plays a lone basic school teacher who shares the passion with James jazz musician Ben Webster. They meet randomly in a store and then in their career days at their school, where they reveal their sexual neuroses in front of classrooms, including their best friend Luca's girlfriend Penelope (playing a child sister Elle like Dakota Fanning). Sedar plays an advisor at school to talk to James after his inappropriate monologue. David Pasques is played by Lucat, the head of the retirement home, and his scenes with Garlin are a light rapport that makes their friendship credible. Almost a movie stealing is a character designer Mina Kolb, who plays James's tiny mother with her heart and heart. the structure is funny), as well as the bits made by the director Paul Mazursky (like the honest camera-type exhibition "Smear Job"), Tim Kazurinsky (as an unsuspecting victim of this exhibition) and Dan Castellaneta (as the owner of a tough love affair). Garlin's comic sensitivity resembles his insecure and confident competitions for Albert Brooks, and the random dialogue best reminds me of "Modern Romance" and "Your Life". One of the constant problems I had with the film is the momentum, because some scenes were pulled out longer than necessary. The problem is clearer in the first half, when Garlin tries to create the right pace and the lack of a real conflict increases the slack. Regardless of what he does well, the desperation is that the revelation that life is not what it is supposed to be is remarkable that a significant second may be inaccessible and that the constant diet of junk food is the hood of the car. a sure thing when it comes to joy.
