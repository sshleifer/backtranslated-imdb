This film was literally rolling on the floor (at least on the couch). I didn't think I wanted to, but it came to cable TV one afternoon, and I looked at the whole thing and enjoyed myself thoroughly. Since then I have also seen a Black Sheep that was pretty good but not non-stop-funny like Tommy Boy.
