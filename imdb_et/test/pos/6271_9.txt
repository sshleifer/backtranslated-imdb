This movie, Blade Master, can be a cheap, cumbersome look and sometimes it does share thoughts about the problems that are beyond the time this movie is set up. Ator is chosen to protect the earth from a terrible weapon that is compared to an atomic weapon in an unforgettable and unpredictable way. He passes barriers as a wise character who is just more than a muscle power, although he has a lot. I would say that this aspect of the film changes the film like Conan, the barbarian, which is the least I can say, quite useless. It does not in any way diminish the great adventure movie that Conan has, but it gives Ator his health that he doesn't have with the barbarian. In a film with a lower budget, this movie is good for setup and the struggles are mostly plausible. Kaabakas Zor is one of the most interesting psychological confrontations with the prisoner in the film, which gives the film tension, even if Ator seems too fit to lose the task. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie a little extra is those scenes that may seem terrible, but worth noting. The struggle with the snake god, although he is a giant doll, is well handled, as the snake, with good flashes, remains a silhouette and the struggle is quite convincing. The film ends up in the most unusual way, quite anachronically, but breathtakingly: in delta planning. The scene itself has not been properly presented, it does not read at all where Ator got this machine, it is quite convincing, but it brings a truly poetic and beautiful smell, which is an independent, culmination point of the film, raising the Ator's place where there have been few human fantasy heroes. <br /> <br /> If Blade Master is not among the great fantastic movies of all time, it is no surprise because of its absence, it is a greater surprise given the philosophical way in which he chooses good and evil confrontation, the truth tells us and the heart shows that this movie is so unfair. I recommend it to fans of each genre and try it seriously as an intelligent movie that needs to be taken seriously as it seems.
