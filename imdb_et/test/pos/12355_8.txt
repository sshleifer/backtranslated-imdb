Sheba Baby is another Pam Grieri Blaxploitation film. It was one of Pami's less visceral films about this genre. Pam plays Sheba Shane, a Chicago elastic band. Sheba's father is a small loan company owner in Missouri. When local mobsters try to lead their father's father, Sheba goes to the bad guys. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier had already marked Blaxploitation in the movies when Sheba Baby came. Both Coffy and Foxy Brown fans know that Pam is capable of acting as an actor. Sheba Baby was not so obvious in the film that the viewers had been waiting for Pam. Not that Pam doesn't hit Sheba Baby. He's not just the kidnappers of a robbed train as he was in his previous Blaxploitation films. <br /> <br /> Supporting this movie is clearly disappointing. This is how Sheba's Baby Pam movie is out and out. And while Pam is a bit more modest than his other films, he still gives weighty results at Sheba Baby. This movie is definitely worth your while when you're a terrific Pam Grier fan.
