Far less and less on stage and the link between Gene Saks's previous efforts in Barefoot Park (67) and a strange pair (68), the cactus flower is not a work of art, but rather a comparison with most tired quarries. 60 is like an apartment, how to kill your husband, say goodbye to Charlie, guide Marrried Man, Divorce, American style, every Wednesday, Kiss Me Stupid, Boys Night Out, this is a masterpiece. Director Saks and writer I.A.L. Diamond has actually "kicked off" Abe Burrows' Broadway and the movie is very useful for New York's location-taking and great performances from Ingrid Bergman and Goldie Hawn. Bergman is charming, looks good and shows comedy. Hawn has never been better or more attractive in her Oscar winning role. Matthau is OK, though it is hard to believe that Hawn's character would be so pleasing to her. Looking back, Hawn's suicide attempt at the beginning of the movie is non-existent and incredible. Nonetheless, the film is a credible farcical, and when it goes it creates a laugh. Rick Lenz, Jack Weston, Eve Bruce and Vito Scotti offer good support. The movie is pleasant and fun, and Hawn and Bergman will take care of you.
