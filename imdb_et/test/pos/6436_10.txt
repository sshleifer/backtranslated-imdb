I remember this movie in 1981 when I was 7. It was absolutely brilliant! I found a few months ago on a DVD. I was almost jumping up and down! I bought it and showed it to my children. They also loved it. They asked what words the horse sang (I didn't tell them because I don't think the words "gay" and "ecstasy" for 6-year-olds are very good parenting). The songs are great. I still remember them. I still remember them when I'm 60 years old! There or nearby. Tommy Pender is such a great actor. I'm sorry he gave it. <br /> <br /> If you find a movie, buy BUY! You love it!
