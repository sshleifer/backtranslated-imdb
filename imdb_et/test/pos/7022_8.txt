Great music, great dancing, sexy star (Swayze) and real sexual desire of a female character (very unusual event!). You rarely see female characters who are motivated mainly by lust and this is a nice change. I also think that the film captures what a teenager wants to do, dealing with class problems and creating ideals unexpectedly against reality. Of course, this is a nice moment - it's movie music, but all in all, it's a joy - fun romance and also politically lit. This movie also has one of the favorite musicians: "I spent watermelons."
