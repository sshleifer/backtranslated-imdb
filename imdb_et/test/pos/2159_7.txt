Night Beer is a sold B-style action movie. Take life and grow people. Don "Dragon" Wilson is a kick boxer (Hall of Fame), not an actor. If you are looking for an Oscar, this is not your brother. Looking for a kick ass action movie with a lower budget, that's it. The plot line may be a bit thin, but what B film is not. I understand that everyone is a critic and how a man's junk is a treasure of another man. Real people, evaluating every movie, just like an Oscar competitor, is just stupid. Awesome fighting scenes, mixed with new twist vampire moves. See if your fan, rent something other than your hate.
