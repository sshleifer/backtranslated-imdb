This movie was incredible! Looking at a big budget, but I felt cordial and original like Indie. The most striking feature of this film was the key role of David Beazely, Mark Hildreth and Paul Anthony in his amazing performances. She wore this film lightly, balancing humor and charisma with a huge depth. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was really beautiful, although some subjects were pretty ugly. In this way, it was not very realistic, but it should not have been a bigger point. It was really a great sight in this, too, Alan Cumming. The script was tight and moved very well with some of the best faces I've seen for a while. <br /> <br /> Go look at it.
