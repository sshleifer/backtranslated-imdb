Written, staged and staged by Charlie Chaplin, this is a great actor's act of anti-Nazi propaganda that drove Adolf Hitler. <br /> <br /> Chaplin plays Adenoid Hynckel, a Tomania dictator, as well as a Jewish hairdresser who is a Hynckel spit. His parody of Hitler is great. Anyone who has ever seen Hitler's talks recognizes the shameful similarity of the cartoon. <br /> <br /> I thought the film was slowly going to the beginning, with a typical Chaplin lollipop focusing on the Jewish hairdresser's first world war adventure. If I've never seen it, then I have to admit that after the first 20 minutes or so I thought what all the noise was. But the film quickly takes steam. There are some very funny moments and enough emphasis on the anti-Jewish nature of "Hynckel-ism" to make a propaganda point. The climax of the film is the brilliant anti-Nazi speech that Chaplin gave at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> As good as Chaplin is in this movie, but I thought the whole thing was stolen by Jack at Oakie, playing the "Bacteria" dictator - "Benzino Napaloni." Our first look at Oakie shows how well he had studied his subject - he had a mysterious surprise from Mussolini. The scenes in which Hynckel and Napaloni "Osterlich" negotiated the fate were in my stitches. <br /> <br /> It was a very good movie and it's worth watching.
