Blind and Blind Sets, an exciting music that cuts through your spin, such as aknife (or razor), perfect for cast, run by Broadway greats Hearn and Lansbury. This is an exciting theater that has been flawlessly transferred to a small screen. Sondheim is our oldest talented songwriter and Todd is his masterpiece, from Brechtia's opening ballad to the darkly humorous final I - "The Little Priest", where Lovett and Todd fantasize for the victims who finish their meat pies, this game never ends, excitement and satisfaction . Betsy Joslyn stands out as Johann, even if she's playing a little crazy. Edmund Lyndeck becomes a lust as a corrupt judge who craves after Joslyn and is Todd's brother. Lansbury and Hearn command show, because only two big actors / stars can do. Other music highlights include Todd's "Johanna" Lovetti's "London's Worst Pies" and II's "GOD GOOD GOOD", and this is the title to describe this production!
