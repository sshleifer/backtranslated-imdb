Having grown up as a child from Phenix City, I know many local people in the movie, so for me it's like a memory lane to see "Phenix City Story" again. In fact, my granduncle in this one of the first scene. Uncle Drew is a Hawaiian shirt that lets his chair get to know the singer / stripper. <br /> <br /> If you weren't there, like Mr. Page and I both, you didn't get it. The New York Reviewer calls John Patterson's racist, probably without ever meeting Mr. Patterson or his father. And what is your point of raising Mr Patterson's employment? It has nothing to do with the movie you probably look through. How in the world can you sit down or understand them or this movie if you've probably gone beyond the Bronx south? It has been my experience that people who do this are just trying to feel the moral superiority of the people in the movie. According to most of the time records, both Mr. Pattersons were basically good and decent men. Their families were respectable people, as were most of the people who lived in Phenix City. <br /> <br /> By the way, why is it so hard for people living in the south to believe that they are good and decent even in the small towns of Alabama? And why do they assume that all the people living in the small southern part are racist? My parents lived there and still, they didn't endure it in our household. Others did not tolerate this, but the myth that everything is racist in the south lives through deliberate ignorance of others. <br /> <br /> The film itself is simple and direct. It's not the whole story --- Hollywood added some sensationality to the film. Part of it was completely targeted. Its other parts border on fairy tales. And if this is the source someone uses to make the decision of the people of the small southern cities, they have to grasp and understand what most of us do - it's just a film.
