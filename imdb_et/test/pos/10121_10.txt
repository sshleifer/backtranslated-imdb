This is a very moving film about life itself. The challenges faced by people with disabilities in a land of perfection bring to the forefront everything to see and hopefully understand. It should teach society that we are all human, and while some of us are talented with heart, mind and good body, there are decent people in the world who are not so happy or maybe we are. failed. We do not always see the beauty of the world because we are packed in our blind ambitions and see it only in one light that this world can do for me! Maybe we all want to be like a Radio, a loving happy person ... who loves everyone.
