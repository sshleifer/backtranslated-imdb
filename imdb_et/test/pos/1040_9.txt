Has anyone found a way to buy copies of this series yet? I see many people have asked, but I can't tell if any of them have been successful. It is hard to believe that today people cannot watch this series, especially those based on the real problems that real people face in both tense and exciting times in our country. How can this be true and what can we change? Aside from this, I agree with all the comments made by other writers on this website about this series. This is a great story of what everyone should know today and know something about. Many of us saw this series when we were in college or around that time. Now we want to share it with our children ... but we can't? If this is true, what would be the good written materials that would deliver the same information?
