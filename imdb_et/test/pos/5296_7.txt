Inspired by Disney, Ponyo is Japan's animation master at Ponyo's sea border, Hayao Miyazaki's next great work after the enthusiastic competition in 2001 and Howl's moving castle in 2004. animation of fantasy worlds and children's characters is again visible. <br /> <br /> Sosuke (Hiroki Doi), the boy's boyfriend, is discovering a glass jar trapped in a gold fish that plays by the sea below the rock. . She is above and beyond her mother Lisa (Tomoko Yamaguchi). Sosuke shakes the jar vigorously to try to get out of the "goldfish", but the little goldfish is stuck. He then tries to pull it out, but it just can't get rid of it. Sosuke then puts the jar on the ground before breaking a small stone, breaking its pieces instantly while the finger is small. He then consciously checks whether the 'goldfish' is still alive. As he observes, "goldfish" reacts when the blood slips suddenly. Excited, Sosuke rushes quickly to the house and puts a "goldfish" in a small bucket in the hope that it will survive. He did it and he called it "Ponyo" (Yuria Nara). <br /> <br /> The scene above shows what needs to be done for the rest of the movie. This is the result of the interaction between Sosuke and Ponyo. And Hayao Miyazaki did it carefully when shooting. He must be attentive and understand how the children behave before he depicts the chemistry of communication between the two main characters. Children's behavior would extend to the rest of the film at their additional meetings. <br /> <br /> Sosuke and Ponyo's affection grew as the movie progressed from the moment Sosuke brought Ponyo's school Add to Car. The best moment was when two short departures were reunited when Ponyo's father, Fujimoto (George Tokoro), a magical sailor, recovers the embarrassing Ponyo before encapsulating into a magical bubble. Fujimoto, who was once a human being, has grown to direct people to contaminate the sea and steal its life. But all Ponyo wants to be a human being and be with Sosuke the second time he flees, inadvertently empties his father's precious magical elixir into the sea, creating a storm of tidal waves and engaging the small town of the process. Next is the adventures of Sosuke and Ponyo in the flooded city. <br /> <br /> Are you happy here ever? Does true love reign? You'll know. <br /> <br /> Looking at the shore of the Ponyo art by the sea, it seems that there have been anomalies in previous works by Miyazaki. It seems unknown because the environment besides the characters present in each scene is not stained in the usual way, such as the Breathed Away (2001) and Howl's Moving Castle (2004). Aesthetic appeal is discounted from what appears to be colored pencil drawings. Objects and characters are not as detailed as before. <br /> <br /> It is peculiar when it is taken at face value, but from how the story is written and spoken, it is possible that Miyazaki will allow the audience to watch the film with a child's tint, allowing adults to remember in Japan when they were younger. This step could have prevented potential filmmakers from working with Miyazaki to see it. The Hague did not do anything to promote Ponyo. However, the Japanese case would be a different story than Miyazaki's power of attorney beyond any marketing technique. <br /> <br /> All in all, it wasn't equal to all this. In addition to the ability of Miyazaki to live pleasant and animated characters, the film lacks excitement and surprise compared to previous works, resulting in the absence of a large screen. <br /> <br /> Sparks of Ponyo and Sosuke could not illuminate the film in a great way, but the moments of warmth, kindness and love have still been found when the film is recognized as not for children, but for children who are all or never were.
