A nice pace of romantic military history that should have got more exposure. The Czech pilot, who played the piano, gives the story a little. The films may not have been sufficient for the aviation sphere, like me, but again this is not a film. Although this is nothing in common with James Salter's "The Hunters" novel, which became the Korean F86-class pilot movie, Dark Blue World had the same feeling, but had a more romantic element. Better in some ways than the British battle, because it does not depend on big name extensions. Suggest that you watch this movie with some Czech beers and some Czech dumplings called kneldniky (sp).
