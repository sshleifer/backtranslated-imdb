Especially fun in the mid-1950s in the West, which packs a lot of 96-minute driving time. Most viewers get this story quickly and find that the experience is quite enjoyable. More than just a B-West, but not an epic budget, the budget was modest and most of the big names were affordable. Glenn Ford was the only ticket office at that time. Edward G. Robinson and Barbara Stanwyck went past their prizes and looked for work, Stanwyck was 10 years away from the new popularity "The Big Valley". Brian Keith and Dianne Foster just started. <br /> <br /> Ford plays with John Parrish, a small shepherd who decides to sell how big a traveler (Robinson) hired the armed forces. Parrish is a former Confederate officer who, for health reasons, only moved west. <br /> <br /> Robinson plays Lee Wilkison, who already owns most of the valley and plans to acquire the rest by giving his wife Marta (Stanwyck) a promise. Lee was under attack during the earth war he fought 12 years earlier; his brother Cole (Keith) has come from Texas to help him spread enormously. Lee is face to face with Stanwycki and Keith, but the sensitive daughter of Judith (Foster) is of course upset about what is happening in their home. <br /> <br /> John Parrish has promised his fianc√© to Caroline (May Winn) that he is moving back east. Designed by Grace Kelly's "High Noon" character, Caroline first interrupts the distress signal and simply disappears from the movie. This leaves John and Judith open for romance. <br /> <br /> Violence starts early and continues throughout the film. Parrish is able to implement a military tactic against an enemy who underestimates his ability and determination. He has a very initial confrontation with the main weapon defender around the middle of the movie. Ford plays one of his usual characters; a modest man who interrupts everyone's self-esteem in a way that is slowly offensive but brutal when it finally provoked (very similar to his role in The Sheepman). <br /> <br /> Robinson is also great as a person who retains his personal integrity, although physically his former self is a shadow. And he gets enough lines and time for the proper development of his character. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck has the most difficult role and he is simply not convincing as a classic two-piece woman, a seemingly loyal woman who is going to replace her husband with her brother. This is partly because he is not given enough time to do anything more than superficially. Even so, a gifted actor would have done a much better job even with these limitations. <br /> <br /> Dianne Foster is a pleasant surprise. He should remind many viewers of Carroll Baker, both physically and in style. Although he must play Judit according to the 1950 Convention (he is allowed to be tough, but after each major confrontation he has to break into hysteria), Foster shows a good choice. It promotes Parrish's growing attractiveness, but it does so fine that only when the various clues click. <br /> <br /> The real problem with "Violent Men" is that he is trying to be both Western and character-oriented. Because so much has to happen on the screen, much of the action is rushed, and many characters get harsh. This is not a deadly mistake or a reason to avoid a movie, but it could have been 20 minutes better or lack of unnecessary characters like Caroline. <br /> <br /> Then what else do you know? I'm just a child.
