One of my favorite movies of all time. Nothing can watch this movie for the first time. If I could go back in time and delete my memory or suffer from current amnesia, I could enjoy this movie as much as I did for the first time. It is still a pleasant second and third time, but I found myself more appreciative of humor, because shocks and excitement were not unexpected. If you want to see a movie that you really can't predict, I highly recommend this movie. Its chilling, shocking, tense and there is also a lot of humor. If you watch this movie and don't love it, I doubt your peace of mind!
