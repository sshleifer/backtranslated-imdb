Charlie Wilson (twice the Oscar winner: Tom Hanks) is a lightweight congressman ... Who loves the party, enjoys women and especially drinking. When Charlie's old friend and former girlfriend Joanne Herring (Oscar winner: Julia Roberts) wants Charlie to visit Afghanistan, this country definitely needs it. Charlie is shocked at what he saw, especially from all ages, being killed or hurt by the Russians during the war. He decides to help people and rebels fight against the Russians who started the war. Charlie, Joanne, and one of the renowned CIA agents named Gust Avrakoto (Oscar winner: Philip Seymour Hoffman) are starting to struggle to bring the biggest hidden operation in history. <br /> <br /> Oscar winner director: Mike Nichols (The Birdcage, in relation to Henry, Wolf) made a comedy of a lively, fun sharp satire war based on a real story. Hanks, Roberts, Hoffman Oscar candidate and Amy Adams like Charlie's loyal assistant are very good in their roles. Regardless of the premise of great real life, "Charlie Wilson's War" is never really a fire and it's not as funny as you liked it. Director Nichols and Screenwriter: Aaron Sorkin (Few Good Men) keeps things moving and the characters are well liked all over. <br /> <br /> The DVD has a sharp Pan & Scan (1.33: 1) transmission and good Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. The only features of DVDs are scenes and team-hidden scenes, and the real way of life with Charlie Wilson and others. "Charlie Wilson's War" is a good movie that could have been great, but it is not. But this movie is smart enough to want those who enjoyed well-written or well-functioning adult comedies. (*** 1/2 *****).
