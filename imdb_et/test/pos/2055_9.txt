This movie has a serious scene. A scene that lets you know that his movie doesn't pull a lot of cheap shots. It takes place in a crowded train station and the protagonists are lurking in an automatic weapon on an assassin. They pause for this and just get out of the firearm. The main hall of the train station has now been filled with dead bodies of innocent people that were perpendicular to the fire. Some would call it too sad and / or gloomy to put what should be a pleasant activity. I call it honest. Most feature films tend to rely on the "safe side" of violence and plot elements. This usually means that despite the massive shootouts, innocent people are not dying or at least we don't see them dying. Violence is all pure boys and bad boys who die mostly. A little common sense clearly indicates that it is absurd. <br /> <br /> Renny Harlin showed it in his first (and unfortunately only) death, Die Hardis. Get your point over. The scene was also filmed with a commercial aircraft backup with only a few people on board but a grimmer and probably a more realistic scenario. But to match the spirit of the first film, Die Hard 2 was mostly a fun action movie. Here's a grimmer and more convincing edge spread. Violence is bloody. One liner is fun, but with a certain style that captures more natural human sarcasm than clich√© film strikes at key moments. The plot also has more malicious intentions than most action films. The offender is not just one of the rogue revenge or looting loot. It's less ridiculous, but also more frightening. In recent films, Bourne's trilogy becomes almost less than the usual feature films, but this film has been in 1996 and 7 years before Matt Damon's "The Bourne Identity" on the big screen. Another interesting aspect is that the main hero is actually a heroine. And that's fine before the "Tomb Raider" movie version changed. What's more, this heroine really looks at how he can take John McClane off and then take his yet illuminated cigarette. This film marks the role of Geena Davis' second heroine of action and still failed to hit. Although Angelina Jolie marks "Tomb Rider" for years and appreciates the hit. The reasons are beyond me. Completely. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie is not all dark edge. There are many outrageous and remarkable devices that can only be seen in the action film. The climate-based explosion of a chemical bomb is an absolutely spectacular display of the pyrotechnics of the film, with more than one physics right that makes it a comfortable holiday. So here's the formula here, but it's Anti-Formula's daily Hollywood Action Movie Formula. --- 9/10 <br /> <br /> BsCDb Classification: 13+ --- Violence, embarrassment
