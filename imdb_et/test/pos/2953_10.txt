In the middle of her parents' documentary, the mother of the filmmaker dies, but she continues to make a documentary, discovering a story she did not expect. The result is a swallowing drama that has the best fictional quality of the word, where a pleasant but unknown narrator prefers the audience involuntarily. Thus, the narrative is a double narration, a documentary story, and a documentary creator. <br /> <br /> Our admiration is with the filmmaker, not only with the boldness of his story, although it represents a threat to his entire concept of his parents' relationship, but also never to sensationalism or melodrama. While Hollywood stuff lurking in detail, Doug Block treats this story as he does in everyday life. For those of us who have always speculated about the lives of our parents before coming to the scene (or after we arrived, but even though we were too independent to notice that they have an independent life), 51 Birch Street gives a fair warning: there are wonderful things in the Fatherland, but watch out be careful when you decide to enter it. <br /> <br /> But this caution is that the audience is slowly going into the details of their parents' past. This is not a warning to those who look at the life of Blok's parents. The film is a marvel that mother comes alive and passionate, but internally, who makes her conscious decisions in the 50s. A particular success of the filmmaker is that the viewers actually see the young woman behind the parent's parent and grandparent. We all know that our parents were once young and powerful, but 51 Birch Street has a mother. The father, who has been far away during the growth of the filmmaker and his sister, is still far away in the film, but this is due to his own rather than his portrayal. This biography became dramatic, intense and unforgettable for autobiography, and it definitely sends viewers to look at their family's albums, but hesitates with the back of their photos.
