This documentary focuses on the 2001 Gothenburg events. In Swedish media, the protesters depicted criminals who stood for anarchy and violence. This movie shows that they are not really intelligent, formulate people who have something to say - and say it with bricks. They believe in a better world, a world where people can think and say what they want without being targeted. But are their beliefs about the possibilities of changing society realistic? I think it's not. <br /> <br /> This documentary gives us enlightenment on issues of greed, capitalism and its future. This is a great documentary that is not propaganda because it is not shown correctly. All that it shows is what some people think, and the viewer decides whether what they do and stand is right or wrong. <br /> <br /> I have heard a lot of people who mark it as propaganda and choose to do it I don't think so, I think they're making a bad decision because even if you know the faith of the police or protesters, everything you get There are more facts to rely on, for example, when a shotgun child says he thinks it is good to throw a brick through the McDonalds window because it is a step between thinking and acting as you think. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie filmed me out because you can't really miss the facts that little police officers who fought against violence with violence did not get convicted or even detained even when their evidence throws the bricks on the demonstration march (and in some cases they beat people, even if they are on the street without resisting) where they are as good as it can be. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8/10 - Very good but not the best!
