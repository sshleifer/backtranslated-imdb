Thirst <br /> <br /> I found this movie beautifully designed. The cinema was very good. Although almost every frame could be frozen, you would also have a great photo. The use of color differs most. In many cases, the camera slipped into the scene and the work was flawless. <br /> <br /> Park Chan Wook's direction was fantastic. He held me incredibly in his far-drawn universe. There were several verbal and visual humor (dark in nature) that simply added another depth to the picture as a whole. <br /> <br /> An actor that I wouldn't call prominent but fit the film and worked well for me was the only place where this movie was missing, it was a story. Sometimes I do not lie, skipping characters did not make sense. Sometimes the story was flowing. All in all, I was disappointed with the narrative and I felt it ran a little too long. <br /> <br /> But I suggest this movie at the end of this vision, visual prosperity, humor of the dark, and at the end of the day it's an interesting film, even if it's imperfect. 9/10
