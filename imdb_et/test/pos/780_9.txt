I can't agree with the previous comment that "driving lessons" are more than a little twee, but one man's accusation is another affirmation, I think. In my book, this film succeeds in pure charm, no small game. <br /> <br /> I can't help but want the story to be a bit less common, given the number of talents in it. Finally, the sight of the plot seems to be similar to the character interaction background. Julie Walters' Dame Evie is brilliantly over the mountain actress. Although Evie has not been working continuously over the years, the last time she ever visited is actually unclear (I think Edina is "Abfab" at 65, at one point she is even forced to cope with her kitch factor). Some may find their annoying, but I think this is the point of stressing how much he pushes the reserved Ben (Rupert Grint) buttons to force him out of the shell. Ben is equally isolated from reality, living his entire life under the thumb of his over-dependent mother, whom Laura Linney manages to breathe in, despite being a rather one-dimensional character (you are an old incredible mother). I was quite impressed by Rupert Grint, who found that I give very honest and credible results (not to mention sweet as everything out of the way), I don't think many teenagers to whom I can say that. <Br / The heart of the film is what happens when the worlds of Ben and Evie collide. At first, Ben is obviously preliminary, but also interesting, because Evie is essentially exactly the opposite of what he has ever known. The combination of Evie's persistence and Ben's beneficial nature develops a real sweetness between them, culminating in an improbable journey that gives Ben the first true taste of independence. <br /> <br /> The tone is constantly light even on some short melodramatic bits, but the emotional resonance was still surprising, which was the credit of the major players. All in all, if you want to sit and let yourself be fascinated by some beautiful performances, "driving hours" should not be disappointed. However, if "cute" is not in the movie vocabulary, then it is best to stay away. <br /> <br /> Another little remark that the soundtrack has a remarkable, nice touch of Sufjan Stevens music.
