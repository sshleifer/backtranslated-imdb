This is not a movie that is a clever, witty, and often hearty film. It's a retrospective relationship between Michael Connor (Michael Leydon Campbell) and his foreign Irish girlfriend Grace Mckenna. Michael managed to make a documentary that reproduces his entire relationship and what went wrong. She uses her friendship with the actor she met at the gym in Nadia (Nadia Daja) with whom she plays with Grace. The concept of this film is very original. Michael's relationship is shown at every point, whether it's high or low. Michael Leydon Campbell pulls out a fantastic result that makes you help him find Grace. If the fact that most signs pull out big performances apart from the riddle. The problem is to move the plot, but it seems to be there in the cafe. His monologues are often overrun and meaningless. This is proven when he says, "That chaos, we are all trying to create a queue. And the order, the meaning. But in reality there is no such thing as meaning. Something has meaning when we have meaning." <br /> <br / > The comment saves this movie. The comment is made in vain by Spinal Tap and Michael and his brother explain the problems they had in making the film. Michael offers very funny self-conscious comments that make a very good stomach. <br /> <br /> In general, I'd give this movie 7/10.
