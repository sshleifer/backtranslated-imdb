Where to start, I like the horrible monster called Jack Frost. The whole concept works well for me, we thought he would be back and he was. Change the local and tropical resort. Seeing old friends and meeting new characters. Scott MacDonald does a great job like Jack Frost, you can tell if the actor is fun playing the villain, you see it or you hear it in the performance. Yes, Jack Frost 2 is a welcome sequel that is better than the first. I have one complaint, small Jacks or Jacklings when I call them. They looked like dolls on hand. I think they could have worked better with Jacklings, the mouth could have been opened more widely, but CGI was good and the whole movie is worth it again and again. If you liked JACK FROST, you will like this sequel. No questions or discussions, 9 BIG STARS.
