If it is true that Sadomochism is a two-sided coin that contains all of its opposites in a diverse expression, Erika Kohut's cinematic portrait reality. Professor Kohut treats his piano students in a sort of fascist sadism, while he himself missed the same. His appearance expressed his desire. That's why he can hurt without guilt or resentment. <br /> <br /> Must be talented, charming, beautiful young Walter Klemmer (Benoit Magimel) who attracts her because of her passion and intensity. She wants to become her student to be close to her. He rejects him, but because of his talent, the Vienna Conservatory votes for him. She falls in love with her. Again, he pushes him away, but he does not accept the answer and thus begins his descent into losing misery and self-esteem. <br /> <br /> The question that the viewer can ask now is who is under control? Sad or masochist? Indeed, who is a sadist and who is a masochist? It's hard to say. Whether a person who has just been badly psychologically and physically abused has been wounded and filled with grotesque on the floor, or is the person who rushes to the door, commanding no one to find out what happened. <br /> <br /> But Erika is not just a sadomocratic freak. She's a sexy extreme freak. He wants to experience the extremes of human sexuality while maintaining a respectable facade. In fact, it is not even true. He says he doesn't care what others think. He doesn't care if they walk and find their bleeding on the floor because he's in love. Love, he calls it. Because his sex and love are the same. <br /> <br /> At one point, Walter tells him that love is not everything. How ironic such greatness is to him. How to get a free comment. <br /> <br /> The film is a beautifully cut and masterly-guided Michael Haneke, who spins the story with expert camera work and carefully designed kits, where the nature of the action is not just clear, but exemplified (as in the bathroom when Walter pulls himself high He's also using the fine-tuning of the players to always be where they should be cut from one corner to the other, which is especially important in a scene where Erika, like bleeding in white and black light, is loved by her lover. here we see mostly only his face and his sharp contour with a pulsating artery. We no longer have to see. <br /> <br /> The Erika Cuddle is perfect for Isabelle Huppert who is not afraid of extremes; I have seen him in several films and what he does better than almost everyone has become a body and a soul. s playing, he is not afraid of what others think and care little about their appearance in decorative terms. For him, the result and the challenge are important. No part is too demanding. No characters are too exhausted. Just as Huppert wants to experience all humanity and wants us to look at him as he does. He's always exciting and almost flawless. He's not just the leading light of French cinema; he is one of the greatest actors of our time who has created an amazingly diverse work. <br /> <br /> I think this is very instructive and gives us an excellent and striking contrast to compare her performance with The Lacemaker (La Dentellière) since 1977 when she was 22 years old. There she had apple cubes and freckles in her red hair and her pretty face and a cute little figure who played Pomme, a Parisian apprentice hairdresser. His character was sex and modest - just an ordinary French girl who hoped to be a beautician one day. Here, he is a self-destructive witch, bitter with hateful knowledge, shameless and completely exhausted. <br /> <br /> Huppert is fortunate to be an actor in France with parts for women older than the stars. (Hollywood could never make such a movie.) Only a few of the best and hardest-performing actors in the American cinema are hoping for a career after about thirty years of age. Huppert significantly increases his exposure due to his ability and scope, but also because he is ready to play multi-level roles here and in La Cérémonie (1995), where he plays a whistle, a malicious assassin. <br /> <br /> See it for Isabelle Huppert. You will not forget him or what he brings to life.
