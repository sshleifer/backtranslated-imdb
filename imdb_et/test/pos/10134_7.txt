Not much for this, but for validating the values ​​of small towns and embracing the young man in his heart with a spiritual challenge. <br /> <br /> I read some comments and was surprised at some of the hostility that it caused. I felt that Cuba Gooding dealt with this part with dignity and respect, unlike Sean Penn's despicable fool, which is "I am Sam." <br /> <br /> The fact that it is based on a real stage makes it even warmer than the heart. Sport is taken seriously in a small town high school in America (and elsewhere, I suspect) and I felt the depiction of competitive students who opened their hearts to a less happy reality, at least for me. <br /> <br /> The trainer was never forced to choose between his daughter and the radio, but rather decided to make his own decisions with radio-loving and open roads. Very well done for everyone. 7 out of 10 <br /> <br /> Debra Winger, we need more of you in pictures!
