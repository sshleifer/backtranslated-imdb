This film is probably too sentimental for many viewers, especially modern viewers. Nonetheless, I enjoyed this movie mostly because of William Holden's ground, one of my favorite stars, and the dazzling beauty of Jennifer Jones. Between the pair and these two talents, there are some really warm-hearted scenes that will save what the lesser hand would have had tricks. The second highlight of this movie is Hong Kong's cinematic film shooting time. All in all, it's better than the average romantic drama, 7/10.
