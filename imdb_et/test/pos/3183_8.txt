After seeing the uncut version, I thought this movie was beautifully done. It took my attention from the beginning to the end; the tension was perfectly delivered. Nasan Ka Man describes the Philippine family precisely when presenting mysteries and lies. Even the religious culture, the tendency of people to keep their appearance and maintain a pure reputation is shown in the characteristic vitality of Gloria Diaz. There is no small scene in this film that has no purpose - cinema is excellent and brilliant in writing. <br /> <br /> Although the plot is large, I personally found that writhing at the end, a revelation related to the nature of Jericho, was not as big a shock as it should be. But then maybe it's just me, otherwise Nasan is also a very wise man in Man. <br /> <br /> Casting was good at first, but Deither and Claudine were on the cake. No one who doesn't like to be looking for a Filipino movie that surprises and exceeds expectations. Thumbs up to director.
