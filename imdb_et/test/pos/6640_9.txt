This is one of the worst, most harrowing Bergman movies I've seen. I also think this is one of the most powerful films about the ugly war of war and what it does to the people's souls. <br /> <br /> A couple of musicians who left the big city with a remote island and who live as farmers find themselves impossible with inexplicable and disgraceful acts that they even imagined because they are fighting the terrible reality of war. They betray their souls, friends and even each other in a desperate attempt to survive. Liv Ullmann and Max Von Sydow are traditionally brilliant as a lost, confused and frightened couple who have been involved in the civil war. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10
