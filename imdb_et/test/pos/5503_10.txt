A very different movie from Jerry Lewis, not like all the famous films everyone knows. Lewis is dealing with the difficult task of World War II and national socialism in Germany in a rather unusual way. But even more interesting and important, he does it in a very American way. And as with so many things in the world and especially in the film industry, the un-american means more sophisticated, finer, more intelligent, or just better. This is why the film did not have success in the US, but a great success in Europe. <br /> <br /> In summary, Jerry Lewis has proved by this film that he can do much more than a simple blow to comedy.
