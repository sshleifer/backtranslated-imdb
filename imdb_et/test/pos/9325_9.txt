When it was announced that "King of Pop" was dead at the age of 50, a month before it started a series of comeback exhibitions in London's O2 arena, it was a huge shock for millions of people around the world. He was and is forever one of the most talented voices and dancers in the music industry, and he is terribly missed. I decided to remind me how wonderful he was watching what many consider not only Jackson's best videos (and perhaps the song), but the biggest music videos ever directed by John Land (American Werewolf, London). The movie opens with Michael and his Girl (Ola Ray), who has a break in his car, and after the round, the moon comes out and becomes a werewolf. Then we see Michael and his Girl who watch it in the cinema movie, he fears and walks, and Michael follows him, sings an iconic song. Coming soon, Vincent Price will come and the zombies will crawl from the ground and open the coffins from the cemetery, and Michael and the girl are obviously surrounded. He turns away and Michael has become a zombie himself, and with all other beings they do iconic dance before he returns to his usual self, at least for the choir. The girl drives near the horrible house, blocks the doorway, but the zombie Michael manages to break through, and when she touches her, she yells at normal Michael, "What's the problem?" The movie ends with his home and looks at us with evil eyes. Michael Jackson was number 100 on the biggest pop culture icon and he was number 6 in Ultimate Pop Star, Thriller Album had 100 of the biggest album numbers 4, and this video was number 100 in the most frightening moments, and it was number 1 100 on the biggest pop video. Very good!
