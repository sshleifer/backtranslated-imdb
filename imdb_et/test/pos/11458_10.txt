This movie was great, not understanding this disrespect. First I saw it like 87-88 and it was really scary, if you're an 80's horror blower, you shouldn't have any problem with this movie. I have to meet some actors and they were cool. What's not great about creepy old houses, demons, crazy party and horny good looking youngsters. Dialogue and special fx made this movie classic. This film also took care of one of the classic rumors that a black man could not finally die. Even though this film was great, I have one thing that has not been discovered for me, what actually happened to the old couple. the little side story that has always been me was confused.
