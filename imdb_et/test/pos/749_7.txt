I found that the film doesn't look very good in the basement, some such big characters. It is about a young psychiatric nurse called sister Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik) who starts working with an isolated spiritual shelter. There he meets with different characters, including Dr. Geraldine Masters, who is responsible for asylum after the hospital owner Stephens kills one patient, hitting him with an ax. <br /> My favorite characters in the movie are Mrs. Challingham (Reah MacAdams), a very funny little old lady, Allison, who is a nymphomania, and Sam (Bill McGhee) is a young black man who goes all day all the time in his own world. The film was a very low budget movie, but it was still a really big movie. I know it was in the list of 'Video Nasties' of the 80s, but didn't think it had a lot of gore, even though it had some disturbing feelings. GREAT FILM RECOMMENDED !!!
