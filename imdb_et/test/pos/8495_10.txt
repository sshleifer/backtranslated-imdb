This film has inspired me to be a better person. In life you do not know who you are driving, and sometimes our prejudices make us wrong. I've learned to give the person some doubts about this movie. I also learned that tough love can build a stronger person. Now I want to know where to find the soundtrack for the movie. There are songs I have been trying to get for years. Allow me to comment a second time. Jamie Fox was outstanding. The man has grown to act as an actor. Regina King's presentation was also fantastic. If I can see a woman how she looked at Ray, I can only dream. I finished $ 18.00 for this movie and I don't have much money, but I'm ready to see this movie over and over again. This film touched me.
