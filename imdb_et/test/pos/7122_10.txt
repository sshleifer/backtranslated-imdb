This film perfectly captures the atmosphere of the D&D Group. Looking, I couldn't help but I noticed that the bright characters remembered to myself and my friends that they acted in the same way as we did. Including bullying, fighting, internal jokes, DM mad leadership. ALL. <br /> <br /> It's all. The jokes that made me cry, the action scenes that were even filmed with low budget, found a nuisance awesome. The story is quite simple and surprising, but it is not really important, because the best part of the movie is that the characters react and interact with each other and with the NPCs. <br /> <br /> Seriously, if you play D&D or similar RPGs, I can't emphasize it enough, SEE THIS MOVIE, it hit D&D spirit beautifully.
