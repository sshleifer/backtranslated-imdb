This BBC series is great. I'm not a paleontologist, but this series gives the best historical representation of the dinosaurs I've ever seen. 3D animation and animation are very good and will make you believe you have traveled on time. The BBC deserves both the fine series and the back of Tim Haines who had to spend a lot of time spending this time.
