This is the first sci fi series I've seriously grasped after Star Trek (and I've never tracked Trek over the years). It takes the issue of invasion somewhat differently, but it has been very exciting. It also borrows from the soap opera format, where it continues to arc throughout the series. The CGI will certainly not take over the plot or signs, except for Nim, who is a pet with a certain attitude. (Something that would show what he really meant to a neighbor's yippy dog ​​is in my book A-1.) He was a genius. <br /> <br /> I am at the end of the finals, asking questions (I hope intelligent) and crossing my fingers and toes that NBC or anyone else (maybe Sci Fi) will continue with the series and answer these questions. <br /> <br /> A really great, stylish show.
