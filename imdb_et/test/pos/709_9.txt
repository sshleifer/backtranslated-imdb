A film that deserved the release of the theater. This television film is a cinematic art that illustrates Michael Man's technique, blended with contemporary music that is closely integrated with visual images. Only with Mr. Mann is increasing the impact of music almost the same as the winning actress who has been added to the ensemble of cast, writer, director and operator. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely my all time favorite. Although nothing is perfect, this film is very, very close. <br /> <br /> With a great script, great direction and a masterful example of Richard Strauss, the perfect ensemble of characters is the best: Roger Mosely; Brian Dennehy; Ed Lauter; Geoffrey Lewis; Richard Moll; Miguel Pinero; William Prince; Burton Guilliam; Ji-Tu Cumbuka; Richard Lawson and Billy Green Bush. You may not recognize the names, but you will feel every face. movie in 97 minutes. I recommend that you save it because it is only available from VHS and DVD from Holland and DVD is region 2.
