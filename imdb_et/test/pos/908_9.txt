Stan Laurel considered PHILIPI PUTTING PANTS to be the first true L&H movie. The second year was the first "official" L&H film, but that was exactly where Stan completely abandoned not only his performance (he had written with Hal Roach's studios as director and "gag-man" before certain situations). - including Oliver Hardy's lamb disaster, which led Stan to replace, and the extra money he would give, would give himself and his new spouse Lois - his historical return, as well as writing, directing, editing and engaging in other production areas), but also realized that he was part of a team that worked well together. That is why it is a historical and very important film in the history of comedy. <br /> <br /> This is also a surprisingly small, quiet movie; rather, what is known to Laurel & Hardy and what they are immediately concerned about today. "Stan & Ollie does not appear - Scottish Stan Laurel is played by Oliver Hardy's nephew, a respectable man from a city that does not want to see this strange sight who is a nice and pretty pretty girl. This well done, charming little film has some very funny moments and their performances by two comedy kings on the spot - check out Stan's small scissors and smile, saying, "Well waddaya know?" when he sees girls, or for example, a hairy scene at the airport. Funny. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie as possible by supporting Beau Hunks Orchestra's music (available in VVL video releases), which enhances the feeling of the 1920s and is very pleasant to listen to. It is a great and undervalued little film, so I said it was "surprisingly" funny.
