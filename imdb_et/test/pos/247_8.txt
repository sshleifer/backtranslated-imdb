It's a very enjoyable, fluffy, glamorous musician in the 40s. "Cover Girl" was a bona-fide, American-American star by Rita Hayworth (formerly dark-haired Latin senor without Margarita Cansino). This confirmed Gene Kelly's amazing talent as a dancer, singer, actor and choreographer. Rita Hayworth is great because Rusty Parker is her picture and her presence is always at the forefront. Her song is dubbed, but her dance is absolutely brilliant and she combines well with Kelly. I think Rita was extremely undervalued as an actor - she plays perfectly every scene here. The gene choreographed the dance sequences (he was given almost complete freedom of creativity here) and his "Alter Ego" dance number is amazing. Such artistry. Permanent fields are "Make your way tomorrow", "Put me on the test" and of course "Long and old and far". The plot is quite thin, but it has moral. It is about fast fame and quick money, and how luck with these factors will ultimately be destroyed. It will cheer you up, lift you on your feet and make you laugh. <br /> <br /> This means that Cover Girl is not the biggest ever produced music - it has a number of bugs to deal with. It can be said that a little bit of Phil Silvers goes a long way. His character becomes quite fast. But I was impressed by his dance ability and how he managed to keep up with Gene and Rita. Another big problem is that too many songs are not so big. The "Cover Girl" number looks fantastic, but I'm not a lyrics or singing fan. "Poor Tom" is a big downfall. I think this is one of the worst numbers I've heard in the music of the 40's. It stinks. The grandmother's lower limit is bounded by ridicule. But that's just my opinion. Others may like these elements. <br /> <br /> However, the bugs are also a very good movie that is much better than most of the products thrown out today. Dancing and singing are superb, product values ​​are excellent and the mood is infectious. <br /> <br /> 8/10
