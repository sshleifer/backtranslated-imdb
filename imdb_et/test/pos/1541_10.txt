The ground of the corps. The title itself reads the secrets. And this is really at the heart of Amnesty International's movie. Government secrets, personal secrets, both are an integral part of this story. <br /> <br /> Overwhelmingly the longest time to see is shown by Alan Rickman as well as Madeleine Stowe, who was a government interrogator and a victim. With only two participants in this unusual standard-length movie, it is immediately clear that both actors were dedicated and talented to pull the viewer into this small world bubble and shut the door. <br /> <br /> The WORD CAUTION ... <br /> <br /> The description of this movie does not mention the existence of a sub-unit dealing with sexual abuse of childhood. Although there is no graphical detail on abuse, it may be difficult for some viewers to look - especially considering the overall intensity of the film. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big Amnesty fan of International Movies, but this movie pulled me in because the actor was so extraordinary and I can't help but make this movie one of my personal favorites.
