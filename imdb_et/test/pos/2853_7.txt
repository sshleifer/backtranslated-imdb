Renee Zellweger is a Kansas housewife whose dominant husband interferes with drug trafficking. Two professional hit men - Morgan Freeman and his son Chris Rock murdered his wife in his dining room. Zellweger, who is not seen by the killers, is witnessing it and undergoes a dissociative reaction, assuming that the personality of the sister named Betty is her favorite soap opera. Believing he is a TV player, Zellweger takes his man into a car with a trunk load and travels to LA, where he hopes to combine another character in this futile afternoon drama, "Dr. David Ravell," Greg Kinnear. It is not understood that he is hit by two men hit, he drives to LA, where he can confirm with Kinnear and is actually a sister named Betty. Few men, including the local sheriff, are catching up on what is happening and are also looking for Zellweger in LA. The end is plausible and toxic. <br /> <br /> If it sounds crazy, it's because it is. And that is the writer's responsibility, John C. Richards. The curious thing is that Richards and director Neil Labute, with the remarkable help of the performers, almost all pull out. This is not a piece known in the familiar form. No. I give him bonus points for originality alone. Someone went through the limb. Someone took the chance of a film that was NOT a copy or a repetition of what had earned money ten years or fifty years ago. I imagine the people involved, kneeling every night, praying praying. I don't know if the film was profitable, but it's mostly successful under its aesthetic conditions. <br /> <br /> This can be called a "prerequisite". You start from a transformative event, in this case the murder of Zellweger's wife and the acceptance of his truly new personality, and you follow realistic results. "Groundhog Day" is another, better, and more sophisticated example. "Nurse Betty" has its logical cracks, where incidents abandon their credibility. For example, at LA, Zellweger finally runs Kinnear, a man who plays his ex-groom on television. She's stunned (because she thinks she's Betty who has lost her bride long ago). He approaches Kinnear and a couple of colleagues and introduces himself as the character of Nurse Betty. He is dealing with Kinneal's TV label "David Ravell." The group is first puzzled, then to convince itself that he is an ambitious actor who insists that during the conversation "character" - and after Kinnear is fascinated by him and others. Kinnear drives his home and even if he can feel good at night, he still leaves a character, leaving Kinnea with a surprise eye when he hits Betty's character. The next day Kinnear returns his love. Such a development, the relationship between Zellweger and Kinnear, is currently a logic, one that is absent from the "ground". At the end of Night One, like every other person, Kinnear understands that Zellweger is a couple of piano that is short of a circus. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie, which contains a lot of deviations, goes beyond expectations. The relationship between Morgan Freeman and his mysterious nihilistic son is perfectly highlighted. Morgan is flawless in his excitement. He can fall in love with the reputation of Zellweger by discovering the clues of his whereabouts and activities, and ultimately he cannot shoot himself. He's too sweet to shoot. After being transformed into Betty, he left behind in Kansas. "I want to help life, be it animal, vegetable or mineral." Who could harm the author of such an excessively binding statement? Her admiration for her is like an epiphany, as she stands near a traffic light on the edge of the Grand Canyon. Zellweger, dressed up as Doroth, or maybe a good witch in the East, has characters that, like Zellweger, are from Kansas - appear to Freeman, and he takes him and can gently kiss him. This is a scene that is terribly awful, romantic and small. I was one of those lights and threw a little crushed paper out of the dark canyon and brought myself surrounded by a thousand rotating bats that were badly broken like moths. <br /> <br /> Right. Where was I? Okay. I wasn't trying to run out of space. The result of Zellweger is worthy. Everything he does, every move, every word, is naive and original. She's a really nice character - and despite being a glamorous girl by Hollywood standards. But - what an actor. Compare your activities as the "cold hill" of the 19th century wolf. On the contrary. But then everyone in this enjoyable movie is snuff. Allyson Jannings does a little bit of work. See her when she tells Greg Kinnear that she is considering killing her character in a swimming accident. Kinnear is one of the narcissists who carry the popular ten thousand dollars at that time with a thin black leather jacket. He laughs and says, "Oh, one of those rogues, right? Okay, how do I get back?" Jannings doesn't answer. She just smiles at her with these huge blue eyes and tilts her head with mockery. <br /> <br /> Not a masterpiece of making movies, but good, original and professional work by everyone.
