This movie was one, if not the best film of the year, which I highly recommend that it starts as a very funny movie, but if the movie progresses much more. do yourself a favor and watch this movie. I saw the reader of this movie, but I'm not going to buy it not only for myself, but for many true movie fans I have the feeling that this great movie is widely unknown, as is the case with so many other non-commercial films. comedic still heart wrenching movie it will make you laugh it will make you cry it will make you think and yes you mean it if its over and not what a good movie is!
