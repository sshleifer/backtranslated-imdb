my favorite scientific literature, incredible ride through mistrust and distortion of reality. Probably the best Jude Law-seen game. Incredibly original interesting character developments and a story that turns and turns so fast that after the movie passes it takes a few minutes for your genius. Even more fun when you look again at the start.
