Most of the other reactions of the users of this service were very suitable, although some found it to be slow or unclear. It was not ambiguous but meant a complex and multilayer. It can be seen as an anti-war scenario for opening and closing, and for the shameless grandfather, because the wonderful cavalry who saw Eylau's excellent charge, as opposed to its so terrible and disturbing conclusion, when we see bloody uniforms, boy dead etc - but mostly I see the movie moral person in immoral society. At the end, Chabert chooses from the post-Napoleonic French world and chooses the simple pleasures offered by Derville (who himself has been saved due to Chabert's basic dignity and choice of choice) - white bread, some wines and tobacco - for his wealth for his wife and the dishonesty of him and society. In her case, we see the film as a feminist, in the current situation of women, where the only weapons that Chabert has, are his charm, beauty, funny and finally money.
