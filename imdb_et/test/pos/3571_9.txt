"Bluff" has been showing in Bogota for some time now, and I finally got to see it today. I didn't know what to expect at all, but I was very happy to be surprised. It is a comedy of the same kind of crime as Snatch et al. The style of the film starts with a cheerful music and an Argentine narrator who sets aside the camera - weird for the first time, but later it fits naturally. <br /> <br /> In my less than perfect Spanish, I still found the plot and the dialogue easy enough and a lot of comedy is situational. My Colombian girlfriend laughed at the different images of people from different regions and social classes, which somewhat passed me off, but for example a well-functioning imaginative powerful idiot is funny in any language. br /> <br /> I think it's the credit of this movie that it has something of a global taste: I didn't often like it was Colombia, which I look at. However, it is important to note that many rich Bogotan live like some of the characters in this film, and this is by no means a false portrayal of Bogota or Colombian society, but * optional * portrayal - as every film allegedly represents a real situation / culture. <br /> <br /> I don't know how much comedy is lost in subtitles, but if it's in your country, be sure to check it out: it's a very slippery and enjoyable movie with a great sense of humor. And everything is tightly packed for 90 minutes.
