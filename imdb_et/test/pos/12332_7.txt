I was surprised by the PG rating on the back of the DVD bag. I certainly wouldn't want my kids to watch it. I think it would scare the 10-year-old out of the mess. <br /> <br /> Plot: The girl trying to click is nervous and tortured by the crowd. They talk to him to spend the evening in this horrible mausoleum (which reminded me of Phantasm ...) and they torture him at night to torture him. They know little that the recently dead seer sees life and raises the dead around them! It sounds awful, but given the age and budget, which was undoubtedly small, this film is fun at many levels. <br /> <br /> Look at the early EG Daily, one of the crowds. I enjoyed it and it frightened my girlfriend. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 kids.
