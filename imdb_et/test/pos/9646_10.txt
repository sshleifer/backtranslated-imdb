I felt compelled to give feedback on the film I rented from Blockbuster. This movie is all - comedy, drama, crime, intercourse and "realism". I'll definitely look at it again! Some funny parts and also action-packed drama. I enjoy movies that interest you, what happens next. My general opinion was this movie great! I am looking forward to your following! Travis Milloyul is a writer and director of real talent.
