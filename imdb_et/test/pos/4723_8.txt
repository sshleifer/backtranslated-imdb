This film worked for two purposes: to make a political point and talk about a scary adventure story. It is often difficult to make a political point and still say good (consider Ellen's political but rarely entertaining). After a rangoon, there is a good balance between politics and storytelling. <br /> <br /> I already knew that Aung San Suu Kyi had won the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize and knew something about the oppressive political situation in Burma, so that the political message about the film was mainly about dramatizing what I already knew. But I thought the film was doing a good job for Aung San Suu Kyi and mostly for the dictators who have been silent for years. A device that presents an unknown environment through the eyes of spectators that can be detected by viewers is quite common, but in this movie it is pretty well done. <br /> <br /> Of course, the real measure of the film was the value of entertainment. Arquette was great as a young woman whose sister took her to distant, alien places to shake her off against her husband and son's violent deaths due to her depression. He is convincingly separated and depressed. His exhausting state gives him a clear reason why he's confused by the travels of a dangerous situation he doesn't understand is what he would otherwise be too intelligent to stumble upon. it is obvious that even through the grief cloud he sees through them, he is trapped, without just escaping. It puts him in an adventure where he needs his intelligence to survive. Writers deserve a lot of credit for being intelligent and inventive enough to deal with numerous dangerous situations, but at the same time he found an incredible reason to be foolish enough to get in trouble first. Leadership is also strong, keeping tension throughout the race to gain access to dictatorship forces. <br /> <br /> This film influenced me and my wife further due to other events of the same time period. We made a trip to India and heard news from Western tourists hosted by the Indian terrorist group. Preventing isolated terrorists in a peaceful democratic state is a completely different thing than escaping the oppressive dictatorship. But the film and news shared the element to avoid a threat in a foreign country. This common feature gave the film a meaning beyond the strength of its skilful narration. The film illustrates the worst nightmare of international tourism.
