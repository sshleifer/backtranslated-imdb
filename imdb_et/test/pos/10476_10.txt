This film speaks of everything that is to say about religion - I want it to be seen by all the bigots and wishing churches. <br /> <br /> The story that has taken place at the beginning of the century in Danish villages is about two very religious sisters, whose late father was a rigid priest who discouraged all his dreams of love and the world and its many beauty. They are now old and their lives and beauty spent. Their quiet new help - which they "teach" to eat - is Babette (played by lovely Stephane Audran, who has evaluated so many Claude Chabrol's films). The life of the village is simple and the rough direction reflects it. <br /> <br /> If Babette wins the lottery, she asks for the opportunity to make a party - a real love work. The celebration and the guest of this commander show the messages of love and spirituality and how there are many ways to love God and life. <br /> <br /> This is a black vision of the commitment Babette prepares and the speech that the General Authority will eventually give. Probably the best international film of the 1980s.
