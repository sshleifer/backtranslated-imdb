I was very happy to know that Hari Om will be released in 2007 by theater. I saw this movie three years ago at the Vancouver International Film Festival and I have been waiting for it to be released ever since I could see everyone I know. It's like a trip to India .... colorful, magical, thoughtful. In addition to a rather strange Hollywood-style rickshaw-chase scene, this film is very realistic. It is not a Bollywood-style song and dance film, but it has drama and romance and humor. Relationships between Indian taxi drivers and French tourists reflect well the fundamental differences between Eastern and Western lifestyles and philosophy. The characters are slightly extended, but the action was very good. Visually, this film is a treatment when you really know what Rajasthan's passage is like ... dreamy. Sometimes it is hard to believe that everything you see and experience is real ... the film has the same quality. Great sound too!
