Recent director John Frankenheimer directed his first feature film The Young Stranger after live streaming in New York. This film came to Rebel without success in 1956. James MacArthur made his feature film debut with a filmmaker father, James Daly, who did not create enough relationships with his son. Kim Hunter plays with a mother trying to bridge the gap between her husband and son. The film uses juvenile offenders popular in history. MacArthur is struggling with the movie theater where Whit Bissell's overall theater director plays. MacArthur, in turn, has to deal with police sergeant James Gregory to teach him a lesson. The material would easily become exploitative, ridiculous, and sensational, like everyone else in the period. However, under Frankenheimer's solid hand, the film is a sensitive image of the dynamics of teenagers and parents. The dialogue is realistic and most of the scenes keep surprisingly well. Some scenes with Bissell as theater manager and Gregory, a police sergeant, are a bit heavy and dated. However, the performances are equally good, which is necessary for success in this kind of film and its theme. This is an impressive film debut for both MacArthur and Frankenheimer. *** 4 stars.
