When filming concerns vision and real life, this film is absolutely perfect: NUOVOMONDO speaks about immigration from the US in the early 900s, but is still talking about when emigration / immigration is still in focus. <br /> <br /> It's not rich to be a visionary movie. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Gainsbourg is the star of the advanced level. A Good Challenge to the Academy Award 2007 <br /> <br /> After the first Crialese experiment, "Respiro", an emotional but too intellectual film, it has learned the lessons of Fellini and David to name just two Italian masters. /> <br /> The plot claims exactly leadership, maybe just a little less melodrama would be more effective. <br /> <br /> When VOLVER (Challenge for Academic Next Year) is a mature film by Almodovar, always a brilliant director, NUOVOMONDO deserves more because he has been trying to be an American scene for a European film. <br /> <br /> And that's it!
