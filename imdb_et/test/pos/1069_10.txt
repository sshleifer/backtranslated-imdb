I saw this movie for the first time about 15 years ago and I've been fascinated since then. This feeling-good experience is that I can look at it at any time happily. For me, however, it's a Christmas movie. <br /> <br /> The fact that it is in B&W is irrelevant - although I often don't know what it would be colored. You just get a warm, glowing feel while watching Christmas events. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck and Morgan are perfect together and Greenstreet is the opposite of his usual character, Sakall is a delightful pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> It is a mild relief and definitely does not charge the brain but leaves you with the pleasure of seeing it. <br /> <br /> I can't wait to have it available on DVD in the UK. I'm sure to queue to buy it.
