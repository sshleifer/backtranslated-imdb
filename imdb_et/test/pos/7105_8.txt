The last queue, which does not read Abbot and Costello, will meet Frankenstein, who was more or less the timer of Dracula (John Carridine), who is trying to treat his vampire kindly as a doc (Onslow Stevens). Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr) also shows that he is seeking treatment. A good doctor manages to cure Larry werewolfism, but Dracula tricks the dock and reaches his blood and makes a good dock crazy lunatic.oh and all this time Franky (Strange Glenn) is on a table waiting for his electricity to fix so he can get some destruction. It was a kind of short film, about 70 minutes, and some change, but the action is there and the big actors are there. when he appears as a police inspector, there are some trivia, Lionel appeared to Frankenstein's son, Frankenstein's ghost, Frankenstein meets the wolf and Frankenstein. and then the other, if there was another, they could add the black lagoon creature from the line, I give Drakula house from 10 to 8.
