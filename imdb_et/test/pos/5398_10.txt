IMAGINARY ARTISTS is one small little movie! The story written and staged by Dan Harris is a classic theater, weaving of customs and tragedy so closely that the climax of the film takes its breath away. <br /> <br /> The Travis family is strange: no member seems to be anybody. Starting with the suicide of Matt (Kip Pardue), a swimmer of a reluctant "hero" child, his father Ben (Jeff Daniels) breaks down and isolates himself from his family and himself, while his mother Sandy (Sigourney Weaver) is turning to the pot and the rage. sarcasm, daughter Penny (Michelle Williams) returns from the school that her family's behavior has eliminated, and the rest of the son Tim (Emile Hirsch) takes all of the above, avoiding her classmates, girlfriend and teams with her neighbor Kyle (Ryan Donowho) to jump into drugs and sexual abuse. tests. The whole movie, Tim, tries to hide the bruises on his body, which have a secret, but that bring his girlfriend to the rejection of his mother's rage against the trailer park. scars that this family has suffered for years. Here are the mysteries and lies, and their resolution is painfully dramatic. <br /> <br /> This may be the best role for Sigourney Weaver, although Emile Hirsh, Jeff Daniels, Ryan Donowho and Kip Pardue (despite his briefness) all play top performances. The story begins slowly and seems to be inclined, and this fact may lose the attention of the viewers, but stay on the little powerful film and its impact will hit you. Highly recommended.
