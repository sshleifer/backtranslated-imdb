I bought my first Zep album in 1974 (at 17) and I've been since then. This DVD has been proud of its music collection now. Often the band does not have 4 virtuosos in their competition, but it is possible here. Each member contributed to the band, but together they produced more than 4 people. This masterpiece covers the entire band's career from Led Zep 1 to Coda, and is perfectly captured on this DVD because each concert shows how the band has grown bigger and bigger over the years. I recently lost my copy, but I'm happy to say that in my 17yo son's room, the new generation discovered how big these boys were. It is mandatory for anyone who appreciates rock music. Live Led Zeppelin.
