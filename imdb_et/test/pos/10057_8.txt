Nikki Finn is a girl I marry. Never bored, always thinking positively, with good animals. Well, if one reviewer wrote a little too much peroxide, lipstick and eyebrow (Only Madonna could give up). But that's why I love Nikki Finn, she's not your usual girl. He always does things, always exciting and always honest. Of course he steals, but he doesn't rob or murder (if you don't). He knows what rules can be interrupted and what to follow. He knows what to do and what can't be stolen. If you need him to make a profit, he is 100%. Bottom Line: He knows how to enjoy life. Nikki is always loving (that's why she also has wild animals) and fully committed to those she loves and loves her. <br /> <br /> Who is this girl? She's a girl for me.
