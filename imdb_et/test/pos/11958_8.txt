Ok, so there are always people who seem to make it pleasant, they don't like movies because they're good, but choose movies based on frustrating or boring movies or whether they are from abroad. All this aside, one crazy summer is a great example of what a great American teen comedy should be. The jokes are a good combination of slapstick (la Bobcat Goldthwait), surreal (Bobcat Steve-inspired direction from Holland) and dry (John Cusack, one of the morally drier and funniest actors in the American cinema) and there are no characters in this movie that don't offer at least one funny line (except Demi Moore). <br /> <br /> Yes, it's immature, yes, it's a screwdriver, yeah, Bobcat dresses like Godzilla and trash in a seafood restaurant. It's also funny as hell. Look out.
