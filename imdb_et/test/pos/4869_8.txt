This comic records the second meeting between Wile E. Coyote and Roadrunner and is definitely better than their first meeting with Fast and Furry-ous (1949). <br /> <br /> According to the aesthetic value, it does not belong to the top 5 or 6 of 1952. This is a very funny short. Coyote (Carnivorous Vulgaris) drives the Roadrunner (Accelerati Incredibilus) along the way and gets completely tired. The ingenious scientific "Latin" names of the characters are very original and are imitated in other un-linked cartoons. Koyoot collapses and makes a great expression - I don't know the freedom. Such Jonesesque expressions make this copy more than a part of its ticket price within seven minutes. Then he has a sense and another ridiculous expression. Long jokes are all fun and obscure the fact that it's really evil to cause such pain to a poor, helpless, GENIUS koyote. Everyone knows, but who cares? <br /> <br /> An old rocket gag is also available. Coyote straps himself to a rocket that should bring enough of the Roadrunner and grab it. Instead, the rocket will let air and become a distant fireworks: eat Joe. This classic gag comes from this comic; While this is obvious, it still makes a laugh. <br /> <br /> Highlighting is indeed the penetration of the miniature neck. Two wear light, and we see the tunnel through which the two go, only the lights are visible. Here comes the top of comedy. Required order, perhaps even the best sequence in the early days of Roadrunner. The final touch is given by Michael Maltese's writing, because the Coyote's light goes out and unknowingly illuminates the game in explosive spaces, showing the surface where the bunch of cactus jumps and writes "YIPE!" after the blast. These little things make you ridiculous in just seven minutes and as soon as it starts to have fun. Rocket skates are another good idea, as well as the free drinking of water and drink on the penguin line (the sequence that appears in Space Jam [1996]). Giving these results would be useless. The free drink proves that Wile E. is the second last end of the sequence: rockets. <br /> <br /> This classic comic is full of perfect animation, except for characters. Although they are animated very well, these two characters are very primitive; which may be an underestimation. Although it may seem strange at first, the humor of the following sequences is forgotten. <br /> <br /> If you like vintage jones, look at it. If you love Roadrunner, you can get this video. Great Entertainment (Rating: 8/10).
