It's a movie I grew up with. It's a great family life that kids love and parents enjoy. I want to make more of these movies. It's a great story for little boys who raises their mother and sister Bull and shows it to the national championship where she wins! Then he fears that someone will start to grab his bull so he robs him and drives home. I was really excited to see it in the movie theater and I was surprised to see George Strait, Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis in this little movie. The music was great with all kinds of big names like Willie Nelson and Dixie Chicks. Anyone who doesn't enjoy this movie doesn't have children and is never a child.
