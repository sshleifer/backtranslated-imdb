I've read a couple of reviews of this movie recently released on Eclectic DVD. Apparently, the titles are letterbox, but the rest (most) are full screen. The first edition, in 1982 by Planet Video, is entirely letterbox. Although it was a primitive release, he got the compositions right. Later, sharper and better picture quality appeared, but they were in full screen when the DVD was. Any release of this movie should be a letterbox because it significantly adds to the visual experience of the old planet tape.
