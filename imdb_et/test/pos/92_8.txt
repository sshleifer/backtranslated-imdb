I expect this film to be a commentary in Canada - especially in Quebec. The reason for this is that Canadians have traditionally loved hockey, and the Canadians of Montreal were decades-like gods of Canada. As America, our closest thing is the New York Yankees. If you are a fan, they are the biggest and winning team in history. If you are not a fan, they are Satan's team !! Well, at least it was as I grew up in Washington, DC with Cowboys. So I'm pretty sure this movie was shown in the north, everyone had a strong emotional reaction right now - their national sport and the closest thing they had to the NHL national team. <br /> <br /> Now the comic book itself is moderately interesting when it starts and the main character talks about growing Ottawa and rooting on Canadian and Maurice "Rocket" Richard. When her mother accidentally bought her a Toronto Maple Leaf jersey and forced her to wear it, I knew immediately what a terrible and shameful thing it would be for a little boy. This ability to unite in nature - although he lives in a distant country, it is what made it a very special short film. The way other children treated her and finally her conversation with God make it a beautiful nostalgic film. Very smart and memorable.
