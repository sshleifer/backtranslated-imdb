Many older people I know do not pretend to be a famous maestro, blind, etc. - and have never been elderly, to qualify for a "realistic" summary. The small issues that were out of the way, the relationships between the characters in the film and the emotions expressed in it were quite realistic and genuine. In fact, although we are not yet 30 years old, I saw a lot of relationships and relationships between my wife and my wife. For those who do not die from the young (the film has a very big feature when the two best friends talk about young death and one of them says - and I paraphrase, we left our chance - we just have to shut it down), we are all where they are signs are a few days. I know many filmmakers would prefer them to get away from reality instead of being * it *, but even they can enjoy the sweet reminder of our mortality - and the importance of life to the full - that this movie is.
