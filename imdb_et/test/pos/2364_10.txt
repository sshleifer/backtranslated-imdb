The British more fun movie I've ever seen, "Supergrass" is a story about sex, drugs, shellfish and seaside murders. Dennis Carter (Adrian Edmonson), who is an average moor, doesn't want to impress his so-called friend Andrea (Dawn French) because he thinks he is too legal. So she can come with her on a romantic vacation to see a scheme that might impress her and entice her to spend time with her. The problem is that Dennis is lying that he is somehow involved in an international drug ring and telling him that a few policemen are hearing his boast and shouting at him. And so this witty film begins, full of slippery comedies and raw jokes. Dennis strikes a local nickname and the jealousy of many arresting officers seems to have no way out (Andrea's earlier attempts to explain this were all wrong with the fun of two officials by the stand by "Stand by Your Man". Then comes Commander Robertson (Ronald Allen), Chief Intelligence, Scotland Yard. He's working with Dennis to help him catch the drug smugglers and release what he wants. Dennis agrees and is with Harvey Duncan (Peter Richardson) and Lesley Reynolds (Jennifer Saunders). The rest is an unforgettable rib-punching experience, Robbie Coltrane as Sergeant Troy, adding a humorous color to the film. Her walk in the dry dock against Frankie Goes Hollywood's two tribes is a wonderful and probably the best scene in the history of film art. Two officers, who call Dennis, have been playing with Michael Elphick and Patrick Durkin, and Alexey Sayle is a motorcycle policeman laugh! If you want to see something good on Saturday night, I suggest you rent it. You won't forget it!
