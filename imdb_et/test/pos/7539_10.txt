Alistair Simms inspired Miss Fritton to portray upwards. This is one of the great comedy characters on the film. The Joyce Grenfell character Ruby Gates is just as wonderful. <br /> <br /> This is a film that should be stretched out on a sunny Sunday night and spent a long time, scary, striking schoolgirls just got our respect - not our ire! I hear the remake of attacking Rupert Everett as Miss Fritton? He has a hard job of competing with the captain - or should he be a lover? - Alistair Simms. <br /> <br /> Go and rent - it will win as much as it does today for comedy.
