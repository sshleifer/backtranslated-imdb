"Anne Christie" was Garbo's 14th film and the first to hear his husky Swedish voice. He plays the leading character, Anna, who has won his father Chris (owner of George F Marion's drunken ferries), and because of his failure he has to keep his head on the water. br /> <br /> Meeting Irish Matt (Charles Bickford) Can Celebrate His Turning Point ... or Do It? Garbo looks great and sounds great in this drama, which looks rather dirty and moves slowly but is still able to interest and engage the audience almost 80 years later. Marie Dressler influences the role that gave her another film success in a movie like Min and Bill, Dinner at Eight and Emma; while Marion and Bickford are more than enough. <br /> <br /> Interesting movie clip. Garbo would make better calls in the coming years, but "Anna Christie" will always be remembered the first time she spoke on the screen.
