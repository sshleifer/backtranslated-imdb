especially since I can count on romantic comedy films I've ever enjoyed on the one hand. (I can think of a number of terrible movies that have used this story - I think there was a LMN movie with Jane Seymour.) This movie is, however, a keeper. <br /> <br /> His dog is cute and sad - the dog will not be able to kill his dead woman. All his friends want him to find a replacement, and there is a fun scene where he is on a dark day and the leader is a waitress. His date is terrible, and he finds himself interested in Minnie Driver. <br /> <br /> Caroll O'Connor is also one of his last tasks, as it is a hard grandfather. Bonnie Hunt and James Belushi (the only movie I like about him) round off the comedy part of the film. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie because the story works, it's not too romantic, and doesn't offend the audience. Highly recommended 9/10.
