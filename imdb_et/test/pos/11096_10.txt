FALCON AND LUMMAN is a great example of the 80's film. Although many other decade films were generally absent, this film is a pure substance. There's nothing stylish or fake in it. It has two great performances: Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn elukestva friends Christopher Boyce and Daulton Lee. Hutton, Penn and Tom Cruise were the triumphant actors of the early 80s, all of whom saw much larger and better things (all three were in TAPS). Although the popularity of Penn and Cruise has increased, Hutton has largely forgotten and it is a shame. In fact, Hutton is the first to win an Oscar-sponsored role in ORDINARY PEOPLE in 1980, but I think his power in this film is even more prominent. <br /> <br /> Hutton pulls the post-Vietnam war rebellion into his character Chris Boyces. The crisis did not succeed at dinner with graduate Chris's love-hate relationship with his father, played by a great character actor Pat Hingle. The scene where Chris quotes poetry that his father thought he had long forgotten is particularly powerful. <br /> <br /> Chris works at the Ministry of Defense and uses his hate for US gov and its foreign policy. to sell the seemingly useless plans of old projects to the Soviet Union. He gets his friend Daulton, a hyper-drug independent server, a courier for this microfilm project plan. Although Chris does it on the basis of his beliefs, Daulton strictly does it for money. David Suchet plays a great role in Soviet communication. Penn and Suchet have real exotic chemistry and it's kind of a funny change between them. But don't make a mistake, this movie is something else. This is a serious character study of pessimism, bad self-awareness, paranoia and mistrust. <br /> <br /> Again, these leaders make this movie. Hutton offers a great deal of undervalued work like Chris, a pretty smart young man with so many options. Penn, as usual, makes a tremendous testimony to Daulton, a pathetic loser who acts before he thinks, and most of the time doesn't think at all. The ending of this fact-based film is very sad on many levels. Really powerful character training.
