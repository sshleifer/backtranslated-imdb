This game is one of the best horror / shooter games I've ever played. The plot is a bit tiny, but the game can never send you much chills and excitement. Many people dressed up the game when they found that they had no cheat codes and found very little healthy drink and ammunition. But in fact, after you have finished the game, you are familiar with more monsters and different rooms so you can easily get the second time. The puzzles are big, not too heavy, not too simple. There are many different monsters so you won't get bored. And there are lots of play areas. You feel you're playing a good novel by Stephen King. It's nice and horrible. Pick this game cheap and have fun.
