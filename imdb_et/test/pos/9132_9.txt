I think Melville intended to define the movie as cool; At the end of the 60s and early 70s, this cool approach is the same discrete quirkiness. The complicated and fatalistic story of LE CERCLE ROUGE is also the role of Deloni, Bourvili, Volonté and Montand in defining roles. <br /> <br /> Bourvil is a police officer with three cats and a daily routine in his apartment. Delon is a hood. Montand is a sick, unsuccessful cop. Volonté plays the escaped suspect. LE CERCLE ROUGE is of course much higher than the movie; Melville uses his methods with a long, vague, detailed description of each degree, etc. But is this particular action drama much better than his other films? And it is very unlikely if they are so much better. LE CERCLE ROUGE's look is very peculiar to Melville, very melville. Bourvil brings his handicraft and Montand plays the best role in this film; its function is unexpected with heat. Or masks; Still imagination is inspired, economic, but desirable. and the fact that he is not a genius does not mean that he should be treated as a fourth-speed actor. He's good, he can wear the proximity of Bourvili and Montand. <br /> <br /> Only ten years. Before LE CERCLE ROUGE did Melville make a boring general cheer (starring) at the end of the 50s? And after only a decade, he is in complete drama of this rather amazing action. Stylishly, it's successful. Now I think I'm rather one. <br /> <br /> LE CERCLE ROUGE is a drama? Melville scores.
