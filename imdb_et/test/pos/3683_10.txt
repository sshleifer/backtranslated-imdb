Unconditional Love is one of the best films I've ever seen. This is an emotional roller. One of my favorite scenes is the pub scene. If Dirk tells Grace that he doesn't want to go to the pub because the villagers don't like him, then you expect the worst. When the old woman keeps her glass up and says, â€œVictor Fox's memory and the entire pub follows suit, I wanted to cry. Funeral is hysterical! Julie does it in her typical Julie Andrews style. Johnathan Pryce is a wonderful Victor. Grace is one of Kathy Bates' best roles. Meredith Eaton steals almost every scene in which she is. Rupert Everett does some of his best work unconditionally as Dirk. The relationship between Rupert and Meredith led me to another hysteria. On that day and questioning, the age of gay rights is, I think, this movie should all look like. Like a homosexual man in my late 40s, I have seen people lose everything as a loved one dies. So it is expensive for everyone to be involved in making this movie.
