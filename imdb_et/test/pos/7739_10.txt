What is Prospero in the twentieth century, what is his life? Why should a man choose to live on his island with his daughter and girlfriend? Because it's too hard to live and love in "civilization" under good conditions. This man (John Cassavetes) is a broken hearted giant who can steer the storm. He has power, strength, but he is human. The theme of this extraordinary film is the deep love of life. The actor is incredible, all with John Cassavetes, Gena Rowlands, Vittorio Gasman and Shakespeare and paul mazursky. Don't miss this mistake, this movie is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen. And I've seen many movies.
