Bergman is a supreme comedy leader and writer. This is evident in the "En Lecture I Spots", where the comics range from deep but very emotional scenes of pure slapstick. This film paves the way for Bergman's later comedies "Sommarnattens leende" and "Kvinnodröm", all starring Gunnar Björnstrand and Eva Dahlbeck. This is a great movie to start your Bergman experience, depicting emotional problems for both young and old. Martin Bodin's cinematic art is amazing, for example, on a picnic. In short, the film is an excellent example of successful comedy, the depth of which is even beyond Bergman's own comedy.
