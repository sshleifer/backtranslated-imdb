This is probably the best film director Hector Babenco. This shows that foreigners do not know the Brazilian reality, which is the same reality that haunts all Latin American countries, poverty and survival instincts. This reality is most affected by children who usually leave orphans, or have given up from poor parents that they have lost the difference between crime, prostitution and crime several times in the "dog food" society. With a very well done and no no frills approach, this movie will send you a great story plot to be in the movie's collection. The most important role was played by Fernando Ramos da Silva, a young boy who fell on a wave of crime, killing some years later at the time of robbery. I suggest people watch the movie "Who Killed Pixot?" so you can better understand the life of these symbols. Some other characters in the film had a similar fate, some died and others were in prison. But this movie will last a long time in your memory
