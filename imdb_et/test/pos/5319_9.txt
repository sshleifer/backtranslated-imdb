I remember seeing the trailer of this movie and I knew I had to see that movie. It looked like something that would be at my alley. <br /> <br /> "Leland United States" is a terrible movie. It won't leave you with a nice, pleasant ending, but a sad and empty feeling. And when I say it leaves you with an "empty" feeling, I don't mean halbana. I believe you need to fill this empty feeling with your thoughts about the characters and the general motives of people and how they act as parts of society. <br /> <br /> Ryan Gosling is perfectly Leland. He's intelligent but stoic. I like to tell the movie with his magazine. Supporting cast is also terrible. Kevin Spacey is as good as ever, and Don Cheadle is amazing as a Leland teacher and mentor. <br /> <br /> It was a great story and it is very smart and thoughtful. I highly recommend it.
