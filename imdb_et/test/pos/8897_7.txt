It is a shame that Asterix and his friend Obelix do not get the widespread recognition of the world that other comic artists are getting it. <br /> <br /> This is another funny Asterix comic that has been captured with entertainment. Animation is great and voice characterization is good even when sync is a little out. The music and the score fit well with the story and the slip of some modern musical numbers is a nice touch. <br /> <br /> Operating time seems short and although it is not the best Asterix story or the most advanced comic, it's a good clean fun. Modern (Disney-like) animation captures kids, Asterix fans and newcomers ... Enjoy Gaul's adventure!
