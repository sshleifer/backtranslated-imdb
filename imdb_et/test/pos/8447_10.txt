I work in a nuclear power plant so I get out of these answers. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I do. Go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palisades_Nuclear_Generating_Station to see where I work. <br /> <br /> I couldn't think of a safer industry. events are as small as paper cuts. Any problem that has been identified as a potential concern for nuclear, radiological or industrial safety will be reported immediately in the corrective action process. they think.
