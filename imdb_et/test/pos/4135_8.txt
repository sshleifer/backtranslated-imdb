I first saw the story of Buddy Holly when I was about seven years old. I had no idea who Buddy Holly was, nor can I remember what it was that made me sit in front of the TV set to HBO and watch this inclusive biopsy. I remember that I realized it was (somewhat) a real story for someone who actually lived. I remember music, great songs that I still love (I can't believe Gary Busey was singing his songs and so well - what a go!) Then the end came. He died. His madness died. I couldn't believe it. I had no warning, no prior knowledge like most of the film. It taught me a tough lesson about life and how it doesn't follow the rules that most movies teach us. I just watched the movie again tonight and started again ... and a little sad. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, but I admit that you are a bit biased.
