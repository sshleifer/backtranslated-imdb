I stumbled upon this film at random. I traveled a couple of years ago and this film was in a cable in the canal for a night at the end of the hotel. Not much else and I thought I'd watch it for about 20 to 30 minutes until I decided to go to bed. Needless to say, I stayed up and watched the whole movie. The plot was very interesting and makes you wonder if there was no SS who did it or at least thought about doing it. I've been looking for this movie. I have even sent and sent an email to a manufacturing company, but I wasn't sure if it would ever make a DVD, but said there was always hope. If anyone finds this movie, mark it here where you found it.
