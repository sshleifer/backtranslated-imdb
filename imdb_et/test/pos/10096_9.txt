If such a thing as a beautiful horror, this film is one of the best in this genre. This is a horror film that, despite the fact that the gore scenes are not empty, rely on psychology and tense masterpieces to create excitement. And this is one of those beautifully filmed movies, where every scene is a world of full characters and details that are all suitable and a genre that can be called but beautiful. <br /> <br /> This is not a simple story where two sisters returned to their father's and mother's mansion after some time in a psychiatric facility. They cannot cope with the death of their mother and they are trying to protect their world by protecting them against the adult world. Thus, the film seems to be in its outer layer. In fact, the film slowly develops into some very different, but no frames have disappeared to convey exciting beauty, so I'm not saying much more. Look at it, this is one of the best genres of Far Eastern horror movies that recently won the world cinema and that really shows that they managed to do it for good reasons.
