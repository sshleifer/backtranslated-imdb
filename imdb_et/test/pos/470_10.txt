This film is enthralling and complex, maintaining a simple beauty. Our two characters come together on the basis of shared curiosity and loneliness, but it's a stepping stone for learning these people, they are lifestyles and pasts that support it. The two main players (Bohl, Brundruge) were at the moment two players I have ever seen. % 100 plausible, they are transporting the audience seemingly effortlessly to their world. Acting seamlessly with the actors in Bechard's beautiful, realistic dialogue, his true direction draws the story of a striking and moving finale. This film is visual, softer, increasing the intensity of the story. Soundtrack serenades the viewer, soothing but drawing the emotional content of the movie. I think this project is not a masterpiece. intriguing.
