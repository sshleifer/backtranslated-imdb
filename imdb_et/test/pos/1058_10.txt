I've always loved old movies, but it's one of my top 10 favorites ... it has all the charm, the 1940s peculiarity and good old-fashioned romance and it's fun! Barbara Stanwick plays an independent single woman who writes cooking articles to a famous newspaper ... provided she is married at home. Even the magazine's president is under this mistake. Enter the beautiful GI, provided by talented Dennis Morgan. His simple desire is to stay at the Inn Inn, where he writes and relaxes so well with his famous home-made food. Now she has to find a way to save her work and reputation ... add that her groom is quick to make the knot independent. Humor is great and the chemistry between the leading characters is very fun. Throw a nickname "Cuddles" (who fits in with that name), it will become even more wonderful. It has become my black-and-white movie that I go to cup with cocoa every Christmas period. An excellent and enjoyable movie that can be enjoyed during Christianity or at any time!
