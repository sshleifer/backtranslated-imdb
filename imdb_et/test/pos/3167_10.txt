At first, I couldn't tell if it was a feature film or a documentary. The day after, I had a unique film after a taste or perhaps a revelation. Film is a human effort to destroy everything that exists, including life on earth. Lead is helpless and cold. She is like everything she wants to enrich, laugh, travel, eat and amuse. He moves from one place to another in a huge RV without direction or motive only with time and entertainment. By the end of the year it is too late. After the first US look, it had grown for me as a custom dream where there was nothing more than a strange experience on earth. I am an artist and a Buddhist, and this film is transmitted to my mind. It was an ideal implementation of uncertainty. It may seem strange, but somehow this film can touch me deeply, like no other. I recommend it.
