What to say about a movie like Rock Star? Much Really! This is the type of film that is slam for critics. It's also a movie I, like a MAJOR Hard Rock fan, who didn't really like it, though all knowingly knowing about many of his mistakes and movies, while a somewhat decent effort left to escape the greatness and become a rock movie classic. Oh well .... <br /> <br /> I loved this movie and saw it over and over again, but I know it's just based on my personal taste. Rock Star is a movie that likes everyone who has experienced rock or hard stone lifestyle elements and wants to go through nostalgia. It was a great time for metal heads. And it's nice that we have a movie that actually fixes it (a lot of many non-rock fans forgot) effectively, as I think Rock Star has done. This is one of the strengths of the film, the concert material. You feel like your right with them and how could any hard rock fan love it? When the atmosphere is set, Rock Star gets 10 out of 10. You can also get 10 out of 10 for pure entertainment. If you just want to let yourself and your freely flow into the good memories of the good times, it's a movie for you. That's why I loved this movie. <br /> <br /> But it's not a great movie. I understand, and if it were my real job to watch movies professionally, I would probably be a little difficult about it. The problem with the rock star is the formation of character. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with character development is that there's nothing. Missing. The film has little and far between scenes, but they are out there - ATTENTION: WARNING SUMMARY: 3 examples - 1) when Izzy debuts on stage (including autumn) <br /> <br /> 2) First competition with Emily Izzy.) <br /> <br /> 3) At the beginning of a small upside down when the original singer is accidentally fired (fired) - the whole "normal business" brings out what comes. It is played very effectively. <br /> <br /> But the problem is that nothing comes. In this film, nobody has a characteristic development for anyone, people are simply touched, but never fully studied. I don't think this is the fault of the actors / actors, especially Anniston, who is trying hard, they just can't do much work. It's just that the script was weak and lacked the ability to overcome the "formula" feeling to the real depth of the movie. The rock star was so candied as it was from time to time (even at the end), it was almost ridiculous. And while the scenes I mentioned were remarkable and highly believable, unfortunately there wasn't much in the movie. <br /> <br /> The second reviewer mentioned the lack of structure to the end and I agree, but it was actually no lack of construction. WHY IS Izzy finally leaving? Because she leaves her girlfriend and the band doesn't let her write songs? It tests the limits of credibility. And to be honest, it was just a cold. There is no point and no reality at all. <br /> <br /> Watching this is almost like watching a movie where its creators said: OK, it happens here and then it happens and then it happens and then it etc. etc. Finally, it is no longer a movie from a shop that has dreamed, it is just another thickly formulated love story. And you don't know why there are so many details left out ... <br /> <br /> I hope I don't want to do Rock Star's hard stuff because I really loved it, but not for the right reason. I would have liked to love it as a great movie about high and low rock celebrity. Instead, I loved it for 80-year-olds, clothes, hair, lights, life ... although many others loved it, I suspect that most of them are people who lived in the life of rock fans, as I did or some playing. I would have liked to see the film and just pay tribute to the fact that it is a clich√© rather than a well-spoken film. I think one problem was length. I myself hate long movies, but it was one that really should have been longer if the movie was really right, the length didn't even feel - the story is just so much that it would be as short as it was - this is one reason why the story or human being in the film does not seem to be much. <br /> <br /> So wind down - this is a movie that can be a great hit - but not a great movie. Check it out for fun. See it for entertainment. Look at it to go back to this great, big room in a time when metal was not just a part of life, but it was life and these non-rock fans see it to get a bit of a glimpse into life that meant and means so much to so many of us .
