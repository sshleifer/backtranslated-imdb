First of all, I've done further research on the film. Firslty, Jules Dassin led and acted in this highly imaginative and different film-cutting film. Secondly, it was a very low budget film created at Rennaissance, the main moment of the film noir. Thirdly, the jewelers where the robbery was attempted are the real jeweler. Rifif producers asked them to film surprisingly (I quote in Jules Dassini's recent interview on this subject, "surprisingly, for some, not very obvious reason, they were happy about the idea that a criminal movie would be put in their store." characters and plot are so beautiful with their surroundings to add their praise to say this, some may say it was a typical Hollywood movie, on the contrary, it is the basis for a regular plot of a Hollywood criminal movie. <br /> <br /> Laslty, I would like to say that I support this fresh idea from a movie, where not only one side wins, and this side is not always good, once, I can say that the film is not predictable!
