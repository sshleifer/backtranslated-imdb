An interesting comedy that takes place in December 1945 from Stockholm to Berlin. Can't help a bad writer / critic who finishes his work and jumps on the train to Berlin. His goal is to make a difference and to participate in building a new united Europe after the war ends. <br /> <br /> I like the black and white format of the movie, as well as the closed terrain train movement. <br /> <br /> In this movie, Robert Gustafsson makes a classic "Gustafsson" role. If you are his fan, this movie is for you! <br /> <br /> Philosopher Wittgenstein, saying "One can never assume that something is what he seems to be" is referred to on several occasions.
