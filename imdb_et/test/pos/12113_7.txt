Lloyd Hamilton was one of the most creative (and most fun) comedians of all the silent movies. Why is he completely forgotten? Unfortunately, at the beginning of the 1930s, the Fox warehouse lost a lot of original negatives of his films. Hamilton was neither beautiful nor harsh as Chaplin, Keaton, and Lloyd; nor was he like Raymond Griffith. And unlike Harry Langdon and (again) Chaplin, Hamilton didn't try the audience's sympathy. <br /> <br /> However, his films were very popular at the time of their initial release and they remain fun today. Oscar Levant reiterated that he asked Chaplin if there was any other comedian he had ever envied, and Chaplin immediately named Lloyd Hamilton. The most frequently portrayed character on the Hamilton screen - a fixed-bound naff, hard-to-do walks, and duck-like walking - was later adapted by the Vaudeville comedian Eddie Garr (father of Teri Garri) and was further adapted by Jackie Gleason's 1950s TV label "The Poor Soul". <br /> <br /> Roscoe Arbuckle's pseudonymously "Films" is one of Hamilton's most innovative shorts and it's fun. First of all, we see him as a statesman, saying goodbye to his family outside the house of his siblings, on his way to a big city. Then he steps away from the house and sees it in a big city, the traffic flourishing around him! <br /> <br /> Ultimately, our hero reaches a restaurant (unredeemed, but it is Montmartre's caf√© in the center of LA), where all filmmakers eat. There's an amusing gag when a Hamiltonian bumper figure meets three costumes and makeups like Washington, Lincoln, and Roosevelt: this gag would have been funny if the impostors would see the originals. Finally, our boy meets at the table, hoping to hear fame. Of course, entering a restaurant and sitting at the next table is a big movie star ... anyone other than Lloyd Hamilton! There's a very good double exposure there - joining is almost invisible - when Lloyd Hamilton himself welcomes Lloyd Hamilton as a statesman. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the Hamiltonian peak of creativity was very short. He started his career as a filmmaker in crude oil films as half of his twin deeds (Ham and Bud, against Bud Duncan) and had a short and blazing era in short time in short times. Sound films were not kind to Hamilton, and in some early speech samples he was quickly put on the list. Then he died young. Luckily, "Movies" is a pretty funny and great introduction to this unique comic style. I appreciate it in 10 out of 10.
