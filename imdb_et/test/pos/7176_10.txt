This is a documentary, unlike others. It has so many layers and shows us so much that analyzing this procedure is almost impossible. The documentary, William Greaves, shows us the process of film making from another perspective. We see the actors, the director, the sound team and all the others who are trying to catch up, fight and make this movie a success. If it were almost making a movie, it would be normal. What Greaves does is making it more difficult for the team to be filmed, and then filmed by another team so that only the other team will film the whole thing. Three cameras, each with a different purpose. It has almost a dizzying effect on you, but at the same time it is exciting. I like the parts where the team organizes together and discusses what's going on. Even they are a little dark in what Greaves is trying to do. The party sees this as an experiment, while the other half sees it as a chaotic and confusing failure. No matter which side you choose, you cannot claim that Greaves cannot participate in this process.
