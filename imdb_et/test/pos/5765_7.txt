bottom of your absolute highest perfection. who ever says the comedy of lollipops is dead and boring is totally wrong. not that this movie is only masculine in nature. this is another high quality British dark comedy that has a lot of fun, not violence, but it helps if you allow your senses and laugh at all this stupidity. <br /> <br /> This is a real example of successful British ingenuity and home-made talent hats for them. At the level of performance, it reminds me very much of Marx brothers' previous work, where the same level of enthusiasm and dedication is in their style of action, resulting in a performance where the audience can really involve the desire of the innate person to see other sufferers who are still separated and still feel secure, similar to many TV show principles. a truly wonderful bit of manipulation that leaves all the parties more familiar.
