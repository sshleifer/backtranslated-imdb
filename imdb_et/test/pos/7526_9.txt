This is the first Pepe Le Pew comic and in some ways it is very similar to the later, but in some other strange way it is not. Although the subject of Pepe's affection is the cat, it is strange that it is a BOY cat! The whole problem arises because the cat is tired of abusing others and dresses like a skunk and tries to smell like a skunk so it can be left alone. Unfortunately, it attracts our hero Pepe. Most of the activities are quite typical until the very funny and unexpected end - and this makes it one of the best in the real series. Great animation (although the style differs from the later examples), great writing and a good sense of humor make it one keeper.
