This movie is entertainment. Imagine your friends with whom you love spending time, those you know outside, becoming a bit stupid and maybe taking a sign or two. That's the movie. An inventive script and a brilliant implementation. This does not mean the masses' pleasure with this substance, it is about having fun with great talented people. What I'm sure they all meant when they logged on to it. The above review sounds totally unfair and I think the person who wrote it was wrong in watching the movie. At a mild time, this is a great dignity if you care. <br /> <br /> Well done work, I thought it was a great movie. I would look at it before the North American standard every day. <br /> <br /> In short, this is not the best movie you will ever see, but it will have many moments. I haven't laughed at that age long ago.
