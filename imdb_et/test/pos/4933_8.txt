As I spend my vacation, the television series, which was broadcast between 1990 and 1992, closes. I've always enjoyed what it is. I've never compared the series with the old-fashioned Looney Tunes. Video release was divided into four or five episodes (I don't remember how I write it) for television, and it's in the episode list of the series. It is good for this series that all of the key features of the story play a big role. We see what they all do during the summer holidays in different parts of the world. Elmyra is with her parents in Safaris, Plucky and Hampton, crossing the country with Hampton's parents, Fifi on some beaches, etc. The climax is very good, and finally all the Tiny Toon characters will be reunited at the beginning of the new year with "Looniversity", ending with the good running of this TV show.
