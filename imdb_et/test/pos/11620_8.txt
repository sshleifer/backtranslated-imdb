"Unconscious cruelty" must be one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. It is still extremely grim and enjoyable, so politically correct mainstream horror garbage fans should not bother. It is extremely strange, cruel and disruptive, so strange cinema fans are not disappointed. My favorite segment of "Unconscious cruelty" is "Human Larvae", which shows us the twisted relationship between a young man and his pregnant sister. The birthplace is especially disgusting and not just forgotten. The last segment of "The Right Brain / Martyr" must be seen to be believed.It is incredibly harsh and blasphemy when it comes to genital mutilation and terrible torture. We see Jesus Christ, who is caught with three naked women who injure her, hang her flesh from her chest, tie her wound to her knees and pee her. There is also the shape of Jesus with the projection of this swastika. "Subsonscious Cruelty" is a truly memorable film that should be viewed by extreme cinema fans.
