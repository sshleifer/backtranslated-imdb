COOLEY HIGH on the surface is a comedy of a beautiful ensemble that masks a periodic piece (in the early 60's, with a flawless Motown soundtrack). But there is so much more to this movie - it gets better every time I see it. Unknown knowledge (at this time) is great, and it is remarkable as a black-and-white film that does not belong to any of the Blaxpoitation clich√©s - sometimes COOLEY HIGH looks like a nearly fresh, neo-realistic film, from time to time it shows a rather narrow budget, but the limitations serve movie is good - here is the emotional and honesty that gives the film a direct shortcoming in most of the movies with similar thinking (eg Schultz's later CAR WASH, which was more popular, but largely meaningless, with a warm heart, but also in life; It was celebrated, some movie movies seem to know it today. Their loss - it's a subtle, subtle film. <br /> <br /> Bare Bones and Scanning DVD (Without Widescreen!?) Prove how little maintenance is this great movie.
