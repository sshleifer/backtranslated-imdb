The Jack Black and Kyle Gass team promoted their band Tenacious D in this Rock Classic called Tenacious D In The Pick Of Destiny. Jack Black and Kyle Gass invented their Rock Opera ... it was like Rock 'N' Role opera. Some of the most twisted events took place in this movie .... big leg .... fungus .... and finally when they took the stone. Classic formed Tenacious D .... one of the best films I've seen for a long time. The last few things I saw in the theater were stupid, but this film tends to. It really made me laugh. The whole base is Jack Black to find his rock partner in Los Angeles. His partner is Kyle Gass and a man who has always been bald. They work together to find this magical choice that can make a very terrible musician. Finally, they make and steal the Rock 'N' Roll Museum. On the way they meet a stranger, Tim Robbins played. They give the club a chance to win their prize money if the owner grabs it and all the time he was a devil and he fights D with Rock Off. D doesn't win, but the devil's horn falls, sending him back to hell. Therefore, LONG LIVE D !!!!!!!!!!
