I watched this French horror movie last night and liked it a lot. The whole film takes place in a prison chamber with three prisoners, who find a series of hand-written journalism that had fled the prison 20 years earlier, but without leaving the cell. When they look through the diary, they discover that they are black arts and commands that can be a way out of the cell and freedom. What they know is something completely different and frightening. I like low budget horror movies that deliver good quality and say goodbye. This film does just that, despite some time spent. The result and horror they are firing is very interesting to me and I enjoyed the ride. Not much gore, but it does not fit the story, although it is very good.
