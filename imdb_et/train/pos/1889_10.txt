My family has been following Arthur Bach and the Stammer after the film's first appearance. We have most of the rows memorized. I looked at it two weeks ago and I still hesitated with the simple humor and life that Dudley Moore represents. Liza Minelli did a great job because it is not her biggest fan. This movie just makes me watch movies. My favorite scene is when Arthur visits his groom's house. His conversation with the butler and Susan's father is adjacent. My nickname on my computer is my understanding of "would you wait in the library" followed by Arthur's answer: "Yes, I would like the bathroom to be out of the question". "Arthur is really funny stuff!"
