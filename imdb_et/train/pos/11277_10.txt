Tarzan and Jane are happily living in the jungle. Some men look for ivory and take Jane to civilization. But Jane loves Tarzan and refuses to leave. One man falls in love with Jane and has decided to take him back, even if it means killing Tarzan. <br /> <br /> This is a rarity - a sequel that is better than the original. "Tarzan, Ape Man" of 1932 was good, but he had some terrible special effects and sort of pulled out. It has much better effects and it is a lot of adults. There are tons of rough racism (a black person is let go of a dead point - and nobody really cares), but it was 1934. There's also a lot of blood, brains and violence (for a 1934 movie), and uncut publications are on Jane's long underwater swim naked! There is also obvious sexual content, and Tarzan and Jane carry something apart and (that is, they sleep together and have sex - without marriage). It won't bother anyone today, but in 1934 it was quite extreme. <br /> <br /> Next to the film, the film is well-oriented, very fast and full of adventure and excitement. Seeing Weissmuller in such a dirty lion dress is definitely eye care and Jane's clothes are also quite revealing. I still think Maureen O'Sullivan is as bad as Jane, but Weismuller is perfect as Tarzan. All others are fine. <br /> <br /> It's just the best Weismuller - O'Hara Tarzan out there. Well worth noting, but not for kids!
