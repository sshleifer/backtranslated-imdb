Before I saw the people, I had the impression that the silent comedy was essentially sliding and only a little. I could not imagine how screen comedy could be possible without a strong talk of word or multiple exercises. But this masterful film proved me wrong. In my opinion, Davies was probably the biggest comedian who came before Lucille Ball. I mention Lucy mainly because Davies' motives and facial expressions reminded me I didn't know if Davies was not one of Ball's main effects. It comes from 21-year-olds who had never seen a silent comedy before, and I have to say that no matter how many period-specific references you actually get (I probably didn't), it won't be forgotten by Film. You probably even laugh more than you would be the most comedy of speaking. This is not only my favorite silent comedy but all of my ten favorite comedies.
