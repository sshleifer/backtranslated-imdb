This small episode of Smallville is probably the best episode of collapse. This is for a number of reasons. For example, this series will return to some roots. He welcomes Lionel's return of allegedly long absence with the Luthorcorp record office Metropolis. This room has not been small for a long time, and its reopening brings back many memories of the small town's past. Not to mention that Lionels conversations with Lex are always admirable. <br /> <br /> Another nice return is, well uv, is Bart Allen (aka Impulse), AC (aka Aquaman) and Victor Stone (aka Cyborg). Steven Deknight not only connects former judges, but connects them to the Smallville formula in such a unique way that it almost seems to be a feature-length movie. <br /> <br /> From there you get the basic story, the green arrow forms too, trying to blow 33.1, Bart gets stuck, Clark rescues him and the facility blows into the kingdom. Everything is good and graceful, with good hiding, action, tempo and intercourse. Oh, and Cyborg has some cool new updates that are right for the judge's character :). <br /> <br /> Music is probably what changes this episode well. When you remember correctly, Steven Deknight was the first episode from the 4th season Agless. It was a mediocre episode, but something seemed inappropriate. maybe it was music or actor, or what at the end is, "we didn't find you, you found us", people of this type lose faith in the formula. But, fortunately, Steve Deknight redeemed himself in this justice episode. <br /> <br /> I had some justice rights that made it completely unfulfilled 10. First of all, too much fun in the Ridge facility. I mean, it would have been so much cooler to say that Green Arrow and Cyborg took Oliver off the bike (rememeber arrow arrow). Clark and Impulse should probably have run and the aquarium should have been swimming on another route. But it was so incredibly cheesy, it nocked 2 points across 10. <br /> <br /> Second, another cheesy moment, not as bad as the first, but when Green Arrow got "let's save the world". It made me brighter. All in all, the actors outperform considerations of acting performances, music, trends and product values, and this is still one of the best episodes in Smallville history and perhaps the 2nd best episode of the 6th season. > <br /> of 7 out of 10 ...
