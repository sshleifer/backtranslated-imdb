"Matador" stands for Pierce Brosnani as a burned assassin. She has gone to James Bond in seeds, too tight, harsh clothes, gold chains and ugly hair. Our fighting assassin, Julian Noble, is in Mexico, trying to get him back. Staying at the same hotel is a pleasant, happy, happy businessman Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) who is trying to restore his balance. Danny is desperately ready to close the deal and return to his wife in Denver (Hope Davis) with good news. Wright is convinced that Noble reveals certain techniques he has shown in bullfighting. Noble is finally targeting her employers and showing up in Denver. <br /> <br /> Writer and director Richard Shepard made this pleasant film at Austin Film Festival after Q&A. Shepard was also fortunate. After losing the victim to his representative and rejection of recent scripts, he decided to write a story no one would buy and create the character no one wants to play. Then Pierce Brosnan called. Brosnan restores the balance of this film. (Bond has life!) She has a wonderful elegant self-exclusive comedy. Don't miss it. <br /> <br /> Keep closing credits to see what filmmakers say about bullfighting. I look forward to more Richard Shepard projects.
