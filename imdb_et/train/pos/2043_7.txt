I just saw this movie last night at the Toronto Film Festival, where he played part of Midnight Madness. The truth, the only reason I went to this movie was that he shared his name with Radiohead's song and also because my friend had bought tickets so I didn't really have the choice: -I went to wait it should be something of lamb's silence , but it turned out to be half shivering. Someone has already mentioned that no characters are pleasant and it is absolutely right. I really don't care less about the fact that Potente's character's strokes were robbed. I took the homeless to make it alive in Potente's character, just getting desserts. Christopher Smith has definitely done a good job with the visual side of the film. But this story is rather weak, but again, the whole idea of ​​the movie was to scare you into a mess and it did it quite effectively. The result of Bristol's The Insects was top-notch. What is more, really frightened me among me. <br /> <br /> The director was really decent and was quite fun during the Q&A session. I really hope he can make better movies in the future. <br /> <br /> It's just for genre fans, but I would recommend it to non-fans. It was a fun ride.
