Although the film is clearly dated, viewers can easily identify this timeless and very funny downhill story with an unhappy Buster. Buster struggles with inconvenient coefficients at three different ages: Stone Age, Roman Age, and Moden Timing, playing almost the same character by changing the landscape to help us identify different "ages". In this movie, we see one of the earliest comic "caveman" stereotypes that win their love not with romance but with vigorous force, but also with the wretched twists of the Roman gladiator, two comedy sketches that have been like spoofes long before. Mel Brooks "World History: Part I". The theme underlying the film is simple but convincing: although time may have changed, we are still faced with the same struggles, even today, that we fought in prehistoric times to "win the girl" (remember this is a 1923 American theme where chauvinism was still in vogue). It is interesting to watch this movie eighty years later and consider how dramatically things have now become the "modern times" of this film.
