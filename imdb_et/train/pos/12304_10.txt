this is a great movie. I like it and how it climbs to get ink and the skeletons are pursuing him, but fortunately he threw them away, opened the window and didn't even notice them. xiao qian is also very beautiful. And when he pulled the needle up, his hysterical was Wu's butt. and when he says that love is the greatest thing on earth, the two swords are great. then also the part where he eats his buns, watching the man kill many people. then you see him singing poems when he ran to the wolf to escape. love scenes are romantic, xiao qian and and see together. add comic timing, giant language and u horror, romance, comedy, all at once. not to mention the great special effects of the 90s.
