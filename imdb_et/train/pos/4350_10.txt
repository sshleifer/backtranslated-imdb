This movie is one of those that is very sensitive to it. It's a reputation, grounded, and movie that makes you think ... and smile. Paul Reiser and Peter Falk will take you on a road you will not forget. The soundtrack is beautifully versatile and fit; and the film itself is like a breath of fresh air. It definitely deserves recognition for both the film and the actors! Finally, a work of art that differs from the obvious love story and the frequent special effects that we see today. Never in my film have I felt the feeling of going out of the film with such a deep sense of warmth and heart; because it seemed like someone was just wrapped around this fluffy fleece. To see this movie, you have to find real treasure and joy.
