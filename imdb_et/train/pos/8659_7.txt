In a way, this movie reminded me of "Jump Flash Jack". Remember the Whoopi Goldberg crushing machine? Whoopi zoned sedatives? Whoopi like a dark lemon and imitating Mick Jagger? Great moments were definitely shot in the movie, but the movie still sucks, right? So I feel "Rich In Love". The man hears his wife for the first time singing. Post-coital teens talk about the nature of love. Albert Finney eats ice cream from the bucket and on the second arena there is a beautiful wake up for his missing wife. Alfre Woodard adds another colorful character to his exemplary wardrobe. But here's just the whisper of the plot and you can't wait until it moves. Only when the former Go-Gos 'Charlotte Caffey' The Graces picks up the big pop music, the picture wakes up ... and then it's over! <br /> <br /> This image is equivalent to a lazy summer day deep in southern America.
