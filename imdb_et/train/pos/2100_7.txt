Before he went into politics or public service, Glenda Jackson was one of Britain's best actors. This movie shows her talent despite having a supporting role in the celebrity that includes Julie Christie as Kitty, the British Royal Captain's wife, who has lost her memory for the past 20 years, and Jenny played an almost unknown American Ann-Margret sister. Alan Bates plays a captain who suffers from a loss of memory caused by a chorus attack during World War I. Sir Ian Holm has a smaller place than his treating doctor. You will see familiar faces like Sheila Keith, Patsy Byrne and Frank Finlay. You can't help but see how Glenda plays a cunning housewife and first true master love, but they came from different classes. It's not the biggest movie, but it's good to see Glenda's amazing talent. He is still a fantastic actor, comedy or drama. He makes Margaret Gray a pleasant character and you see why the rally captain falls in love with him.
