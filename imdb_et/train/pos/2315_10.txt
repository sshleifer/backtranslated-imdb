In this movie it is so worth it that it's hard to know where to start with praise. Let me first express my admiration for the perfect depiction of Reese Witherspoon. The fact that his performance is in great pain is indeed a praise. Robert Mulligan is rarely disappointed by those who admired his work. The frame of each man's frame is proof that the film is the best.
