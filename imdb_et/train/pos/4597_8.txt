For the first time, having gained the fame of Drunken Master, Jackie Chan again drew attention to the 1983 project A, which was a very enjoyable pirate that reused it for a big star. By the time the police story appeared two years later, the extraordinary leap that surrounded Jackie reached his zenith and the crowds saw to see this awesome stop, cruel martial arts, and questionable comedy. It broke numerous cash registers and inspired a 50% increase in police recruits, but 20 years later - is it good? <br /> <br /> As a feature film, the police story undoubtedly persists. There are a number of terrible fighting scenes, some stuntwork that resemble Chani's best hero, Buster Keaton, and compelling as too violent climate change. Jackie's performance is also very strong, and although frequent intrusions into working comedy are only a bit of a dull effect, her charisma carries it. In addition, when our hero is a border poppy whose neglect puts others at risk, Jackie took an important luck ... though if anyone seems to have noticed! However, thanks to the police story as the ambiguity of the film, which was blurred by the simple "Good vs. Evil" battleground, and although it is barely brother Karamazov, the film represented a remarkable and commendable transition from conventional ideas to depicting such uncertainty. In short, it remains a high quality "popcorn" movie * (although you can empty your stomach, as many blind people push or deposit in the last scene of the movie in glass showcases) - a strong, sparkling entertaining movie for its best period.
