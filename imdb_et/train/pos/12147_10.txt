Back to the third chamber, there is a comic sequence for the epic 36th Shaolin House, where Gordon Liu played Shan Te, a young man who became a monk and an awesome fighter. At this stage Liu plays an unlucky loser who has to learn kung fu after beating his friends. He imitates the original Shan Te, tries all sorts of tricks to study at Shaolin Temple and finally has some unique skills to fight some bullying bosses. It's a classic light-hearted martial arts story with Shaw Brothers' Ace Production Values ​​and Lui Chia Liang's solid base. Choreography is fantastic, be it a fight or a hit comedy, and a performance by Gordon Liu, like others, especially the sympathetic monk makes a great work for the material. The film is less epic or deeper than some other stars and definitely has bigger, more violent and more extensive Shaw Brothers films. But few have such magical mixing, unique training and struggle, a subtle but warming story of a meaningless man from good. Full of joy filled with white joy, it is impossible not to give it the most.
