Freddy's Dead: The final nightmare (1991) was the last film featuring Freddy Krueger as a solo (not as a unit or co-star). The years of slaughter have gone to Springwood. It has come to a small city that has become a virtual ghost town. Parents who killed Freddy Krueger so many years ago have paid the final price. Only mad madness lives and survivors are scattered everywhere. But this does not prevent Fred from searching for his final revenge. No matter how they try to stop him, he always comes back more. But this time he explains a little more about his old life. Can children eventually stop Freddy? What is the secret that is buried in Freddy's twisted mind? To find out, you must look at Freddy's dead. Finally, the 3-D was originally filmed. <br /> <br /> An appropriate way to complete a franchise. Freddy learns something about himself and his perverted life, and he goes into the bang! Add Zane, Yaphet Kotto and Freddy Krueger in this last part. Especially Rosanne, Tom Arnold and Johnny Depp perform. A whole lot better than the last, but it's full of a couple of dated jokes. If you like this series, you don't want to miss it. <br /> <br /> I have to recommend this movie to Freddy fans.
