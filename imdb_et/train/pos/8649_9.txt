I bought it a while ago, but somehow I missed it until the last night. I like Juliette Lewis, though I am indifferent to Brad Pitt. After this look, I have to admit that he is a very fine actor - his character was completely plausible, and I didn't think of "Brad Pitt" at all. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Duchovny can't tell David the same. I am a fan of X-Files and I had to double-check this movie as I thought it was done a few years later. I like Duchovny, but I found my character here a little bit two-dimensional, except when she does voice transmissions. This part was strong, looked like a character, good intonation, and so on. Otherwise, I thought of "Agent Mulder", which is a pity. Michelle Forbes was petting. Why haven't I noticed her before? (I look up to see what other roles he has made and seen them in.) I'm a little worried about the stereotyping of Lewis, this movie, and "wild-born killers" (company favorite). However, seeing the contrast of characters is interesting - in NBK, he is ready to be a accomplice, while here he is saddened by violence and is trying hard not to admit the early blind until it is on his face. <br /> <br /> The movie almost completely. In addition to Duchovny's character, which did not seem to be fully developed (and perhaps Pitt's washed out a bit), it was perfect. I was also pleased to finish it - glad that innocent heroes did not die, but they had to suffer first. It was realistic, tense, disturbing. <br /> <br /> If you like NBK, this movie may also like and vice versa.
