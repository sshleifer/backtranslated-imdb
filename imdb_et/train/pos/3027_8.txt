I watch many movies that are good, bad and indifferent; usually there is something of interest, even if it is a reliable work or a casual laughter of an actor with a character of design or good character, which results from the observation of an unrecorded failure forever. <br /> <br /> I was quite pleasantly surprised by what I have never seen before. Graham Greene has been translated into film many times in masterpieces such as "Thin Man" and fewer vehicles. "Confidential Agent" is one of these smaller vehicles, but I still manage to get somewhere else, despite the weakness of the Bacall and Boyer image mismatch (respectively) in British and Spanish, and the lack of almost complete chemistry for both leaders. In a way, this last problem will deal with the film because of how one can love the tragedy of one person in the atmosphere of killing fascism and capitalism? The most appealing aspect of the film comes directly from Greene's complex and accused psychology, which goes through the film. I know some of you see a deliberate silence here, and I understand that. At the same time, I found that it is rather emphasized rather than a claustrophobic world. I was forced to watch, not a big actor (although Boyer is wonderful, as usual, manages to deliver a rich world and fatigue, tragedy, hope and passionate mix with his great voice and longing eyes), but below the spiral radiance of one man's thin hopes of oppression and money against the world. What is a thief? What is the face of love death? Where do you just start earning and exploiting profits? The film does not rise to the level of art and cannot therefore count on such questions, but it is much more than just entertainment, and its murders and culprits are very grim. The lack of fraud in the "bubble" of narrative "bounce" helps to make this movie very valuable. <br /> <br /> And it's not a happy ending, because history was over.
