There are other comments here, so I don't have to say how big it is or what it is ... My idea is: I heard this movie long before it was shown. I don't even remember HOW, I know it was through the Internet. Distributors went down before it ever hit! I was copying and complaining for several months. Please note that this page has a link to purchase this movie and the only highlighted area is VHS on Amazon.com in Germany. You can translate Alta Vista Babelfishi. I know it is a PAL format and they change the screen text into German and at the beginning there is little bit of narration, which is also German dubbing, but just as fun and campy as this movie is, it only makes fun! If you want to see this movie and you have a nearby place where conversions are worth it! Germany will pay about twenty dollars to the US. Trust me, it may seem like the movie takes a lot, but if you're on corn with b-flick, the money blows left and right to get conversations with your friends!
