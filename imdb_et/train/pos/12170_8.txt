Romantic comedies can really go that way, do you know? You see what is really happy, and you think you want something more realistic. Then you see what is realistic, but it may be too boring to interest you. Or maybe you can see what's doing right, but just can't smile you. Romantic comedies are tough movies. You expect them to have a lot of expectations and usually whether you just like the question of whether the filmmakers anticipated the expectations of you or the man or girl next to you. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you have a girl next to you and you're like me, probably not so much about whether the movie is good, you have other things in your mind. Because I tell you, "Go to him, Tiger!" The rest of us say, "Look _A Guy Thing_". It's a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Because _ Guy Thing_ knows you're going to this movie with expectations, so it's not pretending to be his "husband getting married to your dream woman and it's not her wife!" The plot makes everything happy. Of course, you like it, but maybe it's not true or you think it's cruel. _ Guy Thing covers it. What _A Guy Thing_ does not fill the screen with the best support I have seen for a long time, so if you don't have the main line, you still have something that smiles at you. <br /> <br Are we talking about the big and small screen experienced veterans like Larry Miller (beautiful woman, best show), James Brolin (traffic), Julie Hagerty (plane!), David Koechner (Saturday night and Conan O'Brien regular, dirty work, Austin Powers II) or Thomas Lennon (country and Viva variety) or new faces like Shawn Hatosy (faculty) or Colin Foo (salvation of Silverman), we talk about a bunch of very talented and skilled actors who know exactly how the film is inspired take advantage of the testimonial, steal the exhibition from time to time, still frame the works with the romantic comedy, the rarely observed energy and joy. And it doesn't diminish the actual romantic cross-section and the stars that carry it, because it is very sweet and terrible well done. Jason Lee (Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, etc.) concerns a young professional whose life can happen, and Selma Blair is surprisingly brilliant, showing an ambitious social and complex career woman whom every man wants to marry, except for the Person who is actually . <br /> <br /> Lots of success in the movie comes to Julia Stiles, the right girl at the right time, and she does it well. Not since, gosh, I don't know when, I've seen an actor in a romantic comedy that is so in love with her. Of course, this is all in the neighborhood, with a voice and a subtle smile, but it's magical, and that's one of the biggest reasons we first go to the movies. <br /> <br /> But Julie Stiles somewhat complicated would have been lost if not that the rest of the cast has so incredibly died in its classic simplicity. This is a film that paints the broken world with the types of conflicting stocks, turns them over to laugh at you, and then comes with a big heart. <br /> <br /> Guy Thing is a movie you've definitely seen before, and filmmakers knew it clearly when they did. We haven't seen any new romantic comedy since Shakespeare; its relative success or that it totally depends on the boy's classical performance with the girl. Guy Thing owns it with a bit of a meta-cinematic edge, often taking the scenes of absurdity to give the audience the opportunity to recognize powerful emotions and ancient plot devices while playing. <br /> <br /> In the record, he can even have fun with the sexual and gender relatively traditional structures that make up every romantic comedy center, so even the feminists out there can get out of it. <br /> <br /> And guys, I think we all agree that we want our friends to be as cool as Jason Lee's friends in this movie. I'm not going to spoil you, but if you try to explain to your girlfriend why the pharmacist and the clothing store are the coolest communities in the cinema, I suggest you just say "It's Guy Thing" and leave it there.
