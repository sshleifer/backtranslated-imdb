(You know what I mean after you've seen the Red Eye ...) <br /> <br /> Overall, the Red Eye was a better than expected thriller. It starts slowly and builds slowly. But by the time it was over, it's a jumper! <br /> <br /> It's hard to pinpoint what makes this thriller ... exciting when I find it. Except that, simply saying, the director did a job to pull you into action that would otherwise have been the mill's piece. I forgot to watch the movie. It says a lot. <br /> <br /> Other factors that I think are the "closeness" of the victim and the bad boy ... and that you will actually communicate with the victim over time. Lack of 8 out of 10, more than 7.5 ... but it's pretty good!
