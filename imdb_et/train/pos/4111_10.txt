I first saw this film as a pre-teen, about the age at which children begin to think through their identity. I was greatly influenced by the person and the children he raises. The eldest boy has been attacked, his mother is a prostitute, and none of his brothers have the same biological father (what Kurosawa does if they have children who don't see anything similar). The man still persuades the boy that he is the only census of their father. The man is acknowledged that all children are father but one who still prefers his brother. <br /> <br /> Each vignette is also convincing for its stories and conclusions. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie, even if it's not the biggest Kurosawa movie.
