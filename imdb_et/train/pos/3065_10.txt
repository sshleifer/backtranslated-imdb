<br /> <br /> I liked this movie. One of those rare movies that Hollywood really doesn't do anymore. William H Macy is just as wonderful as a dead man, and Neve Campbell is just as proud as a fantastic woman who puts her life on the path of redemption. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity, watch this movie. It serves its praise
