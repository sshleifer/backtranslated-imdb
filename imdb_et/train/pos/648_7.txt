I decided to review it because of this site's suggestions. I have to say that it was worth the effort. However, you should keep in mind that this movie will continue for 210 minutes. If you don't have the strength, get it on tape and watch it for a couple of nights. Remember here goes: <br /> <br /> Alexandre is a fever, a woman and a gigolo. She lives with an older woman named Marie. Marie owns a retail store and gives Alex. Alex spends his day in cafes and restaurants. The story shows that Alex had previously impregnated Gilber with whom he had previously lived. Gilberte continued to be a less attractive man he didn't love because Alex had abused him and beat him. At this point, Alex was ready to work and help raise his child before he found out that Gilbert had interrupted it and was going to marry someone else. Randomly, Alexandre meets a sister with a nymph called Veronica, and they pulled up a relationship. Veronika fell in love with Alex for the first time since he had been a kind of sex between men in the past. Marie and Veronika were fighting for Alex's affection and had revenge. Finally, it turned out that Veronika was pregnant with Alex and Alex asked her to marry. We assume (as mentioned above in Gilberte's situation), Alexandre even works and is his new found love and family provider. There is hope! <br /> <br /> With the title "La Maman et la putain", I concluded that Jean Eustache was related to the character of Françoise Lebrun's Veronica. He was a whore and then he became a mother. So the mother and whore are the same person? Anyway, what I know! French films are mostly (not all) very dirty, purposefully political, preaching, theatrical, uncomfortable, exhausting and quoted. Lebrun and Léaud played their shameful signs well and kept the movie together because some of the scripts became a bit lost and loose. <br /> <br /> Not a bad effort. 7/10
