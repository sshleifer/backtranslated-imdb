Antonio Margherit "Danza Macabra" / "Blood Castle" is a terrible, atmospheric chiller that succeeds on all fronts. It seems black and white perfectly beautiful and it is a great creepy Gothic vibe. Alan Foster is an English journalist who deals with an interview with American horror writer Edgar Allan The store contributes to Foster that he can not spend one night in the abbey's abandoned mansion at Thomas Blackwood. In agreeing to the fight, Foster is locked in the mansion and fear begins! the atmosphere and it frightened hell about me. The encryption sequence is really terrible and tensions are almost unbearable.Barbara Steele looks incredibly beautiful as the evil spirit of Elisabeth Blackwood. Blood Castle is one of the best Italian horror films made in the early 1960s. Masterpiece!
