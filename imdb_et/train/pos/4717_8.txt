How does anyone love this movie? I think this is a fun looting of all the old gangster films; if you have never seen them, check it out. Michael Keaton has a ball in this role if he goes. One man mangles English whenever he speaks, and Griffin Dunn plays with his wife D.A, but my favorite role is to be Joe Piscopo. He has all the best features. Danny DeVito, Alan Hale, Ray Walston is in this adult movie whose shepherd gangsters are much more fun than "mafia" for crimes on the ground.
