I saw this movie on Thursday after a really boring day. I had no expectations, the ones I had were rather negative. Being the only movie I've ever watched by Jimmy is the American version of the taxi with Queen Latifah (?). But seriously ... this movie is so cute! Drew Barrymore is always sweet, but I loved almost Fallon's character. Why I can't get that funny joke like that. :) Such movies are great. Simple, sweet and necessary. Sunday Thursday. I'm not even a sports fan, but it's something about American movies with impressive baseball. Probably the fact that we don't have this sport here in Norway. <br /> <br /> (My first comment ever.) Haha
