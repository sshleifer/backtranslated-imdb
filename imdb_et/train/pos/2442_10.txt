This film speaks of Ireland, which the Americans usually do not see, a narrowly-minded religiously damaged side of the "friendly race of the world." The film, which is sufficiently old to accept the events of the Fethard inhabitants, is quite accurate (although they demand that the filmmakers invent some more violent scenes in order to raise the action). <Br / The film was very unpopular in Ireland because it depicted the Catholic Church in a bad light, but it is simple that the Catholic Church * organized minority veto rights (before the Protestants were Jews). The film is a fascinating insight into the whole issue of religion in Ireland
