Love it or read it, it's hard not to find Warren Beatty in "Dick Tracy," the adaptation of the 1990's Chester Gould's famous comics. Superhero films have come out of wood in recent years and may soon become a genre. <br /> <br /> The Beatty film fully utilizes Gould's source material, capturing the basic colors in all six bands, giving a unique but familiar world of trigger-happy mutant gangsters and open, seductive women a lush visual style and tone. <br /> <br /> It can be argued that the strong visual aesthetics of the film are significantly short of changing characters and their ability to act, which I do not believe can be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> "Dick Tracy" is in its looks and terrible characters, and Beatty himself, who plays nervous and the invasion of the undetectable detective is appropriately stoic and ready to attack the bad guys at any and all costs. <br /> <br /> Other than visual and Oscar-winning makeup, there is a plot and a big boy Caprice (Al Pacino, delicious in the Oscar nominated presentation), trying to eliminate Tr's quite well-planned movement, but also trying to get control of all criminal operations in the city, combining all the sensual gangs under him. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Tracy juggles her relationship with Tess Trueheart (Glenne Headly), who would be under her name, carefully next to her and cares about Kid (Charlie Korsmo) who finally finds a father who is looking for our criminal hero. Tracy's Fidelity to Tess is tested by Breathless Mahoney's (Madonna) appealing advancement, who is also Big Boy's main rather. While all this goes down, things get hot when a new criminal figure arrives in the city, and decides to play both sides in the middle. <br /> <br /> The performances are good, as Beatty's focus on tight and romantic relationships between each leader becomes the focal point of the material, not focusing on meaningless action and special effects. Pacino freely looks at the landscape that is truly outstanding. <br /> <br /> "Dick Tracy" is one of the best and overlooked in the comic book movie genre. I think if Chester Gould was still alive, he would be proud of taking Warren Beatty over his beloved crime detective. <br /> <br /> 8/10
