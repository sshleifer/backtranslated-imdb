Even at the beginning of his career, Capra achieved his camera work and timing. It is a thin story - and from time to time quite predictable - but it gets very good performances from its pain and it has some rather complicated camera movements that closely involve the viewer. The first part looks like a Cinderella story, although anyone with a brain sees that the bottom falls out of it - the rich "prince" loses its fortune. <br /> <br /> However, thanks to its good pain and fast pace, it's easy to grab clich√©s. Then the film becomes more original because the couple must find a way to live. The end is very predictable but satisfactory. I also want to praise the writing of the title: very witty and fun.
