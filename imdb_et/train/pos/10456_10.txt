This movie does not mean entertainment or even the movie you want to see over time. This film is a true love that can only come from God. While watching this movie, you can't help but be deeply touched. We have several dimensions of love that contribute to the value of this movie. God's divine love is beautifully depicted. God's love transcends the heart and the spirit and lasts and is eternal. Married is love. Although the main character grabs his wife's illness, he understands through God's love that he loves his wife more than he ever imagines. He knows he and his wife are one and can never be separated. Finally, you have a child and a parent. Families of the family come together and realize that nothing else matters except that love conquers fear. Dear friends, love is not love unless it comes from God because God is love and love comes from God. Talk to someone and let them know you love them. Love is not good if it is not given to another. I pray that this film can inspire and change anyone who sees it. Amen!
