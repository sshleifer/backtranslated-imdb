Although it is not as horrible as the cult classic (ZOMBI 2), I like it better. This is due to faster pace, better settings and cool 80 soundtrack. It's loaded with action and has a sweet effect on Lucio Fulc. Zombies don't look so nasty as in ZOMBI 2, but they still look good. This was done quite well, but it is definitely the share of cheese; For example, some zombies really move slowly, while others are as fast as ninjas. some are braindead, while others say funny lines, but who is waiting for consistency in Italian horror? There's even a flying zombie head! How rad is this? Be sure to see gorehounde and zombie fans. this is likely to match most movie fans. See also Zombie 4.
