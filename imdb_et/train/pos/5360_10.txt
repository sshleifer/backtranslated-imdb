Among the standard one-liner-type films, where the door controls operation and logic, this film is at the top of the class. If the person responsible for casting had to put the "good" players on this flick, it would have been worse (except for Richard Dawson, who actually worked well if you were able to "play"). I love this movie! A running person is probably God's gift to man (maybe just men). Certainly the most quoted film of our time, so I'll give you my favorite line: "It's all part of the life of the rich Brenda model, and the better F ***** g get used to it." Ahh, citing this movie, more people are called "Brenda" than I can imagine.
