The true fans of the movie love this authentic movie. <br /> <br /> I disagree with trolls who rate this movie with one star and call it unreal. Although I do not have a background or an environment of protagonists, I have worked for many years with a lower income and in the neighborhood of a workgroup, and I feel that it was very real and represents how young people behave. I do not know what is the basis for other comments that the film is "unreal". Dialogue is great. <br /> <br /> The low budget output value didn't bother me a bit. I felt that natural light increased the character of the film. Attention focused entirely on the development of story and character, not on glowing Hollywood support or melodrama. <br /> <br /> I totally bought a character's motivations and reactions. Operation was plausible and impressive for new and non-participants. <br /> <br /> If your good movie idea is Transformers or Fast & Furious, skip it. If you have a good character drama, look at it. <br /> <br /> (For negative commentators who are "trolls": click on their names and you will see most other comments or only negative comments.)
