The most disturbing thing about this film is that, as illustrated, the spies killed at school are actually done, it is true that teenagers like Cal and Andre ... are ordinary children with ordinary families. Using handheld camera technology, Ben Coccio manages to bring us to two friends with high school problems, even though we never know what is behind these issues. They seem to be typical - many people hate high school, so what? Some of you just don't think they will ever make a very well thought out massacre on zero day. Surveillance camera scenes at school are therefore made even more powerful. You can't believe it's really happening, and it's really happened. The handheld camera technique also creates the illusion that it is not a scripted film that is a brilliant idea related to the subject.
