I think it's a great movie. because you see how Diana's home is at home. he got so much aggression and he wants to prove that the girls can also fight. I think he and Adrian were great actors. Because of this movie, I'm also in the box. It really impressed me. the only negative part I think. Is the end. because it is well between Diana and Adria. But you don't see how it is at home. And I didn't like you not seeing his father do, and his brother. but i think it was a great movie and i think i'm looking at it much more :) I recommend it to anyone, even if you don't like boxing, you see much more than just boxing. I looked at it very well.
