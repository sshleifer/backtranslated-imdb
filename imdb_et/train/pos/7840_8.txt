BOOGIE BOOGIE is a real "find" - even though almost thirty years of stone blower, I saw the film just a few days ago and got the best rock films of all time; the horrible music (T. Rex's cream) and visual images are exciting and unusual, leaving this viewer longing for the past of Ringo Starri, who did a great job here. If you love music, you are all over T. Rextasy because Marc Bolan is really a piece in the front and middle. Even the fact that some songs are repetitive is not important: different places, costumes, musical arrangements and bizarre visual concepts are meant to lend a variety of textures and a lot of hostile humor to what might have been the "only" concert movie in other hands. So rich and packed BORN TO BOOGIE is that the movie is only about an hour long, but what is completely satisfactory here is my only criticism - the video package says something 71 minutes and at least one online source says the film is 67 minutes , but it's probably a 61-minute rocking game.
