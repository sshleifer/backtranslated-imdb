The simplified story and the tempting heroine were the fear film that all started. John Carpenter brings Halloween at night with a nail blasting night when Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis's debut, career-defining role) and her lost friends are planning a night of horror fun - only at the crossroads of relentless psychopaths in hell. <br /> <br /> Michael Myers has escaped from a nearby crazy aslysis ... having killed his sister fifteen years ago, he is now back in Haddonfield, a sleepy city in Illinois where his murder took place. When he puts his eyes on Laurie after he put down an abandoned house where he lived, he starts lurking and terrorizing him. br /> <br /> Beautiful cinema and lighting make this intimidating horror intimidating ... with a long, gloomy picture, you feel like you are a manic serum killer yourself. Myers are well hidden in the hidden conclusions. <br /> <br /> Although Halloween is definitely out of date, it is by no means less cooling. The idea is to knock down the ghost, and this little shocker is one of the most famous and memorable films ever made ... it created seven sequences and finally Rob Zombie's equally frightening remake that set a new standard of fear that still exists.
