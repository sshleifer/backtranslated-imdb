Clint Eastwood reiterates his role as Dirty Harry, who this time is a Sondra Locke who kills people who raped her and her sister a carnival years ago. The role of Eastwood is the role of him and the film, which is mostly more active than talking, not that I complain. Sudden effects are really enjoyable entertainment.
