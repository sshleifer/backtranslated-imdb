The story is extremely unique. It's about 2 pilots rescue Earth aliens, but they need to use special speeds that will make all of them around ages quickly. The whole series is about pilots dealing with time loss, friends and mentors Â© InfoSUM.net All rights reserved. <br /> <br /> Finally, EVERYTHING would have been fantastic. It started to end with a note and remained a real sign, but ended with a super-happy Disney remark and annoyed me very badly. <br /> <br /> Animation is a decent 89 but can't be compared nowadays. I've also heard a lot of complain about nudity cheesiness.I actually found it to be somewhat decent. Nudity was mostly legitimate except for episode 2 where was superfluous. <br /> <br /> In general, it deserves the prospect, but the end is a classic.
