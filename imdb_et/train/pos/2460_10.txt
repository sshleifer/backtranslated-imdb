Hamlet is my favorite of my Shakespeare creations. Branaugh is one actor fuck. His portrayal of this was just amazing. His soliloquies were breathtaking. As long as it was rare for the film to keep my interest, I was still in that particular piece. I recommend it to anyone, both Shakespeare fans and those who aren't so much. It has everything the world today is looking for in its films: murder, betrayal and fraud. Not to knock the Mel Gibson version, but Branaughs touches all the work. It doesn't leave the stone around. When you finish the movie, you seem to read yourself. How do you say "two thumbs up".
