I thought this was a great move. There were some things that were less than perfect, but in general I was quite surprised. The scene at the end of the courtroom seemed a little unreal, but was quite entertaining. I found that the film was experiencing difficulties in military training and accompanying sacrifice. As a military pilot, I was involved with many of these parts.
