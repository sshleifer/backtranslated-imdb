Looking before the devil counts as one of my cinema's best experience in the cinema. I've intrigued my confusing answer to the film - and for me, the extremes of the opinion show that the film was about something that has been publicly pronounced or paralyzed. This is one of those films that has stayed with me, and I mean and think about it. <br /> <br /> Are DVDs still lightening some of the topics and movie elements? Includes: Sidney Lumet's return movie, storytelling, a great combination of Lumet and Masterson, and why it works so well, a masterful direction, relatively rare Hollywood movies giving male characters and their largely doomed struggle to get their women a control book open to their women , submissive but still resonant performance by Marisa Tome and, of course, Hoffman with this central monologue about the sum of his parts - the heart of the film. <br /> <br /> Phew! Definitely a masterful film. So imagine your frustration, who eagerly looks at the expected DVD - but didn't find any comment, no scenes, no interviews, no additions. <br /> <br /> Hey - Distributors - Sort!
