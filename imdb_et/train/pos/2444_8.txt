"GEORGE LOPEZ" is, in my opinion, an absolute ABC class! I haven't seen every episode, but I still enjoy it. I have many episodes I enjoyed. One of them was where Amy (Sandra Bullock) walked into the moving machine. If you want to know why you need to see it yourself. Before I put it up, I would like to say that everyone always did a good job, the design of the production was remarkable, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, while new episodes can be seen now, I urge you to catch it when it comes out of the air.
