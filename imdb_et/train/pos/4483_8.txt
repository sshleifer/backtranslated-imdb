All musical comedy should be. Gene Kelly (like Joe Brady) does not miss the move and Frank Sinatra (Clarence Doolittle) does not leave a comment. Scenes with them are very good, showing how much talent can be added to a somewhat uneven plot. Sinatra "I Fall in Love Too Eoily Easy" shows her and the best of the future. Kelly's "Mexican Hat Dance" with a young Mexican girl is delightful. Kelly certainly earned her best candidate. And there are really funny lines, like: "Do you think the navy takes tricks?" "Do you think someone is singing a sailor?"; and "We have little trouble, we got a little boy." A thoroughly pleasing film, just the shaking of the dust of the recent World War II.
