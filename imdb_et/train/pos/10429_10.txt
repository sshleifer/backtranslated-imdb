I am not usually a fan of strictly romantic movies, but I heard it was good. I was stunned. Just the most romantic thing I've ever seen in my life. Stunning. Brilliant, sweet, funny and full of heart. Chemistry is flawless, like writing and managing. <br /> <br /> Movies take you right now and don't let go. You can't watch or stop listening. Even small moments melt your heart. <br /> <br /> It has jumped into one of my favorite tracks. Masterpiece.
