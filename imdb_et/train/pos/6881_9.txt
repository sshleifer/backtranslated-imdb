How can Curtis Mayfield's song be bad? It can't! Groove Tube is a series of scatological black-out sketches that makes the 2001 Olympics fun. High, (clown mild, light licensing recipe) exceed lower (too long "sellers"), but even low are funny. Ken Shapiro's manic dancing is best done on the Manhattan sidewalk. Certainly dated now but during Groove Tube was reckless, bold, shameless and hysterically funny. Ken Shapiro made this small cult, but 7 years later he made a Christmas Eve bomb, modern problems (though I enjoyed it) and, unfortunately, nothing since then. (Maybe he can play the drums in a jazz group) The Groove Tube will leave me with an endless burst of positive energy, a movie that, 26 years after my initial viewing, still brings real joy!
