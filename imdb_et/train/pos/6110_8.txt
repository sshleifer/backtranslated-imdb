Like "My Sassy Girl", this movie is based on a real story sent from the Internet, but similarities end. Generally speaking, this rebellious guy named Ji-Hoon (Kwon Sang Woo) is still trying to finish a high school whose parents are hired by a woman from a poor background, called Su-Wan (Kim Ha Neul). but it's the same age as him. In addition, there are some obstacles, martial arts (always beat after Ji-Hoon for revenge), a scary, embarrassing love-sick girl who is after her, her tendency to trick the lessons, and you generally think the whole story. Did I mention that this is a romantic comedy? This movie has some good fighting scenes, great visual humor and a lot of dirty, thanks to the good chemistry between Kim Ha Nuel and Kwon Sang Woo, which bring a lot of energy to the story. That's why romantic elements work. And I have to say that I would like a girlfriend like Kim Ha Nuel as a "My Sassy Girl" girl (at least a personality). She's dirty, but it's more cute, sweet, cordial. Characters are already mostly pleasing (so it can be said that he had less climbing than the "My Sassy Girl" - an obstacle that worked for his credit for this film), and the film is quite clever and interesting most. However, this story is about two-thirds of the roads (where it is familiar with a regular ticket, where nothing really cares), but at the end it gets up a bit. In general, it's a fun and cute movie. 8/10
