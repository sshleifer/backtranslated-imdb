I was expecting it to dislike it; I thought it would be terribly worthwhile and serious and rather tiring and boring. <br /> <br /> It's actually much better and I found myself really enjoyable. I don't know Queen Victoria too much if she knows the most - married to Albert, who died young, and she mourns her once. Seeing the situations in which he grew up was exciting; In fact, I found myself wanting to see more of the story, and I think we'll see a sequel at some point. <br /> <br /> Visually, the movie is stunning. Sets and costumes are incredibly rich without being too harsh and up. Action is the upper limit of all actors. <br /> <br /> In short, it was great!
