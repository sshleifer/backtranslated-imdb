His Hollywood imitates the best of Daytiem Soap Opera! It's fun we never see. Large characters and excellent lines. Whoop is fun ..... Sally Field is up ... Gary Marshalls lines are rebellion .... that's what I love about good comedies. Never be afraid to have fun! !!!!!! The sets were great .... the wardrobe was on the ground and the upside down "Montana Morehead" was a devilish pleasure. Terri Hatcher "Dr. Monica Demonico" was not enough lines, but still wonderful and fun during the screen. I would like to know how the idea of ​​this movie came. Never have I seen that the number of people doing comedy work is so much fun! Soapdish is black, and I'm waiting for a DVD !!!
