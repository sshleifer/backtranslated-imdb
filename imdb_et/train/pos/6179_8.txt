It is good to see that the Vintage Film Buff has correctly classified its excellent DVD "music" as it is what this film is pure and simple. Like his unofficial remake of murder in a windmill (1949), the murder card is just a pretext for the sophisticated girlie exhibition developed by Kitty Carlisle and Gertrude Michael, leading super-decorative girls, including Ann Sheridan, Lucy Ball, Beryl Wallace, Gwenlliani Gill , Gladys Young, Barbara Fritchie, Wanda Perry and Dorothy White. Carl Brisson is also under his hand to give his strong voice "Cocktails for Two". Undoubtedly, the film's most popular song has been heard at least four times. But this is Gertrude Michael, who steals the exhibition not only with his "Sweet Marijauna" rendition, but with his strong-performance hero rejected girlfriend. As for the rest, we could have done without Jack Oakie and Victor McLaglen. The only good thing about Oakie's role is his weak running cult with the icon, Toby Wing. In fact, to give you an idea of ​​how far the rest of the comedy is superfluous and too tense, the super-stupid inspector McLaglen just can't put his hand against the killer, even though you think that in this case there will be a person you suspect the most. Director Mitch Leisen is in great pain to bring the killer to the strangest cinema audience, giving the player in the close-up.
