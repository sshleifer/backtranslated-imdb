This is, above all, a fantastic series. It is very well done and very interesting. Like a huge World War II buffer, I had learned a lot before seeing this series. One of the best things this has done is all interviews with individuals of the past, when the war was relatively fresh in their minds, it is quite. There is nothing against the men you see interviewed in today's programs, but the fact that most of these men did not actually participate in what happened. One of the best parts is the narration of Sir Laurence Oliver. I recommend it to anyone who wants to get to know the Second World War, but I really think that only heroes (like me) want to buy it or watch it more than once. My only real complaint about this series is that some facts are not as accurate as we know today. Especially with the data of the Soviet Union, it is exaggerated or simply inappropriate. This information is now different, which we now know because of the fall of the USSR. In general, there is a fascinating look at World War II and must see the professional or personal perspective of every serious World War II historian.
