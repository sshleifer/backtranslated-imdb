I believe Sarafina is the tremendous effort of Whoopi Goldberg. Apart from her, there are no other characters in the film and her role is less than the title, Sarafina. As I work in an urban high school, I think it's an important film to show the history of apartheid in South Africa. Sarafina is a film education and teacher relationship with student Sarah. I bought the video from virtually nothing. I watched it and quickly transmitted it through musical numbers. But I advise this film to be understood by teachers and their students. Now that I'm not familiar with other actors and actors in the movie, I assume they are very popular in South Africa and I am glad that they played with South Africa's cast and team, except Goldberg, but with a small role, but if that person this movie is seen when Whoop comes to a global complaint.
