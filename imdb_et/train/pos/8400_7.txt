I chose this movie in my local library. Having met the director at the film festival at the end of last year, I was curious to study my work. I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The film takes a fresh picture of familiar topics, love, infidelity, friendship, jealousy. Sometimes it can be a bit "talking", but never so that the movie will completely sink. I liked the love story that CLEARLY belongs to, and looking at how they make informed decisions, instead of accidentally falling into something as important as love. <br /> <br /> This movie and medium low budget contrast shoot-em is quite different. Look at it. If you're lucky, your copies will come as well as the soundtrack I made. Good stuff!
