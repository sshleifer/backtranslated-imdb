The womans ward waiting for the big recumbent hospital, with all its joys and worries, is where LIFE lives. , everything is related to the life of motherhood and their patients. The honesty with which the substance is treated refers to the situation of the pre-codes of the film. <br /> <br /> The great Aline MacMahon, a sympathetic headdress, is the calm center of the film, all around which rocks are. flow. Can cope with any crisis or emergency, she is the best, sometimes the last, friend of mothers. MacMahon's surroundings are a great costume: Loretta Young as a convicted murder who was released from prison long enough to give birth; Eric Linden as a frightened young man; Brassy Glenda Farrell as a child who hates children; sweet Clara Blandick as a very mature mother for her sixth birth; Preston Foster & Hale Hamilton is a thoughtful, compassionate doctor and Frank McHugh as a comic foolish father. Paul Fix as a nervous husband who promises to behave like a "small soldier"; Gilbert Roland, an Italian spouse and Elizabeth Patterson, who is a sharp medical spouse interested in receiving Farrell's son. ; Farrell obviously becomes drunk in Ward, but none of the workers seem to have noticed; An obviously psychotic patient can move around with the will, but it really only increases the exotic entertainment value of the film and keeps things too serious.
