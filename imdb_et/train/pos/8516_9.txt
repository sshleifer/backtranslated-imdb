This movie is an extremely funny and close-to-heart story about a children's home that is in financial trouble. When a director goes on vacation, his father agrees to start doing things temporarily. <br /> <br /> This is a positive job Leslie Nielson has ever done. His idea of ​​letting children go is instantly innovative and his sales techniques will certainly make you laugh. <br /> <br /> The little girl in this movie is so sweet and charming that I know I will never forget her. Just make sure you don't miss the first five minutes of the movie! <br /> <br /> This great family life is so rare these days. When you go with happy endings to lightly shining images, go to it! I can watch it over and over again and I often do! My only complaint about this movie is that finding a copy is so hard.
