This is the ultimate consensus where Eddie Murphy is his best. Just forget about Nutty Professor and Dear Sirs, this is the real Eddie Murphy. His imitations of T. (pretending he is gay), Michael Jackson and other artists are killers. I think it is also quite bold to have fun with artists who were very popular at that time. My favorite act is where he is in his annual BBQ with his family and plays down the stairs and the aunt Bunny. <br /> <br /> This show is the best medicine for you! If you look at "Raw", don't be disappointed. It's also pretty good, but it doesn't fit "Delirious".
