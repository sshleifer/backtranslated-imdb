"Hot Millions" is a delightful comedy made even better by the wonderful casting created for it. The film is a tribute to the genius of Peter Ustinov, who wrote the screen and appears as a key emezzler. The film, directed by Eric Till, does not show that they were so terribly timing like some others since then. <br /> <br /> At the heart of the game is the friendly man, Marcus Pendleton, who confirms the prisoner's tax forms before being released from prison, who are surprised by the government's indebtedness. Marcus, who is a genius of numbers, sees opportunities where others are not. He starts working for a company that uses the latest computer in his accounts, but Pendleton is an inventive man who finds the opportunity to use the system and create different accounts in different parts of the continent. <br /> <br /> Marcus has a secretary who also has an apartment in her building. Unknown Patty sees a bus running as a ticket vendor who can shame everything. How she works as a secretary is not understandable, but things are never the same in the office when creepy Willard Gnatpole decides to go after him but is not afraid, Patty's heart belongs to Marcus, who is an achievable pianist and he is a flutist and they are flutist make beautiful music together. <br /> <br /> The best movie is Peter Ustinov. He clearly understood how Marcusut was playing and going to the movie. Mr. Ustinov gives confidence to the guarantor. Magnificent Maggie Smith is also her best when she takes on Patty, a kind woman who adores Marcus and who is brilliant in investing money in Marius's pockets. <br /> <br /> Karl Malden is perfect for America as a responsible company. Bob Newhart also appears in Gnatpole, a man who wants Patty, but can't accept him. The wonderful Robert Morley is considered Caesar Smith, whose identity is Marcus. Cesar Romero also appears as an airport customs inspector. <br /> <br /> Hot Millions will delight everyone who is looking for a fun time with this unpleasant but charming company, Marcus Pendleton.
