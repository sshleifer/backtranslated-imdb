Oh, it's so cool to watch Silent Classic once at the same time! Director Vidor is just a cheerful and even long (at least 1928) head of self. The story tells us how success in life is and how it changes you. Marion Davies plays a girl who leaves her friends a little comedy studio to be part of a bigger "drama" studio. He becomes a big star and its consequences are truly foreign to the world. For a moment, he even denies the (bad) past! Comedians are just fun, definitely a scene where the main character (Marion Davies) sees ... Marion Davies's studio and concludes that she doesn't seem to be special ... It must be one of the first movies-films here and for real freaks Fantastic to see cameras and material back then. Must-see if you ask me!
