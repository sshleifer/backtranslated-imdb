Having enjoyed Joyce's complicated novel, I was ready to be disappointed by the scenario of Joseph Strick and Fred Haines, given the stunning complexity of the original text. But the film turned out very well and the exact translation of the tone, naturalness and lightness of the book. <br /> <br /> It will certainly help you read the original text before watching the movie. I imagine that the latter seems to be undivided, the very unusual episodes are apparently randomly sewn without the prior reading of the text to grab the plot. Given that he was beaten in Dublin in 1967. The filmmakers in Ireland finally ended it up to the public in Ireland in 2000 (it was shown to a limited audience in a private cinema club, an Irish movie, in the late 1970s). Joyce's eroticism is not just naturalistic and dirty, it offers many wildly "perverse" episodes. Don't forget that so many of these fetishes were unacceptable when the book was published in 1922 - they were still completely taboo when the film was made in 1967. The profession of an Irish actor of the 1960s, dear players, dare to express and enforce such joy of Joyce's extremely evil text. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
