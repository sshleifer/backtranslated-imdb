Conrad Hall went crazy. A big film photographer finished his movie before going through the film. She was proud of her, as it is one of the best looking movies you will ever see. Here too, the amount is right: not too much; None of the characters here are honestly "good guys", because Hanks is a professional tabby player for the city's superior, Newman. Hanks' only redemption quality does not want his young son to stop his killer, although he teaches him how to be a robber! <br /> <br /> As good as an actor and as interesting as the story, the real star of this movie is the operator Hall, who paints the scene after a beautiful scene with his lens. His work is just awesome.
