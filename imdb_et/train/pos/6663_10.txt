This film is related to a dysfunctional family, but not only to any uncertain family. It concerns the family of our nation (India), although the film focuses mainly on foreign relations between Mahatma Gandhi and his eldest son Harilal Gandhi. This shows how Mahatma had to kill M.K. Gandhi, how he had to sacrifice his family for his freedom. Every time Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and his son try to bring Mahatma closer, they come between them. This is a beautifully made film. Akshaye Khanna has proven to be Top Actor. He naturally expressed emotions. Darshan Jariwala, who mainly celebrates Gyshi-Gurukant Desai's lawyer Gurus, has been wonderfully portrayed by Gandhi (as a true Human Being, unlike Ben Kingsley who made him see God), the Monsoon Wedding Girl Shefali Shah has done a very good job of showing how Kasturba Gandhi was torn between father and son. This film touches and so has its unique way of singing this soundtrack "Raghupati Raghava". I saw this movie only 3 hours ago (it appeared in Dubai the day before the 2nd day) and when the movie was there, "Pin Drop Silence" and no man out of the theater pushed another (Can you imagine we Indians don't push?) NOT ON! It was a holy silence ...
