"Midnight Cowboy" is one of those films that has been justifiably declared a masterpiece - it's really one of the best films made in America. It is both artistically valid and fully accessible and commercial. No wonder it was a great success when it was initially released. But be warned that this is also one of the most heart-breaking films. The characters are memorable, well-developed, and finally tragic. The filmmakers should be praised for not giving us the end of Hollywood, which was in principle mandatory in the 1980s. Nevertheless, I am playing an American film for the years 1967-1977. This is the time when well done, innovative and most dark movies can be done with the big budgets that Hollywood could offer. All of this was over when Star Wars appeared. <br /> <br /> The direction of John Schlesinger makes material work. It combines a simplified style with some experimental editing. Unlike many other psychedelic films, Midnight Cowboy is pretty well outdated. It is still as powerful as originally released. But that's what makes it a masterpiece. The background of the characters is never fully explained, but the performances make them completely out. Both Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are completely memorable and compassionate (despite their sometimes deplorable actions). Plus, having been a fan of films for decades, I loved strangely scary scenes placed on 42nd street. Midnight Cowboy is almost perfect and one of the most powerful films. (10/10)
