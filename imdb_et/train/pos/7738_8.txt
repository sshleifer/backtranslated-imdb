After dark, my lovely, wonderful, modern dwarf, full of fruitful signs, dirt roads and, of course, sweaty signs. It seems that most of the really big twins of the last two or three decades have been in the south, where the men shine and the women are beautiful. Why? Because it's hooooottttttttttt. And because everyone looks better wet (at least men - sweaty women leave me bad). <br /> <br /> Anyway - there may be some spoilers here. <br /> <br /> This movie is a wonderful example of what a dog should be - a constant tempo (although some pointing to it refers to it as "slow"), clear and widespread (though not simple) characters and tons of atmosphere. Noir, if at all, talks about moods and attitudes. That's why great big ways of doing things (see Bogart, Mitchum, Hurt and Nicholson - they (and their characters) were nothing more than real - but they had a style and a sass, and a crime movie that you just want). or fast paced adventures (again, all the big noirs are burning like a cigarette). Large daggers create the environment and you live with it in a couple of hours with characters. <br /> <br /> After the dark sweet we promise you to do it - and let you enjoy some very interesting and complicated characters. Uncle Bud and Collie are intriguing - never let the audience know what they really do - and Patric and Dern (by the way, I love Bruce Dern) is the perfect pitch, especially Dern (see previous comment). They accept the basic features of character and give them the depth and express our compassion. <br /> <br /> The story itself is also interesting. There are better plots in the world of young people (hardly any secret - mostly it's intercourse), but that's for sure. If anything, the "okay" plot is more about writing Jim Thompson than anything else. For Thompson, the plots are almost secondary; he gave up stories from Hammetti and Chandler's labyrinths to get simpler stories with stronger and more confusing characters. See the novel like The Killer Inside Me and see immediately (in the title) what it is. When it comes to Thompson, that's not what it is, that's how it is (to quote Roger Ebert). So, in fact, the relatively simple line of robbery is not, and if you don't like it, jokes for you. <br /> <br /> Why this is an 8-star movie, not a 10-star, because of the female interface. She is not bad in itself, but she is neither Angelica Huston nor Anette benning (see Jim Thompson's The Grifters customization if you don't know what I'm talking about - it's a better movie and you should start with a modern knife - that's The Best and Challenge of the 1990s Blood Simple, which is the best title from Chinatown). He just doesn't have a piece (or looking for that thing) and although he and Pat have chemistry, I don't have him. So there.
