I'm shocked. Disappointed and outraged that 428 of your IMDB users who voted for me have not given this movie a higher rating than 7.7? ?? - It's C! If I could give 20 to FOBH, I'd be happy to do it. This movie is a contemporary comedy pantheon high side by side with Half Baked and Mallrats, the most entertaining film of all time. If you know _anything_ about rap music - you have to see it !! If you don't know anything about rap music - learn something! And look at it! Comparisons with "Spinal Tap" do not understand this unique film-inspired gene. If you liked Bob Roberts, you love it. Watch it and vote for 10!
