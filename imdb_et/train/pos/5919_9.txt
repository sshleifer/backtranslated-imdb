Street Fight is an excellent brutal satire. It's not a movie you just look fun about. It is not a comfortable experience, although it has some ridiculous moments. This is the movie you look at when you need food. <br /> <br /> The aim of this film, just a racist rejection, is to leave the point completely. This is not only a satire of the South Song, but also a biting comment on the prejudices that Americans still have as a society. Each ethnic group depicted in the film appears as a grotesque caricature of these stereotypes, which in turn is a grotesque cartoon of real people. With this natural exaggeration, the filmmaker shows how absurd these tightly held beliefs are. <br /> <br /> If you are a person who is willing to admit the widespread odds of prejudice, American culture still exists. and if you are not afraid to look at your own prejudices, this movie may be for you.
