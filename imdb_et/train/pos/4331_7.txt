The murder of Mesopotamia has always been one of the best Poirot books because it is very horrible and has a brilliant ending. There is no doubt that customizing the TV is visually striking, with some beautiful photos and a very haunting music score. As always as David Suchet is impeccable as Hercule Poirot, the epic comic adventure in Poirot's fight with mosquitoes at night and Hugh Fraser is good as naive captain Hastings. The rest of the cast moves are in decent performances, but are cautious not to overshadow two cases that are at risk in some of Christie's adjustments. Part of this episode was quite creepy, which was the same tragic episode as the five little pigs - the episode that I had much more than that. Particularly what made it horrible set aside music when Louise Leidner sees a ghostly face through the window. It was quite faithful to the book about customization, but I say I had three things I didn't like. The main problem was pace, it's pretty slow, and there are some scenes that happen very little. I also didn't like being murdered by Joseph Mercado. I see him as a rather nervous character in the book, but the idea of ​​being killed for murder and retardation made him a less attractive character, although I am happy that they did not stunn drug addiction. (I also noticed that the writers omitted the fact that Mrs Mercado gets into hysteria when she believes she is the next victim of the murderer.) Another thing that was not so impressive was that I felt it could be more effective if adaptation had been from Amy Leatheran's point of view, as it was in the book, Amy seemed somewhat less sensitive to adaptation. All in all, I liked the murder of Mesopotamias, despite some misconceptions about the writers. 7/10 Bethany Cox.
