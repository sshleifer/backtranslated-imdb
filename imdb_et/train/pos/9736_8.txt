Pegg has had a few hits in the last few years, starting with "Shaun Of The Dead", "Hot Fuzz 2007" in 2004, and in early 2008, "Run Fat Boy Run" and now it comes ", How to lose friends and transfer people ", which is in many ways one of my favorite comedies. <br /> <br /> The film is about Sidney Yound, a man who writes about an unsuccessful magazine that mostly makes fame. because he's not one of them. Anyway, one of the most successful magazine owners (played by Jeff Bridges) invites him (out of nostalgia) to work in his magazine. Sidney is of course excited and moving to America, where she meets a girl who is currently writing a book, and a cheerfulness. <br /> <br /> This movie is great and I hope more will appear in the near future. Pegg has once again given people a good movie everywhere and I can't wait to see the third part of the blood and the trilogy of ice cream "Paul". I appreciate this movie 81%.
