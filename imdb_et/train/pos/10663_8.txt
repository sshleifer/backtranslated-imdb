Here's a great Barbara Stanwycki double bill on one plate. The first film - and believe me less - is MGM's "To Please A Lady" (1950), where he is associated with Clark Gable. It is essentially a character car that Gable has traditionally dominated in the film in the presence of his screen. Here he plays a macho racer, who gets a bad journalist from the feminist reporter Stanwyck and starts a gender battle. Of course, they will eventually reach each other's arms and everything will come close to predictable and pleasant. Slightly moving pull, but Gable and Stanwyck - two gold age icons - make it traceable! <br /> <br /> But real meat on this DVD is another feature - a wonderful and quite unknown little thriller called JEOPARDY. Made in MGM in 1953, this is a wonderful little pearl from a movie that hasn't dated any iota! Stanwyck plays Barry Sullivan and his mother's wife, Lee's Aaker, on a vacation while abandoned and far off the Mexican beach when a tragedy strikes. The dirty wooden museum collapses from the Sullivan trap in a heavy pylon and thinks what? Yes, the tide is coming. If the soul is not in the eyes and cannot release it, Stanwyck leaves for help with the car. After some distance, the only aid she can experience is the shamelessly escaped convicted (Ralph Meeker) who - in return for her help - wants her more than money or clothes ("I'll do everything to save her husband"). Do it or not. <br /> <br /> Meeker disappears with the picture! He turns to high performance! When he gets to the movie, you can't just take your eyes off! An actor who is relaxing in Brando style, did not surprise her films surprisingly. Although he gave great performances as a disgraceful, shamed cavalry officer to prominent Mann / Stewart's western "Naked Spur" (1953) and as one of the most devastating French soldiers in Stanley Kubrick's powerful WW1 drama "Paths of Glory" (1957), only the true celebrity requirement was Mike Hammer "Kiss Me Deadly" by Mickey Spillane in 1955. His "Jeopardy" performance should have done her a miracle, but she only had such a great career in films. He died in 1988. <br /> <br /> Because of this publication, "Jeopardy" can now proudly take its rightful place as a classic. A memorable, tense and exciting thriller thanks to a subtle performance, close trend of John Sturges, Victor Milner's sharp monochrome filmmaking and Dimitri Tiomkin's atmosphere. However, the extras are not big shakes, except for "Jeopardy" and trailers for both movies. <br /> <br /> This plate is also part of the Barbara Stanwycki box, which marks her century. It's hard to believe a lady would be over 100 years old if she was still around! <br /> <br /> JEOPARDY - MGM Winner!
