I saw this movie at the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival. The title of the work was "Dog Days". The audience's reaction was confusing. Some people found that graphic sex and realistic violence are too many for them. Others seemed to appreciate how good this film was. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for heart failure. It's like "Happiness" with explicit sex and less optimistic view of humanity. There's animal poisoning, striptease of older people, orgy-bath in the mall, anal candle spread and torture of mental incompetence. <br /> <br /> If any of these sounds too much to handle this movie, this is not the movie for you. This film shows mankind the most desperate and pathetic. The banality of our existence is the ultimate blow to our face. <br /> <br /> Seidl is not interested in redeeming humanity here. And why should he? This film has excellent exhibitions of all involved people, is always interesting and is probably the most intelligent social statement that the film will take for some time.
