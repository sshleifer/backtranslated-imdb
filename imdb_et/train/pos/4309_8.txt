Many of the comments that people have made strikes me as (sorry). Kasdan wants to make life simple, ordinary life. This traditionally structured story, with character changes that change their lives and then disappear, the music up and the movie is over, is absorbed into this much larger canvas. Many of the characters in this movie have such illumination and then move on. Sometimes they may stick to their perceptions, sometimes they fail, and that is how life really is. In other words, does Kasdan jettisons have a normal dramatic structure that favors studying the continuity of life? is not a happy ending, but a possible end; and everything is still going on before, always grab it? and if you absolutely demand the subject, study the role of a wonderful role in our lives. What is a miracle? Well, life itself, the beginning. Then add all the occasional incidents and cross connections that make up a life or several interconnected lives, and you have wonders for the spider. Kasdan emphasizes this topic lightly rather than demanding it, and strengthens it in many ways, most memorably by the device, right in the middle of the film, with a Mac and his wife, lying in bed, everyone dreaming of their dreams. but also in the movie later showing how these dreams have the power in the film to shape reality. This is not a simple or obvious message. You just have to let him play in front of you and then let him think for a few days, six, a couple of years and see what he's done there. This is undoubtedly Kashan's best film, his most mature, most humane. One of the great meditation of the life of our talented writers and directors. The tragedy is of course not allowed to work for several years, mainly because of studio restrictions around Dreamcatcher. Hopefully we haven't heard of the last Larry from Kasdan. Great movie big artist. Remember that art does not have to be rationalized to succeed.
