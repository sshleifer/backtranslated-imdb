Katherine Heigl, Marley Shelton, Denise Richards, David Boreanaz. Even before I knew what that movie was, these names were enough to bring me in. Excellent, talented and popular, these are performers looking for attention. <br /> <br /> Ok where I start. We already know what the film is. Five beautiful girls who were directed to the "romantic" serial number, the man they all danced at school, 13 years ago. Her brands include fine deaththreats hidden in valentine cards, maggot-infected chocolate and bleeding. His choice: well, take ax, knife, electric transmission, bow and arrow, hot iron etc. Ok, so basically it's a horror movie with nice twisted sexuality. <br /> <br /> Horror movies don't have to be Shakespeare, but I won't go there. I love horror films, but not all of them. This one, I adore. It is there with some other favorite. It's funny, sexy and scary. The killer mask is childishly horrible and seeing the victim long ago and having an arrow is truly terrible. Acting is topnotch: Denise Richards, Marley Shelton and David Boreanaz are very fun. I really want to see a lot, much more Katherine Heigl. I am one of her biggest fans and would like to see her doing the main job soon. Jessica Capshaw is a very capable actor, and Jessica Cauffiel can do that she played the perfect blonde role in Urban Legend 2. The smaller parts were also good; Hedy Buress was a hoot ('bleedmedry.com') and this younger version of Denise Richards seemed terribly like her. <br /> <br /> Highlights: Every death scene had a special difference. The more outrageous in the morgue is the more frightening. Hottin's scene, though ridiculous, was well done. And the audiovisual maze was bad. The soundtrack is great, with horrible music and some good alternative songs. <br /> <br /> Lower Point: I felt the killer wasn't highlighted enough, we barely looked at the mask, and it didn't happen at all. I also thought that the climax was really unreasonable but fun nevertheless. <br /> <br /> The end result was not such a big surprise, but I'm really glad that the filmmakers decided to save us from the whole "explaining killer" routine. <br /> <br /> I don't like to tell people what movies they should see, but if someone asked me to choose a movie that I thought it was really worth, then Valentine would be my rating: 10/10 (Bullseye! )
