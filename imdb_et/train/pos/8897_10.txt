I and my sister rented this movie because we were in the mood for something unpleasant and not so demanding. But the film greatly exceeded my very low expectations. <br /> <br /> It's as much as just a century's representation. It has very real images of characters and most of the participants do amazing work. Different stories are baked with the actual film material from the time that gives it a very unique touch. Looking at it, I felt that I was taking care of what characters happened. stood out! <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone ..
