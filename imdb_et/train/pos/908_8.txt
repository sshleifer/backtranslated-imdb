I can't believe this movie is rated now 6.9. Anyway, this movie was probably one of the most touching Indian movies I've ever seen. It was really refreshing to see a movie that showed a traditional family film. As for the story, I thought it was great when it was about shahid kapur creation organized marriage amrita ruffle. He is a kind of happy lucky man, while Amrita Rao is a traditional Indian girl who is very helpful to her uncle, but the only problem is her cousin who doesn't see as much attention as she does with Amrita's passion. It disturbs Amrita because she wants her aunt to love her. It was also very sensitive to see that although the Amrita family was not so rich, perhaps the middle class for the lower class, while the Shahid family was quite top class, they treated their family with respect and did not even ask those who really collided with me. This is because I have actually seen people being very rude to people who have not thought so well below their standards, which I think is very low. This film showed that the Shahid family was ready to look at the great values ​​that Amrita had brought up, and it was an eye-catching eye that she was not a rich business daughter or anything. All in all, this movie 8/10 earned more and more of such movies.
