With the wheel of Devil, like Ang Lee's later Brokeback Mountain, is an aesthetic and historical film. Film students should see it at least twice because its artistic nuance is worth understanding. An ideal work of art, the surprising depth of humanity. I really do not remember another warfare, so it hits you, changes your existing history and policy, restores your faith in humanity. Having seen so many killings, so much suffering, they do not feel numb, instead of having more ties between people. The actors' performances haunt your heart, the music guides your mind. Some shoots, not just a few pictures, they cross themselves, becoming a soul. This is the real feeling of the film, which is a work of art. <br /> <br /> This movie does not require long comments or comments, everything it says. Ovation to cast, featuring Tobey Maguire, Jeffrey Wright, and Jewel Kilcher, a cinema and lyrical composer, an accomplishment!
