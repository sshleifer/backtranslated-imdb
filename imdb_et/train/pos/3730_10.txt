If you want to watch a movie and you know it well, Tigerland is a movie for you. I love this movie from the top down. The perfect scenes of this movie are so real; it's almost like a documentary that happened in real life, but drama. Boy, I'll tell you ... REAL Drama, which they actually "fought" on one scene (get a DVD to hear the comment that it's not obvious). I see this movie as a man of desperate young people trying to flee a bad fate after watching Saving Private Ryan. I appreciate what a "badly fateful fate" is and how exactly the men of the movie know. I see this between "Stand By Me" and "Saving Private Ryan". What do men do when they are "hard pressed" in real life? Some men crazy, some men cry, some men fists, other drugs, some randomly sleep with whores trying to ruthlessly lose the meaning of love from their lives, some trying to drink pain, jump from buildings or bridges, some feel guilty and others feel so embarrassed and others feel so embarrassed that they are so sick that they collapsed - physically. This movie has all those desperate emotions that are rolled into one ball. But don't get me wrong if it's not a depressing film, its a realistic, very humorous movie, this stabbing and funny Bozz (Collin's Symbol) will light it all up and there will be about 5 female actors in the movie. ; I'll let you understand what it is for them! Shoot the perfect scene with the right music with the sequences of dialogue, war / action; this movie has everything as I said: top down. I don't know why Tigerland is heavily underfunded. The best thing about having a movie is that it says it on the cover with a big "Best Movie of the Year", and that is absolutely nothing. Keep rare gems in Hollywood, 10/10.
