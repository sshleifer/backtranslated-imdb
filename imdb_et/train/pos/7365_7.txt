I found it very touching, because Spike and Heaton are all over the film, not to say there are no betrayals along the way. I thought the chase was set aside if there was a relationship between the two, which I think. I had already thought that Heaton had such gay intentions. My favorite scene was to be a little bit where Heaton and Spike were bogged down and Spike ran off what I generally thought Spike hadn't come back. I must say that if our film education teacher hadn't watched us, I would probably have seen it. In general, I thought this movie was pretty good and would recommend it to all people who are a fan of British films.
