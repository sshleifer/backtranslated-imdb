The title of this movie is taken from the party's game "Seven Minutes in Heaven". The game was popular with my husband's friends when he was at school in New York, NY and described it as "Spin-the-Bottle", "Lifesaver Relay", and other preteen kisses. According to the rules, the boy's name and the girl are drawn, and the chosen persons ordered to get into the dark cabinet together for seven minutes. In the meantime, there is speculation among the party guests about whether they had a nerve to hold, accept and / or kiss in the cabinets. At the end of seven minutes, the gambler would say "time is over" or knocking on the cabinet door and the couple will appear out of the closet. After interviewing other guests, the couple should admit what they had done in their "seven minutes in the sky". Then, other couples will be selected to enter the closet until all guests have participated. The couple who recognized the most action would be the winners of the game. <br /> <br /> Such games have been "icebreakers" for children and teenagers, but they can be embarrassing and frightening for individuals. The film has been given this title because it deals with teenagers' first experiences of crushing and romantic love.
