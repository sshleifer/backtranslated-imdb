An inspiring story of Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), a black man who grew up in poverty in Kentucky and then joined the US Navy, trying to be the first black champion in navy history. We are shown that Brashear must fight from childhood to change his dreams (and then keep him alive). Not the least of the challenges was Master Diver Bill Sunday (Robert DeNiro), head trainer diving school, Navy sends Brashear, who is not particularly sympathetic to Brashear's goals, but who eventually becomes unlikely friend and supporter. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie; fast paced and high-activity, though not a "normal" image in the usual sense of the word. Here is also a very human story and an interesting study of racism and overcoming it; there is also the idea of ​​a fight that took place in the 1960s between older and younger naval officers ("old navy" vs. "new navy"). The performances are pretty good - especially Goodings. I thought DeNiro might have been slightly up on his Sunday portrait (though who knows Sunday could have been such an extreme cannon) and depicting Sunday woman Gwen (by Charlize Theron) questioned me whether these parts were "jazzed up" "to provide entertainment value. <br /> <br /> Good movie, though. I've never wondered if it's worth bringing. <br /> <br /> 7/10
