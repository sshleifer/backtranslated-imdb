This shorter film is the expected result when the shelter is directed to imbet. It is sad how their young futures were rolled out, if neither Saddam Hussein nor the Iraqi people, God rested the dead 350,000 souls, had nothing to do with terrorism or al-Quid. <br /> <br /> After this movie, the smart viewer must pick up or download "Loose Change". This movie is available for free on the Internet until the Bush Kabbal locks it down, with a googling-up title, like in closed brackets. <br /> <br /> God save our country. This is not done by following Christo-fascists who controlled the Congress Hall for over a decade before November 2006!
