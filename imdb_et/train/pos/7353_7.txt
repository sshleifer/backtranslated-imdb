This movie can be one of Bollywood's most underrated film. This 1994 explosive had all that good performance, music and direction. I remember when I was in Allahabad, when this movie took place and it was somewhere in March at Holi, people who played their song "Ooe Amma" in their speakers with the highest volume. If someone who likes to look at some similar heat and slips over Marilyn Monroe, he should see this movie. Tiny to Govinda.However, many of you know that this movie has been filmed in southern India and after Sholay was one of the few Blockbuter hit Silver Screen.With movies like these Indian comedy will never be dead.
