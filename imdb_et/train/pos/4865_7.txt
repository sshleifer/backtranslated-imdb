I couldn't wait to get it when I read Fred Astaire with George Burns & Gracie Allen in a movie with P.G. Wersehouse and Gershwin music. It is certainly worth seeing, but there is no uniform quality of Fred & Ginger's films. <br /> <br /> It would probably be better to read the story from Wodehouse's book, where humor is better. Some acting are totally painful to look at (especially the young boy and the girl). <br /> <br /> But ...! Funhouse dance is worth more than most movies. I didn't know Gracie Allen could dance, but the boy does it in the movie. Have you ever tried to stay in one of these spinning disks in the amusement park? Imagine one high side by side! It perfectly preserves Astaire and significantly increases the overall image quality. <br /> <br /> Several nice songs, especially fun, are a nice job when you get this and a tight top lip. <br /> <br /> Recommended for Astaire, Burns & Allen fans. I had to go back and watch the dance house as soon as the credit was rolled.
