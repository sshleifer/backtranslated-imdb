S.S. Van Dine must be a smart businessman in dealing with Hollywood. Most of the film series from the studio days were usually limited to one or two studios. But apparently Van Dine has to sell his rights to every book on Philo Vance one by one. Please note that Paramount, MGM, Warner Brothers and all other Philo Vance films. Only Tarzan seemed to be around Hollywood. <br /> <br /> MGM produced a murder leader and celebrated Edmund Lowe as a fashionable detective. Of course, MGM was on the screen with the original Philo contract, but Bill Powell was busy at The Thin Man and I think Louis B. Mayer decided to focus on him. <br /> <br /> Edmund Lowe is quite acceptable for Philo Vance. Lowe started with a pretty big, What Price Glory at the tip of the quiet era, and then with Victor McLaglen with his Flagg and Quirt characters. But when McLaglen got his Oscar for the informant, Lowe seemed to be in the B-market. <br /> <br /> The Garden Murder Case includes three separate victims: Douglas Walton, Gene Lockhart and Frieda Inescourt. The deadly atmosphere around the offender gives it away, the mystery is really how all the killings are related and how they have been achieved. <br /> <br /> I say this, however. Vance takes a great opportunity to hate exposing and the last 15 minutes are worth Hitchcock.
