I couldn't comment after reading a very short "bad" comment. This movie is much better than just not bad. Acting is a meaning, even for the children of the cast, who do not play cute or anything but act like my son's friends. The film is smart and hopes it will be the audience. Double back flash story lines are creative and help story, not act as a time filler. I watched this movie with my kids and then looked at it a few days later. If you have babies and you have fatal movies that inspire diabetic coma with your syrup sweetness, check out "holes". My 6-year-old enjoyed it as much as my 11 year old and my husband and I liked it as much as two. How many movies do you want to say about it?
