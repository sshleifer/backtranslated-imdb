Although Johnny Dangerously is critically annoyed, it is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. This is a film that should be closely monitored; some funny bits are over and they have not been given their usual attention. For example, keep an eye out for Michael Keaton's price gun at the pet store ... and also in the documentary years that appeared at the beginning of the scenes. It's one of those rare movies where humor hits you unexpectedly, though you know it's comedy. Director Amy Heckerling is very sharp here - if you liked her famous movies (Fast Times Ridgemont High, Clueless, European Vacation, etc.), you should watch it. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton is a very nice title and supportive cast (Griffin Dunne, Maureen Stapleton, Joe Piscopo, Peter Boyle) is great. Highly recommended.
