I've loved this movie because I first saw it in 1979. I am still surprised at how exactly Kurt Russell depicts Elvis, directly on how he moves and expressions in his face. Sometimes it is scary how much he sees, acts and talks like a real Elvis. Fortunately, it is released on a DVD so everyone who is waiting can finally get a full-length movie of excellent quality. I've heard of some detractors who say there are some inaccuracies or some things left out, but I think, bearing in mind that John Carpenter only had about 2 1/2 hours to work and that it was shown on television (just two years after Elvis's death!) that he did it. In fact, I haven't seen another Elvis movie that even comes close to it. Highly recommended.
