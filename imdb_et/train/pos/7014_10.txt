Wow ... I don't know what to say. I just looked at seven pounds. No one can call me like Will Smith. The man is very inconsistent with the great amount of human emotions. This film was skilfully and beautifully made. Rare to find such an intense humanity in Hollywood. I would compare it to "Pay it Forward" and "Crash" insofar as both light and darkness are so raw. Definitely stick with you for a long time and give you a lot of thought. I have a deep love and passion for such films. It is not usually a "bad end", but rather a seeker of truth that includes emotions, raw life and more than a plurality that is numerous around the whole. That's why I don't mind a little pain at the end. It is true to life that there is always no happy ending. Sometimes it's just not the happy ending you think. Many people were able to live happy lives, even though the love and life of one person were lost. If you are someone who looks like you love this movie!
