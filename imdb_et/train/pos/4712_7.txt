The jokes are obvious, the gags are bright and the characters are running - but I couldn't laugh at my very fun movie. Regardless of how many times I see it, I get out of it, and I recommend it for very pleasant entertainment. It includes many moments to quote and some of the best things I've seen. If you have had a bad week and you need to be bothered, rent it out on your home Friday night to give your weekend a good start.
