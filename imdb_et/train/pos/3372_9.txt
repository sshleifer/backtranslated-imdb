His time is a tribute to the great Charton Heston after his recent passing, but this film is not. Her other past-generation films were her best work at BEN HUR, TEN COMMANDENTS, OMEGA MAN and APES PLANET. <br /> <br /> This film, made in 1973, attempted to predict the future land, in 2022 it is so overcrowded that the authorities have manipulated the human race to eat a universally produced food called "Soylent Green", which is made of human flesh. This strange and unlikely film at the time of release was as ridiculous as it is today and expects that the Indian population, who would be about 2 billion by this stage, would be a meatman without knowing it. <br /> <br /> Charlton Heston's characterizes the secret international conspiracy created by world authorities to satisfy the nutritional requirements of overpopulation by using cannibalism. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the producers of this movie do not have a green message they are presenting, not the green party of today's ethos. Thank God. The natives of New Zealand, Fiji and Borneo only used cannibalism 40 years before this film was made, but human civilization has long abandoned it. <br /> <br /> Another silly prediction in the movie is that women become a nearly sexual slave, reversing the rise of radical feminism that was in 1972 when the film was made. <br /> <br /> The film was foolish and is now silly, but it contains a very unememable last film late and a great Edward G. Robinson report, but there is still no valid reason to review the film just for academic reasons. <br /> <br /> This is a movie and I don't recommend it even for baby boomers or Charlton Heston fans. All the other reviews of this film that I read are all the same as referring to a dystopian society whose central theme of the future seems to be related only to the US, where there has been an ecological disaster. <br /> <br /> The only thing in the movie is that the earth is facing overpopulation.
