One of the greatest classic comedies. Not a tiny comedy, not a heavy drama. Funny, satirical film, buyers keep the new home under the guidance. <br /> <br /> To be filled with big characters, all of whom, Cary Grant, is convinced of being a fleece in building a dream home. br /> <br /> Great look at the end of the 40s. <br /> <br />
