I just want to say that I'm so glad that somebody finally beans on this movie. Bravo Spaz, Bravo! This film is a ridiculous farce of filmmaking. Especially for the student film! I just want to give Spazz the recognition that he took care of finding such a rare picture of the absurd time, and then commented on it! Most people I know do not have such time, especially so little stops reading it. Kudos you sir! Anyway, the film follows a thin story that is at least incredible and just stupid. I understand the idea of ​​creating a satire of Charlie's angels, but why hire such cruel actors! Also, which director is acting, writes, produces and edits the picture! Choose one job and put it all in your love! It's so ashamed, because I hear he did a good movie about a killer toothbrush. Again, thanks to Spazz to retrieve this movie curtain, your similar people are rare.
