Even though I'm pretty young, Beatles is my ABSOLUTE WORD band! I have never had the opportunity to listen to their music when it was released but have liked them because I remember. I understand why it wasn't published in the cinema, but it's definitely a great movie to put on the TV. I flew through my TV program and happened to watch this movie, it didn't give much detail except anything, "John Lennon and Paul McCartney meet after The Beatles have broken down, Jared Harris Stars." I would never have heard of him (he was playing John) or Aiden Quinn who played Paul. However, they are definitely undervalued participants! Like a big fan, I know what real Lennon and McCartney are. The script was brilliant and Harris got Lennon's accent, personality and courtesy. Quinn played well with McCartney, but sometimes he went to his Irish accent. Make-up artists showed them perfectly. <br /> <br /> THIS CERTIFICATE MAY BE APPROVED A * SPOILER *: <br /> <br /> As I mentioned earlier, it went slowly but soon developed and became quite an emotional film. I found a little waste of time in the park and completely character for both musicians. Lennon's rude line in an Italian restaurant is totally unnecessary. The end result was very embarrassing and brought a tear to my eye when I looked at it. <br /> <br /> It is completely different from the other biographies I've seen, where it is, how the Beatles joined and belonged, and they didn't really make those signs. For example, Finally, I would say that if you are a fan of Beatles or John Lennon or Paul McCartney, give him the chance to have a pleasant surprise. Only for about 95 minutes, you should wait for the film to develop. be very interested.
