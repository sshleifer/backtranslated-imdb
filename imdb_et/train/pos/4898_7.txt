A captivating little movie created in the UK associated with the (almost) swinging of the (almost) rocking band of all girls in World War II. Old-fashioned luminaries bring Dench and Laine always with great "tubes" to watch this fun life in light. Time for well-spent time and fun watches for everyone.
