I just saw this movie @ TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival). Hal Hartley fans don't have to be disappointed! And if you don't know the work of this director ... it doesn't matter. This film can be completely independent. I have to go for another screening ... it was amazing to have to see it again - and fast! <br /> <br /> This movie is very funny. This dialogue is very smart, and Parker Posey's performance is remarkable when he stands for the role of Fay Grim. Fay Grim is the last feature in the world and featured in Henry Fool (2000). Visually, the most important stylistic feature uses a customary (or Dutch) angle, which can often be seen in various shorts available in possible films: Hal Hartley's 1994-2004 Collections, and Girl's Monday (2005). <br /> <br /> I was watching this movie on September 11th most appropriately. Textually, Fay Grim's adventure in this story is back on September 11, 2001 after a changed world. than ever before in the fictional cinema after 911 (see Syria: lateral note - Mark Cuban Exec. Prod in both films ... most interesting). Finally, for those who are closely associated with the characters of Henry Fool, Simone, Fay and Henry, this film is fun and self-conscious. Fay Grimm's nature begins in the film, exactly where he was when Henry Fool ended, but at the end of the film ... Fay's knowledge and experience has changed and expanded during the story. What can be the future of the Fay and Fool family ...? I can't wait for the third part of this story!
