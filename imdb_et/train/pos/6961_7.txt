The title got my attention and then I wondered what the plot will be like, as we've seen so many "super-people" films in those years ... and really really liked it because there were many unusual funny scenes that I didn't expect. Uma Thurman was the average of G-Girl's role. Surprisingly, I was able to see my toes wide-screen again (like at the beginning of Kill Bill). Luke Wilson, however, played very well with the idiot's daily man who met a great woman. If you want to have fun, you should definitely look at G-Girl's and Matt's average adventures, especially for the joy of your partner. 7/10 in my collection.
