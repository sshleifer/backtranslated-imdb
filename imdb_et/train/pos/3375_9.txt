In this film, 2022 looks like the 1970s. It is amusing at first, but soon the viewer will perceive how different this decadent futuristic world is from the perspective of how many things we take for granted cannot be obtained. <br /> <br /> Signs often communicate in a peculiar way, without tactics or ways. I believe this is deliberate, not bad action. After all, those who showed the social changes of the 60s and 70s can be assumed that by 2022 the overpopulated urban population will behave like this. <br /> <br /> I didn't like most of the action scenes, except for the priest after death: too cheap even in the seventies. The plot is not too polished. But the big scenes and ideas - like Sol's death, how the attackers and corpses deal with it - "furniture" outweigh the drawbacks of this film. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
