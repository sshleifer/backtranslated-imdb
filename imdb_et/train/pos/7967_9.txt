This is definitely one of the biggest ever made in Disney movies. It's a real pleasure for everyone. It makes you laugh, it makes you cry, and it makes you skip. when their owners go on vacation. They don't know what's going on and who desperately want to go home, they run away from the farm and try to find their way through the desert. <br /> <br /> This is one of the latest films that Don Ameche has introduced. He gave Shadow, an old, smart and friendly golden retriever voice. Sally Field, who gave Sassy's voice to the Himalayan cat, also starred in this film. But seriously what this film is about is an opportunity! The voice of Michael J. Fox (my favorite actor of all time) is that Chance is basically everything you expect from a dog, a loved one, playfully, energetically, and foolishly, and every time I break this movie, it is due to the opportunity; It's like comedy never ends! <br /> <br /> This movie is sometimes very sad. Sometimes it reminds people of the times when they have been alone or when they lose their pets. <br /> <br /> The one scene that always misses me is the scene where the trio tries to escape from the nail; Especially I feel shocked when Chance gets his neck in the garden and almost doesn't do it. There were other alternating moments in the film, but I don't think it would be more tense than that. If you liked this movie, you probably enjoy following. I'll give this movie 10 out of 10 solid!
