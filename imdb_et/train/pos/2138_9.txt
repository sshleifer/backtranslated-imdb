This film revolves around Japanese culture as much as the life of a modern Japanese family. Physical exposure of people over 7 years of age, especially the public, is nervous, so it's all about hugging even when you're close friends / relatives. Dancing the dance halls means that your hands are placed around someone else and in public! Never Less Ballroom Dancing is quite popular. People dancing in Japan are considered a bit like nudists in the West ... much more would like to do, but inhibit culture. A pleasant family film that every amateur dancer would enjoy for dance events only. I understand that it was more popular than Titanic in Japan. I think the Japanese are like the rest of us - they also want to hug.
