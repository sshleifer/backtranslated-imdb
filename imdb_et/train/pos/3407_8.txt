Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer give solid performances in this beautiful but empty film. The irony is that Dietrich plays a woman with a beautiful but empty life. Really gorgeous cinematography and sets and yes, Dietrich's bottomless clothing is also fabulous. He looks good; Boyer looks young and beautifies. Max Steiner's score and good support. The film lasts as 76 minutes and seems poorly edited, plus some characters that appear or disappear. , Tilly Losch Dancer, John Carradine Hunter and Basil Rathbone are playing .... well, I'm not sure. He just rides the desert and breaks everything! As others have pointed out, John Gilbert was joined to Dietrich. I can't help but think he would have been wonderful. The world's tired Boris's role would have been very good for Gilbert. And after the success of Queen Christina (with Garbo) she could regain her career again. <br /> <br /> I don't think of any other film from the 1930s that Dietrich did. She looks good and wears terrible clothes. My favorite is Valentino like Shiek-type clothing he's wearing by the pool. <br /> <br /> Be sure to look for lush sets and colors and two big stars.
