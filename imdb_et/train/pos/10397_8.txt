Stealing Baghdad's thief is quite a story that is almost as wonderful as the story told in this film. Alexander Korda went almost insane about making this film. <br /> <br /> According to the Citadel series of films "Great British Movies", the UK son Alexander Korda took this film back in 1933 and spent years planning and preparing. However, during World War II, Korda and the cost of filming the spectacular vision remained. <br /> <br /> Budgeting in US films, only Cecil B. DeMille always had a free hand in Paramount after 1932 when she returned there. But neither DeMille nor any of his American companions had to worry about enemy bombs when shooting a movie. Part of this fire, Korda spent the whole company in America and put those sequences with Rex Ingram as our Grand Canyon gene. He certainly didn't want to get such a landscape in the UK. Korda also finished the Hollywood interior all the time during the Christmas holidays of 1940. <br /> <br /> The view of this thing was given to four academic awards candidates and three color cinematography, the best colors. color film art and set direction and best special effects. Only Miklos Rosza's original musical score did not carry the prize in the designated category. The times must be really happy to have decided to shoot in Grand Canyon, because it is impossible to get bad colored pictures from this place. <br /> <br /> Special effects, however, do not destroy the simple story of good triumph over evil. Two young lovers John Justin and June Duprez are good and evil is Conrad Veidt as a witch who is trying to steal both the kingdom and the heart, both of which belong to Dupre. It was to Veidti's career to Casablanca, where he played Luftwaffe's bigger stroesser. <br /> <br /> Of course, it is a good thing that the unlikely source is of little help. A mild boy and a thief Sabu, who could very well be one of the few who could call themselves an international film. Clearly out of poverty as Mysore Maharajah as an elephant-stable boy, he was shown by Alexander Korda, who needed one of his jungle qualities as a local leader. Saba strikes the innocence and misery of all the youth as he fills the fantasy of the tyranny boy of the tyrannical boy. Not a bad message to send in 1940. <br /> <br /> The Baghdad Thief holds it very well today. It is an eternal story of love, romance and adventure in every order.
