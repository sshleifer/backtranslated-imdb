Could not understand why Jeremy Irons felt it was necessary to exhibit the most distracting pressure that was spoken through crushed teeth and behind the throat. In fact, it's rather a breach of the film for me, and it has mixed up what was probably his very good result (very irritating). No other actor or actor seemed to have such a pronounced emphasis, and although I have always appreciated Jeremy Irons as a fine actor, I would not classify this film as one of his best. But the film is my appetite, as well as some other comments about this movie, which I found very interesting and I am going to read the book now.
