Tess of the Storm Country was Mary Pickford's vehicle, which I had for a while. I finally found a copy of VHS at a reasonable price and I could enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Mary gives her typical filthy, innocently sexy image from the wrong side of a girl who wins a rich heart successor. Only then will the stakes be higher: the wrong murder charge, the illegal child (and the subsequent motherhood) and the weighted suicide. <br /> <br /> You can see why Pickford wanted to do it again. The story is a true moral story he loved to celebrate. Controversial issues are not always clearly identified; the viewer must pay attention and take hints to catch everything that is expected at first viewing? although everything is more or less explained, it is only a negative remark about Jean Hershol and the dog. Hersholt, whose character Ben Letts looks like about 6 to 200 pounds (of course bigger than Mary), is sent to panic as the 60-pound chocolate lab pays him! Then he will be able to put it down (or perhaps justify his amazing fear of the dog) that he will be able to grab him on the ground and somehow harm him so much that he is still in trouble, how bad the storm hits! It's the same lovable lab that sleeps with Frederick (Lloyd Hughes) and shouts to Mary! But Mary later throws Ben on her face with boiling water that hardly slows her down! Okay, I've vented around Ben and the chocolate lab! Other than that, the film was quite touching and my attention was paid. Pickford's supportive casting was strong and credible. This is definitely one of his best films.
