Several years ago, when I first saw "gray gardens", I remember laughing and having a fun camp. Years later I still laugh loudly when I look at it, but after several views I have seen the beauty in the strange, twisted relationship between the "Big" Edith Bouvier Beale and her daughter "Little" Edith Bouvier Beale. br /> <br /> Mother and daughter, living together with their disintegrating 28-room East Hampton mansion, add a completely new meaning to the term "Shabby Chic". With numerous cats, raccoons, and opossums, Albert and David Maysles promised Jackie O's aunt and Niece filmmakers to live in their lives every day. The result is a fun, beautiful, sad and touching account of true love and anarchy rule. <br /> <br /> Relationship between the Great and Little Edie is a testimony of the unbreakable bond of love. And their life is an example of leadership, determination, and free will. This movie has more to suggest than put it in words. This is a rare experience you need to see yourself. <br /> <br />
