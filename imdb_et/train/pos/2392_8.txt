I am 19 years old and got really tired of watching Care Bears all the time. Rooney is a great dancer who cares when he is gay. This man must be a cheerleader or something. <br /> <br /> Beats Barney, can't get the songs out of my head ... must ... stop singing ........ Doodlebops songs. ....... NOW. <br /> <br /> There must be ten lines of text so I have to continue ..... what if I say all Canadian things like OOOUT Aboooot. Dirty Canadians ..... Jazmine is too much of a rhyme, she must be a Dutchman. <br /> <br /> Knock who is there, Dee Dee, super hottie <br /> <br /> Bus driver Bob can't dance, take Rooney's story
