this is a movie that wants you never to pick up a nerd that grew up in school. If you liked this movie, I would recommend you watch Valentine. I learned today that Marty (Simon) played a man who killed himself shortly after the release of the film, which is a shame because he did a good job. I don't know if it's because of the part he played in the movie. It starts when Carol tricks into the girls' lavatory as they anticipated. When he changed to the shower, Carol's popular friends penetrated the bathroom and got everything ready, camera, electric shock, mast. When Marty opened naked behind the curtain, she realized she was deceiving. He tries to cover the shower, but the kids open it, grab Marty and start thinking about it when the camera runs. They pulled him up, pulled the head with it when it was rinsed, and they cranked him (a little). When the children are arrested by the coach, the two boys give Marty a joint that throws him away. Leave a break with a glass window in the gym using brick to excuse the teacher. While Marty laughs in the bathroom, Snea jumps into a science lab and mixes things like cocaine, but she's not sure what it was. Lab is bad for him. Five years later, the children who tormented him today received an invitation to a 5-year-old school in an old school that burned that day. One by one people kill people. I don't understand how a drowned girl drowned. he could have got back after Marty's departure. He went out almost for the first time.
