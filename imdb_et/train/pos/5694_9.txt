Val Kilmer and Dylan McDermott are terrible. I've seen Kilmer on The Doors, but his interpretation of John Holmes is great. Nothing was compared to Boogie Nights, which was kind of slow. Wonderland is a film that can show you a terrible criminal story from a man who has just promised his drug vice and what is ever going on. At the same time, the character of John Holmes is very wisely showing a hustler who is able to pass through the nastes and the toughest situations that are almost intact. The film is worth watching more than once. The atmosphere of the seventies is sensual and the drug-filled is amazing.
