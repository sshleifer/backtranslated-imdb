The only thing about this movie that strikes me is that DVD is so expensive. For my budget, it is too much for the moment, or I would buy it because the film is a good example of a movie's young man ... and I enjoy watching Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter. <br /> <br /> The criterion produces great DVDs, but sometimes the questionable price is a bit. This is an 80-minute black and white mono sound that is good but nothing extraordinary with cinematography. <br /> <br /> The story is a story here (not visuals, actors, sound, kits, etc.) as a Widmark that involuntarily opens with espionage microfilm at his disposal after the Peters wallet. (say three times!). Everyone except Peters is a credible sign of this film: Widmark, police officers, US representatives and communists, and especially Ritter as "Moe", informant. He and Widmark are the stars of this movie. <br /> <br /> Peters is doing a decent job to play cheap, but loses his credibility early with Widmark in his first meeting, though he is disgusting for him. Only movie in the world !! Too bad because this ridiculous part of the novel's story takes away. <br /> <br /> This is an average movie noir, which means good but not big and definitely not worth $ 25-35. For that price, the film's young man could do much better on the market.
