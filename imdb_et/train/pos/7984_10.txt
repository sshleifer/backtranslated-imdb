Man is a fire, certainly one of the best drama / crime thrillers I've ever seen. Despite the slow start, this story is so amazingly complex and sensitive that it stays pretty well. This is Denzel Washington's perfect role, where he plays a body guard called Creasy, tortured by his past and an alcoholic, but never gives up his obligation to save his last member of the Defense Forces, Pita. Dakota Fanning plays Pita, a very intelligent, enthusiastic little girl who loves so many things and acts very convincingly, she has a great future in front of her. As I said, this story is somewhat complicated in order to fully understand it, you have to look at it a few times. <br /> <br /> This movie has been made in two parts, there is the first hour where everyone is happy. Nothing is wrong, everyone is happily happening until Pita is kidnapped and where Creasy is almost killed. And then there is another part, the rest of the film, where suddenly everything becomes complicated and somewhat harsh and annoying when Creasy has recovered from his severe injury and is responsible for killing and killing many criminals and "La Hermamdad". and Pita kidnapping. <br /> <br /> Denzel Washington shows us our most up-to-date talent with many other talented players who have a great future. It is really shameful that this film is not sufficiently acknowledged, indeed another Oscar, and so is Fanning and director, for earning Washington. And maybe even visual effects that were of high quality. <br /> <br /> If you like great, slightly inclined, tense thrillers, this is what you see. The most amazing thing is that the elements of this movie are based on real story and real characters! 10/10
