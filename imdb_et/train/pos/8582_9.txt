Love the symbols and the story. Very funny with lots of activities. Thomas Ian Griffith and Tia Carrer give great performances. I liked the dynamic and comic communication of Griffith and his career. Donald Southerland has a very pleasant and surprisingly sympathetic, burned hit man. All three actors are among my favorites and have been specially treated for this film. Nice addition to my extensive DVD collection. I highly recommend this movie. If you like ... Mr. and Mrs Smith, Replacement Warriors, L.A. Confidential, Long Kiss Goodnight, Abyss and all nine yard ... you love this movie.
