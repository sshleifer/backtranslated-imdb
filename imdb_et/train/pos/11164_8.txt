A century ago, Brouckin led Chuck Connors and Steve Brodie and their competing volunteer firefighters to Brodie's famous contribution to jumping out of Brooklyn Bridge. This is a story that has been known to many people by Bugs Bunny's "Bowery Bugs" since 1949. <br /> <br /> This generally very enjoyable movie would probably be more widely available if it wasn't a notorious and amazing scene that includes some Chinese tenants - a slow time-lapse of racial attitudes, which I find to be of great historical interest to the film.
