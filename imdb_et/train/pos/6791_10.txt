I was the second move to make it a movie, it would be great! I was also surprised by the style and character of this game. I've played it over and over again (over 20 times) to try something else and it gets more interesting every time. Final Fantasy Eats Your Heart! This should be done in the movie !!!!! If somebody wants some help from there to start a petition to bring it in, please contact me. I would like to help this project every day. The graphics are great for the PS1 and even forget that it is mostly PS1. Many side visits change it every time you play.
