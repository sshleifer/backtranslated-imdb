... and if you're very good, it's like Moon Over Parador. <br /> <br /> This movie was a bit stupid story, but it was a fantasy, and the pain and the act of acting were well done! Dreyfuss was perfect as an actor / impostor full of all the small neuroses and vanities you imagine. You see a glimpse of what the actors are behind the scenes. <br /> <br /> It was one of Dreyfuss' best roles, as his character also has the best role for a dead dictator! And leaving: like something out of Casablanca! <br /> <br /> Raul Julia was great as the head of the Paradian secret police. He gets some really funny lines, some of which are tribute to other films, like "the rounding of the usual suspects!" <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> And Sonia Braga was a great girlfriend - besides being a really hot number: "You should get an Oscar today!" Let's not forget Johnny Winters as a CIA agent and as a number of guest stars: Sammy Davis Jr., Ike Pappas, Dick Cavett - all done perfectly. <br /> <br /> All in all, a memorable loot within the Parade month. <br /> <br /> -R.
