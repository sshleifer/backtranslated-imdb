The key to the 40-year-old Virgin is not only that Andy Stitzer is a 40-year-old virgin, but how Steve Carell made him one. The Crass "comedy" genre, which has become a feature of its lack of humor and fascinating characters, offers a 40-year-old virgin, cast and intelligent, heartfelt script that does not use the brutal jokes as its main character. The fact that Andy is still forty years old is not really as funny as it is curiosity. <br /> <br /> Carell, Team Ferrelli veteran at Anchorman and ex-Daily Show castman, uses the film concept to expand his character? we understand why Andy is how he is. This is the little movie that makes this movie work. When Andy's colleague in the electronics shop asks what he did at the weekend, Andy describes his unsuccessful efforts in cooking. When Andy rides his bicycle to work, he notices his calls. Does she not simply admire her home with the active indicators? he paints them and talks to them and shows that some really old ones have belonged to him from childhood. Smaller comedy won't even focus on all these things. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simplified? Andy's fellow students find that she has never had sex, and they do it for personal use to get her bed in bed with a woman. It is a childish idea and the film does not try to hide its minor. <br /> <br /> Andy's friends are complementary to his neurotic nature: David (Paul Rudd) has broken his girlfriend over two years ago, but is Jay (Romany Malco) a feminine female man and Cal (Seth Rogen) is a tattooed sex care . Their attempts to get Andy on the back of the bag many times and every time Andy feels less and less optimistic. <br /> <br /> Finally, Andy meets one of his mothers, Trish (played by Catherine Keener), and much more of her worrying mates who claim that mothers are not worth it, she falls in love with her. They start a relationship and agree to quit sex for 20 years? Trish didn't know that Andy was still a virgin. <br /> <br /> The 40-year-old virgin leader was led by Judd Apatow, a man who produced Anchorman and The Cable Guy and started a short-lived cult rehearsal Freaks and Geeks. Apatow is known for its unique sense of humor and script? compiled by Carell? However, this 40-year-old Virgin offers the most interesting and (even surprising) aspect of its maturity. By now, you are probably aware that the film got a glimpse of the critics and even I was surprised by this warm reception. But after seeing the movie, it's easy to understand why. We like Andy. We care about him. Isn't she just a clich√© of a sex comedy cut out of cardboard? he is a real, lively, breathing person. His neurotic traits combine Woody Allen's best childish naivety. His friends are not unpleasant jerks and his romance is angry and bitter. It captures the chord with the audience. <br /> <br /> Although it is far from a perfect movie, and it certainly contains some fairly raw and sexual humor, it doesn't break through other genre records. because we have affection for people on the screen. Are the best sex comedies working this way? from a risky business to an American pie? and this is a big difference between a 40 year old virgin and 40 days and 40 nights.
