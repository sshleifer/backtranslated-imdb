Recently, we discussed the friend and I the educational and ethical implications of growing in the 1950s compared to today. He mentioned Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who wrote in 1798 in the family of an ancient sailor. Both were obliged to share some of the epic poems in high school and English literature courses at college. My friend said, "His messages, even in today's context, can be called metaphysical." <br /> <br /> We tried to read it and remember only bits and pieces. (I'm having trouble remembering Dr. Seuss.) I said I'd get two poems so everyone could read it. It was easy enough, but I was very surprised that it was made for a movie. We look forward to watching the movie to see how it was interpreted. After all, Ancient Mariner Rime isn't exactly easy reading. After reading each poem we watched the movie together. <br /> <br /> We considered the film a remarkable achievement, especially since it was made in the 1970s, before the computer, before the so-called "Ken Burns effect", and before the special effects too often began to compensate for the lack of substance. and 20th century illustrations cut from "lesser-known artists", like the early Hollywood designer Willy Pogany. <br /> <br /> The film is spoken by Sir Michael Redgrave, who was taught by the poet when he was a schoolmaster, adding power and the tone of credibility that it has left in the poem. <br /> <br /> The mastery of this is in the layers of fine messages that are transmitted without "instruction" or the story of oppressive and obvious morals. We found this to be a refreshing change in today's "your face" and "grabs them over the head." Most of the moral messages of today's film are two-dimensional: extreme violence, murder and chaos are bad, bad is really, really, bad and good are heroes. Just as a person would not have a nuance, the ancestor of an ancient sailor is the celebration of the individual, the character, the celebration of all the wealth that life has to offer in the larger context of humanity, ie the ability of man to give others. <br /> <br /> We know that we have found this "unknown" legacy, so we learned that it had won its top five prizes in sixth international film festivals. Another surprise was to learn film director Raul daSilva, a recognized institution on early animation, and author of six books for winning the film. <br /> <br /> The message of this movie is as important as not more than when Coleridge wore the original epic and when Raul daSilva translated it. If I still teach high school what I did in five years, I would grab this one and show it to all my students. There is a level of wealth here that naturally leads us to discuss all of our great and important issues, whether in 1798, 1978 or today - as long as humanity has a spiritual component. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
