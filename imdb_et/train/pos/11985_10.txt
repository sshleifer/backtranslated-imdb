I'm only 11 years old, but I discovered Full House when I was about five years old and I was constantly looking at seven. Then I grew older and thought Full House could wait and I had "more important" things. In addition, it was that my younger brother, who looked at it faithfully with me in these two years, began to think inadvertently. <br /> <br /> Then I realized five times in the afternoon that it was 23 and I was addicted again. Full House is laughing at me and crying. It made me realize how nice it would be for our world to be like the House of Full House and Mother. I have heard people say that the House is cheerful and unbelievable. But look at the big picture: three girls whose mother died of a drunk driver. Sisters fight and get their feelings hurt. Three men who live with girls can get into the bicker at times. What is it real? <br /> <br /> When the show has lifted me up when I stepped down and brought me even higher, I thought I was in complete luck. I am nervous at the show and got massive obsessiveness over Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen. (Of course, Hilary Duff has now taken this place, but they were literally the sweetest children I've ever seen. They are great actors and probably very beautiful people.)
