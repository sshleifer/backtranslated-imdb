First of all, the only reason people hit this movie is because they can't "change" some of the real story. Well guess what? Peter Jackson's film was not a perfect rendition either. Well enough. This is a very beautiful movie. The backgrounds are proud and come from well-known Tolkein artists. The film covers about half of the trilogy (Ring Scholarship and the Battle of Helms Deep in two towers) and moves at a good pace. Voice dialing is top-notch and most of the characters look like I thought they were. Samwise is a bit ugly for my taste, but Aragorn sees YEAR. The film has a high score that fully supports the film. If you enjoy good fantasy stories, but hate (books are even better) give this movie a try, remember that it was made 20 years ago. <br /> <br /> It is also particularly noteworthy: Peter Jackson's adaptation The Fellowship follows almost exactly the same direction as Ralph Bakshi (Jackson has said many times how much he admired Bakshi's efforts).
