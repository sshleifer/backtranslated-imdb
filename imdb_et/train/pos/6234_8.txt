This is my all-time favorite, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. The dialogue between the two is so cute and funny and very smart. Not to mention this movie, there are some of the best songs that two have recorded; like I put all my eggs in one basket and see music and dance. When I remember correctly, this was the movie that introduced me to Fred Astaire, so I think that's why I always have a special place in my heart (sorry for the sentimental cr * p, but I'm a woman to get over it) All this movie gets me 8/10. Choreography was great and the fact that Lucille Ball is inside makes it even bigger.
