As a Parisian Je'Taime fan I went to New York, I love you with great expectations. I liked all my expectations. It was funny, sweet, fast paced and fun. The film begins with the help of two cockpit bunkers (Bradley Cooper & Justin Bartha) who are trying to get to the same area but claim to go. It was funny, and then the movie goes with some of the best sketches I've ever seen. Of all the good, four were amazing. The four I will talk about. Here is Shia LaBeouf as a bellhop hotel who finds love with an old lady. Next is Orlando Bloom, a musician who deals with a woman played by Christina Ricci. The other is Anton Yelchin and Olivia Thirbly as the two people who go to the prom, the character of Thirbly is disabled. The best one is Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman, who is an aging couple. I would like to point out that Nataile Portman is making an impressive director's debut that drives and writes about a caregiver, and Ethan Hawke and Maggie Q are excellent as a flirtatious man and whore. New York, I love you is definitely as good, if not better than the 2006 Paris Je'Taime. Skits are well developed and the film shows how indie films really should be. However, the film does not have as many famous directors as Paris' Je'Time, so it was fantastic to live on its cutting edge. If you want to laugh, look at some dramatic effect, look at the amazing number of great performances and just entertainments, be sure to see New York, I love you.
