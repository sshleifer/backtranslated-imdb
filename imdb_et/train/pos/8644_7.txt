It's really more drama and very gloomy ... I remember some emotionally intense Duchovny voice commands. <br /> <br /> Pitt plays his potential sexual film with amazing talent. Who started as a desperate but harmless "white trash" spouse, became a prudent and disturbing alcoholic. During the last stages of the movie, I had a hard time watching her - she was unpredictable and scary. It proves very good writing and action. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is full of weird, sensational scenes that made me hold on not less than once and I don't think about scenes of action. I mean the scenes of dialogue that are so wonderfully designed that I actually watched and threw on what I saw. It was like putting a rhinoceros and a lion in the cage and watching them chewing each other with death. Again, I have been very impressed by the screenwriter (s); whoever they have done is impossible: mixed oil and water. <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed the performance of Juliette Lewis. It is so rare that this talented young actor will appear on those days that if he does, it will be so joyful. Some of her moments in this film brought me tears. I mean it. The emotions that this girl raises with her head are incredible, and I remember clearly that I get a few times blurred eyes. <br /> <br /> I almost feel I have been cheating on the high quality finishes that filmmakers have shown in "CALIFORNIA" ***. But the dark feelings it picks up are too strong and depressing to raise it. I believe everyone should still watch this movie. I really do.
