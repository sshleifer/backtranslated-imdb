OK, this movie is stupid. I mean, that's good. It was a goal silly and was one of the best "stupid" movies I've seen. Jokes and gags are purposefully bad, but delivered in such a way that it strikes me with all the right comments. Supportive characters were pretty low and mediocre. There's a pretty weak plot, but it works just fine. <br /> <br /> Elvira's character is focused here.It is lovable and divine.Cassandra Petersen has a world of talent that just shines in this movie. this talent he had, frankly, stunning. Few men could not agree. Some of the pieces that showed her figure were more fun in the movie. <br /> <br /> I had my ear in my ear at the ear. <br /> <br /> Recommended comedy for fans and fans of beautiful women. I wish they had made ten more Elvia films.
