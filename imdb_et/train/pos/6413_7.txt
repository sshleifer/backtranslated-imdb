Robert De Niro, Gooding Jr. of Cuba, Hal Holbrook, and all the other "Men of Honor" actors and actors have combined to make it a beautiful movie. Mark Isham wrote the film so you know that music is also really good. <br /> <br /> But after you noticed a stroke from the start, gaps and over-dramatic heart-strings had to make a promise to ignore them and sit down to enjoy the movie. If you can do that, it is _really_is_ good. <br /> <br /> The story of the life hero Carl Brashear is inspiring enough to last a lifetime. See her online ... The whole story is more amazing than the film, as the director admitted in his remarks. In World War II there were only three American-American naval divers. But none of them reached the US Navy captain. Carl Brashear was the first African American US Navy captain diver. AND he was the first amputee diver ever to receive a certificate or certificate for a naval diver in the US. (Remarkable applause). <br /> <br /> About the negative side of the movie: Should I tell you only one of the many "gaps"? Yes, I note the comment that contains the "spoiler" and does it ... Early, the centerpiece where the helicopter hits the radio mast and sinks into the sea: they would never have time to match Mark V's diver, even if he was the legendary Master Chief Billy Sunday, was just "... a few minutes late" to save the pilot. <br /> <br /> So, with gaps, goats and over-dramatization, I took "Men's Glory" from 10 to less than 7. <br /> <br /> Does Hollywood EVER realize that closed truth is so much better that their too dramatic approach to narration? I doubt it. Damage!
