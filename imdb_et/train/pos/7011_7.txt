First, I like this movie. It worked well for everyone. <br /> <br /> But I don't understand the comments I hear from people by surprise. I didn't know anything about this movie except for some suggestions I wanted to see, but I knew where the plot was less than ten minutes. (I do not mention what confused me to not ruin the good picture for others.) Despite the fact that it seemed obvious, I still looked. It was nice to see how everything happened, completing the details and motivations of the character in later scenes. <br /> <br /> I don't hate it when I think the movie ends. I only hate it when the journey to the resolution is lined with boring landscapes. <br /> <br /> The Smith's person on the screen is just pleasant, even if he plays such a worrying character. He's energetic and credible in everything I've seen him. Seven Pounds is another good force. <br /> <br /> Rosario Dawson is a solid performer who is a peculiar, rather optimistic character, despite end-heart disease. Beauty is in the eyes of the viewer, and Rosario, if you can't find your pride, you should think about replacing your eyes. <br /> <br /> It was nice to see Woody Harrelson back on the screen. I haven't seen him much lately, but it can only be me. Woody had no huge screen time, but he sold his joyful, piano game, blind character to anyone who was worth it. Great. <br /> <br /> The classic study of shellfish jelly tells me that its poison is cardiotoxic, neurotoxic and dermatonic. I think that makes it a questionable choice for both the pet and the plot. <br /> <br /> In general, I have to recommend this not for drawing a movie, but for some very good stages and that it tends to create some tragic emotions that we usually try to avoid.
