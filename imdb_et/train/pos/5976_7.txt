Trick or Treat, Quickie Review This film generation revolves around the 80s heavy metal culture and horror movies - two things I love dear. So, as you can imagine, this movie pulled me quite easily. In addition, Ozzy Osbourne plays the preacher for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> This film speaks of unpopular high school youth who, like all our losers, ended up in the "evil" world of heavy metals. His favorite Metaldude dies and of course resurrection - playing his last unpublished album. This allows corrupt singers to go through the demons and * t to kill people. <br /> <br /> Okay, it's funny from time to time, but you know what? It has a surprising number of good features. Decent action (including Gene Simmons as DJ radio), pretty good special effects, very short nudity, decent atmosphere ... All in all, this is really a good horror movie. But what really sucks is music. Ironically, huh? Well, this "uber-evil" metal boy is one of the most reluctant, high-class, brighter, Motley Crue pushes back to the planet - and "Metal" is a bit more than the 80's Pop / Hair Metal. He hits all the clich√©s here, from perceiving like a gay fairy tale to looking for thinking, shouting "Rock and Roll!" high that is big enough to turn the King Diamond around. In addition to this terrifying musical presentation, it is actually pretty good. 7/10 <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
