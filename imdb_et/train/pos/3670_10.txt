I rented this movie on DVD without knowing what to expect - and if I'm going to shoot in all places in Canada, I'll definitely bring it in class. <br /> <br /> A story that is central to probably the most unhappy movie teams in the history of the film is perfectly written and very talented actors can deliver a single punishment on time. <br /> <br /> If you just couldn't laugh at "Hollywood North" "I suggest you see a psychiatrist right now - you may have serious problems. <br /> <br /> In addition to a great script, I also noticed a larger chemistry with Deborah Kara Unger and Matthew Modine - where are they really operating? Jennifer Tilly (playing funny bad actor) and Martin Landau also offered very sharp but funny results. <br /> <br /> Great movie, even better casting.
