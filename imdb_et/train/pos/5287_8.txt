This is one of quite a few cartoons with Bugs Bunny and Marvin Mars - and also the space dog K-9. This Looney Tunes episode is very funny, it has a pretty good animation animation (Marvin's animation is very well done) and the plot is well done. The end is rather weird, so be prepared for it, it's a bit boring. <br /> <br /> In this episode, Mars was sent to Earth on Mars to capture the Earth and bring it back to Mars. With his trusted dog K-9, Marvin puts out and soon finds another rabbit, but Bugs Bunny! He welcomes them with treatment, thinking they are a trick or processor for their costumes. She doesn't understand that they are making this rabbit for Mars ... <br /> <br /> I recommend this episode to anyone who likes Bugs Bunny, Marvin, Mars and Looney Tunes in general. As far as the beginning and the center of the episode are concerned, this is likely to be the case. Enjoy "Hasty Hare"! :-)
