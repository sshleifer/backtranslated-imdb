Look, if I were interested in Nancy Drew's book, I'll make the book up and read it. I am not. Since then, I remember that I read people who were watching movies because it was not like a book. Sorry - in the digital age, we can't watch movies anymore, but I'm sure you can still find some short silent movies. When the Lord of the Rings came out, people complained. When the third won the Oscar - "The book was better." When I looked at killing Mockingbird, "the book was better." Now, a lot of people are still upset because Nancy Drew wasn't like a book. I'm not saying Nancy Drew wins all the Oscars - something that is one of Nickelodeon Blimps or the Kids Choice Awards. I'll tell you to give the movie a break. It's a movie, not a paper. As a film, I found that Nancy Drew is quite enjoyable - featuring the supporting roles of Bruce Willis and Adam Goldberg (Hebrew Marshal) and Tate Donovan (O.C. Jimmy Cooper) and Rachel Leigh Cook (all of them). This is the first time I saw Emma Roberts in the film and, frankly, I enjoy her more than most of Julia and Eric; his character remains consistent throughout the film and responds well to conflicts. In the spirit of Harry Spy, a light spiritual film is now and again nice. <br /> <br /> I give him ten stars because I enjoyed the movie thoroughly, I would like to see it again and probably buy it from the DVD. release.
