My manager's intuition can bring material that needs just the right direction. Young Mr. Lincoln is full of some "old-fashioned" values, which retrospectively, despite his two-dimensional portrayal, are at least more respectful than seen in the current cinema. What makes this work so great is that it is all in its simplicity and size, that it is a really great lesson in the courtroom drama history. <br /> <br /> We all know that Abraham Lincoln is the 16th President to emancipate and was murdered after the Civil War. But as a lawyer in his earlier years, he was charismatic, funny in unexpected places and a real gentleman. He is not a superhero who cannot do anything wrong (which was Fonda's only understanding of the part before logging in), but an indicator of possible mistakes that are overcome by his innate goodness and a clear and false vision. <br /> <br Suffice it to say that John Ford is almost untested as a narrator. In fact, it's wrong, he's trying, but he does it easily in the studio system; he worked independently, but at the same time liked Zanuck, so he was left alone with his short practice in "editing the camera" and did not move it so that it did not go far. This is the strength of conventional wisdom that somehow works with the material that is a companion to full-blooded Americana in 1939, as Mr Smith goes to Washington (only here is the law and not politics). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Fonda is at the forefront of its first Ford and will never let us lose Lincoln behind our eyes and extra strength. Fonda's own personality, in some ways, like it would be in the grapes of anger and my Darling Clementine, appears by the character of Lincoln. However, it is unlikely that anyone else who could have played it at that time would be: he is mature and wise, but he is tempted to prove himself to have been murdered-see-it-but-made-his-murder case. <br /> <br /> Only in small bits and pieces, like this final shot that places Lincoln along the road with its monument and a few small copies at the beginning of this great parade scene, it seems dated. With regard to the targets set for Young Mr. Lincoln, all Ford and his team met and poured; It is not as hokey as one might think, and it has gained a strong sense of humor and true sin.
