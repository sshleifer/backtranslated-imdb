The wooden horse is a very wise and successful escape plan that the British army has developed during World War II. This is a great sense of humor, especially the expression of acidic languages ​​by Leo Genn. Anthony Steele and David Tomlinson (later George Banks Mary Poppins) are wonderful as two heroes. The direction is tense and fast moving. Highly recommended.
