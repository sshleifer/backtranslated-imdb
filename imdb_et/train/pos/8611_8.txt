I enjoyed this movie very much. I recorded it while watching it so I could review it later. I enjoyed the second look more because I was able to swallow more of the two main characters between Natalie and Adam. I thought this story was very thoughtful. I was very interested in how Natalie plans to communicate with her daughter's friends, at first it seemed that she was going to create a lot of hostility, but when she started to communicate more pleasantly, I had to see how that visit would open. I was not disappointed. Gradually the secrets that Sara kept her mother began to reveal to her daughter, who was not as perfect as a faulty person like most of us who wanted her freedom from the dominant mother who thought she knew her daughter, but unfortunately had to learn very painfully that sometimes I really love someone with whom you have to give them your freedom. The spectators who ended up with this film saw Diane Keaton (who is always wonderful, even in some of her less well-received films - the city and the country) - a very important performance. At the end of Diane Keaton's home entrance, it was worth expecting to discover that anyone who loves another must learn that we have to live our lives, we love others, but we don't own them, and finally we have to go. It's a hard lesson, but it's worth considering now and then. Thanks for this CBS for this transfer, it was worth a long wait.
