This movie is amazing for a number of reasons. Harris takes an extremely uncomfortable documentary and makes it an appropriate social commentary. Groovin 'Gary is a small town boy who is (probably) very fond of his reproduction. When he decides to play Olivia Newton John at a local talent show (for whom he is very passionate), Gary's actions show that he is in conflict with the conservative social environment in which he lives. As a result, he makes a number of reasons for his actions so that people do not believe he is actually a transvestite or other social challenge. In the second part, Harris struggles between Gary and Beaver in a novice attempt to make the original documentary narrative. The third and final part of the trilogy is truly amazing when Harris is very sensitive to the subject. Unlike the second part, "The Orkly Kid" shows Gary as a truly uneasy character. He struggles to embrace his community. Her secret passion for bondage, like Olivia Newton John, further distorts her from people who already consider her a social challenge. The film is depicted so realistically that, like reality, it gives many reactions. Certainly, Gary can be seen as a ridiculously pathetic character, but can also be identified with him.
