Beautifully done by Gretchen Moll, who is perfectly prepared and often entertained in stainless steel and small films and photos. According to Harron, they used a film that was no longer produced and the lighting of a fifty-style studio even in exterior locations to give a special look to the color parts. Bettie Page saw the film at Hugh Heffner's house (now he's eighty-three) with the producers there, but not with the director if it were uncomfortable if he didn't like it. He seemed to see it until the official investigation he found calmly. Also some great costumes. The idea of ​​the movie started in 1993, but it was worth it. His portrait never seems to be wrong, referring to all those images and fragments of (terrible) films that many of us have already seen. This would be an interesting companion to Goodnight and Goodluck, but a much more pleasant look!
