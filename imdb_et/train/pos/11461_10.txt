Apart from the fact that this movie has risen from all the unexpected, this masterpiece of cinematic portrait is the best when it's the best! Paul Johansson and Craig Sheffer show a brotherly conflict with all that is in it. As usual, a woman proves her true intentions. The end was surprising as unforssen, as his older brother killed Keith Scott. <br /> <br /> Wiking land scenes are the same as I remember when I travel early. - Frankly, this strong passion for trash films makes it a must in my never finished collection. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to all loved ones who are one of the biggest brothers on the hill of a tree. <br /> <br />
