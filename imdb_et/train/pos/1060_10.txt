Dark Angel is a cross between Huxley Brave's New World and Percy's love in ruins, which represent a not too distant future as a disturbing blend of chaos and organization, in the worst sense of the word. If one swallows the assumption that all "modern technologies" can be stopped by "Pulse", it offers an entertaining landscape to explore the relationship between the two primary characters - Max (Dark Angel / bike messenger) and their relationship. Logan (rich rebel). It seems uneven, maybe the result of different authors, but it is kept together by the energetic, beautiful and charming Jessica Alba, who looks both strong and pampered, but sensitive and sensitive. I think Fox has done it again.
