If you played "Spider-Man" in PS, you have seen it. To truly experience this, you should get a DC version. Simply put, it's a much graphically better game; texture is sharp, levels are easy to navigate, and it's a much better sound then it's PS cousin. I bought this game back in the late nineties and it is still up to this day. Well, Marvel: The Ultimate Alliance is a much better and more strategic game, but if you are a "Web Web" fan, you owe it to your gaming library. Moving around the city because Spidey has never seen it in the video game. If you have a Dreamcast, then pull it cheap. The DC version is simply incredible.
