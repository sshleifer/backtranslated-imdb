The first time I saw this movie, I fell in love with it. The atmosphere was what got my attention first and foremost. I was expecting a gore fest, but instead I had to watch a very intelligent killer mess with my head cooling sound (that's actually my ringtone right now: P). The fact that I couldn't predict when he was going to kill and when he disappeared was a big plus in my book. Predicted horror movies gave me. Now, I know the story had some discrepancies, but if you're like me, they won't even notice until the movie is over and you're in bed on bed so you just saw the masterpiece move. Finally, as I mentioned, the soundtrack is timeless. This is one of my favorite music of all time, so I was very happy to hear that Rob Zombie leaves it untouched by his re-evaluation. Speaking of remake, I read a very broad article about it and now that I know Mr Zombie is talking to John Carpenter, I have great hopes of dealing with this classic. This movie is great anytime, if you have a craving for spinal stratification, but it's a perfect addition, opener, finals, you call it the All Hallow's Eve movie marathon. :)
