The Good Times was a groundbreaking comedy about the first nuclear family in Chicago. Whether you live in the hinterland, in ghettos, in suburbs or in rural areas, this exhibition is still a treasure to look at the family, which is a family rather than a poor black family. But they don't live there. They find humor and have strong family values ​​and morals. Despite the story behind the scenes, this exhibition was worth the air unless I liked to kill the father with whom I agreed with Esther Roll, who fought to keep the family together. But despite all the struggles behind the scenes, the Good Times family was showing. We all loved the JJ dynamite and his antics. We watched Janet Jackson Penny grow a little. This exhibition was groundbreaking to show despair in drugs, gangs and alcoholism. Without trying the Gospel, Evans always tried to do the right thing, not to do something wrong to get out of the ghetto.
