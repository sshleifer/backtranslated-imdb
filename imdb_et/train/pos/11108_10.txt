Well ... just my favorite TV series. Call me a voicemail, but it has to show violence, mafia, sex, gambling, drugs, etc. and you've already won in your book. Combine everything that works that goes beyond what you've seen on a small screen, add a board that matches vintage-type cinema and most of the letter that blows (and a few brains for a long time), and you got yourself an exhibition that's quite difficult to compete. <br /> <br /> First of all, stop two actors, James Gandolfini Tony Soprano and Edie Falco, as his wife Carmela ... as for Gandolfin, he fits his roll so that the words can't express if you haven't seen him see it now, look at it now! <br /> <br /> I can keep going on and on and on every show, psychological shine, thrilling scenes, etc., but you can't stop me, so all I can say is that it's the only example with Seinfeld, I can look again and again and enjoy it even more.
