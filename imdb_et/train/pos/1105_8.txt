Residents of a Manhattan apartment must be exposed to any inconvenience. The worst thing is the lack of a cabinet room! Some people who eat all the time, use their ranges and dishwashers in storage, because the cabinets are already full! <br /> <br /> Melvin Frank and Norman Panama, who is a great comedy of this era, saw the potential of Eric Hodgin's novel, whose hero Jim Blandings is unable to hold a narrow apartment where he and his wife Muriel and two daughters have to share . <br /> <br /> Jim Blandings, Madison Ave. Executive has done it! When he sees the advertising of Connecticut's life, he decides to watch it. Naturally, real estate owners are probably the first owner of Jim to buy a broken house that he sees as a careless representative. It's just the beginning of his problems. <br /> <br /> Whatever may be wrong, it goes wrong. The architect is asked to come up with a plan that doesn't work for the new house after the original has been kidnapped. Because one problem leads to another, more money is needed, and whatever is going to be the initial cost, the inflated price that Jim could not afford would come. <br /> <br /> The movie is fun because it has three principals. Cary Grant was an actor who clearly understood what character he was playing and made by Jim Blandings. Myrna Loy was a pleasant actor who always played against Mr. Grant. The third character, Bill Cole, an old Myrna boy, turned to Blandings' lawyer, smooth and embarrassing, as Melvin Douglas depicted him. One of Blanding's girls, Joan, has been played by Sharyn Moffett, who carried an unpleasant similarity to Eva Marie Saint. Big Louise Beavers plays Gussie, but it doesn't have much to do. <br /> <br /> The film has been lovingly photographed by James Wong Howe, who clearly knew what to do to make this movie much better. H.C. Potter is light and has succeeded in this film that delights fans of classic comedies.
