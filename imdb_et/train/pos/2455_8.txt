This is a pretty good movie, but too predictable. Turn Kung Fu into a football and Turkish family for Pakistan, and you look at Bend It Like Beckham (2002) for almost a scene. A nice feature that acts as the backbone of the film is the struggle with the mysterious ninja on the road, starting with unfortunate damage and slowly, until the last fight is a victory over itself, as the Kung Fu champion has repeatedly emphasized. On the second level, Danish life is quite different from what it has bystanders: non-indigenous immigrants, who make up a large part (actually the majority) of Danish citizens, graffiti in the suburbs of Copenhagen, an immigrant girl begging for a movie. Everybody depicts a different picture than one remembers when the word Danish hears.
