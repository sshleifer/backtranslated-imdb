I liked this movie because it basically decreased less. It could have been more interesting if they had kept it in the studio (though some of the plot elements would have been harder to work out). <br /> <br /> DJ did a good job of showing that someone was speculating and worshiping his memories. I found my dialogue with callers quite funny. <br /> <br /> Although some of the movies you see a few miles away, other parts you don't want to find out. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a minimal spiritual story, focusing more on the living side of the equation. The last 5 to 10 minutes were pretty well done when everything appeared. <br /> <br /> Although it was a shorter film, it seemed to be almost the right time to tell the story. Even more and it would have started to drag.
