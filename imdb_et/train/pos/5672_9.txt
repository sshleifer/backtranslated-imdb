In this part of the series, Edmund Blackadder is in the UK for the Regency period (later part of George III rule). This time, Blackadder's prospects are much poorer - as in the case of a license fee, he is a very thick officer of George IV (price register). Unlike George IV's historical reports, it is about as bright as tomato and as a result, Blackadder is able to use it and the content of his heart. The only major difference between this one and the past is that the series ends with a very, very, very different note - you just have to believe it. Moreover, all the usual story elements exist and the show is fun. The only reservation I have (as always) is that this exhibition is not suitable for children due to their raw materials and adult situations.
