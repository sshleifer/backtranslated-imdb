These Simon have a lot of work to do, but this is a strange couple who made him famous. This movie really works. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthaw have great chemistry. Stars are also cast in support of this movie. <br /> <br /> This is about 2 men living together on opposite planets. The script is brushing with the humor of this situation. It had been done in some form before. This is what brings it all together in very good packages. <br /> <br /> Simon has done some other decent work, but it's really his best job that made the rest of the work possible. It is hard to imagine that Simon will ever build it.
