Despite its rather merciless title, it is a light teenage drama. If you're not an old coat, it's probably nice. But it is not as good as the smooth development of symbols or situations. When you look at it, you will feel like you have been running back and forth on the kitchen, even if you are always watching. This is one of those films that reads a lot of their symbols pleasantly, and they are attractive enough. Jennifer Connelly is a celebrity of many, I know, but I've always loved Maddie Corman. Teenagers get most of the time on the screen without these irritated adult people invading. Is it just me or did most of the young men show a terrible amount?
