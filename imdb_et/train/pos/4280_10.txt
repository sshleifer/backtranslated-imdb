People travel to Belgrade on a terrible bus headed by a drunk driver and his stupid son (who wants to travel with eyes closed). Their journey is often interrupted by a number of fun events that describe the fall of the great irony of the spirit of the people in 1941 and are so funny that they are also used today as jokes. The man who "steals the exhibition" is a peasant 4 feet tall and his 4 sons, almost twice as big as his. Ultimately, the film has one dramatic move and the journey doesn't just change the story of a dying country.
