Four-man racing on the southern side of the river. They are pacifist Ed (Jon Voight), adventurous, violent Lewis (Burt Reynolds), unpleasant Bobby (Ned Beatty) and nice guy Drew (Ronny Cox). The first 40 minutes are great - there is an incredible dueling banjos queue, an interesting interaction between characters, and Vilmos Zsigmond's simply stunning widescreen art. Then two hillbillies attacked Edi and Bobby. One of them rapes Bobbit ... and the trip becomes horror. <br /> <br /> Just incredible. The landscape is incredibly beautiful, but this terrible violence is taking place. To be fair, Beatty's rape has never bothered me - I am very aware that, despite good deeds, it is counterfeit. This film also shows how characters change - Ed has tested his pacifism, Lewis is weak, Bobby is spoiled by one person who was previously mocked, and Drew is trying to be healthy. The direction of John Boorman is also very confident, and the sounds of the forest and the river contribute enormously. <br /> <br /> Usually works good. Voight is just in the lead - he's been better. Beatty is also just OK, but it's her debut film and she has the courage to take such a dangerous role. Cox is very good, especially when things start to break down. And Reynolds is just great - one of the best actresses EVER! The fact that it was not even nominated by the Academy is fleeing me. Also Bill McKinney and Herbert Coward are too incredible as hillbillies. <br /> <br /> Powerful movie - NOT for kids. Try to see the uncut version - the TV version is polished. Watching the letterbox is also important for capturing amazing images.
