Bob Clampett '' It Itch in '' Milk Milk for seven minutes is a very small assumption. Elmer Fudd tells his dog that if he scratches again, he gets a terrible bath. Unfortunately, the dog does a relentless flea, but it is impossible to stop scratching. The classic switches to flea progression between dog fur and dog desperate attempts. In the big order that really strikes the frustration of wilting, which cannot be scratched, the dog turns brown to blue to make it dirty! It sounds ridiculously surreal, but it perfectly awakens the indescribable feeling of itching so that it can only be Clampett. There are many other elements that make An Itch in Time a pure Clampett. There's also a grotesque concept that brings some of the church's graphic scene to dog meat. There is unlimited violence that carries your head in any scene with a cat. Most importantly, there are dirty jokes, including behind a big dog, causing flea wolves and a hysterical order where the dog tries to scratch himself by dragging the back of the floor. He pauses for a moment to turn to the audience: "Hey, I could cut it better. With a very limited concept, Clampett can make An Itch in Time a unique, custom-made comic. Like the early episode" Seinfeld "," Itch in Time "is almost nothing else as very funny.
