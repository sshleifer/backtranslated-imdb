I find it very interesting that Lee Radziwill, the sister of Jackie Kennedy and their female cousin encourage Maysles to make a "Big Edie" and "Little Edie" movie theme. They could certainly be considered "skeletons" in the family cabinet. The extra features of the DVD include a number of modern fashion designers who credit some of their ideas to these strange women. I would say that all people interested in fashion find that the discussion of these designers is exciting. (i.e., "Are they nuts? Do I have anything?"). This movie is hard. This is not the case with Netflix. The facts do.
