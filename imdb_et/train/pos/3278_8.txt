It is a wonderfully written and well-functioning psychological drama. It's not really a horror that those looking for something like Ring or The Grudge are disappointed. What really surprised me about this film was intelligence and fine attention to detail on the plot and the efforts that were made internally consistent. I also appreciated the absence of Dr. Phil psychobabble or New Age revision. Instead of progressing on the agenda, the filmmakers just talked about the story, talked about it well and let the viewer think about it. The rare dreams reflected Wyeth's paintings and were amazingly effective. <br /> <br /> A great example of how to make a good movie with a low budget, without big studios, star artists, big names (much better than many Hitchcock movies), special effects or a "smart" twist on the plot.
