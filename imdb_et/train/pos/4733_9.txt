Already again, Jet Li brings his charismatic presence to the movie in black. In this film, Li plays Tsui, a transmitter of a superhero program, trying to restore the humanity that the program had taken away from him. To do this, Tsui decides to become a librarian to live in a normal and peaceful life, but destiny requires him to clear his past problems before he can continue to seek peace. Other members of the Super Soldier program had escaped while Tsui, but they wanted to get even with the world, not to find inner peace. So Tsui is the only thing that can prevent his former crew members from spreading information that can cost many innocent people their lives. This movie screams across the screen at a frantic pace and never lets your audience go. Martial arts are amazing, but because it uses wires, it may not be as great as the American audience deserves. If you like movies with interesting stories that require good exhibitions because they deal with both psychological and physical conflicts, Black Mask is for you. I am pleased to see that some of the Jet Li films will eventually become the main stream in the United States, and look forward to seeing the changes that this release requires (such as dubbing and soundtrack) affecting the film. This is one of Li's best movies, going out and seeing it on May 14 when it appears in America.
