This movie is a wonderfully simplified work. Enjoyable from start to finish is both sad and at the same time resurrecting. Miranda Otto's performances (oh, how she deserves so much more recognition!) And George del Hoya is beautiful and still almost painful to watch because two tortured souls come to understand each other. The supportive casting of the Dead Letter Office staff is a part of their own, just like Alice's long-time boy I couldn't help but feel a little sorry. There's one particular scene that I can look at again (and I have it!), It's a shame that such movies don't get appreciated and therefore bring them more eyes to enjoy more people. I cried, laughed, and sighed. I recommend this movie to anyone.
