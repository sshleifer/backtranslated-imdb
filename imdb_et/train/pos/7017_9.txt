You spend most of this two-hour movie, thinking, "What's the story of a character's character?" <br /> <br /> Will Smith, like the low-key Ben Thomas, keep you away. The last 20-25 minutes are when you find out, and it's shocking .... but you knew something was dramatic. Then Smith plays this mysterious, almost pursuing person. You know he has a good reason to do it, but it has never been explained again to keep us till the end. <br /> <br /> All this, including re-on / off, but with romance with Rosario Dawkins ("Emily Posa"), some viewers may be disappointed or want to abandon this movie ..... but not because the last long The segment puts all the pieces of this puzzle together. <br /> <br /> This is a two-hour film, not a typical action-packed macho Will Smith movie. In fact, the most shocking aspect can be that Smith is drawn, sad face, throughout this story. It almost doesn't even see him in many shots. She looks like she has lost weight and is sick. Smith does a good job of depicting a man carrying a lot of sadness. <br /> <br /> Like a good movie, this movie will make a long time after the end credit.
