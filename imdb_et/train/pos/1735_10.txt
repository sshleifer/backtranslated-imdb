Miss DeCarlo starring in her debut is all that writers could point out - from the French-French war to the US Civil War, the great West of America, San Francisco's blossom, ballet, opera, vaudeville, bands of productions, and Chinese junk. Just when you thought the plot wouldn't get any screwdriver, that's the case. It's great, the tongue is cheeky. The character of DeCarlo (called Anna Marie - EI Salome, this is her dancing) is based on the infamous Lola Montez career, who was the lover of Prussian king and caused a revolution when she gave her crown jewels. He fled to the west of America. Arizona is a city called "Salome where he danced", based on the historical fact that Lola Montez danced the role of Salome there. The StageCoach Cleve and the Russian nobles, who belong to his charms, are not historically accurate, nor do I assume that the Chinese wise man is a Scottish accent - but this is one of my favorite, which is the classic of all time camps and DeCarlo is breathfully beautiful.
