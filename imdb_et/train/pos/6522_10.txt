During the trilogy of Pirates of the Caribbean, Craze Paramount Pictures pulled the ball into the Anthony Quinn's recovery directed at Cecil B. DeMille's film and received it on DVD and Blu Ray with all the additions. It is obvious to me that Paramount Pictures Execs is blind and unaware of the fact that their vault has a really good pirate movie about the real pirates who actually lived in New Orleans, Louisiana, which would have helped Crescent City once again become a famous Pirate Connections. When the parameter excuses finally get to the program and release the movie in digital format, I'm a happy tent. Paramount Pictures is yours to decide and get this movie now restored!
