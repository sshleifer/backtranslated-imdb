Just the best made reality show. The first two seasons (the only ones) are Hulus. I invite someone to look at the first three episodes of the first season and don't like it. I guarantee that you will stop watching the season. Then I guarantee you look at the 2nd season. <br /> <br /> Other quick reasons to watch it: 1. Anderson Cooper is fun 2. Places in Europe are fantastic 3. Games are mentally challenging. interactive 5. In one episode, the player reacts to another player's despair: "I'm trying as hard as possible!" equally desperate, "Not necessarily." <br /> <br /> Can you figure out who the mole is?
