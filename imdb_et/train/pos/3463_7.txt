I'm a big fan of the Beatles. My favorite Beatle is Paul and my least favorite is John. I already knew quite a bit about the music of Beatles and the truth behind the destruction, but also about things like John Lennon's family and Paul's band Wings. I was curious to see how this film led John and Paul so many years after the break. <br /> <br /> This movie was not disappointed. Although the story itself is a fiction, many of the references used by two musicians are very accurate. These included how Yoko Ono always stayed with John, wherever he went, the Wings song "Silly Love Songs", which was the first hit of this year and a concert on the roof of Apple Studios, playing music from "Let It Be." br /> <br /> Participants did a great job with John and Paul. The accents may have used a little more work, but it seemed that they acted much like I had read two former Beatles who had acted in the past. I also liked the dialogue between them, which was basically what the whole movie was about. <br /> <br /> Finally, I was disappointed at first, but the more you think about it, the more you value it, especially since it's actually going in real life. They also show a fantastic sketch of "Saturday Night Live", where $ 3,000 is offered to the Beatles. (Compared to the $ 220 million offered to them) I was not disappointed at all by this film. It really gives you a better sense of why the Beatles broke down and why they never came back.
