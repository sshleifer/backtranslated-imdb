The story is a prerequisite: one man in the woods accidentally falls into the murder of a small child and tries to convince the police that a murder has taken place. Although there is very little dialogue throughout the film, the camera's visual narration made the film quite appealing. Gray forests create a sense of loneliness that complements the silence of one's own character. We can also understand helplessness if an old man fails to convince the police of a murder that is equal to the inability of a silent child to tell his story. <br /> <br /> The real horror lies in the feeling of hopelessness, helplessness, and irrationality. This film successfully deals with these elements only with visual images, instead of relying on cheap sound effects or blood and gore to make other bad horror movies use when narration is weak. <br /> <br /> Smartly, the story evolves slowly to create tension for some horrible and amazing moments. The end is also unexpected and plausible. Reminiscent of Japanese horror films like "The Ring" and "Dark Water" or English horror films such as "Lady in Black" and "The Innocents". This movie provides the audience with the experience of a real atmosphere of horror. I recommend to anyone who enjoys good cooling to scare the bone, try this movie. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you haven't seen the movies mentioned above, you might want to give them a try too.
