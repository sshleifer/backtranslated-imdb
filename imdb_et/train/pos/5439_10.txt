Of course, there is a film that has had a great impact not only on the genre of friends, but also on the genre of action. George Lucas was supposed to be the fan of this flick, because so much of his Star Wars series seems to pay tribute to Gunga Din. The characters that Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks play are only the predecessors of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and Chewbacca. Even Sam Jaffe's Gunga din morphized into C-3PO and R2-D2 and resembled him or not: Jar Jar Binks. <br /> <br /> Today, this movie is not considered a PC, but Eduardo Ciannell's speech is the leader of the Guru Indian opposition to the British division, which can be repeated in many of today's moods. The young boy had this great film. Three strong men and only romance. There was a time when young boys were kissing a girl on a matinee in a kiss on Saturday. Not like today, where more skin is welcomed. Too late to defeat innocence. <br /> <br /> Hopefully this movie will not be forgotten and some who are surfing the channels will stop at TCM and catch the movie with action, adventure and thousands of games instead of CGI. participants.
