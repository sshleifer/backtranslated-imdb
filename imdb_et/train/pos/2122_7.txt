On the day of the big studio system, the most direct decisions were made. Good old all American James Stewart, who appeared in the Hungarian shop at an angle. If I had cast a film, the Kralik part would have been ideal for Charles Boyer. His accent, mixed with all the other European accents, would be nothing. Stewart had the same problem with Mortal Storm, Margaret Sullavan. <br /> <br /> Margaret Sullavan was her most frequent lady on the screen, she made four movies with her. But only one of them will not die. Sullavan and his wife Leland Heyward knew Stewart back on the day he fought in New York. In fact, Sullavan's wife, Stewart, was a good friend of Henry Fonda. <br /> <br /> I think only Clark Gable was able to get the Americans out of non-Americans who were from Mutiny's Bounty. Stewart in The Mortal Storm was German, but all other players were also American, so there was nothing to look out for. <br /> <br /> But if you can receive Stewart, you'll see a fine film from Ernest Lubitsch. The plot is quite simple, a man and a woman working in a department store in Budapest cannot go personally. But they seem to continue to correspond with an anonymous admirer who turns out to be one another. Frank Morgan also suspects Stewart is wrong with his wife. <br /> <br /> Although leaders are good and Frank Morgan leaves his usual suicide, these are the two best players, Felix Bressart and Joseph Schildkraut. Bressart has her favorite moments in the movie when she starts asking for opinions from Morgan people. He does very little. <br /> <br /> And Joseph Schildkraut, who is always good, is just a great madman who can kiss Frank Morgan. You really hate such people that I know too much like Schildkraut in real life, who is in office policy 24 hours a day. It is sad that it will cost a lot of time.
