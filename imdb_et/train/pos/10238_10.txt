People are not just looking brilliant when Steven Spielberg controls the film and this film is no exception. Some of the movies I love were in the post office badly, but I'm happy to say that this movie is not one of them (over $ 9 million, which I don't think it was bad). The characters were fun, the animation was clear and not blurry, and the music was also modern, unusual for the animated film. I didn't think Professor Screw Eyes or his "Scary Cirus" was too scary for the young children (the target audience of this movie), but I thought the incident that ended in a fun professor was a bit too dark for the kids. In general, this movie is a fun and enchanting classic that I have loved for years.
