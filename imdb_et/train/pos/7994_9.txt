I liked this movie. It's dark, it's not bullet-powerful, auto-chasing your brain action film. Many of the characters' backgrounds and motivations are vague, leaving their conclusions to the viewer. it's nice to see a movie where the director lets the viewer make his thoughts. <br /> <br /> Finally, with love or revenge, or with the desire to repent - he does what he feels. "Have God ever forgiven us what we have done?" - it is not a question of mortal men can answer - so he does what he sees, what he has to do, what he is good at have been trained. <br /> <br /> denzel washington is a great actor - i honestly can't think of one bad movie he's made - and he has a great supportive cast.
