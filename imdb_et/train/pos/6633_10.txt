The first film is ever made. Workers flowing from the factory, some bicycles, moving on foot, moving right or left. Along with Melies, Lumiere is both the starting point and the starting point for the cinema - Melies begins narrative fiction, cinema, fantasy, artifacts, spectacle; Lumieres is clean, unchecked, an observation. The truth. There are a lot of intellectuals who regret the ossification of the cinema from the former tired formulas. <br /> <br /> But look again. There is nothing "objective" about this. The film is full of action - a static, inhuman breakdown of the scene into life, action and quiet harmony of the frame breaks, tilts right or left (but never, in front of where the camera is). But the camera is still in stock, contains energy, possible subversion, subordinates it to its will. Film can be a revolutionary invention, but it is used for conservative purposes - for mapping, changing, limiting, limiting the world. <br /> <br /> Worse is the historical reality of the movie. These factories are Lumiere employees. The bosses spy on their employees, the invisible eye on their faceless minions. Thus, the film describes two types of imprisonment. Behind the gates are employees in their workplace. The opening of the gate seems to be the image of freedom, the escape, but they face another wall, the fourth wall, which limits them further. The first film is also the first example of CCTV surveillance, a picture of an invisible, visionary institution that puts its servants on hold. Scary, too prophetic film.
