Mel Gibson's Braveheart was a remarkably accomplished film, but it left a sour taste in his mouth. By contrast, Rob Roy is a little less polished, but a better film. It is a historical film that combines timeless themes with truly historic values, while Braveheart puts an ancient story in an extremely and unpleasant way with a modern glow. What makes this movie cast. Liam Neeson plays the role of a hero, which he replicated mainly (in a delighted fashion) at Phantom's threat. The character is heroic, but not the greatest fighter or the most demonic mistress. Amazing yet, he tells the screen. He has been chosen equally for the selection of human opponents, including Tim Roth Cunningham, who is unpleasant but brilliant, and John Hurt's morally bankrupt. Also praised by Jessica Lange, like Robi's pragmatic woman: also strong and noble, but 300 years away from a modern hero that is just as it should be. This is not the most original film you see, but it has the courage of your beliefs and strong performances.
