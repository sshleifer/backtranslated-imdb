Lily Mars, a small town girl living in Indiana, dreams of being big on Broadway and her efforts are being boosted by the successful Broadway producer John Thornway returning to her home town. Lily is trying everything she can to notice Thornway, but she just offsets her generation. When Thornway returns to New York, Lily follows (of course unknown to John) and Thornway will give him a small role in his next show, but for his family, but Thornway will begin to fall for this young man. girl and romance blossoms that makes the exhibition's leading wife, Isabel Rekay, jealous. When Isabel got into John-Lily's romance, causing friction with the show, he leaves and John decides to make a Lilys star. Isabel returns later and Thornway is forced to say to Lily that she is back in her small role in the game, which can also endanger romance. A very charming film and a refreshing change to see Garland's comedy touches his role (his reading of Lady MacBeth, though it should be humorous, never threatened his singing career) I enjoyed Heflin's character (Thornway) more than he was annoyed by Lily, not romantic. The film was somewhat predictable and the scenes were not collected as well as a very pleasant film. Assessment, 7.
