Carter Wong plays a noble hero in search of a healing book that leads him to seek the ultimate hand! This movie is good and there are many fighting scenes to continue the movie. Flying guillotines see evil and the main villain has no problems using them. Although the story is not strong, action is fun and pulls you to the end (what I felt could have been continued). <br /> <br /> Camping and dark, this is a great ol skool kung fu !!
