The memory of "The Last Hunt" has been with me because I saw it in 1956 when I was 13. This is a film that was much ahead of others at that time because it dealt with the treatment of indigenous people, the environment. and short-term and long-term effects of greed. Today it is as important as in 1956, an extremely deep and relevant debate. This device is beautiful and cinematic excellent. The memory of this movie stays in my day until the end.
