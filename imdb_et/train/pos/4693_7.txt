Johnny Dangerously falls completely into the impact or attack category, where it is a lack of overwhelmed gags and a complete holistic script or story that makes Sense. But that's right, right? <br /> <br /> Cast is pleasant; Michael Keaton is a great comic book maker before he took himself too seriously than last years. Griffin Dunne, Peter Boyle, Joe Piscopo, Marilu Henner and Danny DeVito are enthusiastic and at least laugh about me. But here's the cover-up of the whole scene with Richard Dimitri (the word "Iceholes" in the history of the film) as the mobile that best appreciates the English language murder. <br /> <br /> I associate this child with many childhood memories, as I looked at it quite often, so maybe I tend to enjoy it more than many others. Johnny Dangerously is at least a completely innocent gangster movie that even transmits some good meanings about the dangers of smoking (and sex). <br /> <br /> I like it, but it's hard to recommend. <br /> 7 out of 10.
