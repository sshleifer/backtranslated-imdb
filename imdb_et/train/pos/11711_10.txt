The story of Mrs Patty Duke's life and the struggles with manic depression were like my life activities. I saw myself like her. I was so surprised by the similarity of our lives to include the sexual abuse that both children suffered. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie when it first appeared in 1990 and I have loved this movie so much. Anyone struggling with manic depression can get so much from this movie. Don't forget if it shows her prizes or what they were. This is not a question here. The question is how Mrs Duke was ill and fought to survive and win. Mrs Duke is proud of her achievements in her struggle for survival, which often leaves many victims without hope. <br /> <br /> If a person has not personally won the disease, they do not know the hell they have to live with. The film I made was successful because it showed real issues and how a person who is depressed and manic. It was so real ... so, so, real. It was like watching yourself on the screen. I wish I could thank Mrs Patty Duke personally for having the courage to let the public know about her illness. Bocka
