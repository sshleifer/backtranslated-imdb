Several posters have commented on the inadequate conclusion. It's always a problem with long and complicated drama. Crime is essentially banal, so paying is always climatic, while detailed exposure reduces human drama. The author has used a number of smart devices to try and not, but has not been completely successful. Answers to exactly what happened and why it may have been, but if so, they are well buried. The viewer inevitably feels a little cheated. <br /> <br /> But in some ways it is irrelevant. The drama was never a crime or even an investigation; it concerned the impact of events on the lives of the people concerned; family, researchers, witnesses, press. And so it was thrilling. Writing was much larger than the time of factory work when prime-time drama and performances were equally good. The ensemble's piece is indifferent to the focus on individuals, but Penelope Wilton deserves special attention for the extraordinary travel force as the mother-to-daughter-daughter, and Janet McTeer was cracked as an old policeman. One of the most interesting aspects of the drama is race handling, like an elephant in a room that no one is willing to mention. Fine and powerful stuff.
