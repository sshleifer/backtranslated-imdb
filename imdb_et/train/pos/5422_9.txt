The 1939 film "Gunga Din" speaks of immunity, acting as a great soldier who saved the lives of hundreds, if not thousands. Rudyard Kipling's poignantly loose movie is directed by George Stevens and stars Cary Grant, Douglas Fairbanks Jr and Victor Mclagen. The title role is played by the name of Sam Jaffe, known for my era's Ben Casey boss, Dr. Zorba, which became synonymous with large hair loss. Tell "Dr. Zorba's Hair" to someone in my generation and they know what you're talking about. <br /> <br /> During the British occupation, three soldiers were deployed to India - two romantic, tortuous numbers in Granti and Fairbanks, and McLagen as big stories - cut - in reality, three grown boys. Gunga Din is a water transport that McChesney (McLaglen) treats somewhat - orally, but Cutter (Grant) likes it. When she tries to practice Din (pronounced Deen) as her soldier walking and welcoming when she is tempted during her maneuvers, Cutter gives her some tips. <br /> <br /> The cheerful band of Musketeers breaks when Ballantine (Fairbanks) announces that she is married to a lovely young woman (Joan Fontaine) and leaves the service. However, if Gunga Din and Cutter drive to Thugees, a murderous culture led by a guru (Eduardo Cianelli), Gunga Din escapes to warn the unit, and Ballantine will need again to help cut the Cutter. After all, this is a friend movie. <br /> <br /> "Gunga Din" begins with easy effort, hell and wonderful, wide comedy, especially with Cary Grant, who is quite funny. So he and Fairbanks are so beautiful, it's hard to decide which one to look at. Much of the film consists of huge sequences of activities that are very exciting. In the final part, the story becomes very dramatic and culminates in a tense, exciting battle. <br /> <br /> Grantil has the most prominent role, Fairbanks is a romantic romantic and McLaglen as McChesney, mainly due to his treatment with Gunga Din, is the most unlikely character, although he finds his soft heart in his elephant Annie's love. His softness comes to the end of the film, especially in the very touching, tear-like final scene. <br /> <br /> Always a gentle and pleasant actor, Sam Jaffe gives a beautiful production like Gunga Din, a simple, brave man with a great smile, powerful imagination and high dreams. Jaffe communicates a great dialogue with Gunga Din's soul without much dialogue. <br /> <br /> This is indeed the ultimate adventure movie that is extensive, with good functioning, an amazing scene, a great musical result and some beautiful movie movies. Another remarkable year, 1939. Highly recommended.
