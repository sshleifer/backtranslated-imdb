He enjoyed this 1936 film by many veteran actors and especially William Powell (Dr. Lawrence Bradford), "Mister Roberts", who played the role of doctor and detective. Dr Bradford was once married to Jean Arthur (Paula Bradford), "Shane" and got divorced and managed to live with each other and fight all the time. Paula wanted her husband to investigate the murder and did everything to convince him that it was very important. Jean Arthur plays quite a nut type and has a great 1936 comedy and murder method that you never believe, especially on the California racetrack. Robert Armstrong (Nick Martel) "King Kong" gave an excellent supporting role as a book teacher with James Gleason, a detective who needs dr. Bradford's help to solve this very strange secret of murder. When you see this movie, I just remember that it was produced and staged in 1936, and these days people in the audience thought it was great entertainment and it was really in those DAYS!
