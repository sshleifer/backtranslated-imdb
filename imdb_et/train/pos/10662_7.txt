Leonard Maltin has to watch some other film. (Although I find his guide to be a valuable resource, please ignore his comments on it.) He claims that "it will start well when it fixes" if it is indeed the opposite - "starts to thinning and then fire". The plot is about as simple as it gets. A happy mother, a happy father and a happy son take a vacation on an isolated beach, a father who is unhappy, a mother runs for help, meets a dangerous escaped conviction. A mother tries to help convict a trick when her father waits and hangs expensive for life. <br /> <br /> A good white-knuckler, to whom Ralph Meeker struck an electric shock, appearing unexpectedly (directed by John Sturges, filming a wise way that makes you halfway as a cunning, desperate criminal. Meeker is an unusually awkward, reckless actor ( at least here and in the classic "Kiss Me Deadly") and he rejoices the keys to the narrative of the film and accelerates from top to bottom. His character has the habit of childishly smile and say, "Pretty pure, huh?" when he is particularly pleased with his misdemeanor. when they get a flat tire and instruct their hostage Barbara Stanwyck, "Don't go away." She burns back "Where am I going?" (they're somewhere in the middle) and she understands sitcom-ishly "Yes, that's right." there is friction between them. <br /> <br /> There are flaws, somewhat ridiculous. There is one scene where the police, who has been hunting for a while, stops Stanwycki's car and the Meeker relies on his shoulder as a loving husband to avoid detection. idetavalt would, and pretends that he is, when he was questioned. A. He sees the eye in this position unequally unevenly, and B. I think it is safe to say that every adult who seems to be sleeping at a law enforcement meeting is doubtful. <br /> <br /> Still a strong thriller based on exciting and pleasant conclusions. <br /> <br />
