I recently bought a complete American Gothic series on a DVD and lived in the memories of it. I was very grateful for the first time I saw episodes that were never televised. I loved "come around" especially on stories I didn't see for the first time. <br /> <br /> Gary Cole is fantastic as "evil, sexy" by Lucas Buck. Calas is also a very good player for Lucas Black. I thought Brenda Bakke, as Selena Coombs, was great in her portrayal. In fact, the whole cast was fantastically gifted and very large chemistry with each other. <br /> <br /> It's a disgrace that the network turned the series (collapsing with a growing censorship group) because it was really designed for adults. Mixes of comedy, tragedy, farce, satire, gothic romance, and horror movies offered great testimonials supported by genius action. <br /> <br /> I had the greatest craving for a fucking once in my life. Long live Gary Cole (Sheriff Lucas Buck), the most lush "fallen angel".
