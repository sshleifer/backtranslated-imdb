Henry Fonda excels in what we had long believed was Abraham Lincoln. It's stupid. Through Fonda's performance, we believe (on the surface) that Abraham Lincoln was a national bumpkin. However, because of their confrontation with the lynch mob and especially during the trial, you will see that below the outer posturings is a brilliant man who has a very good command of what is happening around him and how to influence people around him. In this film, Henry Fonda shows that he has a very good understanding of how to present humor. This is his aspect that has disappeared over the years. When he talks about stories and jokes, he is perfect from time to time. There is a queue in the trial that makes it quite difficult for me to laugh. He presents this gift again in Lady Eve in 1940. <br /> <br /> The end of John Ford is absolutely brilliant when Henry Fonda goes to the top of the hill and far away there is a huge storm that symbolizes civil war. He goes into history. The film is a fiction, but Lincoln has a huge overview. It's definitely worth a look again.
