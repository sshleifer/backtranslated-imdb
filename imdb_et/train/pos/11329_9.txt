The combination of excellent black and white photography and the "Eugene Onegin with twists" plot made it a real hit for me. In most cases, the very dark atmosphere created by contrast, which is contrasted from time to time with bright white light, was thrilling. It was a great moment when the guns - apparently the usual holiday spots, but where the faces of the actors showed the character and the situation finely, but immediately - were shown with Lensky's heart-like aria from Tsaikkovsky's Eugene Onegin. <br /> <br For me, a good movie is that it should take advantage of the potential of this media, which means that this story is often less important than imagination and atmosphere - last year Marienbad is a good example of such a movie. Krisana is in the same form.
