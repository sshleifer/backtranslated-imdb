Actually, I liked this movie very, very much. Not that plot, actors, jokes, not. I liked it because it's one of the films ever created. It's so flat, so bad that it gets terribly funny. Some jokes are really cool, but the rest puts me praying for the unemployment of the script worker. "White men" are so stupid and stupid that you can only do two things. Turn off the TV or roll on the floor laughing (beer helps a lot :). I chose another option.
