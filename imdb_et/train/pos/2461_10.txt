Kenneth Branaghi's "Hamlet" hits all the signs. The actor is great, 70mm cinematography is proud, the Oscar costumes and kits are stunning and Patrick Doyle's result (including the Oscar candidate) is sensitive and moving. Oh yeah - a scenario made by a boy named Will S. is not too bad. The film critics chose the "adaptation" of the scenario for receiving the fourth Oscar of Branagh films, but his decision to use full text was gutsy. I can't think of many of the best ways to fly for four hours. <br /> <br /> Almost every decision makes Branagh's job great: using the English Blenheim Palace for exterior surfaces, Edward's dress and "staging". To be or not to be in the mirror room to name a few. Casting small parts of Hollywood lighting such as Robin Williams, Billy Crystal and Jack Lemmon can be annoying, but it's nitpicking. The main majority seems to be: Derek Jacobi hits Claudius's controversial nature; Kate Winslet Sharply Shows Ophelia's Going Crazy; Julie Christie brings passion to the depiction of Gertrude; Richard Briers is perfect as uniting Polonius; and Nicholas Farrell raises Horatio's potentially ungrateful role for true friendship. Every speech, every line, each word is given with passion and conviction; the whole movie has no wasted moment. The final scenes will increase the scope of the Shakespeare tragedy through theater adjustments in a way that is not possible. <br /> <br /> Branaghi's Hamlet is a brave, ambitious, and ultimately successful attempt to match Shakespeare's size and poem with the same beautiful images. This is arguably the biggest Shakespeare adaptation ever filmed? strong praise but well earned.
