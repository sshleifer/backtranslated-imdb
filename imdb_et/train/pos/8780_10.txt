It's one of Hollywood's biggest sports movies ever made. What a wonderful story of one of the great sports events in American history. Particularly interesting is the story of James J. Corbett that Mr. Corbett introduced the style of boxing that continues to this day. In this regard, James J. Corbett was truly innovative. But returning to the movie, all the performances were great. Alexis Smith was beautiful. He looked like Nicole Kidman. And while this is a periodic piece, it can withstand the test of time; it is not hidden. Ward Bond's imagination of John L. Sullivan must be one of the greatest images of the actual sports figure in the history of films, and boxing schemes are realistic, well-staged and very effective. This, along with a large script, makes this movie mandatory.
