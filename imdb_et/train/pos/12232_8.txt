As a collector of film memorials, I had to buy a poster of this movie, which now, when I finally see it, must be the best thing. There is nothing more attractive to hang on your wall than a 27x41-inch image of a melting man. However, your video recorder is no more terrible than a picture of a one and a half hour melting pot. At first I thought this film was pure garbage, but then I realized that it had some features that made me laugh. Dr Ted Nelson's character must be the most sought after person who brought the biggest screen. His dialogue is so harsh that it is incredible! ("It's incredible! It looks like he's getting stronger!) <br /> <br /> And could anyone tell me how the hell they know exactly how much time Steve has left before he completely melts the plan If this movie was meant to scare the audience, I think it wasn't calling it.
