This movie is such a cheesy goodness. <br /> <br /> A number of people who are trapped in an abandoned school. They're gonna kill, they know they're being tracked, so what are they doing? One girl chooses to take a bath, the other decides to deceive her husband (who is there) with the old boy so they can find a bed (in an old abandoned school?) And go here. <br /> <br /> And it comes with Gore and R&D. <br /> <br /> And it's also interesting from a historical / sociological perspective. If the traditional 80's is a reflection of how we see ourselves or how adults see, or when Hollywood looks at the rest of the country, it has a unique perspective. This is a British film made for the American. It's fun to see how often British actors trying to talk to "America" ​​are sliding back inadvertently with their UK accents. <br /> <br /> If you like cheesy 80 slashers (like Pieces) then you will like it.
