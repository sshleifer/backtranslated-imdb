Just the biggest low budget horror movie of all time. I saw this movie for the first time when I was about nine years old and I have to say that it frightened me of fear. Now that I've all grown up, I see this movie, what it really is ... genius. Anyone, or at least anyone with a taste, has dreamed of seeing the snowman who goes to kill people, even if they don't recognize it. I've always found something genuinely terrifying about snowmen, so of course this was a spooky junkie like I did this dream. Some people say that this movie is stupid or in some other way void ... it is a bit more of a movie, than what the hell are you waiting for? Anyone who gave this film to a low score is obviously too modest to sit back and be ridiculous for foolish liners and cheap gore. I love this movie for what it is, comedy, and until the film industry rises and makes a serious horror strike with the killer snowman (which seems to be impossible, unfortunately, I keep this great piece of indie horror near my heart forever).
