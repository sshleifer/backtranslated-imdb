It's not the most fun movie I've ever seen. From the four criminals whose fathers have sent to the Wienberg Military Academy, a tone is set to continue throughout this football film, and it does not allow another. <br /> <br /> It's hard to try to describe this movie; Humor elements are both on the spot and superbly convinced that the first look does not look like a stupid 80's teen comedy. But that's so much more! Fresh MAD Magazine's older people think that the Academy has built up a formula and style that I have never seen before, the "funniest" offers copied from Hollywood in the past. Basically, the film is so perfect with childhood cornflowers that you might think the writers were a couple of 14 years old. Watch this movie if you like to act "immature". Classic. *****
