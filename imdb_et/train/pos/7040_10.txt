This movie was great for the following reasons: 1) It contained great wallpapers and kits. 2) This showed the difference between the war-torn environment and the technological side. 3) John Cusack's actions were terrible. He imagined it very well. 4) It showed the vulnerability of all people in war-ridden situations. 5) This gave us an overview of what could happen in many aspects in the future. I also had the impression that the actor was mostly acting. Hilary's action was, I found, the toughest. In a war-ridden situation, everyone's morals and values ​​are grasped. A liberal journalist and a conservative businessman are able to do anything in any situation and are equally unpredictable. Good stuff. PSP
