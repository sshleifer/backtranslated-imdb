If you have any appreciation for character and dialogue and the history of American culture, you will find a lot of very absorbing material in this film. It was probably a game originally, and that's why this dialogue is difficult, but I can't stress enough how these icons, which we only understand, have become a truly complicated and wonderful sign. <br /> <br /> This movie is better than any college course that tells you how to create a character-based story. <br /> <br />
