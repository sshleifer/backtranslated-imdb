For one of us, this season, I have been disgracefully enjoying all the Pushing Daisies episodes, and I hope the writers strike will not end cruelly at the very beginning of a very good show. Ned is a pie maker who has a restaurant in the middle of the city that has a secret talent. Emmerson is a private investigator with unique questions as she loves knitting. Charlotte (Chuck) is once a dead but no longer a childhood friend and a sunny place in Nedi's life. Olive is a jealous but good-hearted waitress. Oh, and add a dog. Jim Dale brings all the characters together with his great talk. Chuck, Ned, and Emmerson, together with Olive, and occasionally with the dog, solve the mysteries of several murders with a special gift from Nedi that brings the dead back to life. The exhibition is funny, clean and romantic in a very cute and cordial way, and I would recommend it to anyone.
