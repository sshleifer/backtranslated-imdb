This is probably the best Star Wars movie. <br /> <br /> The movie's starting point was almost like Episode IV - Spacious cabaret music and cabaret thoughts, where the seriousness of mobile Jabba, Hutt became even more serious. He ordered Luke to die for Bantha's bone-breaking teeth, which saw almost a bear and shark cross. The Luke Jedi authorities finally take out the monster. Jabba was very confused because Hei Solo, who was frozen at the end of Jimba V, added that Luke was sentenced to death outside the Sarlack well. <br /> <br /> But all Star Wars had good guys, especially R2-D2, with other ideas ... and these other ideas led to Luke's implementation; finally, most of Jabba's soldiers and princess died, finding Jabba deadly to death. <br /> <br /> Like Episode IV, Episode VI's death star appears. Analyzing the rebel fleet who attacked the Imperial fighters around the star of the death, I thought the Star Destroyer staff highlighted the high altitude weaponry using Imperial fighters as a deviation. The 20-25-star fighters who were lined up were ready to attack, but they were called out and, instead, they were shot with a stellar laser gun. When it was triggered, the only hope of the rebel fleet was that the shield of the star of the death star strikes out and affected Land so much that he wanted to destroy the dead star, but he could not take the shield. And it was taken out of Lando's growing impatience. <br /> <br /> As in episode V, the imperial walkers are making their threatening appearance with their two cannons, killing at least one of Ewoks ... but the old Ewoks still found an unusual way to deal with them. For example, Chewbacca, as well as the other Ewok, managed to lead one of the walkers (and actually used it to destroy one walk) and the other Ewoks used the logs to throw them out with two other walkers. > <br /> It is wonderful what Luke is doing with his Jedi power on his Light Saber, such as the Endor scene, where Luke directs incoming laser images to the Storm Trooper speed bike, and using Sabre to fall off part of the bike. Or at the peak, using Saber, to break his father's hand in the battle with Sith Vader, who ended up with Sabel. <br /> <br /> You know that celebrating Ewoks is likely to be a blast of death after a short time, along with a short fireworks display, racing drum (such as Storm Trooper Masks) and Luke finally met Luke's own failure --- Darth Vader, who is now dead, burning the pyre. The celebration celebrates Ewoks' song, but I think Lucas did not buy it - even with the respect of the film component John Williams. In addition to the event in Endor, he wanted pictures of festive scenes on several surviving rebels' planets, including a festive laser shooter that destroys the Sith. The Ewoks song was replaced by an alternative instrumental community. He probably wanted him to be able to prove that by destroying the star of death, the balance of rebel galaxies was restored.
