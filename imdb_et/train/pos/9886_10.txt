This is a prominent film visually. The characters from the Mexican desert, the old mansion, the picturesque costumes ... represent a real work of art. <br /> <br /> The story seems a little open, but because it's not meant to be realistic. It is taken from a book called one hundred years of honesty, and it should be an outstanding Latin American isolated, different atmosphere "as far away from God and so close to the United States". The big debt owed by Erendira to her grandmother is the symbol of Latin America's international debt, although there are many groups of meanings. <br /> <br /> If you can evaluate a slow moving, richly textured movie, it's for you.
