I loved it so much that I bought a DVD and a novel at the same time. The chemistry of the actors (including the small Arthur) is amazing and exciting. And Gilbert Markham was amazingly "on top" of the movie from the beginning. <br /> <br /> The one who liked me most about the surprising shock and fear and surprise was Rupert Graves like Arthur Huntingdon. I adore her with Forsyte Saga, and I've seen her all else. But he crosses like Arthur. In my most wooded dreams, I couldn't depict him as a dementia psycho like Arthur Huntingdon. But he does. And I love it. And I love her.
