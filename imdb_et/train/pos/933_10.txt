I saw this movie in the sixth grade at Christmas and I was really happy to see it and when I heard George C. Scott was in it, I was very excited because I love George C. Scott! When I and my class watched this movie, I really came into it and when it was over, I was very impressed, I thought it was absolutely fabulous! This is Charles Dickens' classic novel I've ever seen! Scrooge by George C. Scott is something else, I thought he was the perfect choice, he was Scrooge, he's the final Scrooge! I've seen two different Christmas song versions, the other is Patrick Stewart, but it's better! <br /> <br /> What it really is, an actor, I thought the actors were awesome, everyone, the spirits, Tiny Tim, Bob Cratch, all, they couldn't find anyone better than those who did the parts ! But the best part of the movie was George C. Scott! When I saw him, I thought he was the absolute best! He's the ultimate Ebenezer Scrooge, I don't think they could have found anyone better! I don't think they could have found someone better to replace the movie! <br /> <br /> This movie is probably the final customization of Charles Dickens' classic film and I really think you agree that this movie is amazing! I think I have to buy this movie on DVD because I thought it was absolutely fabulous! I suggest you see this masterpiece! This is A Christmas Carol's best period, period. <br /> <br /> 10/10
