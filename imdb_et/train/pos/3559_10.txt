I love this movie. My only disappointment was that some original songs had changed. <br /> <br /> It is true that Frank Sinatra can't sing so much in this movie, but it's also nice that it's not another Frank Sinatra movie where it mostly sings. <br /> <br /> I thought it was better to use Marlon Brando's own voice because he has a voice that fits and I didn't see anyone with this great voice who pulled the gangster off his voice. <br /> <br /> Stubby Kaye "Sit down, you're the Rockin 'boat" is a mouth-killer, sing-long, so I just love. She is a hard act following her version and I still like her best. <br /> <br /> Vivian Blaine is great in this respect and "Adelaide's Fear" is my favorite song. <br /> <br /> I thought Jean Simmons was perfect for this part. Maybe I wouldn't have looked at him first, but after he had seen him, it was reasonable. <br /> <br /> Michael Kidd's choreography is timeless. If it was staged again in 2008, I wouldn't change anything. <br /> <br /> I find that there has been a loss of the film version of the production several times, but it continued to feel like a production. , though it was on the film. <br /> <br /> I thought the film was well cast. I did this in regional versions and this is one of my favorites in this period.
