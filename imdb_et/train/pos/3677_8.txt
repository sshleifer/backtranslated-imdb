Fortunately, I saw it recently on an airplane in Singapore (I thought it missed the Cinemalaya film festival). Paris, je t'aime is a collection of 20 short films (about 5 mins) by 20 directors who show their love for various modern Paris pockets. <br /> <br /> One of my fave segments is "Parc Monceau" Alfonso Cuarn (high expectations, Harry Potter and Azkaban prisoner), made with one continuous picture and with Nick Nolte. <br /> <br /> Coen's brothers "Tuileries" play Steve Buscem as a tourist subway was fun! Juliette Binoche and Willem Dafoe in Place des Victoires were haunting. <br /> <br /> Maggie Gyllenhaal as American actress / drug "Quartier des Enfants in Rouges" to portray prediction and heartbreak in such a short time. the time was just great. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood as a victim of "Quartier de la Madeleine" vampires was quite surreal, while Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell played a lovely pair of Wes Craven's "Pre-Lachaise". br /> <br /> Natalie Portman was beautiful as a girlfriend of "Faubourg Saint-Denis", an actress of a French-speaking boy with a visual impairment. However, despite many young love, Gena Rowlands's more mature placement in mature Latin was equally aw-inducating. <br /> <br /> This movie is perfect for those with ADHD, because each sequence is carefully thought through. <br /> <br /> There are also many memorable quotes. This is especially the one who has cheated on the husband who finally leaves his lover with his dying husband in the last few days: "He is a man in love, he became a man in love with him."
