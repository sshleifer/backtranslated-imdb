(spoilers?) <br /> <br /> Although historical accuracy may be questionable ... (and because of the inaccurate LOTR mass complaint, such things are now more easily released), I liked this art. Although this is not really an art house film. It occasionally gives little emotionally charged scenes. <br /> <br /> I have two complaints. 1. It's too short. and the second voice whispered from time to time is not explained. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 10/10 Entertainment: 7/10 Replayable: 5/10
