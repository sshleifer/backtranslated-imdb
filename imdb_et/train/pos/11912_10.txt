I liked the "Nemesis" by Albert Pyun for his cheesy activity and a semi-complicated script. Many people complain about the first movie about a "confusing" plot, which is probably why "Nemesis 2: Nebula" is stupid like rocks that have the same super-action to do it. <br /> <br /> This gives the first movie to the hero Alex, who has been rescued in the past to save the future. He is raised by the African tribe. A good part of the film is only in the language of the dialogue, without the subtitles, what I liked because it seemed somewhat authentic (how often do movies in this genre try to do that?). It does not take long before evil cybercrumbs travel from time to time to find him and try to kill him. <br /> <br /> Don't make me wrong, this is a piece (not that the first was something big). There are lower limits that include African political unrest, treasure hunt and tribal combat. The picture is very short in the brain, so none of these things can be a very good treatment. Basically, the picture has been pulled out in the fight with some of the rain that tend to muscle the baby and cyber. It has an entertaining value, just does not expect quality or anything from the first movie.
