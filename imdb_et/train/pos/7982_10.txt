I'm surprised that such movies can still be done. I always watch all kinds of movies with friends and I can say that this is one of the best I've ever seen. Never thought that a 146-minute movie might think about it and beyond. <br /> <br /> Washington, as charismatic and intense as ever, plays Creasy, a washed anti-terrorism agent dedicated to a bottle. When he is destined to protect the young Pitat (Dakota Fanning) in Mexico, his emotional and redemptive arc is triggered so that he can only offer a divine little girl. Inevitably, Pita has been kidnapped by predators and Creasy decides that most of the Mexican cities have to pay for the courage to take their character's teddy bear catalyst. Yeah, he's got ... man of fire. <br /> <br /> You have to watch this movie.
