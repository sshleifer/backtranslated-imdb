As the one-line summary says, two films have left me like this when I left the theater. One was "Echoes of Echoes" with Kevin Bacon and the other was "Vanilla Sky". <br /> <br /> One of those movies you sit deep on the theater side and finish thinking about yourself, Stop thinking about the end of the movie and just leave the movie quickly where he wants ... The way out of the cinema was a bit weird like this feeling you get sick and don't think about anything. One of those movies that gets one with you, and the feeling that nothing moves around you as things in the movie. <br /> <br /> One thing is for sure. The actors are fantastic, the sound is great and everything in the movie is 9+. <br /> <br /> Definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen and a movie that made the best and most shocking of my life and my goal in this world.
