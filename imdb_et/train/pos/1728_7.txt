The wooden horse was one of the first "great" escape stories of World War II that spoke of Eric Williams and others fleeing Stalag-Lufft III in October 1943. it is from VHS from Amazon to England and get it from PAL format in the US. I read the book when I was in college after seeing part of the film on television in the early 60s, trying to beating Peter and John in a beating drama during the war from Germany is more realistic than the treck of the great escape flee. This movie is a lost treasure that should become more accessible to the American audience.
