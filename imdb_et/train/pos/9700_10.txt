Somehow, this film will at the same time be lively, bittersweet and heart-warming. Letters like Tony Shalhoub (from Providence) bring the story to life. The story itself is inspiring. We see a desperate, up-and-down life through the most innocent eyes that can be imagined: a bird. Paulie begins her life as a little girl's parrot (played by Hallie Eisenberg, also known as Pepsi girl) with speech disabilities. While he is learning to speak correctly, Paulie is. Unlike most birds, he can talk and understand everything that is said. The military father doesn't like the bird, so he's sent to a pawn and buys an aging artist Ivy. She teaches her practices, etc., while traveling across the country to find Paulie's owner. The film continues with several twists of fate until Paulie arrives at the laboratory, where she is finally hidden in the basement and found a Russian caretaker affected by the story of the birds. The plot is in line with a simple, metaphorical theme whose language is a gift, and a curse. I would like to say that the sound is amazing. A beautiful blend of flute, digital base and horns will bring the film to pure ecstasy. The camera angles and breathtaking scenery further enhance the story. And the last point is that the doll girl is completely plausible. (Unlike the importance of the Yoda muppet) This movie is one of my favorite films, plus a note that my wonderful four-year-old parakeet died recently. In general, I give this film **** from four stars, two thumbs and a great hug.
