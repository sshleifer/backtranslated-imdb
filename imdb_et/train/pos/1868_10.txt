This film describes the life of the most disadvantaged person, but unlike many people, he grew up to be a respectable person. What's more, it's a real story. Antwone Fisher is so innocent and still abused just because he was not white. Antwone Fisher has been married to the same woman for ten years and has never smiled with women, coke, cigars, weeds, alcohol, or things that are very popular in places where she grew up. <br /> <br /> There's not much to say about this movie, it's great. The only rating I can give is the 10/10.
