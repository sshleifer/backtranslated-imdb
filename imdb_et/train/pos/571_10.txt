Looking at how the two brothers communicate and give each other through the film, I personally feel happy in the countryside as they did in the film. I watched this movie countless times and I put the book beside my Bible. After watching the movie, I agree that this is one of the few films that make the book fair. I strongly urge anyone who has the opportunity to go to Montana to do it or stay outside. It's amazing. I don't think of anyone else who could play a role better than Brad Pitt. Make yourself fair and watch one of the best films in modern movie timing. DON'T recommend and, as a guide to fishing trips in Montana and Wyoming, do not try to learn how to fly fish movie scenes, because while the film has a good prospect, you have no idea how much of this practice and skill is being sought. actually takes. Thank you for listening Watch this movie if you want a longer sad movie.
