"Life stinks" is a parody of life and death, happiness and depression. Black and white are always in our lives. Mel Brooks's performance is brilliant as always and other participants work well. This film has some Capra flavors, so it's so good. <br /> <br /> There are some unforgettable gags like Brooks tries to collect money on the street and all the people who just pass ignore him or when he meets a funny mad man who believes that Paul Getty and then will argue against each other. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it, you don't know what you're saying about this movie. <br /> <br /> This film talks about the old and eternal struggles of the poor against the rich. <br /> <br /> The only difference between this film and reality is that this film has a happy ending and no reality. <br /> <br /> Yes, life is alive.
