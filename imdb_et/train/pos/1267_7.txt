JUST CAUSE is a flawed but decent film that is kept together by strong performances and a creative (albeit extremely predictable) letter. Sean Connery is a Crusade against the Death Penalty, who saved a seemingly innocent young man (Blair Underwood) from his final sentence. To set the right things, Connery puts a crime on the scene where she has to fight not only with the passage of time but also with the confusing sheriff (Laurence Fishbourne). Revolutions and reversals of roles are abundant - some surprising, some not - as an aging crusader tries to unravel the mystery. The climatic end is a bit ridiculous, but JUST CAUSE is worth a look at a slow night.
