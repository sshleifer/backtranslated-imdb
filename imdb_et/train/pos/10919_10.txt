Five deadly poison is not as bloody and violent as the story of Ricky or Super Ninja, but it contains some of the best hand-arm sequences in Hong Kong's film history. Director Chang Cheh creates what many see as his masterpiece. This film launched a career of five men. Meng Lo plays another bad ass. He's going to Super Ninja. Kuo Chui, who is Philip Kwok, would continue with Ricky and Hardi's cooked story. This can be any cork cleaner. But I think it's not as good as Super Ninjas (also Chang Cheh). But all the pieces are good and this is one of the best.
