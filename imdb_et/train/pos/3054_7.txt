"Panic" is a leading role in William H. Macy, Donald Sutherland and Neve Campbell. Alex (playing Macy) is a man who kills people for living. But at the moment he is facing depression and therefore sees a therapist. There he meets Saraga (Neve Campbell) and falls in love with her. He also faces another problem: he wants to give up his family business (killings), but he doesn't know how to tell his father. <br /> <br /> The man who is in his time is a medieval crisis that faces common problems: falling in love with a pretty young girl and everything that comes with it. <br /> <br /> Pretty good actors. Macy is great as depressed Alex. I had great expectations about it and it was a good movie, but it can't offer it completely. The story was pretty flat and clich√©. <br /> <br /> 7/10
