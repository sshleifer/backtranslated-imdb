I don't know why some people criticize it so much. <br /> <br /> This is a great, funny show - probably not the right material for the mainstream, but still ... <br /> Family dynamics are funny and all you see in most comedy events. Supporting characters are completely fun. Plots of individual episodes and frequent Siegfried & Roy jibes are just above average, but you always have lots of plots or lumps that make you roll out on the floor. the exhibition was worth 8 pounds, for which I paid for it. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8/10
