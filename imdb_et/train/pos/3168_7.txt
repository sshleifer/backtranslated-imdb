It is a lovely and sad little story of cultural difference. Kyoko is a beautiful Japanese woman who has traveled to California to escape Japan's failed relationship. Ken is a Japanese American craftsman who wants a rock and roll start, but little concrete to offer a potential partner. Kyoko "marries" Ken to stay in the US permanently, convinced that although they live together until he gets a "green card", marriage is just the name. Soon it turns out that the parties are not on the same wavelength - or perhaps the same time zone, so the movie's title. As an immigration lawyer, I have seen that such "agreements" take their lives, so I was pleased to see how the filmmaker has developed dramatic opportunities for this situation.
