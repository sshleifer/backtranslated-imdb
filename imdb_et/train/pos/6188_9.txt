The investigation of the killings is back, while The Vanities plays on an unknown audience on its opening night. The strange combination of music and murder mystery is worth searching for your cast, its product numbers, and the newness of the film. <br /> <br /> Gertrude Michael has an obvious role in the wife's actor's intention to stop the marriage between the stars of the show, Kitty Carlisle and Carl Brisson, as well as starring in the notorious "Sweet Marijuana" (also in the 70's Bette Midler's album). So, when the girls in the choir mix at the back of the stage, the detective Victor McLaglen worships the girls when he tries to solve the murder of an unknown woman at the back. <br /> <br /> We quickly find out that Lady (Dorothy Stickney) loves Brisson far away, that the lady lady (Jessie Ralph) is Brisson's mother and that the director (Jack Oakie) strikes everything. Musical numbers have lots of plots. The most famous song of the exhibition is "Cocktails for Two." Kitty Carlisle also sings haunted "Where do they come from?" And there is a strange rape that breaks with Duke Ellington as a Harlem specialty! Quite amazing. <br /> <br /> Some terribly acting here, especially Gertrude Michael and Dorothy Stickney. Kitty Carlisle is pretty good. However, Brisson is a complete zero. <br /> <br /> Charles Middleton plays Homer, Toby Wing plays Nancy, Donald Meek plays the doctor and sees if you can show Ann Sheridan and Lucille Ball among the girls.
