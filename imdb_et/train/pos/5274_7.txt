Yes, I loved this movie when I was a kid. When I grew up, I saw this movie so many times that my father had to buy another copy of VHS because the old copy was worn. <br /> <br /> My family got a copy of VHS from this movie when we bought a new VHS system. At first my mother wasn't sure that it was a good movie for 10 years, but since we just bought a new VHS system, she promised me to look at it. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie is every little boy's dream? The film has a terrible place, big muscular barbarians, beautiful topless women, big bad monsters and jokes that you can only get older. So, a few days ago I entered the video and watched the movie for a long time. At first I was bored, then I began to think about how much I loved this movie when I was a kid, and continued to watch. Yes, the experience was not as big as I remembered? The action is pretty bad, the story is pretty bad, the jokes were no longer funny, but the women were still pretty beautiful. Yes, I have grown up. Although the movie experience has changed for me, I think it's worth 7 stars. Because you know good old times?
