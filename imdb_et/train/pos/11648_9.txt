There are people who claim to be the second "bad language" of the ultra violent Mexican film. They are right, but more than this film is a call to raise awareness of what we have changed. The terrible truth is painful or boring if you have already accepted the third world paradigm as the only possible goal. One of the most important things in "Cero y van cuatro" is an open call for our current identity. Is that what we are all about? Is that all we want to be? I'm abroad and I realized how Mexican society was being corrupted when Tlahuac's incident came to light. I still can't understand viewers who are familiar with mass broadcasting. I saw almost some pictures. It was not Iraq or Rwanda, but a small village near Mexico, with a pledge of media and government. Restoring a similar situation in this film shocked me deeply. The other stories were good, reflecting other situations of corruption, dishonesty, betrayal and violence, but I think Tamales de Chivo is the best. <br /> <br /> The film is deeper than some "cabr√≥n" and "pendejo" screaming. They are meaningless compared to human activities. With some exceptions, they are all perfect examples of human waste. Just as in real life, honesty is becoming an exception to our rule in our country. Moreover, honesty is only rewarded wonderfully.
