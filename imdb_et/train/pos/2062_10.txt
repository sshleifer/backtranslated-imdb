First of all, I am the first to admit that the scarecrow itself is quite overwhelming. A toned, perhaps less acrobatic scarecrow would have much less cheese in this film. But in general, I think it's one of the best B-movies. Tiffany Shepis is absolutely wonderful, not to mention incredibly beautiful. Although this film lacks all the important nude factors, there are also several other movies to watch. But here he gets all the evil roughness, especially at the end when he walked away from the imprisoned scarecrow. Richard Elfman also does a good job as a sheriff and a drunk boyfriend. Yes, it's a B-film with a low budget. But of all the ones I've seen, it's definitely one of my most popular favorites.
