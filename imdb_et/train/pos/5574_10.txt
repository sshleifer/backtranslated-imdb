Peter M. Cohen has the winner of the match, which has been turned and turned. Critical bashing of the film in the media as "offensive" and "filthy" only serves its intensity, which is refreshing and the dissection of the sexual interests and passions of concentrated people. This is a tradition that I call a "reality-based" satire, followed by "In The Company of Men", "Chasing Amy", "Your Friends and Neighbors" and "Two Girls and a Guy". Cohen's dialogue is fun and I was always interested in how perfectly he hit the real pace of today's conversations. Brian Van Holt, Zorie Barber, and Jonathan Abrahams have three different, relentless sexual obsessed predators who, together with their recently married friend (the great game of Judah Domke), are the predator of a foil (Amanda Peet). Under the satirical surface is a romantic comedy that is much more satisfying than most sugar-coated studio products.
