I really don't know how this show is playing in the US and elsewhere in Europe. It is both an independent American (especially white Americans). This can be a big reason for some poison and vitriol on this table. I love this example, but it has some reservations and I feel that Spoiler Spoiler took it out easily: <br /> <br /> Crashing and burning everything at the end of the second season. Julie stuck in the door with hope to revive the example, unless her character lands in the middle of a farm in the middle of a farm. Who knows? It was a funny, dirty and sometimes confident show.
