I looked at this example when I was a little girl. When I think about it, I only remember it vaguely. When you asked me it was a good show. The two things I remember vaguely are the opening order and the theme song. In addition, everything was ideally cast. Writing was also very strong. The performances were also top-notch. I hope some networks will bring it back so I can see every episode. Before I seal it, I would like to say that I always remember this memory forever, although I don't think I've seen every episode. All in all, if any network ever brings it back, I hope you get it one day before it gets in the air.
