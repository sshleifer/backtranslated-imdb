Also known as Big Spook War. The Great Yokai War is Miike's test of family film and fucking good work. The problem is that I can't imagine many parents wanting to put their children on the film. The best children's movies are those that are scary or distracting images, the endless story, and the return to Oz, but in the case of the Great Yokai War, Miike is likely to take things a little too far. In fact, I was the person who introduced the film and said it was not very suitable. <br /> <br /> The film is launched by a young hero who introduces himself and explains his current family problems. This short moment when a person is suddenly broken, when a cow is born a calf whose face is a person who screams, that before he is dead there is something frightening as it is (it is quite possible that creature fearfulness is some odd Quato tribute). <br /> <br /> After an incredible introduction to the main baddie Kato and his henchwoman Agi (surprisingly attractive Chiaki Kuriyami), raising the apocalyptic army. The story turns out to be normal for a while, but it won't take long before all the logic goes off and the young boys attack the Miyazaki group, who pushes the evil witch out. /> The plot of the film is quite common and at times surprising, the whole selected person seems to be in a movie that regularly breaks clich√©s, totally out of place, but is supported by a simple awe-inspiring vision of the magical world. This is really a Miyazaki movie made for live film, although it is more succulent and cruel than the usual Miyazaki movie. <br /> <br /> The film is simply a joy to look at Yokai's designs that are colorful and highly practical, while the evil robots' monsters, while not showing the best CGIs in the world, are virtually and dangerously sacrificial to them, giving to them much more sensitive than imagined. <br /> <br /> Cast is equally great, they just make their character completely natural, which is commendable if you think most of them are full body makeup or latex suits. Even with the ridiculous bees hatched, Agi is terrible and lethal thanks to the surprisingly excellent action of Kuriyam. <br /> <br /> Although the film has many elements that make it firmly in the family movie territory; cute creatures, younger heroes, thoroughly evil villain, mercy and adventure, and violence against violence. There are elements that make you question whether Miike should have managed such a movie. <br /> <br /> Robot Army is a truly frightening everyday item that has been turned into monster animals that look like T-101 sans skin and added chainsaws. These animals abduct signs; suck the creatures into the stained mouths of their blood and abduct the children from their homes, wiping them straight out of their parent's nose before they get a little patrician. <br /> <br /> Creating creatures is just as difficult for young minds. Yokai, mainly heroes, is fed into a giant oven filled with a form of eradicated anger that corrects Yokai's flesh and forces their angry souls to have metal pieces. If the children thought Anakin was bad to wait, they would see that the men-sized hedgehog burns to death for a few minutes before it turns into a motorcycle disaster. There is also an interruption of the limbs, in one case, a hand in front of the camera dripping with blood, a fair amount of sexual energy (Agi wears one outfit specially designed for fan services and seems to have only Kato's motivation, while the princess of the rivers carries something off and gets the heroes of the young heroes grabbing several scenes) and the general humor that goes beyond the miracle of the technical colors that saw. <br /> <br Spoilers An example of how Yokai is interested in the last battle when they think it's a big party. The next fight is more about a festival than anything, with beer, crowd surfing, and metamorphosis. Also, the scene where Agi wins the tarry of a cute furry creature seems to be a call to the raised masses of pokemon. <br /> <br /> Final Spoilers At the end of the day, the great Yokai War is easy on Miike's toughest movies. Although he lacks some of Gerva's or Ichi's fake magic, it is simply constantly pushing the audience on the path of general madness. In fact, it's just Miike's hardest film because it covers the whole magic of the subject. <br /> <br /> It's only good to look at Gogo's ass from time to time.
