Xiao Chen Zhi Chun is a great movie, not only this year, but also now. This is an art film that has not expired in the 21st century. The director kept good narrative skills and thus made the story so smooth. <br /> <br /> The film reminds me of a later French new wave film: Francois Truffaut's "Femme d'a cote", a similar theme.
