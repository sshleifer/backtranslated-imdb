I just saw this film by Frank Loesser boys and dolls for the third time with my mother who never saw it before. She was pleasantly surprised by the voice of Jean Simmons and Marlon Brando. And he thought that the Havana sequences, where Simmons and Brando were rushing, were excellent. They were too impressive for me and were usually highlighted in the movie. This movie, which Damon Runyon's story has directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, will occasionally take a slow pace of non-musical scenes, but will pull you off after a while. The second story with Frank Sinatra and Vivian Blaine was not so convincing for me, but still their charms especially during the Sue Me number. Also, Stubby Kaye loved the "Sit, You're a Boat Ride" number and Sheldon Leonard's and B. S. Pully's performances. With the view of the boys, boys and dolls are not great film music, but certainly very good.
