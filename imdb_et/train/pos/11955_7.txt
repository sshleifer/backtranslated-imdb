Let yourself be transported to storytelling in a different old school. Scoop is a classic Woody Allen. <br /> <br /> Allen's latest museum, Scarlett Johansson (who also appeared at last year's Match Point, including Allen), is surprisingly able to repel his ridiculous sex kitten and turn into a normal-looking student with nerdish glasses and equipment, but still can't believe the public how Hugh Jackman's peculiar character can hit him, given the royal background (don't worry, there's no spoiler here). For Johansson's character, there are no major transformations here, as he constantly plays the same character, despite the script that says otherwise. You even forgive the lack of obvious logic of your character, continuing the link with the suspect's serial killer, just because he is His Royal Hotness Jackman who is refreshing to see the sols of Wolverine duds. <br /> <br /> If anything, consistency is what 70-year-old Allen is. He continues the pulp stories in the same way as always; as if he had ever made a contemporary film that would probably make his quiet, simple movies attractive. They never seem to target a specific market; as if Allen was just making films for her taste, regardless of whether the public likes it or not.
