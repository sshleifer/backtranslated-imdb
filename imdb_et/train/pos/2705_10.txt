This is a script that Ed Wood worked for over a decade. Finally, Aris Iliopulos got a chutzpahi to shoot the script Wood saved from his burning home at the expense of other temporary values. <br /> <br /> This is a dialogue-free movie, some of which may be silently silent. In fact, it is a rather noisy film without most of the cinemas being dirty. In the hands of these filmmakers, the musical and sound effects offer a rich sound experience that works better than almost all the grills of the Hollywood script grinder, especially this silly boat film, Billy Zane, which was last ("Look!!" - J. Cameron .... ick. ..) I take Zane's excellent communicative monosilic primers in this film during an empty dialogue every day. <br /> <br /> Billy Zane controls a group of players who probably really wanted to be in this movie. Ricci is radiant as always, and the gods shine when you put Sandra Bernhard, Rick (y) Schroeder, Eartha Kitt and Andrew McCarthy on the same poster. <br /> <br /> The design is perfect, the pyramid is fine and Ron Perlman's wild performance is just wonderful. All in all, this is a chaotic, visceral masterpiece masterfully designed by Ed Wood Jr., auteur and cinenephile fans. You have to see anyone who really loves movies as Iliopulos and most of his election apparently do. A film that wants you to have done it yourself.
