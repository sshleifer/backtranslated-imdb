Probably the first Portuguese film I've seen in my life, and I enjoyed it. The plot is related to how the young army officers took power in Portugal in 1974 to finally lose the Caetano Fascist government and to complete the wars in colonies, ie Mozambique, Angola and Guinea (Bissau) - Cape Vert. Most of the events shown in the film accurately reflect the behavior of army officers and soldiers for the coup d'Ã©tat, the oppressed people who were very pleased about this new development and freedom, the resistance of Caetano men, and also of the most conservative officials, including Spinola, who took over the new president. The Portuguese Revolution may be recalled due to the actions of many young officers, but for me the most interesting part of the film was when a young captain expressed that Portugal should develop democratically, and that is what the country will achieve in a few years' time after a coup or revolution. The film also shows that military officers and soldiers never wanted to kill anyone; even the most serious enemies were honored at the end.
