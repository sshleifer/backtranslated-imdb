I was looking at the "Last Wave" library of the Fine Arts Library in my school. It's intriguing, like all Peter Weir's stuff, but it's not always as attentive as I would have wanted. I found myself fascinated by what was thrown at me (because they are very well run by film director Weir), but at the same time I didn't get enough stimulus. In AKA I got a little bored. <br /> <br /> The plot is surrounded by an Aussie lawyer who is obsessed with certain dreams that bind him to the aboriginal group he protects. <br /> <br /> It starts with intense weather and has some very fantastic moods throughout (especially the bizarre, "bursting" sound design) and the strong direction; but it just didn't know me like Weir's later films. I can just look at it again. <br /> <br /> A good movie about obsession and mystery. In the end, the secret between white and aborigines has some very serious consequences. <br /> <br /> However, God blesses Peter Weir. For him alone, this film is worth ... a very organic director. Like Aussie's Answer Malick! I would give it to 7 because it has got enough good ideas to overcome its boring moments.
