The cast is different and now we started a different approach when we have the street player "Networth" vs. expected professional team "Magna" but a boy if you think a street-friendly team would be in trouble. Although the Magna team has sometimes struggled, the street team has just broken down in a week. <br /> <br /> First, some things that need to be repeated as "Apprentice 3" first continues the same absurd mentality (from Trump) and the game in this series: as your good project manager, but you lose, the team turns you on and you are fired, despite the fact that your backstabbing teammates are often the ones who do half the ass. It is just absurd that the game shows that it claims to hire the best candidates for the "weeds" best, while dysfunctional candidates stabilize with each other until one is left and the person is the best. lol <br /> <br /> Anyone in this season saw the horrors, setbacks, and even gays attacking the stereotypes that the teams were trying to make campaigns. <br /> <br /> The list of victims so far Tara Dowdell, Audrey Evans, Danny Kastner, these three are the only ones I feel unfairly fired by Trump, the rest really came because they only fueled conflicts, anger and suffering. It's just amazing, because one of the candidates, Audrey Evans, said how she who did a good job was fired and how some of her worthless teammates are still in the game. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a game, it's a "Teacher" where manipulation, rebound, and always popular "everyone comes to the project manager" mentality rules. <br /> <br /> It has been a fun ride, but candidates are given many different tasks from photo shooting to building mini golf courses, building new apartments. <br /> <br /> Although it is still a "trainee", although everything you can do is laugh at all times, because madness and chaos are inadequate until the happy person is the winner.
