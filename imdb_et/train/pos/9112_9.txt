The semi-Portuguese language does not make semi-dark (or semi-damaged) Portuguese Portuguese. Not that I often do it. But this movie was such an adrenaline speed! Yes, it is right - it was mostly accurate as much as history went on - but it doesn't pull beyond the usual Portuguese-movie territory: things like using real locations with traffic jams in the middle of Lisbon and recruiting a real crowd almost 30 years ago against a real crowd . And God got it right! OK, in summary: very emotional when you have gone through it, but you can mark minor improvements that might have been made, as well as the priming needs that were. If you look at it just by chance, you are a good historical rumor, only with a very recent history and somewhat more thoughtful than usual. Even according to European standards, yes.
