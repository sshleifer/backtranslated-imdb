This movie is a fun and completely sarcastic view of pop culture and its producers. I was impressed by the photography that consisted of vivid colors and spin-doctor settings, especially if you think it is ZukoviÄ‡'s first major impact test. <br /> <br /> One warning, don't take the film's message seriously. It is not meant for mass consumption (and it is not a compliment). The message is a somewhat stylized post-social view of the college. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the fictional zine editor's main picture lines that verbally whipped up mobility in the 90s.
