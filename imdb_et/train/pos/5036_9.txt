Bill Paxton, aliens, in the dark and the fame of Terminator, surprises me with his debut as Frailty Director. He hits all the cylinders, but near the end there is one improbability involving the FBI agent (Powers Booth), which drops the point of this otherwise cooling and provoking thriller. Besides, this movie was just good. Bill Paxton plays father. He has never received a first name, but it is not the weakness of the film. In fact, it strengthens the film, allowing the viewer to see him as a sort of symbol. He has one day's vision of what he says he was sent from God, telling him that the world is coming to an end, and both his and his two sons, Fenton Meiks (Matt OLeary) and Adam Meiks (Jeremy Sumpter), have to demon and punish. The demons look like the ordinary people they kill, and it makes the spectator wonder whether his father has just lost his mind or really does the work of God. There are scenes that reflect both points that add confusion and tension to the film. <br /> <br /> The story speaks for one son who has now grown up (Matthew McConaughey) and speaks to the FBI representative Wesley Doyle (Powers Booth), who is very skeptical and rightly so. After all, it's not everyday that someone comes to your office to say he knows who the killer is. <br /> <br /> The film has a lot of twists and Bill Paxton drives great, keeping us unaware of losing interest. Operation is incredible. Two young leaders and Paxton work together to look like a normal family, although they are all involved in murder. As I said, Powers Booth's character is one disbelief, but it's not really a big deal. It was a very well made film that included religion and family.
