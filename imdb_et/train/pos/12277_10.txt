Perhaps Isabel Allende's best book, The House of Spirits, is an alternative to Chilean history, full of magic, mysterious veil, plus some sort of sadness everywhere. This film collects the direction of a great selection and great art that does not contain the quality of the entire book. It is unusual for an almost unknown country, such as Chile, to be as well represented as this film, which perhaps only sin is directed too high, and that is why the illiterate public left a little disturbed, mainly because they understand very little.
