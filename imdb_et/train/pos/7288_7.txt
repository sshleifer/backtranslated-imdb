This film is an absolute classic for the camp. That's why it was classic Elvira and MST3000. Everyone knows this story. The scientist keeps his girlfriend alive in the basement lasagna pan if he cruises to the city and tries to find him by controlling the local chicks. Finally, he finds a real body of sand watches with a scarf-covered chick head. The interrupted head makes a folding experiment with friends, and the outline comes out of the closet and hangs from the assistant's "good" hand (his second is not a scientist's previous failure) and the whole place is burning. <br /> <br /> The film was afraid of us as much as the kids that my friend wouldn't see her in the basement a year later. As a child, we always took terrifying films and it was the fourth. Only one of these scary films was really good (Original "The Haunting.") <br /> <br /> I had to give this movie seven judgments that it offers for a huge amount of entertainment value. His unsuccessful effect, because the scientist is looking for bodies (complete with sound music) for frightening production and strange sexual angles, scares the hell of innocent children, while ridiculous aspects make it the main material for viewing and laughing. I can watch and enjoy this movie tonight when I go to the dentist to watch "Chicago" again. <br /> <br /> Seven are the most I can give because the value of this entertainment is just luck. Film as a cinema is a disaster.
