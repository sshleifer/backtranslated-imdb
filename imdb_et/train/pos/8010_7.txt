I thought this film was a fluff of Muppet films. I would now like to withdraw this statement. In my opinion, the most widespread MUppet movie has been a TV movie, which is VERY MORE COUPLE Christmas, is it a wonderful life that was truly terrible. MUPPETS TAKE MANHATTAN is something special. The best songs are that "You can't answer" the song that Muppet babes sing and songs for themselves. Since I liked the Muppet Babies TV show, I loved the Muppet Babies queue here (I said it was the one that inspired the Muppet Babies show). <br /> <br /> MANHATTAN MELODIES showed herself as a real showplayer on Sesame Street Cups for weddings. Because Kermit puts it in its last line, "What better way to stop something?" But I wish that what was between the beginning and the end was a little more fun. Brooke Shields and Gregory Hines are a lovely stick and great dance shows from Rizzas and Rats (choreographed late, by great Jim Henson himself) and the movie is definitely entertaining. I have to say that MUPPET MOVIE, GREAT MUPPET CAPER and MUPPET Christmas CAROL have three final MUppet movies.
