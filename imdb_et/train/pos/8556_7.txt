This movie is normal fun. I have nothing to do with the original American pie, but it's fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Another try, but better than camp camp and naked mile, at least more fun. <br /> <br /> Just after the first five minutes, I smiled at my ass, so I decided to call my friend and we would look at it together. We had a couple of beers and we had fun. <br /> <br /> You can't find any deep messages in this movie, but it's worth a look. <br /> <br /> So put it back and enjoy it easily.
