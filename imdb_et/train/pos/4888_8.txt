It's just been posted on the BBC and I'm very happy about it. When the credit was rolled, alone alone made sure I would give it away. In just five minutes, I was under the most beautiful film. <br /> <br /> Yes, it was formal and predictable, but it somehow added that charm. The repercussions of the forties were superbly positioned and seemed like a few products. <br /> <br /> A real good-looking movie that is all about music. If it's released, I'll buy it!
