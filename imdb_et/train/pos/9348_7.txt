What we have here is the situation. It has been found that man is in trouble and people want to help him - differently. Finally, they are forced to go. You can't fix people. And while in many ways Reign Over Me is traditionally Hollywood, this is not the message. <br /> <br /> This story is not related to Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler), a man who lost his wife and three daughters. / 11 A plane that has gone from a psychotic state of almost PTSS. This is what meets Charlie with a dentist in New York, Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle), who was his roommate at a dental school and knowing his tragedy puts him on the street and reconnects. Charlie travels on a small toy motorized scooter, which is quite fantastic in the Manhattan traffic negotiations - with large headphones over mass unrestrained hair. Hair is Sandler's editor-in-chief to show that he has been corrupted. And the use of music as a getaway must hit every iPod rider using iPod. <br /> <br /> Charlie is a catastrophe, but paradoxically, Alan, the leading woman (Jada Pinkett Smith), will envy her. Charlie lives like a nutty young boy with a large trust fund (tragedy insurance money), and begins to drag Alan to "scare", "eat Chinese," buy high scores or watch Mel Brooks marathon in the house. Charlie lives in a nice large apartment, protected by a medium-sized landlord, changing the kitchen over and over, collecting Springsteen's old vinyl, etc. living room. <br /> <br /> Charlie's laws are deeply concerned about him, but also somehow outrageous as we learn later. Alan has a new patient who proposes her. Charlie's despair puts us in Alan. In an attempt to help Charlie partially allow Alan to escape from her serious reality, but partly makes her more aware of her. <br /> <br /> Cheadle and Sandler are making an odd pair, but it's not important because it's convincing they both need one another. Charlie is desperate to be a companion to a friend who never knew his family because he loses his loss, pretending he never had it. And what if the roommate Charlie was naked and tall and went horribly musical (not Motown)? Alan wants to escape her orderly life. He is not only under the thumb of his wife, but also of his dental partners who hand over him, even though he is the one who set it up. By the way, they are white, and he is black. <br /> <br /> There is also a devilish patient who seriously disturbs the dentist's stuff, but begins to look different when Charlie arrives and reports are his babe. His libido seems to be lurking ready to revive every minute. He has also pulled the breasts of Liv Tyler, a psychotherapist in the same building as dentists who are going to treat Charlie when he admits he needs help. <br /> <br /> Sandler's crazy scenes are a bit too theatrical, as well as many plot devices (in fact, this movie seems to be playing at more than one point), but he has several monologues where he expresses his sadness in deep touches ways. <br /> <br /> Charlie's not only misleading and sad, but dangerous and violent, and all those efforts to help him start a setback. The film is admirable in the sense that it makes people feel wrong. This is an interesting film - sometimes relevant - and this is the first time that 9/11 has dealt with the suffering of survivors. But there is an element of comedy that seems occasionally tasteless, many people are too broadly drawn, and the extremely large Hollywood interiors are terrible. only the streets of Manhattan seem real. There's a courtroom that is unpleasant and Donald Sutherland is a judge who is too good to be true. Alan's family problem is too easy to solve with a phone call. And yet it is worth showing - Cheadle's control and subtlety and Sandler in a serious role that was almost as good as what he had in P.T. Anderson's Punch-Drunk Love of 2002, though clearly a better film, is actually much better.
