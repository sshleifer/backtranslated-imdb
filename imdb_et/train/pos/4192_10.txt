What is likely to be on my Fuller list of best films (ie, when I see them more than that and Shock Corridor), Pickup on South Street is a movie noir, where the femme fatale, as well as the male main character, is not stereotyped in the genre. Like most of his other works, Fuller injects his experience and the New York style feeling that is usually absent in Hollywood poetry. In a small budget - at least for Darryl F. Zanuck-Fuller and his actors - people who like even in such a dark atmosphere are creating. Good guys are basically the ones who don't get violent things with you, even if they are looking for extra bits. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark, Jean Peters, and Thelma Ritter are all terrible in leading positions. Widmark is one of the few actors I can think of who would really have pulled that character. She's a bit like Bugs Bunny because she might be a wise ass who's a little slippery. On the other hand, Skip McCoy's character is a set of values ​​in his life. He does not go into other people's affairs and does not try to take care of a large part of the world of work outside his small river line after he has been sent off for three years. He slips up and does not know him when he pulls a woman on the train (Peters) and raises the object under the government's eyes. It may have some secrets that could make him a lot of money. But at what price is the center of the film, because it includes Moe (Ritter is one of the best and most reliable, characteristic actors of the period), a woman's former (volatile Kiley) and police department. br /> <br /> Apart from the thematic elements that are spoken of in an exceptionally dramatic journalistic style (as was Fuller's previous position with the boxer), the dialogue is fresh and inclusive. Many Fuller camera movements have spontaneity. And what the third act. This is a lean, dense movie-noir, which is worth looking at even if you are not familiar with Fuller (it is relatively less odd than some of his later works).
