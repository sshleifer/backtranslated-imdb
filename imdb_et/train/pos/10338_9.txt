Norman, is that you? was (it is all with a third hand, so take it with a salt blade), adapted to the Jewish African-American family when it made the transition stage and on the screen. It was also one of the films that were originally filmed on the video, so the publications from the theater were not so big. However, the productions by Redd Foxx and others were pretty good. <br /> <br /> What I wanted to tell you is that the film is PERIOD PIECE: it reflected from the mid-1970s to early attitudes to find out if you have a gay son or daughter in your family. For this reason alone, it is quite interesting - if not a small "Hollywood". Don't believe me? Check the curtains, etc. Very stereotypical. Not too deep. <br /> <br /> But there are a few areas in the movie. Redd Foxx tries to find his wife who escapes with his brother (!) To Ensenada, drowned Pinto. A telephone conversation across the border is really memorable. <br /> <br /> But the best scene in the movie is when Wayland Flowers and Madame did their gay routine, which he did in gay bars and nightclubs. To my knowledge, this is the only time a routine was filmed. And it has a slightly cleaned and much shorter version. However, it is vintage Madame and should not be missed. People are still stealing Wayland's lines; the man was truly talented. Enjoy the movie!
