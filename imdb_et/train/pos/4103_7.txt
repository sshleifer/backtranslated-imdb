The guides of this movie are divided into two categories: smart and stupid. Just enough. <br /> <br /> Jiri Machacek (Standa) plays an unhappy, cunning man who is arrested for a crime he didn't do. When he tries to compensate financially for his evil, former boss, the situation changes. <br /> <br /> While Standa is truly (but amazingly) stupid, her friend Ondrej is an absolute spooky idiot who all sounds and manages to say and do wrong every time. Without Ondrej, Standa can be a way to go through a somewhat modest life. Ondrej, life is never boring, but certainly not without headaches. <br /> <br /> Ivan Trojan plays Zdenek, an evil genius that degenerates into a Hitler-inducing tyrant. Zdenek and his henchmen try to kill Standat so Zdenek's secrets are safe. <br /> <br /> I am very impressed with the high quality and imagination of Czech films. For a relatively small country, the Czech Republic has certainly produced more than its excellent entertainment part. The best Czech movies I've seen are: 1) Game ?? ky and 2) Tmavomodr√Ω Svet (Dark Blue World). When you see these two films, you have seen the absolute best of the Czech cinema.
