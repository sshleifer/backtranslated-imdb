I saw this movie with a similar title called Blockbuster rent, but it had a swear word. <br /> <br /> This movie was funny as hell. It was also true for bone. If you've ever been to or around Hollywood, you will understand humor. If not, you may not get it at all. <br /> <br /> The story of two companies trying to do this until they finally reach a breakpoint is a rare gem. He says it's a drama, but it's the same drama as Deer Hunter is comedy. <br /> <br /> Loren Dean is an excellent, as always, supportive actor. Jamie Kennedy managed to keep her well. His performance is particularly impressive during a tree-like scene. The only drawback was Carmen Electra, but we don't get everything.
