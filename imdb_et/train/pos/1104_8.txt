The film is opened by Bill Coles (Melvyn Douglas), who talks about his best friend - make this customer - Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) and his family are tightly packed in small New York apartments with little room and too little bathroom. When Jimi's wife, Muriel (Myrna Loy), wants to renovate her apartment, the ad loves Jimi's love (or fall!) For advertising the house. When he has bought a house, the bills and the frustration will grow constantly, because everything that might go wrong with building Jimi's "dream house" goes wrong. <br /> <br /> One of the three collaborations between Grant and Loy is this charming little comedy - not very taxable, without a real big message, but a great way to spend an hour or two. The laughs are from the beginning, when the alarm clock goes out and Jim tries to turn it off so that Muriel can stop it at every step. Just a few experienced pros can give the timing and delivery of Comedic lines and situations, and that's what Grant and Loy give us: polished performances, easy chemistry and fun. Myrna Loy is a very ungrateful role (it is obvious that Grant's character Jim gets the lion's share of the lines and the actor, and Grant, as always, pulls out a remarkable aplomb), but gives Muriel a color, life and bite that only Myrna Loy can give character. Melvyn Douglas also plays for perfect amusement, never knocking one false message. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite scenes has definitely come when Bill himself locks into the "store room" and Jim is going to "save" him ... just to keep everyone in! Any small problem that appears in the Blanding renovation project - including the little jealousy and the "Wham" advertising campaign - seems to combine everything that * could go wrong with building a new house, but makes it a credible and enjoyable watch. 8/10
