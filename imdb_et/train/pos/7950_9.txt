First of all, I loved Bruce Broughton's music score, very lyrical, and that alone helped the film's charm. The best aspect of the film was the three animals announced by Michael J. Fox, Sally Field and Late Don Ameche. When Fox has the most funny lines, Ameche plays a rather interesting character (the voice of reason) and Field adds a character to the spirit that is always visible. People were not so tempting and sometimes dragged the film, but that's my only complaint. This is one beautiful movie, beautiful close-ups from Canada, I believe. Though the film itself is quite long, it is never a really dull moment and it is a preferred voice work and a well written script. All in all, it is a charming and perhaps underrated movie, of which 9/10 is about me. Bethany Cox.
