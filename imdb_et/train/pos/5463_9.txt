Very slippery, very pre-hays code, and still very sassy. I highly recommend seeing this movie even if you are not a Stynwyck fan. She's funny, she's sexy, she's hard-working and loves the perm she gets! <br /> <br /> Barbara Stynwyck is fantastic as a cozy person who rises in the world and is perfectly depicted in a bank building. John Wayne plays one of the first conquests. The last three minutes are punches, but the sets, lines, clothes add one film that rises vertically in a horizontal position.
