Famous words by Roman Maron, the owner of the nightclub, "a nervous cork infant," who spends the film not only as a Johnny Dangerous rival, but also English. <br /> <br /> Another undervalued classic that can only be found in the afternoon matinÃ©es or the "Late Late Late Show", Johnny Dangerously is a terrible satirical blow for a good-hearted boy who secretly controls the life of the crime to help pay his mother's medical care and put her brother through a law school. br /> <br /> Yes, there is a story, but who cares? Joe Piscopo, Dom DeLuise, Marilu Henner, and Alan Hale Jr. are waiting for you to see what will happen next. <br /> <br /> There are too many laughs here. Like an airplane, you need to pay attention or leave something behind. Highly recommended for anyone who can laugh or two!
