This is a good show and I find it funny. Finally, the bad Latin stereotypes are over! Ac Gracias, Se√±or Lopez! I love this example and started watching it about three months ago. The whole concept of a TV show for the Latin family surprised me very much. I'm surprised that the Latin people are finally on television. This exhibition is probably one of the best I've seen, it's funny, affectionate, nice and nice.
