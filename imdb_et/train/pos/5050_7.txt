We really enjoyed Gray Owl: a simple story that is well talked about in the classic Attenborough fashion: a little over-romantic, archetypal, humor and dignity and values. <br /> <br /> Nice shot and nice pace, this is the real story of the English Archie from India who went to live and trap in Canada. <br /> <br /> Due to all solid occurrences, this film is easily visible. <br /> <br /> Two movie stars are undoubtedly the sweetest we've ever seen - and the message has good ecological qualities. In the 1930s, it is good to meet or read Gray Owl, which is a unique character and is an appropriate film tribute.
