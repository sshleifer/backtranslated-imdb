This film was an interesting cast, this mat was not on the list, but the participants in the film did a good job. I am happy that we have such b-class movies, this story is basic, because the actors are basic and so are the way they do it, you don't need a million dollar budget to make a movie just for the regular b-list . I like the way they had the street and that there was no one else or what I was interested in, that they did not close the cafe to go there and that they did it all at the police station. Arnold Vosloo and Michael madsen did an excellent job of portraying a hostage in a situation. It was a great movie and I hope we will see more in the near future.
