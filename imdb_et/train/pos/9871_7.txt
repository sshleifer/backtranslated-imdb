The return to the lost world was filmed upside down with the lost world version of 1992. <br /> <br /> In this order, the same five people who Challenger returns to the plateau where the group has started drilling oil, threatening to destroy the land. Gomez has something to do with it. They manage to break down the drills and the plateau is saved, with many natives joy. <br /> <br /> As with the lost world, some dinosaurs are made of rubber and contain T-Rex and Ankylosaurus. <br /> <br /> John Ryhs-Davies and David Warner repeat their roles, like Challenger and Summerlee, and three other actors are back. <br /> <br /> Despite reading a lot of bad comments about it and looking for these cheap dinosaurs, I enjoyed the lost world. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
