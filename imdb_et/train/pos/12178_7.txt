I think this movie got a low rating because it was rated at the worst moments. There is a joke of diarrhea and embarrassing walnut scratching, but in addition there are very few moments that made me laugh out loud. Jason Lee performs wonderfully subtle comedy in this movie and Julia Stiles succeeds to be pretty funny. In addition, like most romantic comedies, this film takes about 40 minutes to know how it ends. (What's better than most of those who already know +/- 5 minutes later). Anyway, better watching movies, but certainly not the worst choice ... Cheers
