(SPOILERS IN THE FIRST PARAGRAPHY) The anti-German sensitivity of this film now seems painful, but it is a great example of great war propaganda. It was back when Cecil B. DeMille was still a big director. (Ignore all his best best Academy awards; he never made a very good soundtrack.) This film lacks the comedy of most of Pickford's other films, and it was really a DeMille film, not a Pickford movie. German fertilization can be compared to "The Patriot" in 2000. The only good German language was the reluctant villain who had the ironic name of Austraim. They even had Pickford take a failed trip on a luxury ship torpedoed by a German submarine. What can Americans do more about war? Lusitania drowning or sinking America's favorite Canadian import? Throughout the film, DeMille directs his protagonist from one terrible accident to another, barely escaping death, hypothermia, misery, rape, execution and explosions that remain in the right place to keep him intact. The way he is rescued from the rescue industry is no longer believable as a way for people to escape faster in Jurassic Park. If I were more sensitive to such propaganda, I would punish myself for partial German ancestors. <br /> <br /> Was that a good movie? Apart from the humorous gagger of the alien aliens, do they think they are inviolable? it was probably joking even then? You may not be entertained. You'll find it more than a little melodramatic and obviously one-sided, but the first thing I thought was after that was that it was years before Potemkin's misrepresentation of the massacre changed the cinema language as well as the potential of film propaganda. It made me wonder: what got Cecil B. DeMille? Somewhere between sound coming and "The Greatest Show on Earth" he had lost his ambition. Ben Hur seemed expensive but not ambitious. In one sentence, this film is 1) for film historians, 2) for silent movie buffs, 3) for Mary Pickford fans, or 4) for DeMille fans, if such a person exists.
