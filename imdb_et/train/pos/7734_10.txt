I saw this movie a few years ago and I have to say that I really love it. Jason Patric was the perfect strange role he played. Director? The scenario is good, it is for sure. With this couple of words I have to say about the movie that is weird, strange, even dark, but that's good. I saw it a few years ago and never saw it I want to see it over and over again. I know I won't get sick of it. Scenes, atmosphere, actors, story ... everything is fine. Video should be longer I think 120 minutes should have been perfect. I was hoping for Part 2 of this movie. Bad bad it didn't happen. Jason Patric: You're the man! very good movie. end. :-)
