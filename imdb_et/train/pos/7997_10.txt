It is by far one of the best-made films and will not disappoint me at all. The soundtrack with fine camera work was subtle. It is always likely that the film will not hold both beliefs and the other, but I felt that the rhythm and timing of this picture were excellent. Dakota Fanning is quickly becoming a film that needs a child of old soul, and she is never disappointed with her efforts. As far as Mr Washington and, of course, Christopher Walken are concerned, both of them overcome the challenge of showing the darker sides of humanity that are trying to move towards light.
