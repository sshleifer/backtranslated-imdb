First of all, I would just like to say that this movie is more toned than any last nonsense that Hollywood has cooked out of its gut. McBain is a real action film with more violence than most viewers. It has all the classic elements of the early 80s / early 90s .... random casual acts of violence (ie when Walken and the team go against the drug dealers to get the money they just show and kill) instead of letting them live and just take money), necklaces, fires boys, buildings blown away boys and of course fires that blow out the buildings. Walken is the best in this picture, offering memorable features such as "go sit .......... deck." and others that make this movie from a local video store for the top purchase of clearing rack. if you have bleeding for unnecessary casual acts of violence, rent this movie today and satisfy your thirst.
