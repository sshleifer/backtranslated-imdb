I think many people just wrote it out as the other Tom Cruise movies (Magnolia, Eyes Wide Shut), but Vanilla Sky is definitely her movie. Many people said it was strange; it wasn't. It was different and confusing, but not strange. Strange is Stanley Kubrick or Pauly Shore. The Truman show is different. The matrix or the game is confusing. And unlike Kubrick, this film has a conclusion. Everything is reasonable - maybe not right now, maybe not even nowadays, but that's reasonable. Vanilla Sky is confusing because David Aames (Tom Cruise) is confused. That's the thing. From there came a so-called "weird" that turned the critics away. If they had bothered to "open their eyes" like the original Spanish film, they would have seen it. And if that's not a good reason to see it, watch it for music. Cameron Crowe offers an excellent soundtrack; he uses it to determine the "feeling" - the infamous element that many movies lack. With songs such as The Beach Boys' Good Vibrations, which play on the dramatic and emotional tip of the film, it creates an amazing but amazingly "true" feeling. Beautiful movie, with its script, music, actors and pictures, Vanilla Sky is, unfortunately, a superficial commercial film that is attracted by critics. Excellent: A +
