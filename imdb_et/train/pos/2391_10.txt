My husband and I like The DoodleBops as much as our 8 month old child. We've bought him a DVD and CDs so we can watch and listen to them. They are fun, energetic and very fun. They encourage children to be active, sharing and caring. They always have a positive message with fun entertainment. Every time our son hears a thematic song, he quickly turns to the television and starts to bounce. Dee Dee is a great singer, she has a great voice. Fashion is a great dancer. I recommend The DoodleBops to all people with children. Our favorite song is The Bird Song. You just can't help but smile and want to dance when you hear it.
