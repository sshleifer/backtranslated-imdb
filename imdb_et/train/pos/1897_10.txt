Again, it seems to me at least completely illogical that "Arthur" deserves just 6.4 out of ten possible. The one-time masterpiece of Steve Gordon is completely "unlikely" here, if not "impossible" from a ferocious element. The fact that he managed to make alcoholism ridiculous, not tragic, is in itself wonderful. The fact that he gave Dudley Moore his best role and every other cinematic element here, which is his optimal effect, including the score, seems to me a patent and a threatening one. I'm challenging ANYone to sit through this movie and not laugh out loud. But probably about a third of this audience has managed so. Well, I found one and found Gordon's efforts as both ridiculous and lovable, and the Geraldine Fitzgerald's aunt's aunt and the absolute precious stones of Stephen Elliott's murderous father-in-law. Even the black driver managed to escape from patronage and late, the scandalous Sir John Gielgud was right to accept his charge, but was wrong in his role. "Arthur" does not make efforts to "Underztand", "much less rationalize", "alcoholism" scourge (hey, iFit is not well, this is another option, including met, and addictions are just symptoms, not targets), just observes its horrible.
