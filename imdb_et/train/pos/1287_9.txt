"Let's Bowl" began with local TVs in Twin Cities. It came late in the night, something you stumbled upon, after channeling Hamm's seventh bottle. <br /> <br /> Even ads were produced locally, presenting Wally outside the Grumpy bar, holding the microphone and nervously nervous - "Ahh ... to you, Steve Sedahl." Not sure why, but it always made me laugh. <br /> <br /> There were two bowling competitions during bowling, but the game was next to comments and clips. Sedahl played it directly, balancing Rich Kronfeld's strange and fun "Wally Hotvedt". Highlights included segments such as "Disposal of the Old Kickman" (cast them into the lake) and "Tips for dating", where the duo "pairs" a couple of whores and Wally ends with a bitter complaint, "I could have done it myself!" <br /> <br / > The second segment - what the duo did in those days - was Steve's beer, which could gently glow, pulling out of the cold chamber, but Wally tried to climb the rocks on Taylor Falls. pale blue blazer and oversized headphones. Fun! <br /> <br /> Wally's astounding comments on "too bowler" and his struggle to apply the right euphemism to the various splits were also highlighted. <br /> <br /> "Let's Bowl" took Comedy Central and had good moments, but the network never knew what to do with it, run it during good times and highlighted the bowling competition that was never the point of the show. Constant ads interrupted the stream and the side signs (Ernie, Pig, Butch, etc.) were more disturbing than anything else. The whole thing seemed rushed and forced. Even Jon Stewart broke down at Let's Bowl's daily exhibition - (not enough flat, sniffing jokes?) - a terrifying treatment for an exhibition that has earned much better. Come into the world of modern television, blended with the local flavor of the comic genius and complete nonsense? Networks have a "complete nonsense" part of the cold, but it's a sad thing to watch them kill so dark, strange, funny little pearls like "Let's Bowl". <br /> <br /> We hope they will put it on the DVD.
