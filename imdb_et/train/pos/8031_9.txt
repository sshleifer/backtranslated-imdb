This is one of the military dramas I really like! Tom Berenger plays a military assassin, Thomas Beckett. This sea area is not your face, and no questions have been asked about the person who does the job. Here is Billy Zane ("The Phantom" and others), who plays the former SWAT form Richard Miller, works on behalf of the government and only takes orders from them. Who needs a bureaucrat? I do not! If these two are mated, sparks should fly. And how. But Beckett teaches young bureaucrats how it works. When other snipers hit, it makes sense vs. enjoyable, cat vs mouse, gunman vs. weaponry. And when the flavored sniper is caught, Miller's task is to put the policy aside and save him. Who needs politics, if you are a Beckett-like sample, he did not accept anyone but himself, plays the rules, not the book, and mutual respect is outlined in politics. The film was a direct hit. Look out. Rated 4 out of 5 stars.
