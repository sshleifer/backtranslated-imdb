I think you should be from the US to get a lot of fun. But if you liked Princess Bride and Forest Gump, you would like this movie. You cannot, of course, compare the quality of filming with them, but the path of the operator is obviously done for purpose. Killer Tomatoes is a hundred times better than the Nepom dynamite. Just my opinion. I'm sure the French people wouldn't appreciate the French cartoons. So this movie is not for the world audience. And although I'm not a trained film critic, I know what I like. I couldn't laugh at the whole movie. My sides and jaws had hurt at the end of the film.
