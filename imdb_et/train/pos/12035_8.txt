I recently hit this movie in TNT for five minutes, while on vacation in Florida ... (Hey, there must be some time in the hotel, right?) I was initially surprised to see Melissa Joan Hart in any length of features film on TNT. I mean, "Drive Me Crazy" is not old, is it? <br /> <br /> But I stuck to it and was surprised and entertained. Melissa plays her role as a psychotic Jennifer. Supporting cast (Nick, a former boyfriend; Karen, his best friend and his life-controlling parents) added great credibility. The end result was a nice closing of this girl's story, who always seemed to be a step ahead of everyone. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance, look at it! <br /> <br />
