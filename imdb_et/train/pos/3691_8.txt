The collection doesn't even go close to the amount of parts. No problem. This film has some of the most diverse creative leaders of our time and some truly renowned names. The segments are designed around the same theme, "Love in Paris," but the similarity ends there. In fact, given that the approach of all these different directors to the theme takes so many forms, it is amazing that we even feel that we are still watching the same movie. No major efforts have been made to make it a complete entity. This buffet contains so many great ingredients, I'm glad nobody tried to put them all in one cup.
