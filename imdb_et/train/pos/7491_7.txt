Years ago I found a copy of this "bonus table" for two or two. In so many ways, it is quite appropriate, because when it was made back in 1933, it was really a cheaper film in the "poverty line" studio Majestic. Although the film is rather a derivative, it is worth seeing STILL and offers some surprises. <br /> <br /> The story is very familiar, as in some German cities, people are disturbed by some recent deaths that seem to be vampire work! Adding such acquaintance is Dwight Frye. He played at Drfield at Renfield and here he is very, very similar - although he plays a lot of harmless strange. In this case, he is obsessed with the bats of his pets and people will accuse him of death. The film does a good job of offering some "red herring" (ie wrong references), and although it doesn't understand genius, Frye may not be responsible, WHO and MIKS are intriguing and make them very different. average horror movie. In addition, although there was little money to talk about the production, there were still good actors on that day - Lionel Atwill and Melvin Douglas - and it also used Universal Studios sets at night (when they made the day's filming). As a result, the film looks pretty good overall, though I also thought that, as usual, Fay Wray was terrible - he thought it didn't dramatically reduce the film. I've seen him in more films than most IMDb people, and I've noticed that his characters are not deep - he always seems to be cast as a "screaming lady" and gives little to each film. <br /> <br /> Generally, fans of old horror movies are great and worth it. For people who aren't fans of the genre, it's probably quite impossible.
