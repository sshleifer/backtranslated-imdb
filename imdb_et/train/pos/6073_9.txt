My college professor says Othello may be Shakespeare's best drama. I don't know if I still agree with him. I bought the movie in this video version. First of all, I love Kenneth BRanaghit Iago, he was completely complicated and worked very well in this adaptation. Surprisingly, he did not manage it, but played a role. Lawrence Fishburne shows that American actors can play Shakespeare as well as British actors. is not that there was a British vs American issue. In fact, when we work together, Shakespeare can reach the masses he deserves abundantly. In addition to other Shakespeare tragedies, it is also a race issue. Something that has been since the beginning of time. The relationship between Iago and Emilia could have been better and show the complexity of their union. Although Othello loves Desdemon with all his heart, he is weak for jealousy and fears that lose him to the Moorish like Cassio. At the end of the movie, this is a pretty big scene, but I don't finish. It's just worth it. I think they made many lines for 2 hours, but they always change Shakespeare.
