Okay, this exhibition is nothing more than AWESOME! It has a great story and a plot and great actors and actors. Jeremy Sumpter is so hottest and he's fit for that role! He's great in Hollywood. He has a bright future for the future! It will take a long time because I really love this example and hope it is very successful! It's so interesting. I've been waiting for this for about 6 or 7 months and it's finally here and it's great! I also tape it. I can always watch it when I want it! Too bad is only once a week. I wish it would be at least twice a week, because now I want it to be Tuesday every day! Hope you like this show! Ashley ~
