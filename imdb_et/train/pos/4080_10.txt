This is one of the best animated family pictures of all time. Moreover, almost all the serious competitors of this title came to the same creative mind with Hiyao Miyazaki and his studio Ghibli. More specifically, other big films include "My Neighbor Totoro" and "Kikki Delivery Service". Spiritual Away is pretty good, but a bit too horrible for a typical family vacation - better for teens and adults. One of the things that set "Laputa: Heaven Castle" apart from other Miyazaki films is that it is much more energized, adventurous. <br /> <br /> Why is this movie so good? Because it is a complete package: animation is very well done and the story is really interesting and weighty. and animation itself is often nervous, stylized and underage. None of these problems break the castle sky. It has the imagination to burn and the characters are well-drawn as slightly exaggerated versions of realistic people. (None of the ditches that carry the carriers) There is not much adventure but no blood and gore. Animation is a smooth, detailed and cinematic ally - not many flat frames. The backgrounds are great. The sound engineer is also great. Use your studio sound when you have it. <br /> <br /> One particular aspect I particularly enjoyed is that much of the back attack is unexplained. The foliage was once inhabited and is now abandoned. Why? We never know. We know as much as we need to know, and then we just have to accept the rest that is easy to do because the invented world is so fully realized. Indeed, it is fair to say that the world is better realized than most minor characters, which are mostly one-dimensional stock characters (eg fluffy general, silly sidekick, kooky old miner, etc.). For people aged 6 to 60!
