Since there was only a toddler when this show was originally aired I just recently picked up a DVD set and wish there were more episodes filmed. This exhibition was the 90's "X-Files" version of the poplular 90s, but a bit more comic / light-hearted. But don't get me wrong, some of these episodes are full of horror themes, many of which have some pretty bad plots (of course, this is left to imagination - it was the early 70s). <br /> <br /> Some plots with a bit of a fool as well as an actress, but this is the charm and attraction of this series. Whether you like the mystery of crimes, comedies or sci-fi / horror issues, this series brought everything together. Every episode took about 50 minutes (1 hour with the ad) and after 50 minutes I always leave more. A great classic show that is underestimated in my book!
