In fact, this film has stupid moments for Claymation as well as Joe Pesc and children, and it is much worse than other MJ movies like "The Wiz", "Captain Eo" and "Ghosts". But like almost a hard Michael Jackson fan, for almost eleven years, (Yes, it's half my life, you!), I can't complain about it too much. This lovely boy's sight and listening to his great music is a trip to Heaven for me. But if it's a movie, it's not good at all, and I'm afraid it would get a much lower grade for me than my dear Mike would be in that starring. But because no one, but Mike is not a moonwalker, he's got to get from 7 out of 10.
