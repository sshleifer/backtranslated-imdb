I loved this movie. It was so well done! Great functioning and drama and historically accurate. I love Romy Schneider's movies. It's rocks that aren't as big as Sissi, but still stones! <br /> <br /> And Scorpiolina commented and said French duplication. Well this is originally a German film, not a French language. Yes, yes. Secondly, there was a plot, maybe your history didn't know. Oh and his mother played part of their ruler, not his teacher. And the story wasn't really Cinderella, but Queen Victoria, maybe u missed that detail. <br /> <br /> But still .... the history of this movie is great, I love historical movies and Queen Victoria is very exciting! I love all the historical things. Like the man who tried to manipulate his mother. And when he ran away and met his future husband, he showed him a "new type of dance". When waltzing was new, it was considered scandalous because couples dance so close. Yes, his ruler was like my god! <br /> <br /> And clothes, I love clothes. Styles are great, hoop skirts are awesome. And of course Romy always looks very beautiful.
