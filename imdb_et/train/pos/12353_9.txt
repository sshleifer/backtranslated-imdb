Tragically wonderful movie ... takes us to Japan, which no longer exists. Despite Hollywood's technical experience, I have not yet seen a (Hollywood) movie that fits this small town's atmosphere right by the sea by the river. Tom Cruise's last samurai felt a nice last part of the Rings that are trying to capture the rural old Japan. <br /> <br /> If you like a calm but intense story, it must be a movie. It is relaxing with hollow flashy films that resemble the last 1000 blockers. I think it's one of Kurosawa's better stories. <br /> <br /> Even when it comes to film gay men and brothels and complicated rules that regulate life in such conditions, it didn't become a skin color. The characters are full of depth and operate at high intensity.
