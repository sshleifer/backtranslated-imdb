Like a person who has lived in the brain palsey for more than forty years, I find this film inspiring. If someone with such a severe CP case as Christie Brown can do this, there is no reason I couldn't achieve my dreams. Daniel Day-Lewis and Brenda Fricker both give fantastic performances. <br /> <br />
