Don't listen to this movie about many acerbic and unnatural comments ..... just to say, about ninja movies it's my friends as good as it gets! Yes, it's silly, yes, if the actor and script are definitely cruel, but by gums - it's so much bloody fun! In fact, as is often the case with B-Movies, the terrible “acting” (which is really the worst thing I've ever seen before in this movie) and the ridiculous “plot” actually only raises the level of enjoyment ten times. <br /> <br /> Probably the fighting scenes are its main attraction and for the most part I'm glad to say that they are very choreographed, especially the final showdown (during which we feel that the ninja is not seemingly restricted by conventional gravity laws ... .) <br /> <br /> Trust me if you are a fan of ninja movies and you haven't seen Sakura Killers yet, you really have lost what I think is true of the genre of crowns.
