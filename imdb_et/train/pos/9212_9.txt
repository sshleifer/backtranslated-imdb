Yesterday I went to the cinema alone, because here in Mexico most films from other countries are part of the so-called "cam√°ra alternativa" (alternative camera). But after seeing this movie, I realized that not all foreign films are alternative. Unfortunately, this is a good example. But I have to say that I enjoyed so much of this movie .. that eventually I was happy .. this movie these days is a little spoon of hope. And the main lesson for me is that at the end of the day ... love is the main force behind us. It's a good way to see a good movie in Spanish ... and I have to mention good music .. specially for the main song of the movie. !!
