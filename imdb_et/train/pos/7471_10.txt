Despite Vanilla Sky's excellent trailers, I waited for the film's disappointment because I heard it didn't get great comments. But I left the cinema completely frightening when the vanilla sky is good. <br /> <br /> There was no bad behavior at all in the movie, every single character is plausible. Romantic moments between the character of Cruise, David Aames and the character of Cruz, Sophia is tactically truly realistic and intimate (probably due to the fact that they were soon-actual pair). <br /> <br /> The Vanilla Sky plot mixes you in the last third of the movie and you have very little chance of ending it. However, the end results are over, leaving you with a strange mix of feelings of sadness, shock and empathy for David Aames. <br /> <br /> The film is intellectual and you have to pay attention. It's not that difficult, because it's likely that you can pull in the movie completely and won't take your eyes off the screen in one second. <br /> <br /> I usually forget about cinemas. a movie I just watch. But in my opinion, Vanilla Sky has been watching it after a day. I recommend it to anyone who wants to change from simple low films.
