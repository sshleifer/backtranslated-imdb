This is one of my favorites with Mariette Hartley and Robert Lansing's "Sandy" and Agnes Moorhead and tiny spaces with episodes. <br /> <br /> This is an important step since mid-1961, during a long Cold War, when the United States then came in. A runaway city picture, a rare dialogue of almost starving characters, their coarse uniforms and minimal action "says": a conflict that threatens to destroy human life, modern civilization and everything that is sweet and redeem it. <br /> <br /> This is a "fabel" because it was made at a time when events appeared differently, like the second Berlin crisis (spring 1961) and the subsequent Cuban missile crisis (October 1962), it would have been The USA is one of the largest cities in a reasonable representation, ruined and filled with some unhappy survivors. I also see it as a "fable" because it is not just a deterrent, but because it is the most popular of all our popular myths: it is a love story that is placed as an impossible situation and involves two very inappropriate lovers.
