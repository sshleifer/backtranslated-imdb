As the film would not be valuable in itself, it is a great opportunity to get a glimpse of the novel as a foreword to its reading. In the summer of 1968, I saw a movie in NYC; what goes into postgraduate study I read the book for the first time. The joy of reading a novel was my memory of exactly a detailed film. And for the better or worse - and I've read and taught the novel for over three decades - Milo O'Shea is still Leopold Bloom.
