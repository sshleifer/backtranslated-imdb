This is one of those movies / pilots that if you knew BattleStar Galactica, it does, but is not necessary. What makes the BSG story even more plausible is that it is not so far in the future. It is so deep that it is quite amazing that it wasn't published in a theatrical way. These experienced and fairly talented participants could not be better chosen. Eric Stoltz is great as a father who does something to be able to reunite with his daughter, though it is real or not. Paula Malcomson's "Deadwood" fame is also her husband's terrible. You are not entirely sure of his motives, whether it is love or money, or both, but it makes this pilot even more interesting. I see the letters of Zoe, played by the relatively unknown Alessandra Torresan & his performance. Esai Morales is terrible in his desire to see his beloved person again and how wrong it is to consider what he wants more than his moral objections. I didn't think it would be a good idea when it was announced, but just a pilot that I'm happy to see how we got the BSG stage. It is nice to see that Adama is a child who is already influenced and influenced by the different types of robots that are going through life at this stage. I just hope they can keep track of the stories so we can understand more about how they got Humanoid-printed robots. It is an almost perfect pilot and I hope they can continue their fantastic storytelling. Even visual effects are better than most of the garbage on the big screen. If you have not entered the BSG, try at least to try it and I bet you will become a fan and want to see how the BSG story came.
