ZP is deeply involved with the dream of young people represented by the hippie movement. The College's discussion at the beginning of the film shows the cultural situation that arises from its movement. Daria is an explosion that represents the decline of all social structures, and thus the development of all the great change that society is suffering and finally Mark's death requires an end to what A sees movement for himself. The film becomes easier to understand when we go back to this life. In the '60s and' 70s, young people were the driving force behind in-depth research into change. One of the most important changes to remove sexuality from the closet, and I think the scenes in the desert are not an orgy, but the sexual relationship that men and women in absolute freedom perform in a hypothetical situation where no one would hide. I watched a scene where couples threw sand at each other and appreciated the excellent way A depicted the impossibility of continuing to hide this basic human instinct. Repression was the way to manage social outbreaks by that time, and this is a method where the police seek to stop students. This society suffers from a hypocrisy and it occurs when students gain access to weapons that skip all counterfeit controls. A dialogue with a police officer and a college professor, who has been detained for some reason, shows some of this youth's feeling and partly of a society of interest. Playing flying as a more accurate symbol of freedom, stealing an airplane from Mark's inner desire, but showing (returning or returning or returning) the difficulties that must be released from these bonds, and as I said, A depicting the death of a dream because of the difficulties that won the game. I think the movie is memorable.
