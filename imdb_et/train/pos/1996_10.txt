Simply put, Oliver! are the greatest musicals of all time. It's full of memorable songs - "Food Glorious Food", "Oliver!", "Think for Yourself" and "Oom-Pah-Pah" to name just a few - and the same memorable characters. <br /> <br /> The film is a musical customization of Charles Dickens' classic novel and a similar story of Oliver Twist, a perfect family film. There are some frightening moments - Oliver Reed's villain Bill Sykes is scary enough in itself, but generally the film is appealing to children and adults of all ages. <br /> <br /> The story - almost all of which is now well known - revolves around the little orphan Oliver and his life is growing in London. First he lives with the orphans of the rest of his colleagues, but after the courage to ask Mr. Bumble, the supervisor, he is sold to the family as a servant. <br /> <br /> Close-up shaving, he meets Artful Dodger - a great game by young Jack Wild, who gives all his role - and through him, greedy Fagin (Ron Moody), who trains young boys to pick pocket treasures what he keeps <br /> <br /> The film was filmed only in the studio and in the sound centers of Shepperton Film Studios, but it doesn't change the film at all. Sets replicate completely Victorian London, as well as character-bearing costumes. Multiple Oscar winner and tremendous success in unlocking it, Oliver! is always the best musical winner and delights anyone who loves the movie.
