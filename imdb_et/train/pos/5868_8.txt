I loved this movie. It is rare to get a glimpse of post-partum in Vietnam, and this film-sans fight scenes and exciting bombs and fire-made it. I had no idea it would work that way. What an amazing look at how foreigners read. Frankly, it was hard to see. We all understand fighting and now drama, but it is so different. What happens when they come back and try to live? They can't. It made me very aware of a large number of men who have disappeared in America. Can't relate, can't sleep, can't be loved, can't deal with "normal society". They feel completely separate. This is a huge tragedy and it is not enough. Yes, we have changed our attitude towards Vietnamese veterans, we like them, but what? It doesn't seem to have changed anything for them. Is it too late? So it was a great movie, but I called a lot. I have no other criticism.
