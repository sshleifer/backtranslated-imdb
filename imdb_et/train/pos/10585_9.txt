Footlight Parade is one of the best extravagant music comedy of the 1930s. This movie is a fun script and all the stars including Jimmy Cagney, Cute Joan Blondell, Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler. This film is directed and choreographed by the creative genius Busby Berkeley, which begins to cheer up from ear to ear. <br /> <br /> Busby is, of course, Hollywood's undeniable "Gold Diggers 1933" and "42nd Street" for its credit (such as Dance Director). Footlight Parade is decorated with hundreds of little hidden choir girls, the Berkeley brand. The worked dance numbers were shot with only one camera and Busby was the first director to film the close-ups of the dancers. His obsession with formal legs and "rear view" is well shown here. The overall effect is very erotic and mesmerizing. Our boyfriend, Jimmy Cagney, plays Chester Kent, a prologue producer or a short musical performance featured in the cinema to listen to entertainment. shown. He is surrounded by curved partners, corporate spy and gold-digging girlfriends. Although Cagney had a strong background in vaudeville, it was the first film she showed her dance talents. Joan Blondell is memorable as Cagney's clever secretary. Ruby Keeler is divine, as always. <br /> <br /> The film features three prominent product numbers: "Honeymoon Hotel", "The Waterfall" and "Shanghai Lil", each of which is a masterpiece and probably not duplicated in today's Hollywood, where "special effects" have replaced creative cinematography. <br /> <br /> Claudia's bottom line: Smart and erotic, some of the best music numbers ever put on celluloid. A thoroughly enjoyable depression.
