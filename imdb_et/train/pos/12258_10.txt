Jane Austen Emma is an extremely enjoyable story at the worst time and this story is the best I've ever seen. Kake Beckinsale's Emma is impeccable. Gwyneth Paltrow (with good scenario and excellent cinematography) is able to bring out comedy effectively, she does not make Emma pleasant. Paltrow is not helped by the fact that her hairstyle is just "wrong" for this part (and I believe it is time) and she looks sick sick in empire line dresses. In contrast, Kate Beckinsale manages the comedy effortlessly and can still show what Mr Knightly (the most romantic Jane Austen heroes) actually sees. Mark Strong is a wonderful Mr Knightly, who has the right combination of beautiful looks, age, knighthood, compassion and gentle behavior. Emma and Mr Knight are supported by good actors and production as a whole is quite pleasant.
