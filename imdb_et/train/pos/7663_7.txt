As a rule, the full moon production logo is a warning sign to avoid the film. But since I've enjoyed Jeffrey Combs in other movies, I gave it off. <br /> <br /> It's not bad. Not big, but it's something else. The film involves fighting a mysterious "brother" who wants to dominate the worlds and the nature of the title. Dr Mordrid must also deal with people and authorities in the daily world he is successfully doing. <br /> <br /> Possible spoilers follow. <br /> <br /> Dr. Morders can move between "dimensions" and do so to find the guard of the fortress; but the guard is blinded. His eyes are ruined wells. So wizard hands over other eyes and hey, presto! Her eyes are restored! This improvement probably only works with the eyes. <br /> <br /> Later, Mordred and his "brother" live a few bones in a museum to fight. Guess which one will win. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the picture is not bad at all, even though it is like a comic book. Dr Mordred's more "human" adventures are in order and the combs play a convincing role. <br /> <br /> I've seen much worse.
