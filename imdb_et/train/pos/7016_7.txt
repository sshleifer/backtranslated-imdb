Although I understand what someone has to say about this movie, I found it to be absolutely amazing. It concerns you and if your critic does not look deeply into the mistakes and disturbances of each film, or just doesn't touch anything, it's worth seeing. Don't come to a movie that is waiting for something, but let the box and your mind open. It's beautiful and the actor is great. I think Will Smith, despite being another lonely depressed person, is amazing. I believe that a good actor is someone who can truly portray the feelings and emotions that we all have with our worst / best experiences, so that it reaches you and does something for you. And that's exactly what this movie does. Give her a chance.
