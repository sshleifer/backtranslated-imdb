All dogs go to heaven is an animated child's film, like no other. Gambling, drinking, death, guns and hell are all prominent on the plot, and although the children get very little of it, adults can scratch their heads, why this film was like a gangster movie. The actual film is not explicit, it's just a strange combination to make a child's movie. <br /> <br /> Charlie Barkin (Burt Reynolds) is a player who owns half of the casino Pind (Vic Tayback) with his partner. After drunk (dog .... drunk ... in child's movie. It just sounds weird), Charlie is cheating and murdering Carfax. When in heaven he finds he can come back to Earth, but he is no longer allowed in heaven. He goes back to Earth and meets his old friend Itchy (Dom Deluise) and plans Carfax's profitability. Meanwhile, Carfax has a little orphan Anne Marie, who is in captivity because she has the amazing ability to talk to all animal species that helps predict the race. Charlie and Itchy release her and try to help her find a family by learning a lot about herself. Children enjoy funny characters and animated animation, while adults can enjoy a nice, sweet plot and more than the usual advanced characters. One thing that keeps it is that it is musical. This is usually a good thing, but the music here is honestly terrible. They tend to jump around, almost ad libbed, no instrumental support. In fact, these are probably the worst songs I've ever heard in an animated movie, but fortunately the rest of the movie is strong enough not to degrade due to some bad comments. <br /> <br /> At the end, this movie works, but I hate it honestly. It's sad, but happy, but sader than happy, and makes the movie feel like it needs a sequel. Given how bad the subsequent order was, I would like the end not to be a sequel and it would have provided a nice, super happy ending. This is one of the few movies I know, but I do it. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a nice family film whose odd themes are thrown away, but still a good entertainment. <br /> My rating: *** out ****. 85 minutes.
