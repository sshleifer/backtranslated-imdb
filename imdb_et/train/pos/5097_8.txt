This is a very rare film and probably the least known of Shirley Temple because it is not in any of his collections. The reason is probably because he doesn't have a happy ending, unlike any other film. musical, although he wears one song called "The world owes me life". The film was made in 1934 and originally it was black and white, the version i is colorful and, in the case of VHS, I would say that they have done a good job of color is realistic, unlike I would say that Laurel And Hardy painted films that are terrible. The film is good for its age and the story is not out of date, I am surprised that no one has tried At the time when the film is a bit of a talk, because some of the scenes with Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard really seem to be out of the way, in some scenes they seem to take fifteen minutes to tell what they could say five. don't push it down because this movie has some really good moments, especially when {Jerry} Ga ry Cooper steals the necklace and hides the Shirley teddy bear. Tensions and slow structure for your actions, {while his daughter is singing another room for the audience}, is very well managed. facial expressions, if checked, are also very good. All this is a good movie from the early 1930s, accept it for your age.
