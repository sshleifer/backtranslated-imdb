<br /> <br /> I've seen this movie many times. At least a dozen. But unfortunately not recently. While my memory doesn't leave me, Mickey Rooney - "Killer Mears" - is unaware that he must be executed and that it goes to the point of truth, he dances and crys, laughs, euphoria is released from Hilleria and runs the gambit of emotions. Never have I seen such a brilliant performance by any living or dead actor, past or present. It was then I know that Mickey Rooney, yes, "Andy Hardy" was and is a great gene actor. But I kept it, my opinion for years, I definitely have to be in this position alone. About 15 years after I last saw this movie on television, I began reading the old Q&A part of the Los Angeles Times. The question was asked to Lawrence Olivier and the question was: "Mr. Olivier Are you considered to be the greatest actors of all time, who you consider to be among the biggest players?" His answer was: "Peter Finch and Mickey Rooney" I was stunned but not surprised. I immediately returned to my "Killer Mears" and I felt very good that I have seen this great ability for him, and now having my position supported by another who work I admire. ga. All actors should see this movie "The Last Mile". I do not remember honestly the film after all these years, but Mr Rooney never leaves me. If anyone out there remembers this movie just like me? I would be interested in you. For this picture, which has only been etched in my heart, I gave it to 10 just in his performance.
