Curly Sue is a 6-year-old with a lot of hair and life as a dreamer. He and his father Bill (Jim Belushi) are trying to survive on the streets, being artists of a small time. In Chicago, Bill decides to jump into an expensive car park while Curly screams at court sessions and traction for the planned victim. It happens to be a very highly qualified lawyer, Gray (Kelly Lynch), who is terribly outraged by what he has done. Scammers not only make money, they can spend the night Gray asked in the apartment. Even when Gray feels that he owes them more, three of them talk together. Gray knows only lucrative law and something about life. Who better to teach than Bill and Curly, those living environment experts who are dealing with the reality of life? But all the good things must end and there is no life for a legal expert and a couple of men. Or is it? It's a sweet and funny movie about the unexpected. Curly is definitely as much fun as the Shirley Temple, but of course it's a lot edgier. Belushi gives a rare touch because his success and Lynch are bright as a slick but soft touch lawyer. John Hughes, writer and director, once again shows us his magical touch, because the script is lively and unpredictable. Just look at Curly and Bill take Gray out for the night without money and see humorous results. Are you long happy endless, long time allowed and the end result? This is the movie you ordered.
