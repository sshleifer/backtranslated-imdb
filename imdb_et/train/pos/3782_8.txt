When I was a kid, I loved both Bill & Tedi movies. One night Bogus Journey was on and because it had been at least five years after that, I decided to tune. AND I loved it everywhere! This movie is still funny after those years. "Great adventure" is better, but it's the same. Of course, some perfomans are a bit fine, but hey, all this movie is cool. In addition, the film is the coolest person. In conclusion: Completely like a fake movie guy! Way Excellent! STATION!
