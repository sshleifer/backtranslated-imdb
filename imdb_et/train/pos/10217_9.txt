Shaking the wings of the Atlantic butterflies can trigger a hurricane in the Pacific. According to this theory (somehow related to the chaos theory, I'm not exactly sure how), every action, no matter how small or irrelevant, starts a chain reaction that can lead to big events. This little jewel in the movie shows us a number of seemingly unrelated characters, most of them in Paris, whose activities affect each other's lives. (You can also apply the six-step separation theory.) Every story is the jewel of this movie. The actor is fine-tuned and nuanced (Audrey Tautou is luminous), the songs are believed to be credible, humor is just right, and the viewer leaves the theater in agreement.
