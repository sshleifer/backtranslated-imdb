A very well made film by the Communist Yugoslavia in the early 60s. Five young actresses at the heart of the story provide strong, sincere and emotional deep performances. A clear idea of ​​how the natural trust and naivety of teenagers can be easily manipulated and how it affected the rest of their lives. Highly recommended.
