Refreshing "lost" pearl! Includes an effective dialogue with great actions to create characters and take care of what happens to them. Douglas and Widmark characters are realistic heroes. Palance is his usual evil presence. Widmark wins a fisticuffs fight scene that is less than 60 seconds long, with a logical ending, and a long walk on foot, leading to the chasing of modern Hollywood. You know how this is likely to end, but intercourse and interest remain everywhere. The end of chasing is one of the most realistic things you'll ever see. The film seems to be slowly slowing down in the middle, but staying at a cost-effective conclusion.
