The novel is easily better and the best parts of the film are direct translations of what Greene wrote; for example, a quiet but gloomy humor that breaks into scenes with Boyer and Lorre, or a murdered child's obsession that takes over some plot. When a movie is different from a novel, it tends to be ridiculous. <br /> <br /> But I do not want to assume that the film is in some way bad. It always looks part and the story remains like good. Some of the juvenile characters were shareholders who could change their hands. <br /> <br /> It's a terrible shame that the movie is not available on DVD.
