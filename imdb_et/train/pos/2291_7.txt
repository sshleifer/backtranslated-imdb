"Elmer's pet rabbit" is likely to have two main meanings, that the mad lepers in "A Wild Hare" now have a name and that he speaks of his famous "Of course you understand it means war!" For the first time. Mostly, the crowd of Termite Terrace tried to understand exactly what to do with this long-haired rascal. This is definitely a genre for the heavy fans of this genre, but others probably have little reason to be interested. <br /> <br /> But don't make a mistake, it's a lot of fun that Bugs Bunny will forever light Elmer Fudd. Clear tones of things that come into the whole comic. I recommend it.
