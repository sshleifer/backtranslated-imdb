What a good movie! Finally, an image showing the unknown side of rock: illusions of fame. Known Rockers are old and forgotten, not music. And with a good sense of humor. Have you ever danced around the clock at Bill Haley's clock? <br /> <br /> Anyway, Still Crazy is probably the best movie I've ever seen. For example, much better than Spinal Tap for example. Why? For Still Crazy, people are mature. They have a different view of stone, love and life. They want to reach out to their crazy youngsters, which they don't miss so much. After the story itself, we see the character with its personality, weaknesses and dreams. Like every one of us. <br /> <br /> Spend this time (listen to the awesome soundtrack!) and finally think about your future. <br /> <br /> Bye!
