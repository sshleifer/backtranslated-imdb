Daniel Day-Lewis is the lively most versatile actor. English aristocratic snob in the gazebo, passionate Irish thief in the Father's father, impudent, violent butcher in New York gangs (ten times stronger than Adrian Brody's piano) and the terrible Cristy Brown with cerebral paralysis in my left leg (just a few names). His roles affect each other, but each one is separate and completely unique. He changes completely with every note he takes. And I'm gonna believe he can do something. Something. Like Cristy Brown, she's stunning. He does not laugh at this character and he does not harm this character. Hard achievement. And Cristy Brown lives. Smart man. Embarrassing man. Human. <br /> <br /> This movie, despite the small scenes of the scene transition and the like, is an inspiration. Yes, it's predictable. But is it silly sentimental? I laughed. I cried. No cheese. Proof that this is not a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the scene in a restaurant when Cristy discusses painters with Eileen, Peter and his friends. Here's where Daniel Day-Lewis reaches its peak. "I put the only part of your anatomy that is animated." "Wheels out sad!" And his performance never slows down, never loses and is beautiful. Just. He has a lot of time here. I look at it again, and I never get tired of Cristy's outstanding eyes, twitching and guttural speeches. <br /> <br /> Must-have. Fo sho, yo!
