I was less able to accept the rating given to this film and I believe that this is an example of how short thinking is for most viewers around the world. Really ... Have you forgotten that the cinema was some kind of art before some thugs just tried to do it for entertainment? This movie is not entertainment, at least not as easy entertainment as you can get movies like Titanic or Gladiator. It has a style, it's different, it's shocking ... That's why most of you hated it so much because it's not trying to be pleasant to you. It's just a story, very strange, which I admit, but after all, it's just a strange story. It's not a great story, not even a big cinema, but I think it's worth the 7-star rating just for the courage of the author and the director to capture a story that's not meant to appeal to the audience, selling billions of copies and making big studios even more richer. For me, this film is a European-artistic film made in the United States, and all those involved in doing it deserve respect. Be it with courage or with a unique sense of humor.
