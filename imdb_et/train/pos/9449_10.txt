I watched this movie in the morning when I was sleeping. This in itself testified that Deliverance was a spell-binding film. I think Boorman did an excellent job of managing this movie. When expertly made the early scene of a hill with people and dueling banjos. It showed so well and early when the people in the area were reserved and simple. Example - at the end of a "duel" a banjo-playing boy smiled (loved his banjo), but when Drew tried to shake the boy's hand after a "duel", the child was too responsive to answer. A Christmas journey will definitely not leave you forever. The rape scene was brutal, but necessary to show exactly what this group was on the back of Georgia. I think that after that Beatty was a traumatic shock well done. Some have said that the ordeal will not affect him. I disagree - if you really got the attention, he didn't react all the time after Reynolds put the arrow through the attacker and they captured a toothless guy. It was confusing when Ed killed another boy later on the rock. It almost appeared that the arrow had been photographed when Ed had curved and waited to die, but then you realize that the arrow he had previously shot had finally come into force. <br /> <br /> Between 8 and 9 of my votes, but after reading the message of an unpleasant voter who gave him "1", I gave it "10". The reasoning of this person seemed to be based on personal prejudice rather than an objective point of view, and his voice was clearly a non-correlative attempt to downgrade.
