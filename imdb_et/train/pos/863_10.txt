I was first in this movie until the last minute. It is perfectly captured with lots of interesting and original camera corners and techniques. The plot is surrounded by a deaf woman who has been chosen by both friends and colleagues. He hires an assistant whose true intention is to find love. She's ex-con and she's using her to get revenge on those who hurt her. In return, he has to help him with the help of his lips reading ability to pull it out. The film crosses a dark film noir, a couple of really great scenes and an even better final. The real beauty of this film is the way the director uses the lack of leading character. Using sound keeps the tension constant, and dramatic shifts from silent noise keep blood pumping, that's for sure. Throw in a little black comedy and erotic undertones of sexual repression that you have a great movie. This is a movie Hollywood really wants to do, but just can't.
