Rated NR (Rate R as a strong language and raw sexual humor). Quebec Rating: 16+ (should be 13+) Canadian Home Video Rating: 18A <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy Delirious is Eddie's first up comedy routine. It came out in 1983. hrs and trading places and he was Saturday night live.Eddie made two stand up comedy movies.Delirious and Raw.I preferred Raw because I just found the topic is more humorous. Oral is also very funny Eddie talks about his childhood and jokes celebrities like Mr. .T and singers like Michael Jackson.All fan stand-up comedy movies should look like Eddie Murphy's Delirious.
