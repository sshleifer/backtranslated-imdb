I loved The Real Mc Coys (1957-1963) It's too bad that Lydia Reed has decided to forget and not to appear. She was great at the show. Of course, Walter Brennan was also great and Tony Martínez. I loved it when he called Amos Señor Grampa.I've bought the season I on DVD and I can't wait to buy Seasons 2-6. If there were more shows on television, then everything would be better. This exhibition was briefly published in the summer of 1999, but then disappeared. God blesses all the departed members, and please, Llydia Reed, to make you public again. You are loved and respected. Real Mc Coys lives forever.
