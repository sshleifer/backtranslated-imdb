The film is very realistic. It certainly does not belong to the Hollywood cinema genre, where every line has to be pronounced perfectly and where every step is accurate. Actors who play the role of lovers do a great job of representing the feelings and thoughts of the characters - the adventures of their daily lives. All in all, the movie raises the viewer into a depressed state. Here is the realism of the whole story. Not everything happens as we think it should happen. I can say that this movie does not end badly. We look, we learn, we experience ourselves. This is probably the moral of this story.
