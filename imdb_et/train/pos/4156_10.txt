I've been following Cold Case episodes since its premiere (especially now that it is following The Amazing Race, but it was one of the best examples of writing and showing I've seen from Bruckheimer's house.) Especially for younger officers it was on the site, script and editing , the soundtrack and the actors made this episode a tourist tool, if I were the producers, I would present this episode to Emmy's consideration. The portrait was taken from Coop and Jimmy within a 48-minute episode that takes many talented people into their best. I hope this episode will recur because I'm sure a lot of what I didn't notice for the first time.
