It played in our theater in Amsterdam and the movie we wanted to see was sold, so we went to it without knowing anything other than the documentary on the planet. We were very happy about our accident because it was a very powerful film about life and the delicate balance we all share with the rest of the Earth. This film has one of the most amazing photos I've ever seen in the movie, and brought me from the desert to the oceans to the rainforest and showed things I've never seen in the movie, on TV or in the book! "Earth" is a film that every student should see before they are left. I encourage my brother to watch this movie because he comes from the planet we leave him. It is also a film that can be seen on the screen or on a very large television, because photography is so powerful and exotic.
