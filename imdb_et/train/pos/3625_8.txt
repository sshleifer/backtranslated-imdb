This is the best picture of baseball because Redford attacked our natural path. Dennis Quaid and Rachel Griffiths light up the screen with a great story and pain that seemed real enough to pull you in your life. <br /> <br /> Created with Dreams - In reality, America dreams of a true story of Jimmy Morris, the living rookie of Devil Ray, after September 9th. Rachel Griffiths, an Australian-born actor, plays better in the local West Texas than many Texans I know; and Dennis Quaid was perfection? cast like a wannabe, a gonnabe, and a humble winner who has the same amount of psychological luggage as the audience's average viewer. That's pretty. Screen chemistry works. If you like a baseball heart warmer, you will love this movie. The ingredients of Americana and Apple Cake were all there. My popcorn became a la mode. <br /> <br /> And hey: buy a CD! The music sounds and the story is great! Syncing words and music pushes the story exactly as it should be, an area that loses me more often. <br /> <br /> Critics: I would have given baseball to someone else. But Quaid has something to teach us about character and heart. St. Rita and Nuns were beautiful decorations, but they never found a story to open and close them. Slightly long. Valued every minute in the last analysis. 8 / 10. <br /> <br />
