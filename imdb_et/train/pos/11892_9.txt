Pialat filmed people in extremely emotional situations, usually with several violent scenes. In La Gueule's Overte, he deals with the devastating consequences of his wife's husband and son as he dies of cancer. A nos amours, teenage girls' sexual experimentation leads to violent confrontation with their family. Here we have a pretty spoiled young woman who gives up her husband to start a sexy ex-con. His motivation is a bit cloudy because Loulou can't read or discuss anything more complex than TV shows; on the other hand, he has a fabulous body (I don't know why Depardieu has never made this movie to show this body - he would have been good as a rugby player). <br /> <br /> Casting is impressive. Isabelle Huppert is not allowed to give strange, expressive performance (she has given a lot); Depardieu plays Loulou for all the dynamics and charm you want - look at the scene at the bar, where he is caught in the gut, runs away and looks for treatment, then restarts with Nelly. Guy Marchand, with their coal-black eyes and unhappy appearance, plays beautifully Nelly's wife; this is a subtle repetition of Coup de foudre.
