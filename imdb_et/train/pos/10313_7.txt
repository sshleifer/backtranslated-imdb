China O'Brien (1990) was an attempt to make Cynthia Rothrock's star in the United States. The production of this golden Harvet was led by the veteran director Robert Clouse. Unfortunately he was happy with Enter Dragon or he has lost his touch because he is not so big a director. The only reason to watch this movie is to see the fighting skills of Rothrock and Richard Norton. If this film was directed by Corey Yuen or Hoi Meng, it could have been a classic style that would rather be a cheesy-to-video action. <br /> <br /> China O'Brien returns home to help his father. He has problems with the local mobile and he needs his help. So he returns home and restores the order (with the help of two unlikely people). But are they enough to destroy Mister Big and his evil cronies? <br /> <br /> If you are a big Cynthia Rothrock fan, this movie is for you. I just enjoyed fighting scenes, everything else is garbage. Why didn't Raymond Chow pull a pair of shekels out and hire a top executive? <br /> <br /> Recommended.
