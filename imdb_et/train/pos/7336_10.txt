This is another favorite of Ralph Bakshi fantasy; after you watch it on YouTube. It is a long way past the ice age, it is a prehistoric sword-witch between good and evil. Ice and her mother, Queen Juliana, Nekron, have set their sights on conquering the famous world. When their glaciers destroy the village named Larn, he (Larn) promises his people vengeance and kills Ice Lord. Meanwhile, the sub-human members of Nekron and Juliana took Princess Teegra, the daughter of King James of King Firekeep; but he succeeds in escaping and eventually meets Larn, who allows him to return to Firekeep; if sub-people can't find them first. <br /> <br /> This movie made very little box (like most Ralph Bakshi movies), but has become a cult classic, partly because of its quality. art, collaboration between Ralph Bakshi and the famous fantasy artist Frank Frazetta. I have also heard that the manuscript was written by Gerry Conway and Roy Thomas, two men who had made Conan's comic book stories, and the background painters were James Gurney, Illustrator of Dinotopia novels; although I had never read Conan or Dinotopia. And Thomas Kinkade, a painter from Thomas Brinkford's exchange company. And like Baksh's "Lord of the Rings and America's Pop", this film was rotoscoped, but the process works better in this movie than the first one. <br /> <br /> So in general, I think it's one of the best animated fantastic movies ever made, and fantastic collaboration with two great minds - Ralph Bakshi and Frank Frazetta. A lot of fantasy, sexual inspiration and an exciting adventure.
