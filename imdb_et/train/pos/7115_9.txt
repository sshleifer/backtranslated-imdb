A great and tough war movie that focuses on the internal torture of Al Schmid, a blinded sea. Although it is harsh and unpleasant, it is ultimately heroic - the Schmid triumph over trees and depression. The fight scene was great. But one bone to choose. No matter how much .50 bullets they fired, I didn't see water or dirt as a result of the blow! It was a realistic damage, but I can live with it. Again, Eleanor Parker's amazing performance, like her girlfriend.
