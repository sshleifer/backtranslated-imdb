089: Footlight Parade (1933) - published 9/30/1933, reviewed 5/5/07. <br /> <br /> Ice cream cone invented in New York. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: After a long and busy break, we found another Busby Berkeley music from Warner Bros. This time it is a very fast paced Footlight Parade that is played by James Cagney's Juggernaut as directed by Chester Kent. I am 100% sure that Cagney will direct Berkeley to her irreversible Kent production with a new performance every minute. Joan Blondell is also excellent as an acid-language secretary-loved one. Ruby Keeler / Dick Powell's sub-block is not as big this time, but not less enjoyable. One of the things that bothered me was Berkeley's own performances, which seemed too extravagant and complex to be performed at every stage, not to mention the stage that would later show the film. Of course, Busby's story doesn't let the story stop him from putting together the most mentioned music codes. I liked almost all of this movie until the end, with a shamefully offensive "Shanghai Lil", which, as you might think, is reversible on the same stomach as racially unpleasant performances. <br /> <br /> DOUG: Six movies in three months. Must have a new record. Anyway, it ends with Warner Bros. The 1933 musical trilogy, preceded by "42nd Street" and "1933. gold diggers of the year. I would definitely recommend looking at all three lines. I don't know if James Cagney was driving Busby Berkeley when he played Chester Kent in this movie, or when that role was written inspired by Busby. I hope it was; there seems to be a sense that Berkeley is a man who would see complex dances like Chester in everyday life. The funny thing about Cagney was that he didn't see a man in the usual sense. He was 5'7 ", squared and spoke with a strange New York accent. But the boy was quite versatile, based on poisonous gangsters, which made him so famous for such famous types of producers as we see here. part is familiar, Joan Blondell returns and almost steals an exhibition, such as Cagney's loyal and lusting secretary, Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler playing a cute couple, but it seems that I get less time than before, Billy Barty opens up as a naughty impulse that is typical of pre-codes 50s and 60s, which were more family-based, and are great for this year's Warner musicals ("Shanghai Lil" number does not tolerate, Keeler does a bad job when looking for Chinese). <br /> < br /> Last movie: Dinner Eight (1933) Next film: I'm not an Angel (1933).
