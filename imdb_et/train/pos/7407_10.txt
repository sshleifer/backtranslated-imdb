This film took me by surprise. I watched it 2 or 3 times. I liked this movie. There were many truths that this film brought. I also love all the characters in this movie. This movie makes a lot of sense, because when society becomes "more" what does this culture get rid of? Don't preach. I can really relate this film to the hood of my child and lose my life that never comes back and has never been the same. This movie is my top 5 movie I've ever watched. There is only such a raw truth that I feel when I watch the film and not the truth that you have to dig your right in front of your face. The creators of this movie did a great job and enjoyed this movie very much. This movie may not be for everyone, but if you have an open mind, I think you love it.
