I didn't see it in the 20s, but I still remember things. <br /> <br /> This movie has NOT been painted. The harsh gray is what makes it and life was very simple in the 1950s? What most looks like in my memory is Perry Smith's moves. His breathing under the hood before the trap. I don't think I can look at it again ..... once there are many. It's like an unnamed guy at the beginning of "Papillon", who is shrinking into the guillotine sharply. A man who said it was "Dead Man Walking" on a double bill would have had to add "I want to live" for the last 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> Some of my ancestors have "aristos" on the guillotine in 1794 - 95, so my feelings about the death penalty are quite intense.
