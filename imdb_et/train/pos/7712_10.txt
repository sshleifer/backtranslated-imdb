First level, fear. <br /> <br /> When I first saw this movie at 10, I knew it would give me nightmares. It did. Surprisingly, as you remember, this sound was as much as the monster they produced. <br /> <br /> Second level, psychoanalytic theory. <br /> <br /> Later as an adult, I saw the story of what it was: What if the wild, unlimited instincts we all repressed appeared. <br /> <br /> Third level, pure scientific literature. <br /> <br /> The best way to believe in realizing the plot "What if" is through science fiction. This is pure scientific literature, not the "cowboys in space" of the modern genre. After 43 years, Forbidden Planet is still the largest of all science fiction. For Transformation Planning, SKG or Lucas, Look Out!
