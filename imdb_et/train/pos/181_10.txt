UC 0079, one year's war is almost over. The cyclones, the Zeon team, are targeted to the neutral colony of the 6th side. Their target is the new Gundam, built exclusively for Newtype (allegedly built for Amuro Ray from the original Gundam Saga). When a little boy Al Izuruha, a fan of Zeon's MS, meets Zak√≥ after the end of the battle in the colony, he meets the novice MS pilot Benard "Bernie" Wiseman. Two of them are good friends, Al is a member of the Cyclops team. Through the show, Bernie Al-dad acts as an actor (whose real father always works) and seems to have been taken by the Federation pilot Christina McKenzie, but eventually they have to meet ... in battle. Al will soon learn that war is not a child's game and Bernie has to choose the ultimate victim to complete his mission. <br /> <br /> For only 6 episodes, Gundam 0080 is well done. Mobile suits are very well designed and the animation may seem dated, but really shows a sense of emotion. If you liked 0083, check it out or if you're new to Gundam, it's a good start. When you look at the development of drama and character in the exhibition, it is for you, it will focus more on this mobile suit battle. I would appreciate it as a drama rather than an action. <br /> <br /> Mobile Suit Gundam 0080, a war in your pocket. Sometimes you have to lose to win.
