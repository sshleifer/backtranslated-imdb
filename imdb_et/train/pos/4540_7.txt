This film marks Jay Leno as Detroit police officer, Tony Costas and Pat Morita as a Tokyo policeman who was sent to Detroit to download a stolen car engine prototype. The Japanese man traveled to Detroit, hoping that it would be sold to a future car company run by a man named Derrick Jarry. Unfortunately, he killed the men who had to negotiate the deal and killed the prototype. Angry Derek Jarry tries to steer away from Phillip Madras, who led the men. But Madras (played by Chris Sarandon) does not have it and threatens to force Jarryd to continue his partnership. At the same time, the same man was also killed by a friend of Tony Costas in the same junkyard where the Japanese man was killed. Tony's friend was watching a spam park. <br /> <br /> Tony is trying to find the killer against his boss. Tony is at the time of the robbery, but obviously the killing should be investigated. Although Tony is investigating the crime he is running on the Japanese police, he has arrested him wrongly. Finally, they work together on the case. They make an odd pair and have some really fun parts, as well as some ridiculous scenes, such as Pat Morita, who jumps and hits through the windscreen of a moving car and hits Madras's head. But it reaches at least a nice friend's movie, at least in my opinion. Jay Leno is not an actor but his role is pleasant and Pat Morita is also good. However, they make one movie for one unlikely friend. If you liked friendship movies, 80s movies or want to see Jay Lenos as an actor, I recommend this movie.
