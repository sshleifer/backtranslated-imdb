The film is not visually stunning in the usual sense. It does not offer a number of beautiful pictures. Instead, it is a visually interesting film. This forces the viewer to process continuously or perhaps to depict the context of different techniques. Such a thing is easy to try, but it's hard to achieve. The film does not use the crowd of the genre to help less than fully involved viewers do this. Instead, the film touches and moves through a variety of genres. The movie's trick is to enjoy this playfulness. I suspect that 99% of North American viewers just can't. If you try to put this movie on narrative, philosophical message, or symbolic structure, then you waste your time. They are not. Sometimes the film is about their genres and others. The only unifying force in the film is Claire Denise's own feeling that fits together. There are so few full-length films to satisfy the description of Kant's art, namely the enjoyment of the judgment's own power, rather than simply submitting the lessons from the ideas. The film usually takes out easily and decides to understand what is happening. Most movies are not art. Most movies don't come in art. When a movie does, as it does, and is still enjoyable by many viewers, it's a miracle. My negative comment is that, from time to time, I find the film to buy too many different narrative threads that run through it. The Tahitian father-son's narrative, though not standard, makes it a bit clear and simple. It dominates too much.
