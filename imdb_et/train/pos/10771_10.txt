In this movie, all the stars, John Candy, Richard Lewis, Ornella Mutti, Cybill Shepard and Jim Belushi, who call them little, run long in Monte Carlo, as well as some other beautiful European places and are very funny. The problems everyone gets when they start to defend themselves are great and I suggest you see this movie, it's worth it! John Candy is once a crime, like everyone else! If you and your family are looking for a great family film, it's your ticket. Everyone gives a constellation, a great act, a great comedy and a great time that is rare in these days. A large plot, a great mystery (whatever I love) and a general, worth the money you spend on it. So get the kids, grab some popcorn, juice or tea, or sodas, and enjoy the show !!
