A channel in the Kuwait hotel suddenly shows up on the channel that was already showing it. The first Pachelbel Canon brought his throat one-time, then saw Tiger Moth (which my grandfather, my father and I have all flown) around the eyes with a slight humidity, and then Crowe's name caught me completely. This movie, Crowe's performance (again), the theme (and yes, what debt owes) entranced how different things were directed and dealt, flying sequences (my father also flew from Avro Ansons), the story - and as the other co-worker noted Crowe's Call of High Flight. I do not break the film to anyone, but by divorcing my wife a 4,000-mile, as a former military officer who was placed in a couple of war and private pilots, I admit that I wept a few times with my heart. Buy, rent, download, scroll, borrow or steal but watch it. <br /> <br /> PS Did I take Bristol Blenheim (in yellow training colors) on the ground? Looked like a twin-engine aircraft with a twin -303 Brownings dorsal tower.
