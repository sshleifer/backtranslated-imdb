"Bedknobs and Broomsticks" is a magical adventure film with a certain charm, although it is not one of the best Disney works. It generally has a good story, nice songs, great characters, good actors, magical and pleasant special effects, good settings and beautiful landscapes in England. <br /> <br /> It also combines very well with live action and animation. Of course the animation itself is pretty good. The animation is very much like the animated film "Robin Hood" of 1973, and the same can be said about animated characters: there are many wild animals such as bears, elephants, hippos, lions, crocodiles and others like "Robin Hood" (lion) Prince John and King Richard, not to mention that the bear looks like Little John. <br /> <br /> This movie is often compared to "Mary Poppins." Both combine live actions and animations with a similar work of art. Both have similar settings in London. Both have their own magic and magical wife. The children (Carrie, Charlie and the lovely little Paul) are a bit like the children of the banks, both of which were directed by Robert Stevenson and both put on David Tomlinson. Banks, David Tomlinson plays a bigger and more magical man - Professor Emelius Browne. With his magic, this film has some but important similarities to Harry Potter's. <br /> <br /> Most songs are good. "Incredible age" and "Beautiful Briny Sea" are the best. "Portobello Road" is also nice. <br /> <br /> David Tomlinson is once again in this movie. Angela Lansbury is great as Miss Price and also 3 boy actors are well: Cindy O'Callaghan like Carrie, Ian Weighill like Charlie (boy who didn't believe) and Roy Snart as the youngest brother Paul. br /> <br /> I like a black cat. It's pretty cool. It looks like a Salem, a black cat in the cash register "Sabrina, a teenage witch". I find that every movie character becomes a white rabbit. Rabbits are really cute, fluffy and divine. I just love them! Even funny is always when Professor Emelius Browne has turned from white to rabbit, because when he is around again, he shakes his nose like a rabbit. It's really fun, combined with his comic figure and mustache. <br /> <br /> Generally it is okay, but its end is pretty bad. The first few minutes of the movie are nothing special, but then it gets better. However, the end is weak. This is my big criticism, largely because the animated knights are a bit too much for me and also for the feeling of war.
