I love ghost stories in general, but I FULLY love chilli, the atmosphere and elegantly horrible British period style ghost stories. This corresponds to all counts. A naïve young lawyer ("Britspeak" solicitor) is sent to a small village by the sea to live an elderly, dead woman's legacy. It's the 1920s, a time when many middle-class Britons are going to the sea for their health while on holiday. Well, I guess what, Crythin Gifford's village, the frightening Victorian legacy of an older woman, lying on the fog-dampened salt meal, has nothing to do with "healthy". When a lawyer rescues a little girl's life (none of the locals will help the endangered tot - you will know why later in the movie), she accidentally creates a malicious spirit, a black woman's anger. He's not a filmy, gauzy wraith, but a solid black silhouette of malicious and evil. The viewer sees him only a few times, but you feel his body is malicious. When the camera slips to the lawyer when he reads the legal documents, you expect the woman to look black at any time. When the lawyer goes to the generator to turn on the electricians in the creepy old house, the camera hits him and thinks he will appear there. Showing a black woman is waiting for nail beating. We have seen many elements of this story (a locked room that no one enters, a mist, a naïve outsider who ignores the warnings of local people), but the driver succeeds in combining them with a completely new and compelling ghost story. See it together with a friend so that you can get someone warm so that the woman is waiting for her. . .
