High Energy Raoul Walsh Classic Class 1933, The Bowery puts a bitter rival and dandy on Wallace Beery, the owner and operator of the salon, George Raft, thanks to the kid Jackie Cooper and the good-looking Faye Wray in roles that play between their great rivalry. It is not clear what rivalry is, but everyone follows it in the daily tabloid. Lots of wisecracks at the beginning, but the characters soften when the movie progresses. In addition, the greatness of the scene is in the Beery salon. Different characters, a sexy choral line, a lot of drinking, the creation of a perfect guilty factor that hasn't abandoned the so-called pre-code restrictions, and later Carrie nations led by Carrie Nation themselves. It all creates a very lively picture of life that has long since disappeared. I don't like comparing the ages, but this movie is completely different from what you see today. The film has a lot of heart and long lost innocence and it is absolutely black.
