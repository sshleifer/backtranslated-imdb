A fantastic documentary from 1924. The geography of today's Iraq at the beginning of the 20th century was powerful. Look at this and tell me if Cecil B. DeMille did not take notes before the ten commandments. The photographer Merian C. Cooper later created Cinerama, an idea that is likely to be in the shell when filming the remarkable landscapes of this film. The fans of Werner Herzog find that this film is a treasure where the heart-breaking struggles that the surrounding country complicates are never so obvious to human power. The fact that it was done, when it appeared, shows not only the will of the subjects, but the will of the filmmakers themselves.
