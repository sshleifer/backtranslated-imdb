I think if the film has magic, I don't need it to be liquid or seamless. It can skip background information, move too fast in some places, too slowly in others, etc. Magic in this movie: scene in the library. Stanley and Iris have many minor mistakes, but they do not diminish people's positive impact when people observe each other in the areas of life that seem most misunderstood, the most difficult to solve. Both signs are smart. But Stanley cannot understand enough that he can't read; she can't read because she has too much adventure in her childhood. Iris, though educated, does not have enough adventure and so she can't figure out how to move the U-turn. Both their mistakes and their strengths characterize each other. It may be a little stretching that Iiris will stop working at the factory year after year, or that Stanley will not hide his illiteracy enough to build or to pay for another. And while these "secrets" are explained in the story, their appearance seems to be somewhat viable. I assume that no one took the script to rethink. Even so, is it a good movie? Imagine what De Niro, Fonda and Plimpton would have done on the screen if someone was!
