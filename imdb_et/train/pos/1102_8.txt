In Manhattan, the American middle class, Jim Blandings (Cary Grant), lives with his wife Muriel (Myrna Loy) and two teenage daughters in four bedrooms and one bathroom in a rented apartment. Jim works in an advertising agency that raises $ 15,000 a year and feels uncomfortable in his apartment due to lack of space. If he sees an ad for sale in a large house in Connecticut at an affordable price, he runs with his wife and real estate agent and decides to buy an old house without technical advice. His best friend and lawyer Bill Cole (Melvyn Douglas) sends a familiar engineer to check the house and the man says he should put down the house and build another. Jim checks the information with other engineers and everyone condemns this place, and earlier he finds that he bought a "money cake" instead of a dream house. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Blandings builds his house" is an extremely funny comedy that is a hidden and top-notch scenario. Cary Grant is a man in the role of a man pushed by an American dream to have a big house that finds it has made a bad choice by losing his job and jealous of his friend. In 1986, Tom Hanks worked in a very funny movie inspired by this pleasant classic of The Money Pit. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Lar, Meu Tormento" ("Home, My Torment")
