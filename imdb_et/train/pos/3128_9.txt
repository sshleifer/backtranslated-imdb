Corny! I love it! Corny - As the TV show was about 40 years ago! Adam and Burt revive the chemistry of the same screen that never seems to be left behind! They live the old memories again and the actors from the 1960s show some of the things that are quite interesting afterwards. In the 1960s, television was so modest for so many of us when a DVD was no exception if you were familiar with the original TV show. Fight scene with written Boofs and Bams or whatever is awesome! The movie theater shows off dead dead clips. At the end, Frank Gorshin appears. He died not too long after this DVD, I believe his great hope is that he came back to Adam and Burt returning as he did so many years ago with Batman & Robin. He didn't lose his touch! Also thanks to Julie Newmar for living a villain. All in all, I think this DVD is a great memory, and I want to thank both Adam and Burt for their return and restoring their memories to those who remember the original - !!! Thank you guys !!!
