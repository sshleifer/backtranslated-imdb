I have to admit that I went to Fever Pitch's low expectations. It is not an enormous revelation for me to say that Jimmy Fallon's latest film (Taxi) was bad for Catwomanly, and Fever Pitch trailers were fine, but I didn't like it. I've already made some baseball red cheeses for review ... <br /> <br /> "I like Jimmy Fallon, but the taxi was one of his film career. Well, now we have two of the steeeeee rides! Another strike and it's back to SNL ! "or" Buy yourself some peanuts and crackers, but don't buy tickets for Fever Pitch. You go out of the theater and never go back! " Then the movie had to go and be as fun as I expected. But hey, I couldn't let my puns go to waste, right? Another reason I thought I didn't care about the movie is that I hate Boston Red Sox. My whole family hates. Just mentioning the name of Pedro Martinez sends me to the bathroom. Oh man, hold on ... <br /> <br /> Okay, I'm back. Anyway, my mom, who is St. A fan of Louis Cardinals, still believes that the World Series was rigged last year. He refuses to believe that Sox won it legally. But I am enough to admit that Fever Pitch made me, though only slightly, sympathetic to the situation of the Red Sox fans. <br /> <br /> Anyone with passion for sports can be associated with a movie at a certain level. If you do not have a favorite sports team, you cannot fully understand the extreme heights and the lower sides that a fan like Ben can go through. There is nothing as fresh as the smell of the new season and nothing as smooth as a clean slate. Well, figuratively speaking. It's a pleasure to be a sports fan. "Wait for next year," your mantra, your motto, your prayer - and Fever Pitch will actually deal with its content. <br /> <br /> I love the fact that the film takes a fictional story and throws it against the real background of the unlikely Red Sox world game that took place last year. I don't love it so much that I want to get married, but you know what I mean. I was expecting it to be handled in a rather cheesy way, and while some humor is a bit stupid, it is actually quite realistic. <br /> <br /> You see, Ben's uncle took him to his first Red Sox game when he was 7 years old, and when he died he left Benest's two season tickets. Ben has not abandoned the game for 23 years. At the beginning of each season, he has a agenda where he and his friends get together to find out who's going to play with him. He does all the dances for the Yankees games, and when someone complains, he threatens to play these games with Royals (sorry Mr. Shade) and Devil Rays. This is a very good scene, and it works so well because I know the people who make the ticket for the day. I must also admit that I can associate when Ben goes to dinner with Lindsey and his parents. Red Sox plays a road race, but instead of watching it directly on TV, Ben decides to record it himself. One of the most dangerous things in life is making games and then being public and avoiding results. Been there. This is a very tense and frightening situation. Weeeeeell, Ben enters the danger zone when a man appears in the restaurant and mentions watching the game. Ben immediately covers his ears and begins to hit like a banshee to not hear the result. Lindsey is embarrassing and her parents don't know what to think about. Yes, sports fans may be weird, I deny it. But that's real. <br /> <br /> Now that you look for the rough, sharp things that Farrelly's brothers know, you may be disappointed. They have moments such as when Ben says he likes how Lindsey sometimes speaks of "like a divine stroke", but in general it is a softer, more romantic side that the brothers say <br /> > This does not mean that the film will ever become too gentle. Fortunately, when the juice starts to do a bit, Farrelly knows when to pull it out. Romantic moment when Lindsey jumped into the field and ran over to Ben to declare her involuntary love for her, Ben sincerely replies, "You have to tell me about it. Jimmy Fallon proves that with the right material he can handle the big screen himself Drew Barrymore remains a source of lasting romantic comedy, Fever Pitch is just a good and solid entertainment that takes a somewhat fresh look at romantic comedy, a film that men and gals can associate with each other, especially men who practice sports fanatics throughout the year and ladies. who will have to deal with "em." <br /> <br /> Now that Red Sox fans could close "Bambino Curse", I would appreciate it. My Memphis tigers have never won the NCAA basketball championship, so I officially declare my situation <br /> <br /> GIST Fans Jimmy Fallon, Drew Barrymore, Romantic Comedy, Red Sox, Baseball or Sports fanatics sm generally should consider looking at Fever Pitch. I didn't go out to rush and see it at the first available time, but it makes a great mat. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3.25 (out of 5)
