This is a fantastic classic monster flick from the 50's! I just love the look of the 50s, like cars and music. Anyway, I love how it looks. I love to have everyone in the theater late in the night frightening slip and the blob arrives and bounces. The second thing I love is that it all takes place one night, like Halloween II. <br /> <br /> When Steve and Jane make out, they see a meteor falling from space. There is a blob inside Meteor. When diapers consume a person, it grows larger and bigger. They try to convince the city people of the blobby monster, but no one will believe them later. Can something stop this blobby creature? I highly recommend BLOB !!!
