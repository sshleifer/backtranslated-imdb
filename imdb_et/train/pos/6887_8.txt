This is a unique and bold film. It is energetic, with highly advanced characters. Very good results. <br /> <br /> I love directors who are not afraid to ask the audience to think ... <br /> <br /> Bret Carr dares to look inward, ask questions, and complain under the surface. Because of the nature of the film, it also requires practically looking inside the viewer. This may take courage. I can see how some close people might find it quite troublesome. But I found it thoughtful, much more than just entertainment. <br /> <br /> Bret Carr is a truly original filmmaker with vision. I'm curious to see what he's doing next. <br /> <br /> Look at her.
