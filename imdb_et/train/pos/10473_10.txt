I saw this movie for the first time in a bad spirit. For some reason, it was clicked on all my levels, family tensions, loneliness, and someone who wants to share your life. It didn't hurt that someone who shared your life was such a beautiful girl as Claire (Cyndy Preston). I also bought a soundtrack for this movie (very hard to get). He loved it and I hope it will ever come out in DV
