I hate reading reviews that say something, "Don't waste your time, this movie smells of ice." For this observer, for me, this is some sort of naive charm. If you like other "Whistler" series movies, it is traceable. If you like 40-year-old noirish movies, it's traceable. <br /> <br /> This movie is, in my opinion, not as good as any of the previous series products that marked Richard Dix as the main character. It is much slower and the plot is empty. You've seen the same narrative in many other movies and usually better. <br /> <br /> But operation is good and also lighting and dialogue. It is simply lacking in energy and you will probably understand exactly what is going on and how it will eventually end in no more than a quarter. <br /> <br /> The Whistler series is a semi-noir and features character, mood, lighting, camera movement and corners more important than the story itself. But this film is not a noir. It's too light and innocent for Hollywood. Neither Richard Dix's character nor the ladies of the previous films had to end. You never knew the end. <br /> <br /> But I recommend it at least in one view. I looked at it at least twice, and I got two times a reasonable enjoyment of it.
