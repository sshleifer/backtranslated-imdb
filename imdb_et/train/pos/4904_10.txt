Any charming film is perfect when you feel good. If you love jazz music, it's necessary. If you like the loving characters that make you smile, you can bring tears to your eyes and swing like tomorrow this movie isn't for you. If you are looking for intense, deep, heavy artwork that needs to be cut and analyzed, perhaps you are best left with Darren Aronofski (in other words, reviewer djjohn, do you know the good time you see it)!) My only complaint is is that the movie was too short. I think I have to look at it a few more times in order to complete my work.
