The "Hope of Hope" speaks of a poor Turkish family and the hope of hope that spirals will despair when traveling in search of Swiss prosperity. Although this Oscar winning film is quite well-designed, it lacks substance and has a lot of uncertainty. A large part of the movie's 1.7-hour driving time comes from the bus, leaves the bus, accesses the boat, rises out of the boat, enters the bath, gets out of the bus, etc.; that could have been better utilized or completely excluded. The story is predictable, especially for those who are aware of the common crime of trafficking in illegal immigrants. Worthy and reasonably entertaining clock, but overpriced.
