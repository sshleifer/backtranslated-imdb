This is a foolish film of a thinker. If you don't expect Star Wars and you enjoy British humor, it can just become a cult class, as it is for my husband and myself - from the "voices" of Cary Grant and Jack Nicholson to the too simplistic population of the Martians Big Bean is the movie You can either sleep or look carefully and enjoy both ways. <br /> <br /> It's not for everyone, but if you enjoy a relaxing, simple humor that takes fun to see when it slips, you'll enjoy this movie.
