The film really challenges the concepts of your identity and society. It's well done and very powerful. The people in the film are honest and manifest from the world that exists outside the normative ideological perspective. I believe that it gives a great insight into the subculture that shakes the viewer with ideas specific to society. It is sometimes shocking and powerful because of this. Some parts were hard to see because most of the reality is, but it's not over. It's good to see it for the first time, but it gets even better at the second or third time; because you have been able to reconsider your mind on the topics they discuss and make challenges.
