In fact, my voice is 7.5. Anyway, the movie was good, it has those funny parts that make it worthy, don't understand me wrong, the funniest movie in the world and not even the original, because that's the idea we saw in other movies before, but it has its own taste, my friend told me it was a boyfriend movie ... I guess it's not exactly who cares? There is also another movie that shows us almost the same topic, Chris Rock appears on it, the name is Down to Earth, the men that one of his very funny movies, look the way you want, and I know you agree that Mr. Rock won with your movie. I would like to see the main character male as Ashton Kutcher, but the film is good.
