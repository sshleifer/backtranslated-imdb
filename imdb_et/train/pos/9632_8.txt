Laurel & Hardy, when it comes to chimney sweepers, has a surprisingly fun concept. This will make some funny situations and stupid things, especially Stan Laurel, as usual. <br /> <br /> The film also has a sub-block with a nut professor who works with the rejuvenation formula. It doesn't look like logical and inconsistent logical blends, but both lines are perfect for a memorable end. However, it is a bit strange, but it's funny, so it works for the movie. <br /> <br /> Casting a movie is surprisingly good. Sam Adams is great as a stereotypical butler and Lucien Littlefield delicately passes over as a nut professor. <br /> <br /> The film is full of some great timed and fun designed sequences that are all quite predictable, but regardless of how they are filled, you can still look at it in a fun way. It all helps to make "Dirty Work" one of the best Laurel & Hardy short pants. <br /> <br /> 8/10
