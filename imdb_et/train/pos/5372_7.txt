In the first five episodes of Hammer's short-term Hammer House of Horror series, this fifth episode with the magnificent title "The House that Bled to Death" is by far the sharpest. As a great fan of Hammer Studios' gothic Horror movies, I have been wondering for many years that took me so long to finally start watching the series again. So far I have only seen the first five episodes and I have a strong feeling that the best is yet to come, but even if the series is the fifth, because the first five episodes are, I'm happy. If the second and third episodes were great to look at their sick and ingeniously dark humor, this fifth title is certainly one of the first five to give the most genuine horror. The episode begins when an elderly person murders his wife about unknown motivation. Years later, William (Nicholas Ball) and Emma Peters (Rachel Davies) move with their little daughter, Sophie (Emma Ridley). However, soon after the move, the family must find that there is something terribly wrong in the house that is seemingly haunting ... Another episode led by Francis Megahy is much better than his mediocre previous record. "(Episode 4) and fairly unknown actors give good results. The film is well done in terms of impact, cinematography, and score." The house that Bled is dead "is a definite episode that highlights the elements my fellow fans would want for a short horror story The film offers a terrible atmosphere, a real time of intimidation and smart turns, and is entertaining and entertaining for fun, and is generally highly recommended for Hammer fans.
