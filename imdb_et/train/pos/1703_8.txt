Being a small town in Illinois, I can be directly involved with this film. Considering the era that has been done, mayors are uncomfortable as many people I grew up with. Yes, the plot is that way. And yes, acting shortly will not be the Oscar candidate. But that's not the case. It's about stopping reality and just having fun. And this movie is fun. From the greedy, screamed banker to its meaning, but to the dimwitted deputy, this film was made for SciF's genre and small town entertainment. Who can't smile in the eyes of Enforcer Drone or Vern Droid? and I loved FarmZoid. I wish I had one when I grew up. In general, taking into account the technology they were available at that time, this is a pleasant outing for childhood, when you can sit on Saturday afternoon, in a popcorn, and laugh at small city living beings. This is a film that I watch again and again, for no other reason than I and my small town.
