Freebird is the perfect marriage journey for comedy, gangapri, "stoner" movie and good feelings with British film. <br /> <br /> This is a brilliant token that puts this movie out of other genres of this genre. The stars Phil Daniels, Gary Stretch and Geoff Bell have great chemistry and their characters are very pleasant and realistic. The main story focuses on their road passage from London to Wales and on the journeys and accidents that arise on the road. This small film also has a big heart - it is not just for bicycle fans, because it is based on character relationships with one another, including dreams and regrets, like Gary Stretch's Fred longed for the family he left behind. Cinematic art is also a wonderful - love letter to the Welsh countryside, as well as the terrible streets of London and the typical pub life in rural Wales. <br /> <br /> Stylish, slippery, fantastic soundtrack, pleasing characters, and funny storyline - I'd recommend Freebird in the heartbeat!
