With the symbolism of drops and miraculous cinematography, Extase is as much as an erotic drama we all expect. It is an almost silent film that has a dialogue in German and has a very simplified German language. Perhaps the filmmakers saw that the film would reach the widest possible audience in Europe, because anyone with even a low school level in Deutsch could easily subtract subtitles. This story is of little importance anyway, the film is cinematographic, not narrative. Symbols of fertility and natural power are perpetrating human characters - there are even scenes where the flowers hide the face of the supposed star Hedy Lamarri - and there are moments that resemble those of Dreyer, Vertov and Riefenstahl. If the film has any messages, I think it is political: the civic person is modest and impotent; a working class man is a happy, productive creature; and the woman is the creator whose purpose is to be unfulfilled until she has borne the child. This mixture of Soviet socialist realism and national socialist dogma does not destroy the film in any way - it's a beauty to look from beginning to end, but it puts it in a very different era of art. And, yes, yes, Hedy won't get her kit out.
