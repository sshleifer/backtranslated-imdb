I just love Malle's documentaries. They are so tired and simple, but still so exciting. I have no idea why this documentary works. It's about Glencoe, Minnesota. There are 5000 people living there and nothing really happens. But Malle is still captivating and interesting. His love for mankind, even for racist or homophobic people, is so overwhelming that you just can't help but fall in love with them. <br /> <br /> Malle filmed most of it in 1979. He came back 6 years later to see what had changed. It would have been a good movie without material 6 years later, but this little addition makes it great. It may seem that Malle did exactly what was done in the Up Series, but it is not. The Up series is related to people. Malle's emphasis is not so much on everyone's case, but on what happened to that community. And the change is great. In 1985, Reagan's time and farmers are suffering. Once a proud community, no one can see much of the future, and parents hope that their children will teach them themselves and do something other than agriculture. <br /> <br /> This documentary is quite relevant today. Our current financial crises started with what happened then. Just look at the last words of the movie that are spoken by an older lawyer from the city (1985): <br /> <br /> "Well, I have great hopes for this country, because things that are right now can only characterize the obsession of greed and the people do not live with this obsession long and especially the democracy that ... There's good - there's good - lots of good in this country and lots of good people and they're not going - they're not going to order the greed philosophy that is happening right now. . "<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it took more than 20 years and the headache of hell happened before.
