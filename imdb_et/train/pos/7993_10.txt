There are many reasons to watch this movie: to see that Latin America is being harassed by reality, police corruption at continental level, among the many realities we live in Latins. <br /> <br /> Denzel Wahington's performance was brilliant, this man continues to be a great actor and continues this way. Dakota Fanning just 10 years, a great actor has changed and I congratulate her. The rest of the movie was wonderful, I have it in my collection. I hope that they have happened to Hollywood producers to make the film completely in Venezuela, where they show our reality better in terms of crime, drug movement or political problems. They've had a few movies they play in Venezuelan countries (for example: Aracnophobia, Jungle 2 Jungle, Dragonfly), which they should do more, as well as in Mexico. <br /> <br /> Song "Una Mirada" I hope it leaves the soundtrack, it's great. My voice is 10/10
