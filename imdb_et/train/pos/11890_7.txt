This is a pretty boring film. Well photographed with realistic performances, especially the very good Depardieu, like a cat and a bad guy with realistic places over the connotations of mood and art buildings, it fails because the director does not take a position, a position or a critical comment on the subject he has set. One of France's revered and regular partner with Depardieu films - I believe they did 7 together - Piala doesn't participate. This seems to be a reason for why women fall to a bad guy who hurt when they have a caring boyfriend and a good-hearted husband. Isabelle Hupert, who plays the philanthropist who makes a distinction, offers reluctant answers like "I don't know"; "I like his hands"; "I like the way she loves" her investigative husband, who is trying to push her out of the house, but strikes and thinks again because ... I assume she loves her. So he accepts and hopes what? That one day she wakes up and comes to her senses. Such things are not answered in Pialat's outgoing docu-drama style, with long speeches and even longer scenes that do not produce. I know the answers don't add, but please stand still. Jules to Jim, it's not. The latter, both cold and simply viewed, is a heartache and headache only for the most forgiving.
