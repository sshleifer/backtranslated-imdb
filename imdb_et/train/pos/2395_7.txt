Although it was a misfortune to hit the festival round here in Austin (SXSW Film), as we were tired of things like Shakespeare's love and Elizabeth, this film deserves the audience. An internal look at "The Scottish Play" when actors call it "Macbeth" to avoid curse, it is a sharp, effective and stylish treatment for the troupe. It is a strangely recognizable result and far better than its small budget, it is a quiet pearl, not world-class, but completely satisfactory.
