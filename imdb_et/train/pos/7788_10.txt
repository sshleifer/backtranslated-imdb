I love Ashley Judd and I think all her movies are great. Ruby <br /> <br /> Paradise is one of his best. This is a very underrated movie that you really need to watch closely. A story about a woman who tries to do it herself and refuses to forgive temptations that make her life easy. Some of his films, such as Kiss The Girls and Time to Kill, apparently made better ticket offices and video rentals. They were also very good movies <br /> <br /> but took the time to really look at Ruby and I think you agree that this is one of Ashley's best. <br /> <br />
