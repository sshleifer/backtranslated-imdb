When I took the cinema, I was in a cool mood and didn't plan to change it. But this film is a dramatic source of power. I was all sweat and I needed a shower. What are we then? Theoretically, the age class of a teenage Turkish girl living in Copenhagen is Denmark. Soon I was reminded that the plot seemed pretty much a loan from Bend it like Beckham, where we had an Indian girl playing football and broke her sister's wedding. Here it is transferred to a Turkish girl who is breaking her brother's wedding by doing Kung Fu. And of course we also have a love story and a contest. After I accepted it, it turned out to be a really captivating, emotional drama and it shows off some beautiful Kung Fu (I'm not an expert). Leading actor Semra Turan is not only a Danish master, but also provides excellent performance, so it seems safe to assume that there are quite a few autobiographical impressions, considering that this is her first film and that she has no education as an actor. The rest supported cast is okay, camera good, Kung Fu intense. Sidenotes: - Turkish Turkish audience showed respect that they should have done something right. - to burst the audience when our heroine finally fought back and attacked the boys who had beaten their brother with revenge. - Xian Gao, Chinese Movie Film Kung Fu Tutor / Hidden Tiger (Crouching Dragon) played a leading role as a champion <br /> <br /> If you can see it in the cinema, do it. good and intense experience and I don't know if it works on small screens
