In a party at Lajos Koltai's evening, "a woman" asks a woman in her death bed for a number appearing in her hallucinations: "Do you tell me where my life went?" The line may be embarrassing theatrical, but the woman who speaks is Vanessa Redgrave, who offers it in a very simple way and the question tears your heart out. <br /> <br /> From time to time, a film based on Susan Minot's novel skirts with sentimentality and routine, keeps attention, delivers admirable performances, and creates emotional engagement, with a small number of recent movies. Only six years later, there are now two memorable, meaningful and valuable films in theaters, of course Sara Polley's "Away from Her". Hollywood could have changed the "Evening" into two pairs of real mothers and daughters - Vanessa Redgrave and Natasha Richardson and Meryl Streep and Mamie Gummer. Richardson is the daughter of Redgrave (with a sister playing Tony Collette), and Gummer plays Streep's younger self, while Redgrave's youthful embodiment is Claire Danes. <br /> <br /> Lisa Glenn Close, Eileen Atkins, Hugh Dancy, Patrick Wilson and Big Cast - Yes, it could have become a multi-star platform. Instead, Koltai - "Mephisto" created a brilliant Hungarian Hungarian operator and "Fateless" director - the fine ensemble's work "Continental feeling", a story that takes place in the high society of Newport, in the days that brought the wedding that is in trouble. <br /> <br /> Unanswered connections, wrong choices, and conscientious compliance with social and family pressures are quite a soap opera, but the quality of writing, Koltai's direction and selfless behavior. "Evening" across this level, the English, French (and some American) family catches the rare air of the century before its modern setup. <br /> <br /> The complicated relationships between mothers and daughters, friends and lovers, adding a complicated triangle, all come clearly, understandably, enchantingly. Individual sounds are woven into the symphony. <br /> <br /> But all of the above-mentioned emphasis on the ensemble and the unassuming appearance still emerge through the "Evening" stars, Redgrave, Richardson, Gummer (exciting new discovery, looking vaguely like his mother, but a very different actor), the heaviest Danes - until Streep appears in recent moments and of course steals the exhibition. Dancy and Wilson are also worth the entrance price. <br /> <br /> Like "Away from Her", "Evening" remains long for you, inviting you to rethink your story and characters and re-experience the emotions it raises. After two hours, the film will take a bit of time, but how it stays with you is among many movies that will jump long before your popcorn.
