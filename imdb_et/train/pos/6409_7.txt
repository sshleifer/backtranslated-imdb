I didn't hear Brashear before I watched it. This is the story of him and the man who trained him to help him become the first African American US Navy diver. The story of willpower. The plot is well written and develops nicely. This is what seems like a typical subtype and it doesn't hold too many surprises. It's also pretty Hollywood, but hey, I don't know the real man, maybe it's close to how it really happened. However, it will be done with work, dramatic scenes and accidents, and it is inspiring to anyone who has ever heard the words "no, you can't" talk about your life-long dream. Good performances are all great. DeNiro and Gooding Jr both always appear on the screen. Rapaport is also wonderful. The characters are well written, reliable, and consistent. It is well edited and includes good cinematography. The production values ​​are high and this is a pretty convincing job to bring us back to the 50s. This is the only film I've seen with this director and writer, although I can now consider more responsibility. There is a moderate amount of strong language, otherwise there is no offensive material. I recommend it to anyone who finds the topic interesting and / or the fans of these makers. 7/10
