There are so many words I want to use to describe this movie, but I can't do that? This movie is for watching a movie if you just want to sit, laugh, cry and pee. I'm serious. Don't look at this movie if you are easily offended by fear, sex, nudity, homosexuality ... and everything else related to nature. Being a woman and it may not even be a factor, I can watch this movie over and over again. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are completely brilliant. With all the other debuts, I think Baseketball is the winner of the prize. I'm just laughing at some of the stupid things they do in the movie. Watch the movie !! That's all I say. It's hard for me to leave this comment because I'm one of those people, like Ozzy Osbourne, who has almost every line that speaks out of their mouth when they speak. So I keep it professional. Best movie. Heck yes!
