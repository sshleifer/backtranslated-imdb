Surprisingly good. Acting was fun, the scenario was fun, the music was fun fun, the plot was amazingly fun. It was fun to watch the movie and give your brain. Parts of the plot and quotes I found to be very creative. 7 out of 10 In fact, it would be worth 10 out of 10. You shouldn't compare it with an arthouse movie or a bloody slasher movie.
