The tattooed stranger was still one of those rare films that the BBC2 traveled through the New Year 2005-2006. See also those who live at night and Brighton Strangler. <br /> <br /> In this central park, a man walking his dog over an abandoned car and discovering a dead woman. He was shot and the police tried to identify him only with a tattoo. Once detected, a murderer is detected and hit at the end. <br /> <br /> Most of this movie is made in New York City and around, so we see some of the city areas we don't usually see, especially the back streets. <br /> <br /> Mostly unknown are cast, John Miles gets the best bills. <br /> <br /> Tattooed Stranger is worth it. Excellent, but rather unclear. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 out of 5 stars.
