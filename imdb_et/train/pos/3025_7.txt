Bacall is doing well here - especially considering that it's just his second movie. It is often hidden in the shadow, because it is between two great successes: "To Have and To Not" (1944) and "The Big Sleep" (1945), both of which tied him to Humphrey Bogart. This one is not equal to other films, but I think it is not his own fault. I think there were some disruptions in the portrayal of the British Choral Lady. No accent. I think all the strange accents were disturbing - Boyer wasn't a Spaniard. It was hard to keep straight from what people were coming from. <br /> <br /> I liked black and white cinematography. The mood is a big influence - I really enjoyed the fog. Lighting also makes a great effort to increase intrigue and tension. <br /> <br /> Bacall is just great. Boyer just doesn't fit me into a romantic leading person - so he was a bit weird with Bacall. Not very big chemistry - and certainly not Bogie and Bacall magic. But I still really liked this picture. There is a lot of tension and it moves well enough. I have to say that I found a somewhat bold girl murder for this girl. <br /> <br /> Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre stand out as strong pains. Paxinou as a hotel keeper is completely bad and evil in his imagination. His scene, where he laughs laughing, when Mr Muckerji leaves after the child's murderer is exposed, is quite disturbing. Lorre also makes his slippery, snake in Conteras's imagination - buggy coward to the end. Wanda Bendrix also does well in portraying a child - especially considering that it was her first picture and she was only 16 years old (although she looks much younger). It turns out that he later married Auie Murphy, who has proved to be a short-lived, passionate marriage.
