This is one of my favorite films of all time and although it may move too slowly for some, it's worth it. The lawyer of the company (Richard Chamberlain) is drawn to the case involving the "city" aborigines, and this is not an ordinary case. OK, the man is dead, but it wasn't exactly the usual killing. Recently, there has been a higher than average rainfall, and most of the film's atmosphere is somewhat claustrophobic and oppressive. Aborigines keep secret and refuse beans from side effects. It has a lot to do with the white men who make assumptions about the "city" and "tribal" aborigines, and of course, Abo should not practice tribal opportunities. Uh ah. Chamberlain has strange dreams and is somehow the key to what happens, although no matter how many times I have seen it, I cannot associate precisely. It's a terrible and horrible movie, and it's a good example of Peter Weir's ability to create tension. The end is a little unclear, but I'll take it literally, it's the easiest way out and more frightening. 10 out of 10 and highly recommended.
