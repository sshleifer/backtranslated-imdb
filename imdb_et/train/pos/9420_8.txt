The white suit man is one of the pleasant comedies that Ealing did so well in the 40s and 50s. This plot is followed by a person who looks like fabrics that are not dirty or broken. Of course, this is a huge breakthrough in the textile world. But things are not as simple as fabrics threaten many people's lifestyles, including fabric manufacturers, the workforce of the garment factory, and even the old woman who wash every week. A white suit man is a film about scientific advancement and the way they don't always help; As an old woman says at one point in the movie, "Why can't scientists just leave things alone?" <br /> <br /> Like many Ealing comedies, this one star Sir Alec Guinness. Alec Guinness is a fantastic actress; he is able to illuminate the screen with his presence (and he does it in the movie, literally), but he can also portray his signs from the ground and credibly. He is in this movie appropriately creepy, and he strikes the right atmosphere for his character; an intelligent and ambitious but somewhat naive scientist. Along with Guinness, White Smoke Man is also Joan Greenwood, an actress with a deep voice, who played with Guinness just divine "Kind Hearts and Coronets" and Michael Gough, a man who continued to play in Alfred's Batman films. It's not always a big deal to film, but it's always good, and it fits the film. <br /> <br /> A man in a white suit is a smart, thoughtful and witty comedy with morality. Comedy is not always evident and it does not always work, but the film is not meant to be a film that provokes a stomach to laugh, so it's forgiving. I recommend this movie in principle to anyone who is a fan of films.
