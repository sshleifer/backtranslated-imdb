I find it so amazing that even after all these years we are talking about this movie! Obviously this movie wasn't that bad or else people wouldn't even talk about it. I enjoyed this movie personally and still! I think this movie is not for everyone, but it certainly touched the hearts of many. <br /> <br /> As for those who think this movie is "overvalued" or "over-jumped", we only have to thank the public for the film! lol * You see, it's not CRITICS / article writers who make "HUGE" or "HIT" with the general movie public. PEOPLE make the movie a great success. Everyone was terrifying with Titanic. Let's face it, it's never been done before. At least not with the type of special effects that are necessary to actually ship the ship. This movie is so accurate that even James Cameron was timing the ship's actual drowning in the REAL drowning, which was the day of destiny in April 1912. <br /> <br /> Skip this movie, what guys do! Critics thought this movie would be drowning in a big time! When this movie actually appeared and people started to hear about WORD OF MOUTH (which is the best form of advertising for you) that it was a good / decent / movie worth seeing, everyone started flocking to the droves to see this movie ... not once, not twice, but maybe 3 times and more! So, I really wouldn't say that this movie would be "overheated" ... at least it doesn't like the MATRIX upload or HULK being "overheated". ha! Critics didn't even think Titanic would have made enough money to cover Cameron's huge film budget, which took the film to make this mammoth. But movie money took care of this 200 million budget and much more! <br /> <br /> Personally, I love this movie. But this movie may not be for everyone. Don't tell me that this movie just sucks because of romance! It's the sexiest thing I've ever heard! Just like the movie because it's romance! The story was sweet. The dialogue might have been better, but let's face it ... the movie REAL star wasn't Leo or Kate ... that was GIGANTIC Ship! I think all the participants, including DiCaprio and Winslet, did a good job. It's not your best job (I've seen a lot of work on both of them), but it wasn't seen on the screen before. Give them a break! <br /> <br />
