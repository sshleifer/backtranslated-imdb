Okay, I don't think Trailer Park Boys has a bad story because they're gonna hit the ass. They just ... contradict each other. <br /> <br /> For example: The end of the movie shows that Ricky and Julian say "Patrick Lewis" to put the dog down and walk away. Finally, it shows that Ricky and Julian say they have been in prison for 2 years. In the TV series, the first clip to be shown is Ricky and Juliani's same clip "Patrick Lewis". But in the TV series they have been allegedly in prison for 18 months. <br /> <br /> They also give us the impression that the story of the movie and the story of the TV series are screaming between the connected sons. However, some actors represent completely different characters. Of course Patrick Roach plays "Patrick Lewist", but Randy plays in the series. Sam Tarasco plays one man who pays for Ricky's destruction, and then plays Sam Losco. <br /> <br /> Also (again ... I know I have a lot to say), film, boys tend to smoke instead of coke. The thing is that they never confirm that these two stories are interconnected, except in the shouting place.
