I really liked BATMAN: DEAD END, I thought it had a theatrical feeling and that giving Collora the opportunity to make a fine film. This trailer did not give me the same impression. The story or potential story was pretty good, but due to action and special effects I felt like it would have been a good TV movie or TV show. <br /> <br /> First of all, Michael O'Hearn is not so good at Superman. I thought he did a good Clark Kent for his short look. Sorry, I just don't think SuperMan is the buff. Kenti's suit wore its size to hide. Batman may have a body, but not Superman. The supes are undoubtedly toned but not bulky. Anyway, I wasn't interested in all of her posing things and her transformation from Kent to Superman seemed cheezy. Now it may not be just O'Hear's fault, Collor may need to take part in credit for bad script and direction. Second, the special effects of flying were funny. Superman flies through the sky. When it was obvious that Superman flew near the ground, the telephone cables and buildings were visible above him. I don't think Superman's flights would be full. Obviously, the harness and the back supporting the O'Hearn must be placed on his lower torso. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was a good trailer. I think I would pay for a movie if it was ever made and would definitely be on television. The story, Lexcorp and the Wayne Industries alliance, Superman's jealous of Loise's attraction to Wayne, Lex, and Twoface to win Superman and join forces between Batman and Superman is good. I am sure that for a bigger budget and approval for the whole film Collora and the company, even O'Hearn could offer a decent movie. Definitely one better than the most recent comic strip coming out of Hollywood.
