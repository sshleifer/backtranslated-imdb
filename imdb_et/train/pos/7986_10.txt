This is a great, heartbreaking movie. This is by far the best thing I could see, which represents Latin America's current reality ... kidnapping, corruption, ruthless and greedy police officers and a heartless devil for innocent victims. Denzel Washinton gives the most moving results in my career. Dakota Fanning is an amazing young actress. The relationship between Washington and Fanning has been wonderfully written and portrayed, I believed every minute. Cast is brilliant, Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke is great as always. Walken lights up on my screen like no other actor. I would have loved to see both of them. Authentic locations are significant. Camera work is interesting and different. The song has many well-known Latin actors that make it more interesting for people who know Latin American cinema. I highly recommend this movie.
