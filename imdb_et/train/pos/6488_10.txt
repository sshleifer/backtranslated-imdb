War is hell. But this World War II documentary is in heaven. <br /> <br /> This series is not just a breathtaking, almost exhaustive look at World War II, but a poetic masterpiece that Laurence Olivier speaks clearly and perfectly. /> <br /> This series of documentaries defines the genre. There is no doubt that it is very long, but you enjoy them all and want to come back more and more. (I have a series on DVD and I will probably watch the series three times a year). <br /> <br /> Indeed, it is an impeccable bit of filmmaking. Other than Olivier, the best part of the series is listening to veterans telling their stories; Whether it is a real battle or finding a hamburger for something delicious for dinner. <br /> <br /> I'm going to look now (again, my ... 11th time)).
