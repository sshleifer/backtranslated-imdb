Lindy (Meryl Streep) and her husband Michael (Sam Neill) just welcomed the little girl, Azaria. As Seventh-day Adventists, they live their beliefs every day, and soon Araria is devoted to God in their church, watching their two older boys. Michael is on vacation and the family decides to run Ayer Rock, one of Australia's most impressive tourist areas. Not rich, family camps near the site. After a wonderful first day, Lindy puts her child in a tent in Azaria. Suddenly she hears Asaria crying. When Lindy radiates to the tent, just the dingo dog comes out, shaking his head. The baby has disappeared and will soon be gone. Although the whole camp is waiting for the baby, he can't find him. Finally, being dead and dingo with a beloved child, Chamberlains fight against God's decision and continue their lives. Unfortunately, this story comes from a sensational spread in the press and soon the story that Lindy murdered will be spread. He is then arrested and brought to court. How did it happen? It is a real event that shows how the "mob rule" is not imagination. The whole country turns to Chamberlains, partly because they are considered odd. Streep gives his best result as a complicated Lindy, whose own deliberate behavior is ahead of him. Similarly, Neill makes a wonderful and confused Michael. Casting is one of the greatest portraits of people all over the country, getting their digging into the Lindy case. Costumes, landscapes, scenarios, direction and production are on the line. If you have never seen or heard this movie, fix it right away. It is far from being a reality to say that "Cry" should be seen by anyone who cares about movie and media abuse.
