I love this movie. This is a great film that combines English and Indian cultures with feminist-type issues, such as girls who want to exercise previously reserved for men. This shows both the Indian person who wants to break his cultural barriers and women who want to break the gender restrictions found outside sport, especially in England. I feel that cultural struggles are more emphasized than other issues. <br /> <br /> Unlike other comments, I don't think this movie is something like Dirty Dancing or any other such chick. Many people, both men and women, love this movement, both young and old.
