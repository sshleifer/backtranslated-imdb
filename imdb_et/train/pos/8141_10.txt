I took the movie without getting involved and didn't even know what it was, but when I looked at it, I laughed so hard. Now this is one of my favorite films. Rusty and the boys created a masterpiece, which I would very much like this movie to anyone with a sense of humor. Thank you Rusty for letting us laugh.
