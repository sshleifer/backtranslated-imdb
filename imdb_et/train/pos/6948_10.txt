The first time I saw this episode shock, it was actually the first time I saw "24". Speed ​​things are amazing, and it's so surprising, exciting and even interesting, it's almost like you read a book; When you have started it, it is very difficult to stop. From the moment Richard Walsh spoke to Jack privately about having a mole inside CTU, I sat for 6:40 hours, which means 10 episodes !!! (It seems funny and crazy, but I'm such a guy who's interested that he just can't stop) This series is one of the best. And it is built to have some different stories connected to each other. Recommended in every way!
