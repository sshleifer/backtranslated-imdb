Producer Joel Schumacher, who also led the "Telephone Cabinet", "02" and many other great movies, showed in great detail how no one can really be killed by the machine, destroying their personalities and the real fears that a person is facing COMBAT when going! Colin Farrell (Roland Bozz), "Intermission", 03, gave one of his best presentations and carried all this picture on his back. Matthew Davis (Jim Paxton), "Blue Crush", "02, Has a Great Supporting Role, and Shea Whigham (Pvt.Wilson)," All Real Girls ", 03, showed their real operational skills in the role he played. A scene where soldiers were able to find a warm romance during a short vacation in the local city and had to pay for their love and sexual desires. One Vietnamese army veteran teacher told soldiers how to really torture the enemy using electrical wires in all the wrong places for a man's male. A pleasant and entertaining film.
