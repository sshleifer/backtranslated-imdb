The first and second seasons began to tremble, averaging between good episodes and sometimes using clich√©s. But when he started to build the universe, where it exists and began to develop it, it became much more fun and fun. The main reason why this exhibition is successful due to four men: Richard Dean Anderson, Peter Deluise, Joseph Malozzie and Paul Mullie. Richard's dry sense of humor shows so much better that Peter's leadership is great and makes every episode so fun and Joe & Paul can never make a funny, interesting episode. <br /> <br /> If you understand what the exhibition is, and feel the signs, I doubt that you don't like this exhibition. For participants entering exhibitions, I suggest "The Side Side", a good serious episode and "Window of Opportunity", a classic comic book episode.
