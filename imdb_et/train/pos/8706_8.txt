What happens if the average Joe discovers he has supernatural powers? The premise may seem familiar. Watchmenid? Impossible? However, the Russian science fiction, The Sword Bearer, is far from conventional. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around a man named Sasha who, as a boy, was out of supernatural power left behind by his society, his peers, and his family. If he wants or his anger allows it, the sword reaches out of his hand, which penetrates his skin. Very Poor? Maybe ... but it's not an interesting part of this movie. All his life was intimidating and anger (and he was terrible) prompted our "hero" to change his life or to find a cause. The only thing he comes up with here is the trouble of meeting an old flame boyfriend leaving him bloodless on the ground. Here is revenge and anger. This is the man you don't want to cross, and from that moment on, the mafia and the police are in their tail. She will meet the girl and fall in love with her as soon as she does, and that's really what the movie is about. <br /> <br /> The film is very impressive, with bold colors and a record with a short but extreme sequence of action. It is an art building that is in its heart, nicely filmed with attention to detail in every scene that is a bright sci-fi activity. This is the strange mask that interests me so much in this movie. Leaders' approach to this genre is refreshing, focusing on Sasha's emotional journey, not a direct action film. Do not worry, however, that it is there and a lot. But many of these sequences show only indirect violence with pictures of terrible consequences. This does not mean that no activity is shown. These scenes are here and are fantastic (especially the end where we see Sasha's full abilities in despair). The director chooses the violence of many scenes to focus on the emotional struggle of the character. It is a tragic love story and refreshing entry into the genre.
