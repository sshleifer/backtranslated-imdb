I saw Freebird's preview of the Isle of Man on TT, as I heard about a couple of motorcycle games. Although I was mainly for racing, I proved that seeing Phil Daniels in a motorcycle movie (yes, I love Quadrophenia like everyone else) proved that I was away from beer and away from partying. Finally! we've done it! we, british, have actually made a big motorcycle movie (and not like a torque), this is the best in the British comedy. Mark my words, this is Phil Daniels' best screen performance, and there is a new British legend for Geoff Bell that makes him know. I loved Gary Stretch in Shane Meadows' fantastic Dead Mans Shoes and here she gives a silent touch that she can proudly add to her growing film. It's a movie not only for our cyclists, but I think everyone (even my girlfriend loved it). I hope it will get the same brilliant response on the continent as it was on the Isle of Man. I'm not going to go into the details of some of the classic scenes of this movie (watch out for the store) because it would break the fun, but I'd say it would look, enjoy and have the best in the night cinema, which has been around for a while. I think it can be a cult classic. As they said in TT ... C'Mon Freebird!
