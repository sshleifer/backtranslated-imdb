The spirits that are still walking are one of those films that grab you and don't let you end, especially when you see it as a child. Looking at the movie as an adult, you have to admit that it is not really scary, but this story is very exciting and contains a great mysterious scene (especially those with horrible mummies). <br /> <br /> One of the best scenes in the film is undoubtedly grandfather and grandmother's scene in her new RV; The stony scene is very exciting and pretty scary. Also, scenes where the main character discovers his mother's secret is pretty scary. <br /> <br /> Okay, movie action is not so big and sometimes the film seems a little boring, but in general the spirits that are still walking are fun. Only a few people saw this film too badly, this film deserves better. I just want to say: Mr. Flocker, you've done a good job! And for all of your Hollywood producers; If you want to make a movie again, do it again!
