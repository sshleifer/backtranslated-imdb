This movie is pure Elvira and shows her breasts ... I mean best! The story (in collaboration with Cassandra Peterson, Elvira alter ego) is inspiring and enchanting and brings Elvira's spirit and charm to life. The viewer gets the chance to see Elvira in a completely new light when he fights against the Massachusetts Fallwell people's predictions (where he has traveled from Los Angeles to attend his great aunt Morganna's will) and at the same time tries to help long-suffering teenagers in the Matriarchal Pariah and the rest of the city council lost in fun. He must also deal with his attraction to Bob Redding, a local cinema owner and another woman (Patty) who is also in Bob's eyes, but not nearly as worthy of his love as Elvira. And later in the film, he is also faced with the complications arising from the "great metaphysical fame" and the accusations of witchcraft raised against him, which means that he is burned at stake. Elvira manages to be both sexy and vulnerable in this movie, on the street and naive, while breaking the risque jokes and offering double-minded attacks. <br /> <br /> This movie is inspiring because it gives out a message never giving up and always trying to follow your dreams. Finally, Elvira's dreams finally come true, which is the best thing that can happen to this wonderfully unique and determined woman. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie countless times and I've never been tired of it! There are no unnecessary scenes, and I found myself exciting throughout the movie. The review does not make the real movie fair, so I'm just telling you that PLEASE watch it because it's one of the best movies ever made! In the meantime, I wish you unpleasant dreams!
