I bought this movie a few days ago and thought it would be a pretty nice movie. But when I shut it down on a DVD player, it surprised me very well. James Belushi plays very well like Bill "The Mouth" Manuccie. But especially Timothy Dalton has a very good role as a Sheriff. The final scene of Bill's House is very good, good camera work, nice dialogue and a great acting. Bill "The Mouth" Manuccie has stolen $ 12 million from the mafia. Together with his wife, he lives in a South Carolina witness protection program. But the Mafia is watching her and wants $ 12 million. Bill can only trust the only person he knows from within.
