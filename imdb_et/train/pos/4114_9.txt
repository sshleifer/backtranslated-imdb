The title of this movie doesn't make much sense until you see it, because it is the sound a slow young man does when he works his imaginary cart that he does all day. And he is just one of many unusual symbols in this surreal and sometimes tragic story in the Japanese population. be an architect and his young son, whom he will send for food. There's a wise man who seems to be a pillar of common sense around him, and there's a businessman who has some serious nerves with a woman who treats him (and everyone else) like dirt. There is no specific plot on it, really, this is a number of stories that travel back and forth, sometimes funny, sometimes tragic. All in all, I thought it worked pretty well, and I was dead to see it for a long time only on the basis of this description. I wasn't the least disappointed and I would definitely recommend it. 9 out of 10
