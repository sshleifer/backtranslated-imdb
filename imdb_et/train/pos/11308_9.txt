TCM keeps me awake all the time ... they continue to appear. I've never heard of ... Senso .... now Ossessione ... very early Visconti movie! ... wow ... the Italian version of Postman always twice ... brilliant !! worked beautifully and led ... Never heard of either of those who were great, Clara Calamai, like Giovanna, and especially Massimo Girotti as Gino ... what a sensual man! more muscular and attractive than anyone else on the screen 1943 !!! His appearance was ahead of his time ... many men from the 1950s apparently celebrated him ... he should have been a big star in the world! The film is much better than the version of Jack Nicholson / Jessica Lange and less glossy than the MGM version (which I really like) with John Garfield and Lana Turner I remember this white dress? who can forget .... This italian version is different .. more realistic and with a very different ending ... look at it ... i am going to buy it!
