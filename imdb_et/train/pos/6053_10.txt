Comedy Pearl. A lot of laughter, shop and pub scenes were unchecked. The characters are recognizable and the dialogue is well observed - I know such people! Humor is surprisingly gentle and the film (it may seem strange) puts me in mind Ealing's comedy. It is a peculiar little film with many details. It will certainly take a number of views. I watched it a few times (I've shown all my friends!) And I notice something new every time - a little bit of dialogue, something visual that I never had before. I was really kidding in the movie and finding a few flaws, but I'm not going to, because in general it's a very fun, good-looking movie that is really worth it and what anyone with a sense of humor needs to enjoy. It's a movie that finds its friends and I hope there's a lot of them. Oh .... and he has a great soundtrack.
