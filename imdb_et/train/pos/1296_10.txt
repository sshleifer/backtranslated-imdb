It's an extremely difficult movie to watch, especially as it is the inner core of our entire life. But in the end it is a very beautiful and deeply moving film. Anyone who thinks it is cynical must say that they have to be completely lost from the entire message point of the whole movie. For those who are actually watching the film, they see that the way the problem is handled is absolutely necessary and the result is ultimately uplifting. Of course, it is very difficult to look at a difficult subject and even brutal. However, it is very important for society and for everyone. It shows the top of what the world cinema is doing now (I don't limit it to France alone) and everyone should try it. I say it is best to go with a clear head without contradictory views, and just let the film work.
