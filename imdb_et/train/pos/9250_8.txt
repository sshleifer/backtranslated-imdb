Clark Gable plays a man who strikes the life of a hard-boiled dame Jean Harlow. She tries to suck her when she is practicing her with her tough-gal attitude. Despite their cynicism and weakness, they fall in love. When Gable kills a man by chance, he runs out, leaving a loyal to Harlow's women's prison where he finds he's pregnant. Anita Loos and Howard Emmett Rogers' writings are great with many well-drawn and surprising characters (including a Jewish socialist woman in jail and a black woman in jail and her preacher father hardly playing a stereotype). Gable and Harlow show that actors add their own nuances and letters to their characters who send them beyond the usual Gable and Harlow role. And the direction is much better than expected from Sam Wood. One beautiful shot is entering the Harlow Prison, and then surprisingly, he took a snowy courtyard when the camera was pursuing. It is one of the best genres of "criminals in love" and "female prison" and has one of the best hard-boiled dialogues ever written.
