It grew to me. I love R.D. I found a lot of what I liked when moving the movie, despite Burman's music and the story of the coarser elements. The plot of the Venna-nurse plot is powerful, I thought; there is also a more likely mandatory stuff, such as bar struggles, a natural criminal story, etc. that is just disturbing. (Although this has not failed in a certain sense.) Also, the English translation is definitely someone to whom it was a little stretching, and as loony as I am grateful to him. <br /> <br /> Like many Bollywood movies I've seen, it's melodramatic and opera-like, including the song that the first little boy sang here to rejoice in his abusive and unhappy sister and then the same song for 12 or so years Later, when a man who traveled to Kathmandu and wished to get in touch with this girl grew up and worried (he had said his brother and mother were dead), anesthetizing his pain with drugs. The super thing about this 1971 movie is that it is a hippie movement that, from Indian point of view, brought India observers who see them as people who have led India to mental hunger caused by its lack. in their societies, but still in India, who only live for a moment's enjoyment. Hippie song-dance-stunning scenes are truly wonderful and accurate in their shades (I am old enough to remember), and I feel pretty confident that the masses of young white-zone children are real hippie accessories, as I remember listening to children from Caravan Bollywood. <br /> <br /> (This does not apply to the actual movement of Hare Krishna, although the hippies of the movie sing the song of Krishna / Rama, as well as the group of real Indian devotees in the film's opening image that are not related to hippies.) <br /> > ~ Virginia
