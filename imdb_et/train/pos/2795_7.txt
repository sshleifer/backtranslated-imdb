I love playing football and I thought this movie was great because it had a lot of football. It was a good Hollywood / Bollywood movie and I'm glad to have won 17 awards. Parminder Nagra and Kiera Knightley were good and so was Archie Punjabi. Jonathon Rheyes Meyers was a disappointment, however. Jazz (Parminder Nagra) loves playing football, but his parents want him to learn how he wants to marry him. When Jazz begins to play the football team secretly, he meets Julia (Kiera Knightlety) and Joe (Jonathon Rhyes Meyers), his coach. When his parents discover problems, but his father lets him play a big night out for his sisters Pinky (Archie Punjab). Finally, his parents understand how much he loves football and lets him play abroad.
