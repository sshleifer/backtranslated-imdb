Several stories are interwoven here with different female characters. The shoes they wear are a sign of their difficult lives. Everything changes at the end of the movie. Adela (Antonia San Juan) leads the brothel; His daughter Anita (Monica Cervera) has a slow and limited life. Leire (Najwa Nimri) is a shoe designer for losers and gifts loser; Maricarmen (Vicky Peña) has lost her husband and is now raising children from her dead ex-wife. Isabel (Ángela Molina) is a boring rich lady. <br /> <br /> There are other characters used to connect the five main female characters. Not everything in the storytelling is at the beginning: some of the connections are surprisingly late in the movie and this adds to the experience. The shoe theme moves to extreme situations: for example, when Leire is a shoe-designer and works in a shoe shop where she steals her shoes, she interrupts one of her heels. <br /> <br /> Editing small connections between scenes. The phone rings, the cigarette lights up, the story, etc. Frequency change often keeps it dull or reaches the TV level. It is strongly music-based to set the tone and atmosphere. The cities of Madrid and Lisbon are the basis for the northwest, and the techniques of these cities are used to expand the story beyond the characters. One of the most moving shots is when Anita, who does the same walk every day, extends her walk and limited life from the relative peace of her street to the busy main road. How the space limitation is visually translated. As with most Spanish films, many conversations are made visually using soap-like stories as a simple background. There is a poetic ending that is somewhat romantic and sentimental, but still beautiful. <br /> <br /> Because Ramón Salazar is too fond of his material, it's too long. Some scenes are kitsch and soap levels, including acting (Adela's love life, Isabel's doctor). The footwear theme is an exaggerated and weak metaphor. <br /> <br /> This is often compared to Magnolia because the structure is the same. But they are different. Magnolia is technically more competent but somewhat mechanistic. It has more ability to visually translate emotions and the atmosphere. After you have seen it, you tend to move to the new movie town of Madrid right away.
