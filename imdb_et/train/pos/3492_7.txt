Not as bad a movie as I thought it would be. <br /> <br /> It's good.Nice to see Roger Moore's screen and the use of other British actors. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see more of Olivia D`Abo in future projects. She can play sexy Maryam D'Abo in front of her cousin. <br /> <br /> Also using good invisible places like Luxembourg. > <br /> Hopefully we will see such UK-European co-productions.
