Some movies in the genre must be dressed. It was an exception. It is on its own, it is a version of the genre film. With minimal special effects, it can be a psychological study that has a simple but existential theme that hits the bus and why does it do it? This is not a great movie, but because it is a little crowded, the story works. Fine and all interacting with characters. In fact, opening scenes are one contest, but it can be placed there just to tint what comes. I appreciate the energy balance between men and women and do not recommend this story to anyone who is more interested than people who respond to the physical and psychological challenge. You enjoy the movie if you have some empathy, value a little adventure in your life and think, "What would I do in this situation?"
