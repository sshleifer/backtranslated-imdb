What is "Cry Freedom" Like? It is just a great and unique experience of South Africa and how white people have repressed the black people of this country. The main character of the story is Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), editor in chief of the Daily Dispatch in South Africa. Woods writes several articles in which he speaks critically about Steve Biko's (Denzel Washington) views. Soon, Wood will meet with the Bike and he will change his views on him and he will also understand what the authorities are doing to the black people in South Africa (directly from the top, even from the police chief). When Biko dies in police custody, Woods decides that he must write a book about him and that whatever he has to publish. But Woods has to flee his country to get the book published, and he has to put his family in second place so that the world can know the truth. <br /> <br /> Attenborough managed to make people a good movie with the main message that black and white are the same because we are all human. The story takes us to South Africa and this (film) is a great way for the world to know what happened in this country, and I'm disappointed that only 3,200 people rated it. It's a movie we can all learn. Although this story is a bit long, this story could not be presented in shorter ways, because the director wanted to show us how difficult it was for Woods to publish the book after Biko's death. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Woods and Biko was also great, like the families of these two people and all the problems they are going through. But sometimes sacrifices must be made (Biko's death) so that truth can be revealed (Woods book).
