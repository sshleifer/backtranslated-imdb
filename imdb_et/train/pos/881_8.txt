"Read My Lips" speaks of a strange symbiosis that develops between a normal, socially maladrated female office worker (Devos) and her workplace trainee, Crude Oil (Casel). As the film makes this unlikely duo into its identities, they become innocent in cooling the senses, each of which uses each other for their own selfish reasons with extraordinary results. Good things for anyone with strong psychodromatic sub-currents. In French it is easy to read subtitles and good translations. (B +)
