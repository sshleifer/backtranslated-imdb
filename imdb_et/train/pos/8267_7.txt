Harvard Brown is a heavy film that can be captured. We are expecting a lot more films from these days, so it will help to keep in mind that the audiences of the 20s were a bit more innocent. William Haines is charming like a rogue who has to stumble through pain and humiliation to find success and even honor. All the film's relationships feel extremely remarkable for the homoerotic bond between Billy and Jack Pickford. The film has everything, romance, tears, love, death and even sports ... It is a great education for the transformation of society in the 20th century.
