I see a lot of really negative posts by people written in August, even though the movie wasn't released in the US until at least mid-September. Perhaps those happy emigrants who live in S. Korea who saw it early. I'm in the US and saw it just today. I thought the special effects were great, better than the trailer. The story was non-western, but I think we are all accustomed to it with many other films. It wasn't difficult to follow at all. Managers were weak, but other people were pretty good. There was also humor all the time. I appreciated it from 8 because I had the time to see what I was doing.
