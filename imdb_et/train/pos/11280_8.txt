Very interesting entertainment with the charm of old films. Tarzan is hesitant to face the greatest threats when the moment demands it, and we all enjoy his success with him. For me, the most unusual thing for me is a person without special powers, who beat them with human skills (he was a big swimmer and had a big shout)
