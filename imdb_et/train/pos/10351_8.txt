When Chamberlain's family is near Australian Ayers Rock, Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep) sees her baby pulled out of her tent by a dingo and then begins a challenge that no one should experience. Because the public or the press does not seem to believe the dingo story, and the whole thing becomes a circus. Lindy doesn't help things because she doesn't play a jury or courtroom, she's just herself, and she's a tough nut to break, so of course everyone thinks she's guilty because there's evidence that hasn't come to light. Sam Neill is great as Seventh-day Adventist Pastor Michael Chamberlain, who has doubts about his faith and perhaps his wife. It is good (or bad) to see that people are both prejudices and stupid elsewhere, as well as in these countries, because the Australian public does not believe this story and the media only fans of the flames. Finally, Lindy is found guilty and sent to jail for hard work, but years later there is a lack of evidence and she has been released, but only after the family's life has it been destroyed. A heart-breaking story, very well done, a bit long but worth it. 8 out of 10.
