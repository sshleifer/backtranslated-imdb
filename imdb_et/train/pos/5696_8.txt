What do you do with a 14-inch dropped porn star who participated in drugs and murders and then died of AIDS? You're naturally making a movie. The probable reason for not having done it before is that Eddie Nash would have been on her own production. It is therefore no coincidence that the film was made a little while after the Nash was sent to prison. <br /> <br /> The best movie is its fast pace. There is no time to waste unnecessary mess. And why would it be? There is too much good material to demand scenes of dull fillers. The cast is good. Kilmer has been mediocre in a film-like environment, so here was the ultimate role for him. Bosworth is cute, so it's irrelevant how he works (he's sure), and McDermott, who is otherwise quite annoying, is pretty good because he carries so many facial hairs that I didn't know him initially. (I would like them to do a cruise for every movie so I shouldn't look at my seeing face.) I couldn't fully recognize Christina Applegate and she wouldn't have known it if I hadn't seen her end credit. Kudrow is charming than ever before, a bit unusual to see her in a dramatic role. (Btw, "Friends" is the worst TV channel of all time). The only questionable choices were the early involvement of Carrie Fischer and the totally absurd involvement of the 90s by Janone Garofalo. You thought I'd add Paris Hilton, isn't it? No, I think Hilton is the perfect choice for its 10-second appearance as a stupid whore. Because film is, among other things, decadence? and about porn actress? it fits perfectly.
