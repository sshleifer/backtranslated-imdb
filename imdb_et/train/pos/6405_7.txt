I thought that racism and prejudices against Carl Brashear were overwhelming with the Hollywood effect. I don't think the US Navy was ever so publicly racist. I can't imagine a full captain, a senior officer who ever tells his driver that he is deliberately banging someone. Surely his life is not a danger. And there has never been a very small officer who would forever be biased against everyone, but WASPs as DeNiro's character. None of the leaders who were as buggy and drunk as he was playing would never have become a superpower. Cuban Gooding otherwise recorded a badly made movie.
