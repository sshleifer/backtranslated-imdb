This is one of my favorite comedies. The film does not want to accept its hero's lifestyle, but for what is worth and not for trivializing alcoholism, the film is just fun. It is unlikely to tell the story forever in a drunken, irresponsible 40 something of a bachelor's degree called Arthur, who must inherit a great fortune, but only when he marries Susan, because the family thinks he can do something about him. Arthur proposes, but then he suddenly falls to Linda, the waitress and the tiny early. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore is perfect as Arthur, the world's most enjoyable drunk, whose antics are laughing at a minute. Moor IS Arthur and I agree with those who can't imagine any other role in this role. Girls' ladies are also well illustrated. Liza Minnell shines like Linda and her screen chemistry with Moore is great. Jill Clayburgh plays Susan, a rich and more suitable woman who has been chosen for Arthur. <br /> <br /> But this film is literally made by Sir John Gielgud, who depicts Arthur's sarcastic but moral butler, Hobson. It is obvious that the two have had a great deal of mutual affection during Hobson's long-term employment. Hobson is Arthur's best friend and sender of unwanted comments and advice. The most interesting relationship in this film is not Arthur's romance, but his unusual relationship with this spiritual and, of course, permanently abandoning servant. This is a butcher who remembers the longest after the closing credit.
