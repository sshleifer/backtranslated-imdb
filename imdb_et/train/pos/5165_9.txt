This piece of the band, from adults who return to their youth summer summer camp, was a very quiet immigrant in the fall of 1993, and a miser. It was said that it was disgraceful, but then there are some better movies ARE silent publications that don't get much leap or praise. <br /> <br /> Diane LAne, Kevin Pollack, Elizabeth Perkins, Vincent Spano, Julie Warner, Bill Paxton, Kimberly Williams, Matt Craven, and Alan Arkin people who have passed the old old and bad and funny memories. This film includes gambit of emotions, which is usually pleasant, and the film does not let the viewer recognize what the characters are, preferring to allow viewers to enter the memories themselves. Since I'm a movie viewer who brushing horribly, tough manipulation in movies, this is something I appreciate by writer / director Mike Binder. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great cheap rental, a good headquarters and even a nice sitting at the theater. You can go over it on television and I would definitely recommend seeing the view.
