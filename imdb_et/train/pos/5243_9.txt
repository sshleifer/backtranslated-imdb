I was looking for this movie because I am a new Frain fan and wanted to see more of my work. First, his Irish accent is great. He seems to have troubled dialects. His behavior was wonderful, as usual. Aside from James Frain, I thought the film was very well done. It showed the conflict in Northern Ireland * as a confusion * that really is. Both sides are guilty of serious injustices and men who have entered the conflict usually have little to say about their situation. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting to understand that not every man (or woman) who is supposed to fight for his country is really * just *. For example, if Kenny (James Frain) asks Ginger (Ian Hart) why he does this, Ginger cannot make a morally acceptable response. Why? Since ginger is not in this country to protect its country or the rights of its Protestants, ginger is fun to kill. He's full of blood lust and it's the perfect job for a man like him. In such a fight, guys like Liam (John Lynch) just want to live their lives and enjoy their families ... boys who see all the struggles are just fighting. There are boys like Kenny who are born leaders full of charisma and they add fuel to the flames, rather they mean or not. Kenny also believes in a "cause". He believes that what he does will make a difference in the future ... which is a bit strange because his character seems too intelligent for it. But like many other seemingly intelligent men, he is sucked into a gang lifestyle that doesn't even understand it ... 'it's too late. Then Ginger, a pure psycho who is not in any other fight, but because of the excitement that makes him a valuable asset in a gangland-type war, some may claim. But now, in this movie, Ginger has come out and has become a very dangerous open cannon. <br /> <br /> Everything reaches the boiling point and predictably this end is tragic. What makes this film worthy is that both sides of that age are an old conflict. Being an American, I cannot begin to fully understand what all is fighting. But I know there's a better way out there. <br /> <br /> All in all, well done, moving ... but disturbing film.
