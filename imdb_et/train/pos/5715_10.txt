Karen goes to the Japanese house Emma's sister, a weird woman who sleeps the day and wakes up at night. Karen goes upstairs when she hears a ghastly ghost. He is studying the secrets of the house. <br /> <br /> It's very scary! Scenes are shocking and scary! The characters are good. The settings are horrible. I love the whole plot! The end was shocking! I stopped in a scene where a little boy drove so loudly to a man who found his sister up and I was shocked. This is the most frightening film I watched. I didn't see the Japanese version. I recommend it to spooky fans. 10/10 and 5 stars!
