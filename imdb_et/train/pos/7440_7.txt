I just saw a movie and a frightening thing that people talking during the movie sounded like actors. There were moments in the film, but it was left behind and was quite sick. All this was supposed to be a farce, but if you see the pathetic life of the people in the movie, you think you like it all around us. stupid thing after another. The plus side has some big (and funny) insults. I think I'm waiting for the video, but it was a good laugh. WARNING - Jerry takes off his shirt during the movie! (not quite in the eye!)
