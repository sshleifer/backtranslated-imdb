This film moves without a sentimental nature - meaningful, without pretense. It tells a simple story about a family that is in danger of breaking down, as the penetration of technology and the progressive society make the family business increasingly unacceptable. <br /> <br /> Operation is wonderful - although none of us have probably heard these actors in the West, we would have had a long time ago - they play their characters honestly and with respect - these are bad characters, each with great weaknesses but so much of humanity and kindness that it is impossible not to participate in this story needs. <br /> <br /> We need more of these movies - we need more Western movies to create such movies.
