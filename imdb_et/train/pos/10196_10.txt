Kudos Cesar to Montana to revive Cebuano movie! Panaghoy sa Suba is very good - it has drama, action, romance and a scene that makes you laugh. <br /> <br /> Although the story is not the original (love triangle or quadrangular love, Japanese occupation, rebellion, American as lord), its presentation is something cool, especially it uses the original language - Filipino, nipongo Japanese and for English. <br /> <br /> This movie will be one of the best Pinoy movies this year. <br /> <br /> Go see it!
