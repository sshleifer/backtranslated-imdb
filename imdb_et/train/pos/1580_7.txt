This is not yet another look at the Holocaust, but rather an intimate story of the events that took place on a small street in Berlin and some of the people involved. This film begins in New York, where Ruth Weinstein (Jutta Lampe) has mourned the death of his wife and family members. Ruth's daughter Hannah (Maria Schrader) is slowly learning that her mother brought Aryan's wife, Lena Fischer (Doris Schade), so she is traveling to Germany and looking for a 90-year-old who talks about Rosenstrasse. <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> Lena speaks in Berlin in 1943, where Gestapo keeps all Jewish spouses in a building on Rosenstrasse, although they should be immune Aryan's marriage and within nine days would wait for a group of women outside and called for their release. Eight years old Ruth (Svea Lohde) is waiting for her mother to come out and has nothing to go to, but she will meet 33-year-old Len (Katja Riemann) who will take her in. Lena's husband Fabian (Martin Feifel) is also inside and finally tries to communicate with Nazi officers so they can do something. <br /> <br /> This film is directed by Margarethe von Trotta, who makes her first feature film for almost ten years after working on television, and although it is clearly not one of her most provocative efforts, she continues to be one of the most respectable directors in Europe. It is not one of those Nazi films where we look at the terrible inhumane acts of the Jews, even though we see some serious treatments, but it is a small event that meant life and death for those involved. This film does not attempt to shock anyone or open the door to discussions about the situation, but what he just wants to do is just a light little but real life event that occurred in the historical period. Part of the strength of the films comes from his actors and there are some good performances that appear especially in Riemann and Young Lohs, and it is always good to see Schrader (Aimee & Jaguar) central. It's not a great movie or anything that would change your perspective during World War II, but given that innocent lives were killed because of the events that took place, I think this reason alone is enough to convey this true story.
