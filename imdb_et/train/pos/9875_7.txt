Lily Mars (MGM, 1943) is a lovely movie, but I think it could have been better. Judy Garland is great, as always, but some movie scenes seem far away and her and Van Heflin's romance is developing too fast. <br /> <br /> For one minute she was ready to beat her butt, but the next minute she fell in love with her. I believe this production, movie editing and scripting (although photography was great, the landscape was nice and the costumes were nice) could have been a little better. It would seem that production is too hasty. <br /> <br /> Supporting casting was also good, especially for Janet Chapman as the second youngest daughter of her daughter, Rosie. She's 11 years old, she really looks cute and is ashamed that she didn't become a teen comic artist. He is much better off in this film than in his earlier films as Warner Brothers at the end of the 1930s (except for the Broadway Musketeers in 1938, he is very good at it) when they tried to make him a Shirley temple / Sybil Jason hybrid. All in all, this movie may be better, but eventually Judy gave her everything.
