I felt a movie about it and a lot of fun, not surprised. I was also surprised that Paulie's voice was made by Jay Mohr. The performance was so subtly nuanced that he did not stay at Schmaltz and became too hard to relax with New Jersey, so I thought it should be an old man, not Mohr, a child. Very impressive performance and really gratifying to see her talent taken seriously in the exotic, indie movie series.
