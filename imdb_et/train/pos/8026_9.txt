For the whole movie, you might think that this movie is only for kids. Well, it is mainly targeted at them, but it is also rounded enough, jokes also referred to the audience of adults. This time, the Muppet's gang is trying to get to Broadway, getting into terrible violence so they don't produce it, so they break down. But Kermit won't stop, and his determination keeps things going until he reaches the car and sends him to amnesia! <br /> <br /> This is partly the sending of old-fashioned vehicles coming from the 40's musicians, the theme of music, but there's a lot of zaninesis and wonderful moments thrown into pots. hysterically funny moments (Lou Zealand's boomerang fish; Gonzo's water-stunt display, a whispering campaign among many others), but also a lot of heart. Mupet's writers are not terrifying of the conventions, on the contrary, they accept them, where it is almost refreshing to see a story that shows the story of the show, where through the thick and think the characters fulfill their dream. <br /> <br /> Although not as original as Muppet Movie, it has received many memorable and memorable songs, great locations all over Manhattan, and even some intonations about inter-species (and marriage)! Cameos include Liza Minnel ("Frog?"), Elliot Gould (as a police officer), Brooke Shields (on a rat proposal), Edward I. Koch, Gregory Hines and Joan Rivers. So get ready to sing together or just a lot of great laughs and a romantic (yes romantic) time with one of the best Muppet movies.
