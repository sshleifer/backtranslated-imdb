I went to see Ashura as the 2005 Fantasia Festival Kickoff. Man, it was one cool. The director was supposed to be Canada's premiere in Montreal, but for health reasons, she's still in Japan ... oh my lord, I hope she heals and makes a lot of other movies. <br /> <br /> It's quite simple, but somewhat original ... Demons migrate to Edos in Japan and Swordsmans are called "Demon Wardens" who kill them and are afraid of Ashura, the demon goddess who sleeps and allegedly is very struck. /> <br /> It brings us to Izum ... an elite meter called "Demon Slayer" and his friend Jaku, who is a typical violent jealous ass ... <br /> <br /> It seems boring? Well now it thickens .... <br /> <br /> Izumo took his retirement from killing demons because he killed a young child with the "impression" that he was a demon, he didn't know, but he killed him. So Izumo went with his life and recovered himself at Kabuki Theater. On a nice evening boat ride, Izumo bounces on a girl covering the bridge and it changes her life and relaunches the demons ... good reason, love cause and fucking ... the man knows how to handle the sword and pull the fun massacre. <br /> <br /> Izumo carries the movie as much as he is playing ... he's the whole package ... he knows how to fight (hell yes he knows), he's witty, he's intelligent and he has this blade . You never have to yell, "NO IZUMO, it's TRAP". The man already knows that he has this common sense. She's really a perfect hero. <br /> <br /> In cinematic art, aesthetics are quite interesting. It's far from a film that looks like a manga. It's creamy full of special effects and nothing stops this movie realistically ... it's pretty amazing. Many colors are "unrealistic" photography, except that ... it is quite simple ... but as I said, the main character of movie A must see, the story with masterful hands
