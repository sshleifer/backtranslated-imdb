I thought this movie was very well put together. Voice commands were also great. I liked how they all overcome their conflicts and achieved their goals. I recommend this movie to anyone. It was definitely worth the time and money to watch it. There are some comics in Atlantis that made me laugh. Other scenes made me sad. And others made me happy. This is a movie of any age you can enjoy. From the moment Milo is a crazy "professor" or until he collects a team under a fantastic cruise. After watching the movie, I read the book. It was also good, but the movie brings you better pictures. It's like a book. But go ahead and watch this movie!
