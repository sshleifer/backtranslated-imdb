Of all the reviews, most people have been very difficult with Alexandre. Marie and Veronika never felt that they wanted to keep Alexandre especially, being only a little intelligent, though not at all intellectual, as most of us are, but it is difficult for anyone to admit. Alexandre lives perfectly in life, being fully cared for, receiving and giving what she wants. girls promise it, veronika loves sex, marie is her patron. Is there anything like that? Is anyone in love? really? I do not belive. Although the French New Wave cinema is prone to prophecy and so on, it's just wonderful because it doesn't need a plot to create an emotion. Easy is completely cute and anyone in Alexandre, in an urban area, can ask. I'm looking for a patron, anyone interested?
