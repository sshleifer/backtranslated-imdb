Bette Midler is again divine! Disgustingly humorous. In love with Burleski. We can bring you to tears with old jokes and new dresses or only with old songs that have more power and punch than ever. All in All Singing new ballads, powerful singing for old / perennials like "Rose"; "Stay with me" and yes, even "Winds under my wings". The best way to judge Divine Miss M has always been slippery - because it is best for her, I strongly recommend to anyone who has an eye-catching and acclaimed adult and the unhappy desire of the child to push all the limits!
