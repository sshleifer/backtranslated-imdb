The story is said to be liquid. No interruptions. Flashes are smoothly woven. Casting was great. Young Ya'ara seemed very similar to Ya'ara, who would have looked at that age. His blind man was convincing. Director Daniel Syrkin has done an excellent job of getting the different participants to work together on this story. Cinematography is very good. You feel you're with Ya'ara and Talia with the ocean to the edge of the cliff. English subtitles follow the Hebrew script very closely. It is interesting to note that although "outstanding" is not a direct translation of "Lemarit Ayin", both names are very suitable for the story.
