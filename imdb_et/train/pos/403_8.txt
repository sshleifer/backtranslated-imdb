I remember that the Zu Legend trailer was quite impressive and A Man Called Hero (my all-time favorite) fan, I decided on Storm Riders to see it. I know that Ekin Cheng's ability to act is a lot of criticism, but he's still my favorite Hong Kong moviestar (better than Nicolas Tse) and he's one of the factors I enjoyed in this movie. Undoubtedly, this film is a work of art from beginning to end. I even thought that only the actors were real and everything else was created with a computer at the end of this movie. They have had a lot of work to do and deserve good credit for it. The story of the movie was a fairy tale between good and evil with a love story that has been thrown (I think Ekin Cheng pulls the girls easily). The story isn't very intellectual and deep, but that's not what you expect when you make a movie. I wanted martial arts competitions to be fisted and fisted instead of magic battles, but it is also life and it never goes as you want. And why did they sound in the sky through supersonic planes? It's too funny. The Zu legend cannot be a man who is called a stranger in my eyes, but it flows like a video game and it's not bad at all. If a company decides to play games on this film, I can't be surprised because it carries all the elements of video games. Good job. Please make such fantastic movies more
