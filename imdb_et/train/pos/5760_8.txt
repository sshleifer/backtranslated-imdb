My room-mate ordered it out of the web at one time and finally got to see it. It's great. This is fun. It's pretty stupid ... but it's fun too. I mean, this was the most fun we've been looking at when watching such a movie, because Walking Dead City has been before. It was like being at the old Drive-In Theater! You could say who made this movie, liked all the terrible dubbed zombie films. It has all the clich√©s and tricks of those films that have been rolled into one, and it's clean, because it's NOT to be like that. The burning factor is high, gore flows and laughs roll! The effect goes from the slack to the good, where the boy is broken in half, and where the man gets his heart, pulls through his chest, both excellent! Working really terrible is pretty good. There's not a lot of land but lots and lots of gore. It is patterned after the Italian and Spanish zombie films because they will remain forever, like this film. If you like Troma movies, cheerful Class B stuff, you can't look at it wrong. Nice way to waste Friday night!
