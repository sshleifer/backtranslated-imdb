I think this movie is very fun and spooky. I love Elvira and I like this movie. It is very unfortunate that the second half of this wonderful film did not succeed because it is very funny as the first part. I also regret that, in addition to this film, I do not see Cassandra Peterson in other films. I think he's an amazing actor with great potential. I hope II will see him in the third part of Elvira's adventures in the future. Cassandra Peterson is one of my favorite comedy actors. Cassandra, if you read it, know you're the best and my heart is with you. You can trust me. What can I add? It's a cool and classic movie!
