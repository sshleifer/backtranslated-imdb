Budget Restrictions, Time Limits, Scripting and Cutting, Cutting, Cutting ... This team is a good group of young filmmakers; well thought out - yes, allegorical - with the effect of zero dollar clever when time and knowledge are all you have, relying on actors and friends and friendly others for your time, dedication, places; and get the box for the first time, 1-in-1000. These guys are making movies. Good. Take a look at your short collection of "Heartland Horrors" and see developments. And I can assure you that working with them is about the most fun thing you did for business. I am harsh, insulting criticism of this film, wondering if one observer even heard a word of dialogue, thought of one thought or concept, or if all that work was desirable was visual vision and hitting to satisfy some meaningless views of it what the horror should mean to the audience. Let "The Empty Acre" bring you. Don't predict what you think it should be just because it gets into the horror / thriller genre due to its supernatural situation. It is a deeper drama of how far you can paste a blade against someone who respects a message that does not attack the visual environment of your brain, but rather relies on your empathic imagination to experience the suffering of others' minds and minds. mark ridgway, curtis, "empty acres"
