This is a pleasant film, even if the premise is stupid. It was a sort of guilty pleasure to watch. It seems that Meg Ryan can pull out roles in such a movie (another example is Joe vs. Volcano). It makes him a star, partly. Of course, Walter Matthau also had this ability and he really does play a role in making fun, heartfelt Einstein. I think you could say that they both represent lovable signs, although they love them in different ways (loving young women vs. loving worship).
