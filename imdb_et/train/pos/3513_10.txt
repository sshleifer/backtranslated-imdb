Actor Herman Jos√© plays the role of a football player as a football player who acquires two African player passports and tries to sell them for very little money to the rival club of Benfica (his heart club), FC Porto, so these players didn't play well and he wanted FC Port to hurt him. But what happens is that these two players are all good and FC Porto sells them a lot of money to a foreign club, doing good business. A small country like Portugal, a film that has no big predecessors in big films, is a very good and funny comedy that shows the whole competition between Portugal and North (FC Porto / Benfica). Highly recommended
