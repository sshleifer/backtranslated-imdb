I saw the brothers in the Tribeca film festival and loved it! Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen are great as father and son. The film follows Scott Cohen's return from Alaska to his family in Brooklyn. He sees it because his brother is dead, and he begins his journey to slowly improve his stranger relationship with his brother's wife and child and his father, who has never given her a black family of sheep. The story takes us deeply into the heart and minds of this family and allows you to understand more deeply the complexity of your life. Woodworking company images and Brooklyn's background also define this rich and revealing family portrait.
