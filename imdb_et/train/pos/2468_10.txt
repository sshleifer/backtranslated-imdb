I went to watch Hamlet because I was between jobs. I thought 4 hours would be great, I've been a fan of Branagh; Dead Again, Henry V. I was totally puzzled by the film's management, acting, cinematography. Like other reviews, they move 4 hours quickly. Branagh doesn't play Hamlet, he's Hamlet, he was born for it. When I watch this movie, I try to constantly find mistakes, I watched the horses and didn't notice them. How he managed to move the camera and mirrors from all mirrors to me, a mystery. This movie was shot at 70 million. It's a shame that Columbia hasn't released this widescreen version of VHS. I have a DVD player and I would take it with Titanic every day. So Columbia, when you listen, put this movie out as it should be seen! And I don't know what happened to the Oscar. It should have been the best picture, the best actor, the best direction, the best cinematography. What kind of movies did they watch? I felt sorry for Branaghi for Oscar when he paid tribute to Shakespeare on the screen. They should have paid tribute to Branagh to bring us into one of the greatest films of the time.
