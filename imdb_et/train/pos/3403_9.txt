Gorgeous Techicolor production that tells an unusual story about a strong religious woman romance and Trapp's monk who left her monastery in violation of her promises. The film opens in a monastery in Europe, where a former student prays - a lonely black black called Domini (Marlene Dietrich). The mother's boss advises her to go into the wilderness and "find herself" and lose her death over her recently dead father. On the train, he goes to Sahara for a very, very restless man (Charles Boyer) - our former monk. She is near a hotel near a palm-shaped oasis where she sees our mysterious restless person again because she has been tempted over what to do if she is facing a very seductive dance girl. Domini gets with her friends, though she doesn't know anything about her past - a romantic soon to follow. <br /> <br /> This movie is sentimental, melodramatic and different (in some ways almost surreal and even a bit campy) - I found it to be quite fun and fun. Photography is really interesting in it - it is full of extreme close-ups of the face and beautiful colorful horse-drawn caravans that cross the desert, silhouettes drawing a sunset. Marlene Dietrich gives a beautiful, though restrained, idea here and sees pride. Charles Boyer - not usually one of my favorites - is actually pretty good at it, I think this part fits him and he looks pretty young and pretty. Basil Rathbone is good here, except for very little to do. Another great orchestra by Max Steiner helps keep the drama rolling - all this is a very enjoyable movie.
