It's for sure that one of the best stand-up shows evre. EVER. Eddie is so close to the wall that I saw this fucking show for almost five years, and it always tends to go. Just about everything from her big, wide-ranging physical comedy to the top of the head's remarks, this is a masterpiece. You don't have to look any further than this line "The word herb. You say erb, and we'll say the herb, if it is". Brilliant.
