I lived through these times and I think the program was at the center of the era. I think it should have dealt with a more African-American issue, but I think it covers a lot of the program. It was scary to sit and watch the T V riots hoping they wouldn't go as far as your families and that it wouldn't burn. I thought Jerry O'Connell did a great job, which was a vet coming back from the war. I went to the school where you came back. Some had changed more than others and some not so much. It bothers me if someone commented that the problem was not sufficiently covered or it was not fun enough. Life through and make comments. I thought the film was great and that all the work done on it was a great job. Thank you for your journey (sad and good) on the memory card.
