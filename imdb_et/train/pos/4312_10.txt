If you have not seen this wonderful film of life in the 90s (L.A.), you have forgotten the special care. It is one of the most amazing and powerful films ever made about the lives of Americans in the 1990s, and it even carries the modern world we live in. love, adultery, empty nest syndrome, selfishness, etc. and the list goes on. This story is based on the ultimate climax, and when nothing else matters, it always goes to love with friends and family, and with the love of life. It helps us dig inside and make us look for what we want out of life. Ask us questions. Have we done enough for others, do we like it, etc.? Sit back and enjoy a wonderfully done and emotional movie that I am sure others will enjoy all your life. These actors are amazing and really show what message is being sent to all of us. These are 3 of my favorite actors who see this movie over 10 years ago. I enjoy it over and over again. Also enjoy this wonderful soundtrack and don't forget to see how many times you see a helicopter flying and try to figure it out as a symbol for the movie? acting in every movie he has ever done. He also does an excellent job in this film. This may be a surprise to most others. Sit back, relax and enjoy a really good movie .....
