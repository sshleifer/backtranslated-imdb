Full House is a great family show. But after seeing some episodes over and over again, I have realized that they are incredibly boring and they seem to be a lot from abroad. Yes, there are many comedies, but there are times when it's incredibly cheesy. It's not like I hate it, but just don't look at them again and again because they get old. Probably the best season is the first. <br /> <br /> Full House is the widow of Danny Tanner (Bob Saget) and her three daughters D.J. (Candace Cameron) Stephanie (Jodie Sweet) and Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley). When Danny dies, she needs help. So his best friend Joey (Dave Coulier) and the girl's uncle Jesse (John Stamos) are moving with them. When they live there, they find they can't live from each other. <br /> <br /> Full House reminds you of the importance of the family and that you can always go home.
