Early film has its drawbacks - a predictable plot and some suspiciously superfluous scenes, but it already clearly shows Hitchcock's editing and the use of a powerful image. It is also more stylishly expressionist in his films; Note, for example, the wonderful distortions he used in the party order, and often the frequent echoes of the title as well as the plot's echoes. <br /> <br /> The bottom line, however, remains the final match, which is still one of the most exciting examples of cinema. Although you know that the hero must win, it becomes quite believable that he will lose, and his wife's movement from the masters to her, motivating the final payment of the plot, is a very good match. Stopwatch attachments do exactly what they should do; you can almost hear the hanging (although it is a silent movie, they are often visually surprisingly audible). Stimulation is getting amazingly fast, and the viewer sucks both the game and the underlying sexual jealousy into excitement and brutality. <br /> <br /> The only DVD I am familiar with is Laserlight, a public company. As with any Hitchcock silence they have released, they have added a number of music selections, mostly to the orchestra. Sound editing is often sloppy and the sound quality varies greatly, but some real care seem to have reached most of the actual choices and the music of the final game works very well; it is unlikely that this sequence would ever be better than here. <br /> <br /> This is a much more impressive film than its current ambiguity. It deserves a respectable place both in the Hitchcock canon and in the fine valuable pokfi films.
