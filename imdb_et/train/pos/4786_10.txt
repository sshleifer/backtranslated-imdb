A straight story is a story of an old man who decides to visit his sick brother who lives across the state line. He decides to travel to his lawnmower if he can't drive and he wants to hang himself. The film beautifully depicts her journey and the life she touches on the journey. <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth turns to a beautiful show as well as the rest of the cast, especially Sissy Spacek, in his daughter's love and Harry Dean Stanton in a small but endless role. First of all, I felt that the story of an old geezer journey across the country would be boring, but soon I discovered that Lynch, along with all the people involved, would change the film I want for everyone.
