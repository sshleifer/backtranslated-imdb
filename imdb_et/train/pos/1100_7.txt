- Jim Blandings (Cary Grant), who is tired of the rat race and the tight living conditions of New York, finds his property for his wife and children. He hopes to find a simple life. But building a house turns out to be something simple. As headaches and bills begin, you laugh. Has Mr Blanding ever got his dream house? <br /> <br /> - What makes this movie so special is the three main players - Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas. Each of the three is capable of wearing a film, so when you combine your talents, almost every scene is special. Grant has always been my favorite in this role. He's as good as playing a man. Loy is always a pleasure to watch. Thin Man films made with William Powell are almost perfect. And Douglas has become my favorite in the last two or three years. Douglas also appeared in an old dark house, which is my special favorite. <br /> <br /> Film is definitely a product of that time. I can imagine the time you could build a two-storey, three-bedroom, four-bathroom house with $ 15,000 in income per year. Throw in the fact that your two children are attending a private school and you have a living servant and it becomes almost fantastic. <br /> <br /> - There are many situations for anyone who has bought or built a house, and the predictions that Blanding has found are easily comparable today. And this is where comedy has come. How many people have done some stupid things that a couple does in this movie only when they pay more money than expected? - The biggest complaint I have about Blandings is the whole "husband who loves the best friend". It is not really necessary on the plot and seems inappropriate and very uncomfortable as it has been presented.
