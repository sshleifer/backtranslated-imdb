I'm a big M Lillard fan, so I was watching this movie. Honestly I doubt if he wasn't in a movie that I would have enjoyed so much or even watched it, but if I watched it, the story was pretty decent. The bad end I have to say, but I saw it coming. This is a low budget movie and some actors were not really good, but overall I appreciated this movie 7/10. <br /> <br /> Immediately, I was wondering what Lillard really had to do with this movie. <br /> <br /> Good rent! <br /> <br /> 7/10
