This movie is one of many "Kung Fu" action films made in Asia in the late 1970s - early 80s, full of cheap sound effects, dubbed dialogue and lightning-fast martial arts. But unlike most of the films in this genre, he also has a good plot and a lot of comedy. When the Manchu bully forces the coworkers out of their workplace, they hire an artist (Gordon Liu) to try to frighten them. If his attempt fails, he will keep his Shaolin temple to learn for a real struggle. But instead of making him a Kung-Fu student, the Master commands him to build scaffolding to cover the roofs of all 36 chambers. Well, it turns out that when he performs these creative tasks (stacking and tying the bamboo poles), he learns to be a Kung Fu expert! It's like Karate Kid, when Mr. Miagi teaches Daniel the basics of karate, doing his usual chores - "Wax, wax away" and more. From the beginning to the end there are many great comedies, and at the end there are many activities when Gordon Liu is again facing his Manchu tormentors. "This time it's not just tricks - it's a real thing!" Liu declares, proudly breaking his chest. If you like classic Kung Fu movies, you don't want to miss it!
