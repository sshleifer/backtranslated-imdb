Accountant Shohei Sugiyama (Kôji Yakusho) feels his daily life eternal, limited to hard work and staying at home with his wife Masako Sugiyama (Hideko Hara) and his teenage daughter. One evening he sees the beautiful face of Mai Kishikawa (Tamiyo Kusakari) on a train at home on the balcony of a dance school and a few days later he decides to go to school and take the classroom dance lessons every Wednesday night. But he's ashamed of his family talking about his secret. Meanwhile, Masako knows the changes in his happy husband's behavior and hires a private eye to investigate whether Shoheil is an affair. <br /> <br /> I've just finished watching "Should we?" and I really loved it. What a lovely and delightful movie! The story is amazingly good, with drama, comedy and romance. The cast is great and I was particularly impressed by the cold beauty and grace of the director Masayuki Suo's wife and professional ballet dancer Tamiyo Kusakari. On September 6, I saw the American rewriting "Should we?" for the first time, and I found it a pleasant entertainment. But now I can say that this is another unnecessary remake, and I recommend this original movie. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Dança Comigo?" ("Dance with me?")
