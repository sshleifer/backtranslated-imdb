I want to warn you that this comment is of high quality. This comment is also more important to you after seeing the movie. scary. The rest of you will never know how precisely this film is, how the people in such a situation act and react in their later life. <br /> <br /> It would not have been fiction; it had to be based on personal experience. The silver screen depicted such a painful experience that I can never see it again. <br /> <br /> But I wholeheartedly support everyone else as an opportunity to approach another person's soul to the extent that you have never experienced or ever experienced before. I know it for the facts, because it's my soul that you follow.
