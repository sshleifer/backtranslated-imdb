Very thin image, which is part of World War II history, which most of us in the US never had. I would love it on video. It was shown only in t.v. once, as far as I know, back in 89 or 90. I have asked about this movie and most video stores don't even know about it. Great actors everywhere, I wish I could see it again. High-end series.
