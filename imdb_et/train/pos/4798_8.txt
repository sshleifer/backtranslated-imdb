It's not a movie for fans of the usual frightening Lynch stuff. Rather, it is for those who appreciate a good story, or have grown from tired minted items with obvious sentimentalism and Oprah-ish "This is such a wonderful film! You have to see it!" - semantics (tho 'he is right, once!). <br /> <br /> The story will open flawlessly and we will take a journey that I believe most of us will recognize for a while. A compassionate existentialist journey where we change our past when we approach our inevitable death. <br /> <br /> Action is error-free, including cinematic (sometimes quite brilliant!) and dialogue simply leaves the viewer out. story to read the story details. <br /> <br /> Warm movie. Not too sentimental.
