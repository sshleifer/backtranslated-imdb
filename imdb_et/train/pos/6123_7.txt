Before commenting on this movie, you should understand that when I saw this movie, I was expecting a typical crap, horror, B-movie and just wanted to have fun. Jack Frost is the one that not only offers but is actually one of the best I've ever seen. Scott McDonald is great as Jack Frost, I really think he has a future as psychopaths in the movies when they are ever given a chance. McDonald is a serum killer that gets thinner through some stupid random mix of ridiculous elements. As soon as this snowman starts to move around and kill people, it's hard not to laugh. The line that is being said is completely slowed down, but really funny. The fact that the rest of the cast is all over adds the film to stupidity, but it is stupid. A scene with a snowman with a teenage girl is a truly classic B-movie, horror movie in fashion. I really hope there is a sequel and I'm there to watch it on any cable channel. Of course, it's just fun to watch for the first time, and it's not really a good job of movie technology, but I just want to see snowy people kill. I gave it to 10 out of 7, this is a great movie for date and couples late at night.
