Reiterates the darkness. The much-anticipated, twisted comedy writer / director Richard Shepard is the actor Pierce Brosnan. This Bond man has gone. This new guy is something else !! Have you read that Shepard thought Brosnan was too beautiful for this plum role, but Brosnan turns out to be the perfect Julian Noble, "Facilitator" ... and is nothing but beautiful! Don't underestimate how humor is in this one. When you go, wait for the strokes and the eyes of the eye that relate to all sex, slaughter, religion, sport, business and anything else that can be considered politically wrong. Brosnan takes an excellent script to another level with its wonderful facial gestures and physical movements. Even sitting in the hotel bed (with or without sombrero) is a pleasure to see. <br /> <br /> Greg Kinnear is a man of Brosnan's comic and has a lot of depth and comic to make this partnership. Hope Davis has a small but delicately supportive role as Kinnear's wife (which is called "Bean"?), Who happens when she has a helper in her living room. <br /> <br /> The visuals and settings are perfect - including bullfighting, race track and Denver suburbs. And how often do we get The Killers and Xavier Cugat the same soundtrack? This is definitely not for everyone, but if your sense of humor is a bit outward and you enjoy risky filmmaking, it could be for you.
