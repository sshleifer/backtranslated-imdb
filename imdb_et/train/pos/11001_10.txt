Vincenzo Natali, a Canadian director, took a storm with an intriguing and amazingly intelligent Cube, which is my personal favorite SF movie in the 1990s. It designed a group of strangers who were caught in a maze of giant cubes, the key words that were completely fired on one set and took the idea in exciting directions. <br /> <br /> I have suddenly been waiting for Natal's follow-up, and although it took five years to install another project, I am pleased to say that it was unexpected. Cypher is an exciting exploration of one man in the world, and how he finds through a logical chain of events a situation that is not under his control. <br /> <br /> I don't want to expose too much of the plot because one of Cypher's joys has different ways he's going to take us. That day and age is so refreshing to see an SF movie that has more than one idea with that head. Cypher is such a movie. <br /> <br /> Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam), one of the most blendy people ever on the planet, has been hired by DigiCorp. They send him to different parts of America to record different seminars. In their confusion, they are incredibly boring. Themes are considered everyday, such as shaving cream and cheese. <br /> <br /> While Morgan is waiting for one seminar, he runs the concept of Rita Foster, a perfectly cast Lucy Liu. He gives him a brush, but he has something irresistible to him. It is not surprising when you consider the dry marriage in which it is. <br /> <br /> When Rita comes to Morgan's second seminar, she tells her that her life is not what she looks like. And I'm not saying anything more about the plot. This would deprive the rest of the film's impact on us, as well as the embarrassing path that is so fun to follow. <br /> <br /> Like Cube, Nathal shows a fairly talented example of ordinary people, bringing them out of acquaintance and not seeing what happens when they get into the unknown. And Cypher follows similar patterns. But this is not a copy of Cube. It has its own inspiration. <br /> <br /> Cypher is a film with more common conspiracy and paranoia stories. One of Cypher's biggest things is how these items slip without your knowledge. When Morgan realizes that his wrong identity is a much larger puzzle, it is so shocking to us as it is to him. <br /> <br /> One thing that distinguishes Cypher from Cube is how much more polished it is. If Cube was confined to the minimalist situation and the pains of the unknowns in the budgets of the shelters, Cypher also has a low budget, but Natalia does it as much as possible, allowing him to open the horizon and open Morgan through an amazing labyrinth of his identity. <br /> <br /> Natal's direction is extraordinary; There are surprisingly surprising camera corners, such as the huge amount of DigiCorp building and the robust office block associated with the insignificant spot on the outside of Morgan. The whole color seems to have been taken out of the picture, complementing the film's tone perfectly as today's movie-noir. <br /> <br /> The actor is equally great. Jeremy Northam is a sympathetic form of his unbelievable marriage to question his identity. His performance is excellent because it is so modulated. He literally seems to change just before our eyes. From a clinical, infinite wimp to a confident person who does something to preserve his new identity. <br /> <br /> David Hewlett makes a welcome look that has had an impact on Cube. He lives in a secret silo that looks like it was borrowed from men black. His scene is one of the best because it is a careful computational break and paranoia. He is an anticipated expert in identifying double agents and this is a fantastic piece of writing that Hewlett has excelled in. All he has to do is look at Morgan and we'll take his complex mind game. <br /> <br /> But this is Lucy Liu, who is here on the scene. Too often, he is cast into films where his potential is not fully exploited. But in Cypher he is finally given a character that fits him like a glove. Rita is a remote, guarded femme fatale that Liu lives with joy. I went every time he appeared, because he is always in control, and he can reduce his quiet space with his icy foamy force. <br /> <br /> Things are coming to a very happy end. to conclude from the ambiguous remark of how Cube did. But Morgan deserves his happy ending. After putting him in this ring, I was delighted by the last scene. This is the perfect last moment because it is sunshine after 90 minutes of darkness. <br /> <br /> Cypher succeeds at all readings. Engaging, shocking, always entertaining, that's all Recall wanted to be, but not. And this is a refreshing antidote to the overwhelming and inexplicable Matrix. <br /> <br /> Natal follow-up. And now I'm a devoted fan of man. Great stuff!
