Not only was this movie better than all H: LOTS last seasons. But it was better than any television I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> Looking at the "Top 250", I see that only one small screen movie has done this: How Grinch stole Christmas. I think it's time to increase this group. 2. <br /> <br /> I testify that there were several examples in the original series that were better than that, but I don't mind. I just loved getting back to the Baltimore killing group again!
