I went to watch this movie with one of my friends. I didn't hear much about it. So I didn't expect anything. But after I saw it, I really liked it. Nicolas Cage and the rest were very good. But I have to say that Giovanni Ribis's show performance needed a bit of momentum. But such a small mistake could be reviewed. Within 60 seconds, Gone is about a retired car thief who needs to increase 60 rare and exotic cars overnight to save her brother's life. The film is by no means predictable. So the end should be a surprise. Think it's just another fast car? You're partly right. There's a lot more to it. Everyone should watch this movie.
