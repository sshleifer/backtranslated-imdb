50 years old, this musical comedy fantasy can look at its age, but it carries it with dignity. <br /> <br /> This movie is still a lot of fun. Crosby was never a romantic lead, but he supplies the material with the slightly humorous edge he needs. Bendix plays a large scale and is a very fun part that requires his strengths. Hardwicke - as a joy to the king of the kingdom - the real - to abandon himself in such abandonment. And Rhonda Fleming enjoys the most important roles. Only Murvyn Vye disappears as convincing Merlin. <br /> <br /> Although the songs are not music, the songs are very good and the routine of dancing comes with busy doing Nothing is perfect - funny, relevant, meaningless without being complicated, and making Crosby a musical move that is fair, let's be fair , of course, was fun because he was never his greatest power. <br /> <br /> Color is good, sound is a bit muddy at times. br /> <br /> And the story - well, it takes some liberties from the outset, but I suspect Mr Clemens might have been happy with the result.
