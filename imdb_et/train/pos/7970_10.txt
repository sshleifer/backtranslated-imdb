This movie is definitely on my top 10 favorites list. Animal voices are wonderful. Sally Field and Michael J. Fox are both brilliant as the sassy cats and youth inexperienced pooch, but the real challenge is Don Ameche's old, loyal golden retriever. This film is a great family film because it can be appreciated by both children and adults. Humorous and relaxed and guarantees the love of every animal to cry! (happy tears!)
