This almost unknown pearl was based on the French farce - which shows and I mean it as a compliment. <br /> <br /> Caroline (Lee) is being bullied by a wealthy Argentine (Roland) who is asking her father to marry. But Caroline is already married to Anthony (Colman), who has just arrived on the plane and immediately opens the audience-led recollection the last time Caroline decided to love someone else: the dilettante-ish sculptor (Gardiner). In the film, Anthony's strategy is to play Caroline out of his sculptor and help him with the Argentines. <br /> <br /> It's completely cast: Ronald Colman is his most sophisticated and charming, Reginald Gardiner is his most priggish, Gilbert Roland is his most exotic, and Anna Lee is just delicious whimsical. The film has been superbly staged by Lewis Milestone (who also produced); the whole production seems like a job of love. There are great touches, such as the Colman interruption frame and camera access and the extraordinary use of the sliding plate door. This is a sin he has not published on a DVD - a film that can unanimously arouse interest in a classic film.
