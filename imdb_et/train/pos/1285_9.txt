Disappointed middle-aged deputy district general manager George Maxwell (George E. Carey's subtle performance, who also compiled this picture) is no longer standing by his naggy, cold woman Edith (perfect female Anne Bellamy). Worse still, the poor George is still confused with the newborn baby's sun and married lesbian teenage daughter (dirty brunette Sheri Jackson). George has adultery, a nice, tempting, and clever, hippie babysitter, Candy Wilson (admiring sexy aplomb, featured by the nude blonde knockout Patricia Wymer). Complications arise when George finds himself shocked by the bitter Julia Freeman (Kathy Williams' nice poisonous regime), who wants George to spring in his psychotic biker boyfriend Laurence Mackey (scary Robert Tessier, who sports hair-filled hair here). Director Tom Laughlin (yeah, the same guy who depicted Billy Jack!) And James McLarty, the screenwriter, crams a great success with a winning and very fun tasty woman's nudity, brilliant soft heart sex and raw violence. What's more, they confirm the entire wild and unimpeded sensitivity of the entire 60's youth culture, and bind the plot with a short 75-minute working time, thus ensuring that this film does not go beyond expectations. One particular highlight is when Candy invites her viable friends to Maxwell's house to get an impromptu basement bash full of pot smoking, career music, and of course, hot naked dance shoes. Robert O. Ragland's funky score hits at times. Stanton Fox's tough black-and-white cinematography adds an exceptionally sharp edge to shamefully sliding games. Best of all, this glow speed is a great example of the charming and freshly hidden pixel Patricia Wymer, which illuminates the screen with its sweet, bubbly personality and enchanting beauty. Complete trashy treatment.
