The action is pretty cheesy, but for the people in this area in the 80s and now the engineers of the Detroit region, it's a great movie. I even work with a Japanese supplier to make this movie even more fun. <br /> <br /> Jay Leno showed up at The Tonight Show last night! She looks here pretty young ... 17 years ago. An open scene where the drag line that seems to be Woodward Ave was great. <br /> <br /> Leno now also has some bad ** cars. collection. I am sure that the open scene blown into the water was his own car. <br /> <br /> A typical 80s film. See it and have fun. No computer-generated cheats!
