This is one great Sammo Hung movie. In fact, this is a great piece of Hong Kong cinema. The story tells about Macao's pedicab leaders looking for love and confusion. The performances are great and the characters are all pleasant and well defined. The story is involved and has enough romance, drama, comedy and intercourse to keep one between the fighting scenes. Sammo Hung here proves that he is probably the best choreographer in the company. The activity is just amazing. Fight w / Lau Kar Leung and Finals. Billy Chow and Sammo Hung are amazing. Must see any fan.
