I came to the middle of this movie, so I had no idea about any credit or even the title until I looked at where I saw your commentators accept it. I'm positive about this movie, but one thing really got my attention when I looked at: a beautiful and sensitive score written in the Coplandesque Americana style. My surprise was great when I discovered a score written by someone other than John Williams himself. True, he has written sensitive and poignant items, such as Schindler's list, but he usually associates his name with Star Wars. But in my opinion, what Williams has written for this movie has surpassed everything I've ever heard of him about tenderness, sensitivity, and beauty, completely with the delicate and beautiful plot of the film. And another last score for her, Catch Me, if you can, shows even more wisdom and complexity. As for Stanley and Iris, I like educational films like How Green was in my Valley and Konrack, it was John Voig and his young African American fees in South Carolina and Danny deVito Renaissance and the like. spiritual awakening, a story that cannot be said often enough. It's a great genre.
