Fragglerock is great so that Schindler's list was great. Great to watch for all sex children and adults. Large nose can be seen as turning to folic symbols, just like H.R. Puff N Stuff had hinted at marijuana smoking. Your kids love this movie. I liked it very much as a child. My father showed me this movie as a child. He also enjoyed it and noted that the exaggerated nose was a folk symbol. Although at that time I had no idea what they were. The film is comedy and adventure. The story is crazy and cheerful. I and you enjoy it together.
