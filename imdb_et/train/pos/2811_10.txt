Silverlake Life, the view from here, is an absolutely stunning movie about AIDS and gay love. Indeed, some pictures are really difficult to take, especially when it comes to gay or fear of AIDS, and probably to any sensitive person who looks at it. It is not easy to make a film about this terrible disease and its consequences in the lives of just one but two people. This film teaches how to care for each other in such difficult times, but it never gets too sick, still shows life, reminding you that outside the theater or your room, life is going, no matter what people may be. Characters are incredibly loving, while we look at their proximity to frames that never go beyond very strict restrictions, never disclosing anything too private or offensive. Children should definitely not watch this movie, but adults, whether or not they have to deal with such situations, should do so and do not regret the tears.
