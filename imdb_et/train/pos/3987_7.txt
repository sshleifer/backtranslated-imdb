Mom is one of the films you know is good, maybe even great, but it's like eating vegetables or doing homework for a child - too much work and a lot of pain to invest. <br /> <br /> The story is potentially terrible in many ways: the death of character in the first half hour, the romance of December-May, the idea that a man will deceive his wife and then deceive his mother's lover, the collection of weak and rather unpleasant thirty-millimeter characters, adults obvious indifference to their children. This film was made in 2002 or 2003, but is back in a collection of British (usually television) films since the late 1980s - this is a moral seriousness that will never let the anguish of the surrounding anger rise. <br /> <br /> Mother is flawless but it is partly a problem; if a film dealing with so many sensitive topics has some drawbacks - script contradictions, some smaller actors - it will take the edge, but if such a film is so perfect, its viewing experience is raw and painful. Even technical features - lighting, editing, etc. - make the viewer pain; this movie is bright and open in London, full of harsh cutting light. <br /> <br /> If you are tough nails or you are one of those hypersensitive people who want to torture sad movies or novels, you will enjoy the mother. Anyone who has missed, give him a mistake or is ready to bully. And to warn: both the harsh and the film from start to finish, the worst is to come. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, her mother asks her daughter what she can do because she (sleeping with her boyfriend) and the daughter calmly says she has thought about it and would like to hit her. Mom agrees, they both stand up and - instead of a well primed blast - daughter clenches her fist and offers a boxer blow. Argh !!!
