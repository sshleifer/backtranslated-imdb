It is a nice movie, with a good story, great actors and great songs. Unfortunately, the cinema was bad. One of the weakest points in the film is the annoying chain of sequences copied from Pretty Woman. Why? Is it painful to try some sort of originality, Abbas? Black? Anyone? <br /> <br /> The film is recently related to married couple Raj and Priya (Salman - Rani). Priya cannot imagine after an accident during the previous pregnancy and they ultimately decide to use a replacement mother carrying her baby. They choose Madhubala, a vulgar prostitute played by Preity Zinta. The film is not really realistic, I do not understand whether it is easier to receive it? And even if they choose a girl, does that mean the man has to sleep with him? Have you heard of insemination? Anyway, I think if the writers had heard about it, the film wouldn't have been made, so the concept is probably deliberate. <br /> <br /> Salman works very well. It's nice to see that he plays a serious character. But his character suffers from unnecessary and inexpensive dialogues about his great love for his wife and how hard he sleeps with another woman. Come on, it's cheesy and unreal. Rani is almost OK; he is generally effective and tries to do something but completely conceals Preity Zinta. <br /> <br /> The film belongs to Preite, who steals the exhibition in a great way with its flawless performance. He makes a light and natural change from a prostitute to a sensitive woman. She lives in a movie, knows and loves her and admires her at the same time, partly because of her role, partly due to her magnetic and positive personality. This is one of his career opportunities. No doubt she is more talented than the modern industry. He should just do more of these roles. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie only shows what I said above. It is a tear-line, exciting and very well-behaved. See this for a reward. <br /> <br /> 7/10 for the movie! 10/10 - Preity!
