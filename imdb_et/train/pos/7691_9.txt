This exhibition was a landmark of American comedy, as it was the first sitcom to celebrate all the African American pains. Unfortunately, even though it was never extensive on British television. <br /> <br /> The Evans family is a poor African-American family living in a tower block. The father is called James, he tries to run the house, but his wife from Florida always gets better. Three children are artistic JJ, fanciful Thelma and young intellectual Michael. Always come to a house in Florida famous friend Willona. <br /> <br /> I watched two episodes of this exhibition on youtube (Black Jesus and Sex and Evans Family - the only two on the site). You may wonder why an English-speaking viewer has followed a series that has never been shown or barely heard in his country. The answer is this. In 1976, Britains first released all black laptops called "The Fosters" Only two series that now seem forgotten. But I looked at the episode and I was really impressed. Then I learned that the scripts were identical to "good times". They were exactly the same characters, but with different names Sam Foster's father, his wife Pearl Foster, and three children were Sonny (young Lenny Henry), Shirley and Benjamin. Pearl's rumor was Vilma. (To read about "Fosters", I've written an overview of it. While watching the "Good Times", only two things bothered me. First was the topic of opening (terrible), and secondly, the audience was laughing. I like the laughter of the audience, but it would say a little funny line and the audience would start crazy and start, and it was a very funny show. We hope that more episodes will appear on youtube and hope that someone will release "The Fosters" from the DVD in England. <br /> <br /> Best episode: Sex and Evans Family - Episode 1 Episode 6. Foster's episode called Black Community Sex The second episode I saw Black Jesus was the episode of The Fosters
