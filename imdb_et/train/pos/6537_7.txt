The children I took to this movie loved it (four children, aged 9 to 12; they would have given him 10 stars). Emma Roberts was divine in the role of the title. (Wait for you to see more of this next-generation Roberts in the future.) After the globalization of Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton, it was refreshing to see a girl who didn't look like she was working on the streets. Also enjoy seeing the supportive pain that included Tate Donovan, Rachel Leigh Cook, Barry Bostwick and Monica Parker (with Bruce Willis). Final Extraction: A lovely movie. <br /> <br /> (Note: I didn't read a series of books, so my comments are only based on the film's advantages.)
