I love Satan's Pit! David Tennant is both a great actor and Billie Piper !!! Who else loves Will Thorp's pieces ??? She's so cute, isn't she? I hated the bits where he got fucking and where he said "go to hell" as Rose did so. Remember, she was pretty funny when she said, "Rose, do we do it, do you? Are you going!". Mr. Jefferson was so brave, didn't he? Dying others to save. I really felt sorry for Toby (Will Thorp) when he came out the second time because he was so scared. I was like "Oh God, if I were Rose, so I was so scared". And when he hugged him, I was like "grrrrrr, he's mine! Hands off!" but I thought it was really sweet. And the doctor .... well, I thought he was telling Ida, "tell Rose I love her," but she didn't. Oh well.
