Always imagine this movie on video. Finally I got it for the buyer and the guy what the film. Just the stunning result of all the cases and it's filmed so beautifully. Even sometimes, far from you, so you can barely hear what a dialogue is like, as if you really wanted to take the bits of the journey. It is really touching, often fun and very observable. Not much dialogue but filming so you feel so much. 9/10 about me. Must see.
