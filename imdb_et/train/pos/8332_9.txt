Part of where Meg visits the mechanic and says, "Is the piston short?" (that is, her groom has bad sexual energy) was fun. I love Meg Ryan and he is as sweet as ever in this wonderful movie. Very lovable and very intelligent. His innocent outrageous expressions want him to be yours. The hero works well with the transformation of the physicist with the garage mechanic. Einstein had a romantic side to his psyche? The journalism round for the press and the audience was good. It is terribly underestimated and deserves recognition and aspirations for revival. It loses one vote to add the US Govt purchased a very unlikely far-drawn theory. I do not understand why this is not a romantic comedy of the 20th century. Big movie, it has a seal of presidential elections!
