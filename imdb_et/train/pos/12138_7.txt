Many of the features of this movie are right there. The sound is quite gentle and understands what progress has been made in sound reproduction in the coming years. The language of the dialogue is rather peculiar and unnatural, and the actor still remembers his transition from the stage technique. <br /> <br /> Bette Davis always gives a strong result in all of his films, as he does in his early career in his very successful career. However, I feel that the cockney accent does not fit in any way. I think this is the expected accent that does not speak to me. <br /> <br /> Somerset Maughan loves to penetrate into the human drama of great dramatic intensity, which will appeal to everyone in the film. As with so many of his role groups, Bette Davis can go from a beautifully seductive woman to a hilarious hatred full of viper. Leslie Howard is well taken out as an English artist whose club's mouth has been desperately sought after by a partner and a poor choice was made by a successful small speaker. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, the young doctor will meet his true love on a busy street. They pass through the traffic completely unforgettable to the many horns and whistles that scream at them. This scene is probably funny, but I think this otherwise very serious movie is very ridiculous. It's probably translated to send a smile to your face. And after we see (and hope), it's a happy ending.
