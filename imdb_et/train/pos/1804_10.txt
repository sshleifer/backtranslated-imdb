First of all, I had never been scared of this scary gem like a child ("Little Mermaid"). As my title says, it was one of my childhood films that I still love teenage. This is a beautiful, bittersweet movie misfit German Shepherd named Charlie (fantastic, which was expressed by Burt Reynolds), who is killed by his boss / partner in a crime (name is ha, ha on Carface). By default, Charlie is sent to heaven, because "all dogs go to heaven because, unlike humans, dogs are naturally good and loyal and kind". Chalie is sent back to Earth because she finished her life, where she got even better off with her best friend Itchy and her little orphan girl Anne-Marie. I looked at it all the time as a child and sometimes I look at it. Anyway, this is a beautiful bittersweet movie, as I said before, it could just be a tear to the eye ...
