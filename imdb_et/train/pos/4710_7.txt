As for parody films, there is little time and energy worthwhile. But with the revival of recent scared parodies such as Date Movie and The Comebacks, it is a fresh breath of air to come back and rediscover a really funny farce, like Johnny Dangerously. <br /> <br /> After his mother's medical problems, little Johnny goes to work on the mobile. Which pages are a series of gags, most of which work, but random flops. But a stranger gangster who doesn't know the American language (at least wise), a rival gangster who wants to take his mouth off (once!), Younger Brother D.A. who is ready for Johann Dangerous and the hot young starlet that is hot for his hearts, Johnny busy. <br /> <br /> And the viewer is busy because the clich√© of every gangster movie is talented cast and proper writing. <br /> <br /> Not very long, but definitely a good smile.
