Must not be confused with the 1994 comedy of the British Black. But this low tomb is worthy of the 80s back gate. <br /> <br /> The plot goes = 4 corporation girls in the monastery plan a lifetime break in Florida, but plans are on hold when one of them knows the murder of a local woman and when she realizes she's seen, let's say it's dead to the cat - And the mouse game and things become even worse when it turns out to be a local sheriff. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the low tomb is one of the more enjoyable in the eighties, especially the late 80's, when the slashers went downhill, one of the few that was not and this film should be more well known , it's a pity it's not. this is one movie that actually interferes with stereotypes (try to guess who the ultimate girl is - I got it completely wrong). The principle is all pleasant and it is one of those films that I hope they will all get away with, of course not. This, along with the first half-hour jar of the film (in good ways) with the blink of a real stud (another murder gives a real blow) and some unexpected fool (though it's not a high budget thriller I didn't expect a topless scene where a woman is burned with her bra (accompanied by hysterical religious radio) in the late 1980s. <br /> <br /> one or two bad things about this movie, not bad at all, just like the sublinks, where there are two teenage boys who don't go anywhere and end, What was stupid and plus the inability of the deputy to follow the logic. There are no sharp devices in SHALLOW GRAVE, but at least I think it's through and slipping. Scenes where girls are wildly shocked by the forest are tense and exciting. <br /> <br /> All in all, it is a very enjoyable and worthwhile stage with excellent performances from all four main girls and from this psycho sheriff.
