Sharp, well-made documentary that focuses on Mardi Gras beads. I have always liked this film-making approach - communicating ideas for a bigger, more complex and often incomprehensible phenomenon, breaking the problem into something familiar and close to home. <br /> <br /> I am sure most people have heard stories about sweatshops and understood the main motives of profit and capitalism and the impact of globalism on poorer countries (but people know it). Instead of explaining these topics and getting up in the soapbox (not because it has something wrong with it, except for documentaries that are usually converted), this documentary simply shows Mardi Gras beads, how they are made, what people and under what conditions and how consumers use it at the end of the process. He publicly and sharply explores the motivation of everyone involved in the process, including employees, factory management, American importers, and ultimately the end of the chain. <br /> <br /> I felt it a little bad; equally, the revelers of Mardi Gras, as well as how Chinese workers have made their situation normal and parade (even if they have objections to the details of their management). Especially impressed were the street scavenger shots that clean the pearls from the streets. But it was just my reaction; I see someone else could read this documentary somewhat differently. <br /> <br /> Unlike other documentaries on this topic, I don't think you should have a specific political opinion on what it affects. This is ultimately the story of people and our relationship with the goods produced and consumed. If you have ever bought a product made in the Far East, you should think about it. <br /> <br /> Great and highly recommended. You need to see more of these documentaries. Tissue to everyone involved in making this film.
