Who said the horror was not a genre of educational film? Thanks to this wonderful Hammer short film, we know at least NEVER to offer bread and wine to your wine in your house, because he can just be a hypnotist and this combination gives him the power to control my thoughts and mind forever! Thank you Hammer! The ten episodes in the House of Horror series are another one that I expect, mainly because the director was led by Don Sharp; one of Britain's best filmmakers, but unfortunately underestimated. Sharp was responsible for some very cool Hammer movie, such as "Vampire Kiss" and "Rasputin: Mad Monk", as well as some unnoticed independent productions like "Dark Places" and "Psychomania". His contribution to Horror House is just one of the best in the series, with a complex, yet exciting plot sketch and a rewarding hidden theme. The plot focuses on two antique vendors stumbling across a strange mirror-like object, but it is actually an ancient friction tool that can be used to call Choronzhon; The demonic guardian of the abyss. The mirror is a heavily satanic cult because they need it for their ceremonies, but Michael does not want to sell it before knowing the actual value of the device. When he picks up a clearly cultivated girl running from the cult to avoid sacrificing, Michael pulls even deeper into the occult conspiracy. Satanic cults and the feminine sacrifice of young women are typical British horror issues, but David Fischer's scenario is never boring and offers plenty of clean plot twits, among which is a very inventive climax. There are also many tensions to admire, the dialogues are smart and the exemplary performances are excellent (especially John Carson as the leader of the cult) is really daunting. Recommended!
