We tend to forget that the master / slave context of past centuries brings more than well-maintained manors fed by large groups of enslaved people and a lot of money for white owners. This leads to a group of people caught in the middle - the offspring of slave-owners intervene in the slaves of their female aspirations. Some of these children became slaves and others were free, but free and painted, which meant nothing but their families. <br /> <br /> A class transformed by these offspring - free or free people of color - and this class was able, to a certain extent, to possess property, to raise themselves to be educated and educated and to achieve comparative dignity. That means they were not slaves, but they were used to some extent. <br /> <br /> Women often loved lovers of white plantation masters and wealth men who had created their own house, support, training for their children, and some kind of gentility, depending on the respect they set for their families. In essence, they prostituted themselves to ensure their well-being and relative independence from the workforce - an agreement pla√ßage. <br /> <br /> The celebration of all the holidays is a beautifully written story of one of the children of such a child, the conclusion of such an agreement with the local gentleman and the people concerned with their lives, both in negative and positive terms. The story was an opener for the eye, New Zealand, with no black and white lines without a real concept, not to mention that it is gray in the middle of the environment where gens de couleur slips. <br /> <br /> The characters are very three-dimensional and are well-adapted by Anne Rice to adapt this novel. The parts are well cast, the costumes are wonderful and the brutal lines are drawn out, with the blurry areas becoming even clearer due to the conflicts that the protagonists pass through. The Gens de couleur libre could not marry the white, the slaves couldn't help themselves, and the white, even sympathetic, could not resist the economic reality of the people they were dependent on. <br /> <br /> I recommend this, both the novel and the miniseries, the story for everyone, unconditionally. If you are unable to cope with the truth, you can eat and break through some parts, because as a result of one injustice, their white stressors and their people are colored. Remember, this is nothing more than reality, and this story is an absorbing way to learn about it. the sour taste I found in my mouth, what went on, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. Look out. If this period is not counted, it must be learned.
