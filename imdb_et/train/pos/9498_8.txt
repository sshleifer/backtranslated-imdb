"Painting sees, I remember better than you saw." So says Dick Heldar (Ronald Colman), a painter who failed. The film is an old-fashioned Hollywood style starring Ronald Colman and a majority of bravura, which includes East Lupine in his first important role, the actor Dudley Digges (who also participated with Colman in Condemned), and an excellent actor, Walter Huston. <br /> <br /> The movie's title and opening sequences give a lot of evidence that Dick is losing his sight. He has blinded the gun powder outflow, as he and his sweetheart Maisie (Muriel Angelus) play with a gun. Later, the ulcer in Sudan is a catalyst for its darkness. He becomes a famous painter, but he is already blinded by ambitions and unable to reach his full potential until his vision leaves him. Enter the bad girl Bessie (East Lupino) and her own destruction has begun. Lupino is very powerful in this role and plays Colman very well. His evil acidic reminds me of Bette Davis in In Human Bondage. Well done and well managed, this is one of my favorite Colman melodrama.
