Everyone knows this "zero day" event. What I think this movie was about was that Elephant didn't do that, they saw us how these guys were. They showed their lives for about a year. With all the film we like, we laugh with them, even though we know what they're doing. And it gives me chills. Because I felt guilty of these comments and I thought Cal was a sweet man. Even if I know KNEW, what do you know? Even at the end of the movie, when they were going to commit suicide and decide if they did it with 3 or 4 numbers, I thought it was funny, but still I was scared that their head was blown. Of course I was. I have to like them. Maybe they were bad, but I felt they were really normal guys that they didn't really understand it. But I knew they were. <br /> <br /> This is IMO, the main force of this movie. It makes us realize that our friends or relatives, or someone, can plan something crazy and that we don't even notice it. That movie, as good as it was, made me bad. And that's why I can't go to bed right now. My belly is still little. Butterflies.
