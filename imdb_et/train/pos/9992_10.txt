... it's a classic with so many great dialogues and scenes that nobody should forget. A nice story, funny rich-rags-situations, Mel Brooks is not a bad leader, maybe not perfect, but he's funny. Look at it, look at something like the final destination (2009) and tell me that Life Stinks deserves the same rating. If you do, I don't think we can be friends XD Here at the fourth season, I recommend "Curb Your Enthusiasm" to every Brooks fan;) Vote for 10 reluctant opinions! I want to make 10 lines to post comments? I don't want to write a book here: P
