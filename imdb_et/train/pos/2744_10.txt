Remarkable, disturbing film about the real life of a small town family, meaningless, cruel murder with killing and studying the lives of Dick Hickok and Perry Smith. <br /> <br /> It doesn't matter how much time it takes, or when this movie can appear, it still resonates with a complete misunderstanding of crimes like this. <br /> <br /> It really traces a number of tragedies: tragedy, cruelty and nonsense. The family of the Clutter family, the decent family of the family, Holcombis, Kansas; Hickok and Smith's wasted, brutal and sad life. The film has an interesting point: that neither of these immature, frightened, small criminals ever thought of anything like that. it alone. But they created a dangerous, murderous collective personality; one that feeds everyone's needs and pathology. They push each other along a road that proves something to each other. That they have enough men to do that; does not want him to be seen as a coward to fulfill his great "score"; an unhappy and dangerous residue of the destroyed lives they led. These were two adult children living in the world of a criminal who did not dare to encourage; who must constantly prove masculinity and strength. in this case, these needs are up to the Clutter assassination. <br /> <br /> The film has a somewhat sentimental look at the Clutter family, but it's done. They were respected, law-abiding, small town people who didn't deserve this terrible destiny. The film also gives us a sense of the young life of Hickok and Smith. Perry Smith, whose early life was full of security and love, but horrified that alcohol took his family on the tragic path. Hickok, poor and pretty much left out on his equipment, couldn't see how he'd fit using his intelligence and charm to anyone he contacted. <br /> <br /> Interesting and perhaps the first to see the death penalty and what goals we hope to achieve. Is it nothing more than killing revenge for a murder that reassured the people at a time when we were not yet fully confronted with such carnivores, or does these men, at the end of the rope, really be modest about the childish and brutal attitude of such children? Is it possible to prevent people living in fraud by working under radar, believing that they are fooling everyone they come across? To prevent this, you must believe that this is possible. Is it possible to prevent these men who believe they are too clever to catch them? who has committed hundreds of crimes and go with them? It had to be "cinch", "not witnesses". <br /> <br /> When Hickok is caught, he thinks he doesn't get the magic and agents he had with department store officers. Smith, who believes he deserves such a fate anyway, who seemed the only one who truly understood what he had done, deliberately tells the story when he learns that Hickok is a cow. A glowing game of chicken between two immature, emotionally damaged, dangerous men. <br /> <br /> An exciting psychological thriller that speaks of frightening crime in the history of this country. The wonderful images of Robert Blake and Scott Wilson. These roles made their career.
