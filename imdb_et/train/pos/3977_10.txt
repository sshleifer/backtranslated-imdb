I looked at it personally to see the material from the 60s and 70s. It was fascinating to know how the drug movement actually started and became a pop culture and a possible compromise in life. Interviews with classic rock stars are good and humorous. You feel secret and slip your head at the same time ... because it looks so good and familiar. I loved it, all segments from day 60. I highly recommend it in all aspects, including rock music, hyperplay, politics and the good Olympic Games. I check that it stated that it contains a spoiler, just because I have no idea what some might consider as a spoiler or not, because I was discussing all four segments so I just wanted to be safe.
