I've always found that I discovered a big (semi) unknown movie. These discoveries have almost always been dramatic movies - my experience is unknown sci-fi, action and horror, very unknown for very good reasons. I found a "High Tide" video in a spam shop, mixing dozens of different quality birds. Of course, this is the only place I find it because it's still not on DVD. <br /> <br /> While I was watching Judy Davis (Lillie) throughout this movie, I was somehow confident looking at a great undiscovered performance. Yes, I had previously seen Davis in several small parts - and one of the most important roles in "A passage to India". But while he was great in the above film, "High Tide" is a completely different animal. Recently looking at Gillian Armstrong's later "Charlotte Gray" movie, I was very aware of the actor who impressed her. Davis pulls Cate Blanchett much more than a transient similarity - both in way and in sensitivity. <br /> <br /> The performance of Judy Davis is stunning, I can't say good enough about it. She shares an amazing screen relationship with young Claudia Karvan (like Ally), another big actor of this movie. There's a lot of drama and quiet humanity they share, the details of which I assume will not appear here (see for yourself!). "High Tide" is too good to cover one review. Indeed, I hardly care - the film speaks well enough. In conclusion, I would like to congratulate the scriptwriter Laura Jones for the excellent dialogue, the understanding of director Gillian Armstrong and the great Russell Boyd for her excellent, undervalued cinematography (see her work "Tender Mercies").
