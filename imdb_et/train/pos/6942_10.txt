In the 50s, the age limits for films in Brazil were as follows: there were no restrictions, 10-year-olds, 14-year-olds and 18-year-olds. Normally, the West was allowed to be ten years old when they had a little more violence than they would go to 14, but it was rare to see a younger than 18 years old western country being limited. Winchester 73 was one of them, and I think it explains very well how this film was considered to be different from the average. The hero, James Stewart, fought his father killed by his brother. He was looking for revenge and seemed quite traumatic, far from the average good man. Anthony Mann tried this kind of variation in the following films he did with Stewart. Shelley Winters, who was a leading woman, was far from virtuous, followed by her husband left with her brother. Dan Duryea as Waco Johnnie Dean is one of those great villains that are always remembered. The story of a movie, which always follows a rifle man, is one of the most suitable for the West. It had to be made for Fritz Lang's movie that didn't come out. When he was offered to Mann, he began to restart from scratch and not take anything that was ready for Lang. With Winchester, Mann created a different concept from the West, but still retained all his traditions. Winchester is still a great movie again, but nothing is comparable to the impression it made to those who saw it when it was initially released.
