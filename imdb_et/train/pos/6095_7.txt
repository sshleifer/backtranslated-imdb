I'm a little controversial about that. The exhibition, on the one hand, is terrible, acting is terrible (even if we get the real name actors like Brad Pitt and Bill Moseley in one episode), the dialogue is moral and the assumption / moral of every episode seems to be lifted out by 50-year-olds educating short. No one of these episodes for a moment is afraid, and Robert Englund's foci are short, meaningless, and spunky, like Bob Saget for the more funny videos of America. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this is one of the funniest things ever to be on television. In the 80's, the soft focus makes the vision of the actors look similar at any time, the rooms lend material to more parodies than intimidation, so we leave an episode where the high school child is afraid if he can't let his girlfriend down his SAT, and her parents leave her, the other fears she is locked in jail because she is a poor mother (her husband plays Brad Pit), the other fears that all the parents in the world are against her when she leaves home, the other Fears that he will be confused with his socially slowed twin, the other will be afraid if he does not break his mother and father whom he is killed at the party in his house. The list continues and continues. <br /> <br /> Suppose they are dreams that I could look beyond the points and equipment of a ridiculous plot, but they are the left-wing fields that writers have no chance of actually scaring the audience. You are dressed in the 80's themed nightmares, migrating around bad dialogue in very tooth fashion and making illogical decisions that do not have any other purpose but a story to move to the next weird test point (usually looking at something atypical for a reasonable person as a peripheral character, while we the main character is bothered and too shocked to do something about it). <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something that frightens you, stay away. On the other hand, if you are looking for more fun things in the 80s. Look at it. <br /> <br /> It has recently been on Chiller TV (pretty much every day) and I've been watching for the curiosity I've had before, and now just so I can laugh every day. Arrested Development and Extras off the air are now officially the funniest thing on television.
