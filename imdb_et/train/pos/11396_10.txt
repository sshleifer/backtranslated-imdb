Released two years before the birth, this Oscar winning film has all kinds of technical colors and costumes, breathtaking cinematography, excellent wall-to-wall Gershwin music, good choreography, lighter-than-scenario scenery and great performances by Kelly, Levant, Foch, Guetary and Caron. Hollywood doesn't do it anymore. Surely this is my favorite movie all the time, a standard on which I appreciate all the other movies. ENJOY, ENJOY, ENJOY!
