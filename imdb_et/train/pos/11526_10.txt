I rented this movie to a foolish chief .. I like the arkin in the field and tried to cover ... I read back and knew right now that he was going to be the best or the worst movie I've ever seen. I think I'm happy .. I laughed from beginning to end. The arkin brings an excellent character to this film. Since then, I've bought used collections from my own collection and have been watching it all the time. I have recommended this movie to people and they enjoyed it as much as I did ... I see complaints about menus and DVDs .. but it doesn't take away from the movie .. The disc was authored by Blockbuster exculsivley, so they didn't let you skip previews. DVD to avoid watching a great movie.
