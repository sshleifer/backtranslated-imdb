Outside the household there is a different world and the family struggles with the father's authority and the line between their hopes and dreams. <br /> <br /> The period has been caught; Bakelite Lights, Georgian Floor Tiles, Picture Rails, Wallpaper, Short Skirts, Fine Boys, Mini Cabin, Glossy Modern Mangles .... <br /> <br /> The location is caught; The glacial glacier created a rocky landscape, local stone, community, freedom. <br /> <br /> But there's more to it; Childhood, happiness, sensuality, pride, values, freedom, authority, rebellion, violence (deepest sense), love, struggle, puberty, naivety, morality, trust, faith, deception, mechanics, customs, maturity, loss, poverty, sacrifice , horror, acceptance, revelation, comedy and parenting are all there. (And not in any particular order!). <br /> <br /> This movie is a richly woven expression of family tensions that are as important as ever. The fact that some of them are not addressed directly proves in itself the attitude of the day, but the fact that they are all here is a testimony to the skill, story and direction. <br /> <br /> If there is anything wrong with this film, it is that all this deeply rooted and wonderfully erected tension is a little too light at the end. Maybe I can't figure out - many teenagers feel like death and darkness when they cope with it (**) - maybe even trying to send this message - it's worth doing. <br /> <br /> What movie is trying to say? Children: The parents were also young, parents also struggling, everyone makes mistakes, everyone learns, things change, fight can end happily. Parents: don't try too hard! Try to remember that your support is the key to their well-being. <br /> <br /> It sounds simple, isn't it? Sometimes the film seems to be so, but you will notice how much is disputed and uncovered. <br /> <br /> The film is classic. <br /> <br /> (**) - No problem.
