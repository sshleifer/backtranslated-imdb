Before George Clooney led Sam Rockwell's debut debut "Confessions of Dangerous Mind", they celebrated together in this film. George Clooney also took part in this film as a producer with Steven Soderbergh, which shows that they really believed in this project. Potentially, it also seems to be a subtle and fun project that is in the same order as the movie's "Ocean's Eleven" and "The Italian Job", but somehow this film is only half-successful or at least not as good as it could have been. <br /> <br /> The film's character is played by all the fine known actors, but it is a shame that the characters don't really have enough space to develop. Even though they may have become their fun and enjoyable character, they are now only characters that entertain lightly, as most of the strange sequences contained in the movie. The fact that they are played does not change much, even though they do not let their characters ever get a full hole or even an annoying or anything like that. <br /> <br /> It is, of course, in writing that characters are not fully used. I can only assume that the original Italian film "I Soliti ignoti" works much better than this film. The film is based too much on its simple story and the predictable way of storytelling. <br /> <br /> However, the movie is just a lot of fun, perhaps because of the same simplicity. This is a harmless little capric film where you simply shouldn't worry about the story. In this context, "Welcome to Collinwood" is still a movie that works well and simply serves its purpose. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that you will not regret when you finish it, but it is also a movie that can really be done without ever seeing. <br /> <br /> 7/10
