Okay, so there is a view of Checker's taxi, probably from the late 1930s. It has excellent triangular headlights. There's also a DeSoto cab in this black, characteristic, almost musical love that went wrong with the story. Men's and women's hair styles are proud. If Dolly Parton had Victor Mature's hair, she would have made it big. There is an artist's attic that would be the envy of every Andy Warhol. <br /> <br /> If you look at it, waiting for a great Casablanca story or Sound of Music oh-pah-pah, you will be disappointed. This movie has a nice little story under the landing model model approach. <br /> <br /> My copy of DVD for another movie for $ 1 was very visible. The title sequence was cute, but not there Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World or The Pink Panther. It was a RKO movie, but it didn't have a beautiful airplane logo that RKO used. <br /> <br /> I liked Victor Mature one million, B. C. and Sampson and Delilah, and especially violent Saturdays. See if you can find it. He was a wonderful comedy with Peter Sellers, called Caccia Alla Volpe or after Fox. <br /> <br /> Richard Carlson went on television with three lives in the early 1950s. Vic Mature was offered Sampson's father's role in rewriting Sampson and Delila. He had allegedly asked him if he had problems with his father's participation, as he was known as Sampson. Victor replied, "If the money is right, I'll play Sampson's mother." <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
