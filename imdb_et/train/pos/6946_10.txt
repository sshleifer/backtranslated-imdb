24 must have the best spy / adventure series TV he had ever sent. The whole idea of ​​telling a story in 24-hour real-time is dazzling. The style of filming and stimulation is what looks at us. And Jack Bauer has long been one of the biggest protagonists in TV series. I appreciate it with Simpsons and X-Files, my three most popular TV series. Bauer is invited to his office to find out who is behind it and, at the same time, to imagine his daughter's journey to unkwown after his bedroom escapes. Thus, the adventure begins with the best political style and best of all, it always happens in real time, making this TV series a real original work at a time when almost every TV show seems to be visible to us the same things over and over again.
