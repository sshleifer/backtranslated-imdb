Some have compared it with Deliverance. I believe that mice and men are more appropriate. Our leading man, Heaton, certainly loves Spike. It is irrelevant and irrelevant whether it is sexual love. That's why Heaton doesn't leave Spike. She needs her. They need each other. As brothers as a family, their only connection with humanity. Determination, scenario, minimal cast, make up a fine film. Frankly, I didn't care what happened to the cases. But I took care of what the filmmaker did to them. He did well with them. I spent some time thinking about how to end with mice and men. Music and cinematography were convincing and intriguing.
