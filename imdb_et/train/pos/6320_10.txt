The main reason I wanted to see this movie was a wonderful cast. One of my favorite actresses in one movie is as amazing as actually seeing it. But this movie hit me from the guard. I didn't expect it at all. It's been some time since I've seen it, but I remember I couldn't laugh! And it wasn't just what it did for me. The script was amazingly written. Every time you waited for something that happened, it didn't happen. There were so many turns, but it matched the whole film's tone, rather than getting into the pretentious. The cinema with the set was also very beautiful. I can't say anything bad about this movie! Expcept, I would have Andrew Davoli a little more screen time!
