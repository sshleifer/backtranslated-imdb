Cosimo (Luis Guzm√°n) has been told in jail about the perfect strike. Since he is behind bars and can't do it himself, he has to leave it with his girl Rosalind (Patricia Clarkson). very little brain capacity. Brothers Anthony and Joe Russo are Collinwood (2002) welcome leaders. This is a criminal comedy that is often very funny. You can't help but laugh when everything goes wrong with these men. actors play these characters.William H.Macy plays Riley.Isaiah Washington is Leon.Sam Rockwell is Pero.Michael Jeter is Toto.Andy Davoli is a basil.Gabrielle Union plays its interest in love Michelle.Jennifer Esposito plays Pero love interest Carmela.George Clooney (including the manufacturer) plays Jerzy, a tattooed guy in a wheelchair. This is a very fun flick.I definitely recommend it.
