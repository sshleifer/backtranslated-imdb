In the 1950s, alternate electronic collars are accompanied by a mysterious "space-dust" corpse, a young single, Timmy, a friend of Fidos (Billy Connelly), recently acquired by his family. <br /> <br /> Fido is quickly becoming Timmy's replacement father, whose true father cannot express his love for his son (or his warm-to-trot woman). proud Carrie-Anne Moss) who has been psychologically in love with her child (when she was forced to shoot her father who tried to eat her!). <br /> <br /> Timmy, however, is struggling when his purulent ball collar starts blinking and he attacks and kills his older neighbor. If the authorities on Fido run into problems with a couple of local bullies, and his mother, who makes a bond with their undead house-help, can Timmy be able to keep his new found friend? <br /> <br /> A refreshing zombie schtick, Fido is a great fun and delicious dark comedy that should turn to anyone with a slightly twisted sense of humor. The Romero Zombie Stage and the transplantation of the 1950s to a small town in America is a genius strike and the result is just one of the most original films to solve the whole "transformed dead" theme I've seen. <br /> <Connelly's Fido is a zombie of cinema that deserves to be included in the Undead Film Hall of Fame, with a dead bubble day and the return of a living dead Tarman; it is not often a feeling for the body walking empathy, but the performance of Big Yin is so good that I actually found myself rooting for a big blue bag! The rest of the majority will also give commendable performances to young K'Sun Ray (like Timmy) and Ms. Moss who deserves a special reputation for Ray, because for one of these youngsters he makes a special move and Moss because he's so bloody house! <br /> <br /> This is the third zombie movie I watched over the week (others are a bit disappointing Planet Terror and quite a fun-living dead flight) and, to my surprise, it's the best. Director Andrew Currie has given the genre fans something truly original and is a talent to be followed in the future. <br /> <br /> 8.5 out of 10, rounded to 9 for IMDb.
