Sorry, I don't have much time to write. I'm not a psychologist, but I've known it for 25 years. He said Scott Wilson was a very good sociopath (without conscience). I agree! He also said that Robert Blake was a person with anger and impulse who had a conscience, but could not control himself perfectly. I agree! With cooling and huge film. I've seen more than 2000 movies and put it in the top ten. My lifelong friend deals with clients like these on a regular basis. My only criticism was the narrative of the sermon at the end of the movie. Many people grow less than under ideal conditions, but only one million behave like these two losers did.
