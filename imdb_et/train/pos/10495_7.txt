Grace Saving is a nice movie to look bored in the afternoon if you are looking for something other than the usual scripts and you want to have fun. I mean, the whole idea of ​​this movie and the whole marijuana is that crazy! It was the first film I watched on this topic (drugs / marijuana), which does not really criticize it, but makes it fun. Grace Trevethyn is a widow who lives in a small town in the US and has many financial problems because of her dead husband who committed suicide because she was full of debt. The problem is that Grace, who imagined she had the money to save, discovered that she had to pay all her husband's nails to lose all her stuff, especially her house, which she loves so much. He never worked before and is in a tragic situation until Matthew, his gardener, who has found a great smoking pot, decides to work with him to sell a large amount of marijuana.
