"Danaza Macabra" (Blood Castle) DVD is very strange. This is because some of the film is in French with subtitles and the rest is dubbed from French to English. Sometimes two characters are skipped in the middle of the symbols! When I tried to dub JUST with subtitles or just dubbed it, it didn't change! Strange, but still observable. <br /> <br /> The story must be based on the story of Poe, although I can't remember which one it is. In fact, the nature of Poe appears at the beginning and at the end of the movie - although it didn't seem very pleasant to him. <br /> <br /> The rich man bets with the carrier that he can't stay home all night. It seems as if it is easy to win - even if the house is very scary. But it can't be that easy, because the rich man says that all those who used to bet earlier died - but that stupid STILL wants to wager! At home, he meets cute Barbara Steele and falls mad for her. Later, however, he learns that he died more than ten years earlier! How's that ?! I can tell you more about the plot, but don't want to break any relationship. See it for yourself to find out the rest of the story. <br /> <br /> This movie gets very high marks to create a creepy atmosphere. House, black and white, and music work together to create a frightening movie. As far as the plot is concerned, it is interesting - especially because there are many turns - so much that you do not know who is and who is not at the end of the movie at Undead. <br /> <br /> The only downside is that I was sorry for the bad snake that was unnecessarily killed. Crazy because it may seem like I felt sorry for it and it hardly seemed necessary. <br /> <br /> Parents may also want to know that there is some nudity to the end. A strikingly beautiful woman seems topless, but it is hardly necessary for the plot.
