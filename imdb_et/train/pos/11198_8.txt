Hitchcock shows his already developed understanding of the visual images of this early silent film. The plot of the movie, which includes two girls fighting boxers, is a straightforward drama without much to suggest. However, Hitchcock's talent is found in his stunning images. Almost every shot is full of visual symbols. Particularly memorable is the jewelry that a boxer gives to a girl just before she marries another boxer. He slides his hand clearly in a sexual way, and with one simple move, Hitch has shown us what we need. Boxing scenes are well handled with some interesting points of view, which once again prove how far Hitchcock was. The film also gives an overview of her later treatment of women. The object of boxers' desires is money and lust, not cause or love. The only other women in the film are beautiful party girls who make open sexual opportunities or old crowns who help to destroy happy relationships. All in all, the Ring must be for anyone interested in Hitchcock's early works and his development as a visual storyteller.
