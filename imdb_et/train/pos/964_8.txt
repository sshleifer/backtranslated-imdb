"Yokai Daisenso" is a Takashi Miike children's film, but as you think, it is probably a bit too dark and scary for the younger ones. However, older children may eat it, which means that if you play it in duplicate in English. <br /> <br /> The story is a young boy who has lived with his mother to live with his grandfather after divorce. During the village festival, the boy is chosen as the "Kirini cyclist", a great honor, but there are of course many dangers and adventures in this honor. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, evil deeds are in the hands of a woman. The white mini skirt, go-go boots and beehive hair make the team with evil Yokai to change their resentment and thrown objects against them. And this evil has appeared as a flying city as a monster that drives the city of Rage, Tokyo. One pretty funny scene has two lies that look at the monster to fly over the city ... says one, "Oh, that's just Gamera." <br /> <br /> A young boy is friendly with Yokai, who are monsters that are mostly benign, isolated from people and all Japanese bands to fight Yokai against evil. <br /> In many ways, Miike and the team have taken Yokai films in the late '60s and turned them into a modern (older) children's adventure film that also combines some strange mechanical monsters that made me think of Transformers. The look and feel of the film is great, the effects are fun, and some humor just goes over the child's heads, but the parents can enjoy it. As with adults, you don't really like it here if you are a fan of the Japanese monster film you enjoy from this devil. <br /> <br /> Cool and fun things, sometimes dark but maybe it's just Mike ... and what a wild ride. 8 out of 10.
