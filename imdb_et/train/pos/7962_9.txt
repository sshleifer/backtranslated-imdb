Very few "remakes" can be as good as originals. It exceeds this limit with flying colors. Just remake, I don't believe it! I was theatrical at the age of nine, and it was completely entranced by the film. <br /> <br /> The film definitely calls for a comparison with a 1963 colleague. The earlier film is also an enjoyable and entertaining film, but feels that it tends to feel like a documentary of nature rather than a film. This update is more epic and cinema. However, I strongly recommend both movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely visible to the natural lover. We have a wise old golden retriever, shadow; sharp, sarcastic Himalayan cat, Sassy; and a young, fun loving American bulldog, Chance. Animals are creatively tuned by Don Ameche, Sally Field and Michael J. Fox. <br /> <br /> The film has almost nothing offensive. There's a bit of scatological humor, but something extreme. There's no hard violence, save a couple of intense scenes related to a heavy waterfall, an angry spike, and a dark rail shaft. <br /> </p> The film won no prizes, no one. However, I have to say that it is as good as some of the best image candidates today.
