I've also been trying to find this movie for a while and how big it would be on a DVD ... <br /> <br /> I saw this movie when I was about 6 years old in the Netherlands. And I was very impressive. It was shown before Walt Disney's JUNGLE BOOK! <br /> <br /> What I remember about this movie is fragmented. I remember that an Indian boy was an eagle's friend. It really affected me. For some reason, he was thrown out of his village (didn't understand the reason). When the other guys threw the stones at him, he climbed the stone and jumped. At that time he became an eagle and flew with an eagle friend. As an eagle, she still suffered a turquoise necklace. <br /> <br /> CB
