I love this movie and I've seen it quite a few times over the years. It gets better with every view. I agree with all the positive comments here. Yes, it is harsh and brutally realistic because life on the prairie was these days. I found myself commenting when I watched it. Someone here said Rip Tower was unsuccessful. I could no longer agree. She is brilliant as a stunter, Clyde Stewart, who says little and works like a slave / work horse. Conchatta Farrell is fantastic as Widow Elinor, whom Clyde hires a housekeeper / cook (with her 7 old daughters). Lilia Skala is great as a distant neighbor called grandmother. The star is also the prince of Montana. It's as beautiful as the brutal country where you live. There are some scenes that are both repulsive and necessary. There are no special effects you see are real! She even has an amazingly perfect music score and a great script. When you see Heartland, you'll never forget it. It deserves all the 10s he can get here.
