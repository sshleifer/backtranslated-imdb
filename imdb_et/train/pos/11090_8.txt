Harry Mitchell, a successful self-made married businessman (Roy Scheider's superbly sharp performance), is a adulterer who burns with young youth stripper Cini (gorgeous Kelly Preston). Harry blackmails the drum with a small lifetime hood - sloppy porn theater director Raimy (great slick John Glover), antsy stripper owner Leo (well played by Robert Trebor) and crazy pimp Bobby Shy (intimidatingly intense Clarence Williams III) - who has recorded his interaction with Cin. When Harry refuses to pay, the lockers kill Cini and look like Harry did. This, in turn, deepens the dangerous mindset and wills between Harry and the hoods. Directed by John Frankenheimer, who uses a robust script based on Elmore Leonard's terrible crime thriller, maintains a vigorous pace, provides a lot of gripping tension and effectively creates a pleasant atmosphere. Wires are all equally excellent when Ann-Margret supports extraordinarily strong turns when Harry bitterly ignored Barbara, vanity as a chartered prostitute, Doreen and Lonny Chapman as Harry's loyal business partner Jim O'Boyle. In a tight, non-silent plot, viewers have their toes all over. There is also money on the evil profane dialogue, Jost Vacano's shiny cinematography, Gary Chang's confusing score, harsh immoral tone and striking conclusion. Both Vanity and Preston take their clothes off as an extra bonus. A very strong and satisfying small number, worth looking at.
