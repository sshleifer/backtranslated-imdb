This is one of those unique horror films that require the word "horror" to be more sensitive to understanding so that it can be understood. The main thing people cannot understand is that this story is spoken from the point of view of a little boy, and as with most younger children, he just gets fear. Mainly because he just does not understand things, for example, why his father is almost absent. When you watch the film, you see that the husband, together with his wife, claims a balance between working time and family time, and you can easily understand it, but the little boy does not. It can also be imagined that the boy is afraid of the forest, as it has been established at the beginning of the film that the family is a city. At the beginning, when the family drove into the house, they were caught in fear, they got stuck, they say to the locals, and the little boy didn't find the introduction pleasant. <br /> <br /> "Wendigo" is ultimately what his young, innocent mind prepares to explain it all. There's an American Indian legend, but when you look at the event where a young boy hears it, he is told that it is direct and simple. Not because Wendigo actually is, but because he understands it. If you watch a movie from this perspective, you can really appreciate it. Obviously it was a low budget and was kicked in cheap but jumping assemblies, using light and generic eeriness more than offsetting it. And the last question the film asks is: is it all about your head or is it really there? Rated: robbery, violence and sex scene
