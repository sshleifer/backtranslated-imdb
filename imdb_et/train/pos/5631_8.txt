Weaving to Fawcett to take on roles that were considered controversial at that time. In my memory, rape was still a taboo subject in the 1980s, and women's rights and emotions were rarely studied so far during this time. <br /> <br /> Fawcett is just a woman who is followed and then actor James. Russo. He is enough as an obsessed psychopath, but sometimes a bit transparent. <br /> <br /> Diana Scarwid has a bit of a role, as does Alfre Woodard as a housewife. Woodard is worried about the legal consequences of Fawcett's revenge on the offender. The scene in which he throws a hot oil in the Russo pan is a classic and deserves to be raped. Then he keeps him in slavery and the consequences must be faced. <br /> <br /> A very real story that reflects the emotions and rage of victims of violence who have been physically and mentally corrupted. Highly recommended. 8/10
