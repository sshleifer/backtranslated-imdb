I don't see how you can say that Freddy's nightmares are hair and dirty. You probably don't know a good TV when you see it. Episodes are full of drama and blood. Freddy is creative as he kills people. I love Freddy's horrors and hope to get all 44 episodes on DVD. The best episodes are: Saturday night specials, school work and love. If you think this series sucks, you are right to your opinion, but keep in mind that this is just your opinion and it does not mean anything. Freddy's nightmares are always one of the best series and you need to take it quickly enough. If you don't like it, don't look at it, but don't deny it.
