In the third or fourth week, this last tip of ENCW was seen. I enjoyed it so much that I ordered a DVD. This is indeed a standout and of course the first Mann-Stewart couples. More than a normal oater, though not quite as powerful as searches. Much of the obvious insignia about achieving masculinity, but it is mainly about Stewart, his partner Millard Mitchell, Shelly Winters and Waco Johnny Dean-Dan Duryea. Steve Miller (not The Joker) is interesting because a beautiful hero who is interested in Lola, but is too yellow. Like Stewart, who killed Liberty Valance, he is put on a virtually reduced field and served his enemies with coffee. Undoubtedly shrink. Tony Curtis of the Bronx Cavalry and Rock Hudson, who does not see the Indian language on the screen, have interesting bags. The Rick American Cafe is a very low quality Western version. Nobody wants to stay there. Jay C. Flippens over kiss Lola (Winters) and has some nice scenes from Stewart before she gets to the Bend River and Far Country. Is Geer Wyatt Earp and Prime Minister of India, who takes Walter Brennan's teeth on Red River as a pleasant note. It is so western that only Stewart, not Wayne or Scott, could have pulled. I'll take it, I'll repeat it. :-)
