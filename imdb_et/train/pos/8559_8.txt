Behind this film is a certain genius. I laughed all the time. The scene in the phone's sex office, which discussed how love improves, was a nice test of genius / humor. Enforcement is bad, but you see the writer's message and has some talent. At the end of the Doppelganger created like ... "ok, it wasn't quite expected, but let's see what the movie has to say". Definitely a ridiculous but sweet idea, and it is very strange that it would be very coherent with the story. <br /> <br /> Is the film's point logical or must it be entertaining or communicating at an emotional level? I'm bored by many movies, but it keeps my interest all the time. <br /> <br /> I think this story may have some auto-biographical roots, but it's just a guess. Terrible bad, but good. I'm looking for other movies that this person has done (more experience).
