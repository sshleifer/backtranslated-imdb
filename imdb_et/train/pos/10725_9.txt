Space Camp is a pretty decent movie. The plot is predictable, but the actors do a good job and the special effects are decent. <br /> <br /> This movie was originally released during a shuttle disaster and really hampered how popular it was. <br /> <br /> A scene where buses that open in space are just big on the screen, that is ... on TV ... it just looks like an average. I remember this scene in the theater. It made you feel like you really were there. <br /> <br /> This would be a good movie to see in IMAX, but I'm sure it will never happen.
