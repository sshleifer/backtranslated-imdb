I saw this Australian film about 10 years ago and has never forgotten it. The film shows the fear of war so that Hollywood is mostly shiny. The relationship between the soldiers of the two warring states is highlighted by the differences in culture and the ultimate knowledge that ultimately we are not all internally different. If you find a copy of it, buy or rent it. You don't have to be disappointed, just awed.
