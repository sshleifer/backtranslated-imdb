A good picture is worth all the words. This film has the most poetic scene that has ever dreamed of people with Down's syndrome. And I won't break it when I tell you. You want to see it yourself. <br /> <br /> Pasqual Duquenne is an amazing actress. I didn't need to understand a word he said to understand his meaning. <br /> <br /> The film has its own magic. After watching it, I realized better that we achieved too much value for accomplishments and not enough people we love. Passion and simplicity are all we need.
