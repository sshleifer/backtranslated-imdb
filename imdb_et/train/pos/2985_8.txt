The idea behind making this film, one of the first and best international color schemes for cinematographic opera, was to make it more accessible to the masses. And it managed to do it perfectly. The public is still not in the love story of two young exotic lovers in ancient Egypt when it was played by a typical 300 pounds over 40 tenors and soprano with vocal equipment to sing glorious music. As a result, the beautiful principles (young Loren, beautiful Della Marra and dirty Mrs. Maxwell) are visual substitutions that make the story much more credible by giving those who are not familiar or familiar with music a better chance to get scents that might not be otherwise. All in all, there is an enchanting introduction to one of Verdi's excellent works. I remember seeing it when I was in high school and it definitely aroused my interest in opera - a form I wasn't familiar with. I still like this movie to be pleasant and I would recommend it to those who appreciate great music, plus better-than-average images. Luciano Della Marra was challenging to Radames, and unfortunately no other film appeared to the audience.
