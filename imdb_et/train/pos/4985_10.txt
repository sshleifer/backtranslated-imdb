People do not seem to have given Lensman enough credit if it is due. Some questions have been overlooked, which is key to understanding Lensman's experience. As a person looking at much of the early 80's animation, Lensman is unique in using what appears to be computer generated images at a time when computers were extremely primitive. An excellent example of this is the Kimi battle against geometric shears. Every time I look, I have to repeat myself that it was in 1984 when it was made. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack: Lensman has one of the craziest soundtracks I've heard, and this mad hysterical winning passes through every corner of the movie. Lensman heavily borrowed two western mistakes and managed to handle the first one - the need to fill every second with quiet music and the need for a heroine. Although the music is well adapted and brings scenes such as a motorcycle battle at the Thionite factory in Radelyx, the heroine's theme fails because of Chris's very annoying value. It is interesting to note that constant music prevented my attempts to remove noise when I archived the lens from analog to digital - because there was no silent seconds that could be used as a reference point. Western Impact: Helmut - sounds like a "helmet" and has the same voice as Darth Vader. Clarissa Fairborn - is the same hairstyle as the SW Princess and her name sounds suspiciously like Marissa Fairborn on Transformers. Takes over the role of Han Solos when driving a ship and having technical expertise. Buzzkirk - Chewbaka's definite improvement. Lens - a nice concrete copy of a power that is less than an opportunity for an audience to proclaim Christianity in the original SW. Although strength relied much more on faith than concentration, the lens is a pure concentration tool. In theory, anyone could use a lens. The lens is much more limited than power - it's a purely protective / offensive weapon. <br /> <br /> Technology: The boskone alliance has interesting cutting boards. They look like stormmen with red uniforms only, not white. The idea of ​​a DNA weapon was nice when only it was developed. The galactic alliance seemed like Starblazers (or whatever it was called - the 60th series where they fought with Xylons). There wasn't enough ship battles for me - it's much better on the second Lensman movie. <br /> <br /> Finally a note about Worzeli. This character is a unique and very interesting character design, which fortunately continues the second film. <br /> <br />
