In 2054, Paris, the computer-generating system Avalon, controls the city, and when a young woman is kidnapped, Detective Karas (Craig) must answer Avalon to find her. <br /> <br /> The Renaissance is a great mix of movie mix with a conceptual futuristic narrative that lights up in the shocking mansion of the screen, featuring noir-themed ideology and conceptual assemblies that should delight many. <br /> <br /> Pixar is an animation master. Their numerous Oscar winning films are endless from Wall-E to the charming Toy Story, and so every business or director has a real challenge to knock their perch. Renaissance is not a film aimed at a young audience, but as in 2007 in Persepolis, it provides a strong and mature approach to the genre of animation to make an older and more complex film for its older generation. <br /> <br /> In 2005, Robert Rodriguez published a shockingly brilliant note of Sin City that shook the green screen's full use of excellent balance and odd coloring of black and white filming, and a year later Christian Volckman used a similar approach to this equally visually masterful filmmaking tactic . <br /> <br /> Volckman's image is still full of animation, but it is no longer realistic in most of its strength for 1 hour and 40 minutes of running time. The characters' faces are well illustrated and this film must be the best for shade use. The fact that we never know whether his night or day is appropriate when we just look at the rocky faces when the shadows mix with these outputs. It is almost wise to use pathetic use and it is also finely targeted. <br /> <br /> For anyone who has seen Persepolis, you have come to the conclusion that this is one of the best targeted animations ever by Marjane Satrap, a simple but very conceptual artistic style. The Renaissance is on equal terms with the same picture and rivals in many cases have a stronger graphics and darker tone to reflect the mood. One scene, especially when Karas comes out of the darkness, is beautifully shot. <br /> <br /> The narrative revolves around a stubborn and desperate political government that keeps a command of every citizen. The running of Paris is a mysterious Avalon, which we do not see enough to get the essence of this real domination. The Renaissance checks the narrative of the tired police for their efforts to save the mysterious woman and then we see that Craig's tired and boring cop attempts to rescue while fighting other elements. There are a lot of things to do with scripts, not to mention the tired exotic policeman, which is old, but there is a lot of momentum for adrenaline and stubborn signs that keep it alive until the shocking last few steps are wonderfully shot.
