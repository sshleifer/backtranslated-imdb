Riding Giants is an incredible documentary describing the history and stories of three influential wave surfers, Gregg Noll, Jeff Clark and Laird Hamilton. Stacy Peralta has done an amazing job with the role of director and should be congratulated on such excellent work. The film's structure is superbly edited and works great with narration, interviews, animation and surfing. The music soundtrack simply adds to the overall satisfaction of watching this movie, making it great for Riding Giants. Personal Highlights include all Greg Noll's comments, his direct honesty, Laird Hamilton's film in Teahupoo and the final results of the film. But really this whole movie is one big, recommended highlight, which is highly recommended if you have the opportunity to see it. It is a shame that it is not better known, but it is worthy of precious. 10/10
