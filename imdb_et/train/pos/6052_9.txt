Highly recommended! <br /> <br /> A well-written, funny movie that likes everyone with a sense of humor !!! Let it go, it's good to see an independent British movie more than your own big studio apartments! It is definitely worth adding a movie collection. In this movie, there are scenes that I am sure many people can communicate with. You laugh loudly and enjoy a great soundtrack. I especially enjoyed the Orb version of Jimmy Cliff Vietnam and the London Tower Freebird. <br /> <br /> Go ahead ............ you don't have to be disappointed.
