In Paris, America is a wonderful musician inspired by Parisian American painter. She meets a wealthy woman who admires her streets in painting and believes she will get her work even more popular to the public, eg. in the museum. Golden Globe was named by Gene Kelly because artist Jerry Mulligan is perfect for singing and especially dancing. She also meets with the main girl, Lise Bouvier (Leslie Caron), who is at her best friend. She can't help her feelings about this girl, even after she finds out who she's related to. It's a great romance and a great song and dance, it's a very good musical film. It may be a little dancing with its dance dreams, ie the American Paris ballet, but it is a good happy ending. It won the Oscars for best art direction, best cinematography, best costume design, best music, music image evaluation, best writing, story and scenario and best picture, and was nominated for Vincente Minnell and Best Director Movie Editing was named BAFTA for Best Movies Any and won the Golden Globe for the best movement - musical / comedy, and was nominated for Vincente Millenni's best director (Liza's father).
