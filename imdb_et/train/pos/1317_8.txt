This anime was undervalued and still. Hardly dorky kids movie as noted, I still come back 10 years after I first saw it. One of the best movies is released. <br /> <br /> Animation that is not perfect is good, camera tricks give it a 3D feeling and the story is still as good today as I grew up and saw breakers like Neon Genesis Evangelion and RahXephon . It obviously has no depth near the depth, but try to see it with ease. It's a story for entertainment, not questioning. <br /> <br /> Another one of my favorites came back when I felt like strangling over white anime. Not to say it's a childish film, it has surprisingly sad moments and you need humor to see it all.
