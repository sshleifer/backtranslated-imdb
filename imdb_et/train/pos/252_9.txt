The performances were great, the costumes gave this time a unique feeling and being a Victorian Living Historian, I was impressed by the accuracy and attention to the detail. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't say that you need the knowledge of Kelly saga to stay in the stream of this movie, but to understand the time events and attitudes that need some basic historical knowledge. Don't wait, because some pretty foolish people, any character with Auzzie accent, as we know it, was a state of childhood at that time. <br /> <br /> OK, the story was some of the fictional elements, but they're necessary for broader film compliance. Gregor Jordan said in an additional DVD that he wanted his film to "inspire interest", and that happened to me so that this movie gets thumbnails here. <br /> <br /> Look at this and you're not sorry
