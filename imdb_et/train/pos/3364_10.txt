I was also quite surprised to see how few people voted on this movie, and just had to write something, although my comments are quite similar to the comments I have already written. <br /> <br /> I like a lot of movies. Great action between Mastroianni & Loren. The way of narrating the film: Humanity and love between these two outsiders are slowly evolving and conflicting with fellow Fascist radio transmitters (who are part of Mastroian) and the ongoing inhumane marching and followers. and from the show. For me, this is a very subtle film of what a human being must be. Maybe some of you say the fascist "message" is too clear, but for me it didn't destroy the film. My voice is 10/10.
