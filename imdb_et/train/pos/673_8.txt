There is still much between the great gap we understand, which we do not know about what the elders of the early tribe explained. In any case, there are many too many conscious dangers. In contrast, there are those who warn us that they have not prepared what they warn. In this film called "The Last Wave", Aboriginal mother tongue is murdered for no apparent reason. When those responsible are arrested, they are less silent if they disturb the order of things. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) plays a defense officer appointed to defend the accused. Although his childhood prophetic images are haunted and warned by the modern signs given to him by the sympathetic Aboriginal named Chris Lee (David Gulpilil), Burton continues to defend against violation as Tribal Law and therefore does not fall under standard justice. The film is full of mysterious, dark, world-wide apocalyptic end-of-life disasters and warns of the tsunami and punishment of the future island. Black drama and deep rituals are what makes this film frighteningly appealing and therefore not with a weak heart, in fact, the simplest haunting phenomena are the nightmares of innocent filmmakers over the years. Good quiet drama. ****
