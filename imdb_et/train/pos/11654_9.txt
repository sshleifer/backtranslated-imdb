I agree with the above comment, I love this realism and in many movies (not just in eating disorders), the producers forget it. They take up a problem every day and create a huge dramatic scene and then come to the end of the movie all that is perfect, which I don't like because it's not reality. Does not mean that things do not get better and does not mean that things do not stay in this movie, but it does not spend much of the film, causing all these problems, and come to the end of the movie when everything is perfect again. When people have eating disorders, people just don't recognize it and want to get better, and then life is peachy, it takes time and I like how we grow characters in this movie. better and worse because it is a very important part of the movie. It gets into the minds of people with eating disorders and shows very complicated complications and pain, and I loved it. I also love how it shows people of mystery and betrayal feel they are suffering from eating disorders, it is scary to see how people react when they know it, especially when they approve it. I thought this movie was very touching and beautiful and well-spoken and one of my favorites.
