One of the more interesting things about these movies is how the characters and their history have evolved. I think the writers wanted us to be interested in the characters so as not to force them to get their characters. The prerequisite for the use of art and crafts in furniture design and construction was the unique theme and / or analogy of what families / siblings are living through. The complexity of dual understanding is replaced by the father and even the husband added great tension to the emotional interest of this film. Also, although the story was not such that the masses could be directly involved (i.e. with the Jewish / twin / family company), the subjects are quite universal, as each family has a black sheep. This made it very interesting.
