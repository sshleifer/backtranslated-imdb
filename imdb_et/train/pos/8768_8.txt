I saw it in a shop in a cheap part of the movie. I actually remembered a living ad and a trailer for this year. I thought, "What's hey" and bought it, basically because the plot sounded interesting and Claire Danes has always been one of the most talented people in my eyes (it was even before I became a big Kate Beckinsale fan). <br /> <br /> So about two girls who are laughing at a holiday in Bangkok will get a drug break (which they are innocent) and then be sent to a Thai prison, followed by a question about what happened and sometimes their innocence. <br /> <br /> Both Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale provide great performances, and this film plot is surrounded by unusual abilities and raises some nice moral issues. <br /> <br /> I think this could have been longerâ€¦ it would have helped to solidify these signs and get to know Thai law system policy better. <br /> <br Nevertheless, it is a good movie with some great performances. <br /> <br /> PS All your pop culture junkies look at Paul Walker's two-minute role. I didn't notice him for the first time.
