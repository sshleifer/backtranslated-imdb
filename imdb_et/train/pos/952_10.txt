So this is made for the TV show only on this site 7.6? Bah! Humbug! This version of the 1984 Dickens classic story is undoubtedly the best ever made. And yes, the applicant has seen the 1951 version, which was also good but not good enough. The lack of color is probably the biggest drawback of this version, although the actor was wonderful. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott is just as incredible as Ebenezer Scrooge. We all know the ghastly story of a businessman haunted by the ghost of his dead partner, then three nights later that night. Scott is like Scrooge properly. In fact, there are some critics who claim that it is unable to find a new one, that it will awaken Christmas in the morning after the spirits teach him a valuable lesson. But hey, that's George C. Scott. She will never go dancing on the street with joy. He has too much dignity and his Scrooge is realizing his emotions. <br /> <br /> Supporting performances are equally excellent, as are costumes, music and scenery. 19th-century London lives in Clive Donner's visionary style. The film even limits the terrifying views of the spirits. The important story of morality, however, appears in every frame. <br /> <br /> You won't find this version on television anymore, and that's disappointing. A Christmas Carol's 1984 version should be part of the celebration of every household holiday. When the decorations come out of the basement, this movie should find the DVD player for at least one season. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The Hound.
