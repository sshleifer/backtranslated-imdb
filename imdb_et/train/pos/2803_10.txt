Former 2-year-old Okinawan Karate world champion I like to sacrifice films for sports. But this movie is much more. This movie is so good and so deep. I have recently been afflicted with a very serious injury and quite a catastrophic lack of passion. Almost for me lights. And this stupid little film touched me so deeply that it reminded me of what life should be. It's a live movie. Live your life for yourself and respect others. Empowerment. God, bless "Bend it like Beckham" I believe it's a real gem.
