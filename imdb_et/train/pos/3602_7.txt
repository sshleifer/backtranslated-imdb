Although the story of a complicated child who turns to boxing for self-esteem and anger management is hardly a new thing, the story is given to a new twist when the protagonist is a girl instead of a boy. Diana has problems at school. He just can't fight. At home, his father is constantly down. Her brother is training her at the gym and one day, when she takes her, she decides she wants to train. <br /> <br /> It's easy to call this movie "Rocky with girls". But that's not what it is. The story really is very useful from the main characters who are more like a girl than a boy. That way, you can solve more problems at once. First of all, his problem is not taken, because he is not a girl and when he reaches the boxing hall, because he is a girl at all. It is also a story about how the goal can change something. When positive things can grow you. I don't want it to sound like a pretense, because the film doesn't feel at all, but what I'm saying is true. <br /> <br /> Michelle Rodriguez is also very good. It's really a shame that he's now stuck in a "karma girl" because it's not really part of "Girlfight". Of course she is a female boxer, but rather it is the more sensitive moments that really make her shine. performance. I appreciate it 7/10.
