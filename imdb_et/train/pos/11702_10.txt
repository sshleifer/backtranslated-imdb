Thief in the Night must be the best of the end-time thrillers. I have no idea what people complain about what people are angry about when they say they are afraid of receiving them. They just had to find a pretext and accused The Thief In The Night. Don't listen! These films are not just about one of the many possibilities of misery, but they are also fun to watch in their simplicity. In fact, they have a low budget and it is a bit obvious, but not first obvious after the first look. I had no idea, because I really expected a lot of movies like those made in the 70's to be low on budget all the time. <br /> <br /> Thief speaks at night of the young and cynical Patty Myers, who lives for what is his way, until his wife and almost all of his friends disappear in the prophetic temptation that each one warned of. First of all, there is no film around him before it happens. What it brings shows that all others around him are becoming Christians and believing in Christ, which usually happens to many people. Everyone around whom they once knew and loved will remain forever, and one who is left behind is the one who accuses everyone but himself. No one can ever blame, because they are always right. <br /> <br /> Like those who complain about the movie. These people must be adult adults. I am thirteen, and you don't see me whining, especially since I was just like Patty before I accepted Christ again into my heart. For those who haven't seen it, if you want everything else to be thrown away instead of a Christian movie, all the other wrong movies are when you enjoy The Thief In The Night. Don't tap it until you try it. Something new is always good. Trust your instincts.
