I noticed that in TOP 10 there is a new move and EMPIRE STRIKES, but it is not even in TOP 100. <br /> <br /> This movie has a bad reputation because of ewoks, but there are so many reasons to love this movie: <br /> <br /> Saving Han Solo from Jabb: This officer breaks Han Solo the plot that was created when we first answer A NEW HOPE. <br /> <br /> - The emperor was finally revealled: Well, it may not work as well as the prequels are over, but it was the first time we saw the emperor as children. <br /> <br /> - Faster Bike Chase: Alright, so it was a special effect moment. But it was definitely one of the most memorable and exciting moments in all the movies! <br /> <br /> -The 3-point climax: 1) Endor's Battle (headed by Han and Find) 2) Luke understands his father & Emperor's fall 3) Destruction of another dead star (Lando moment) <br /> <br /> - Final celebration with our heroes: As I said, this movie gets a lot of nonsense because of Ewoks. but I think it's cool that while the whole galaxy marks the EMPIRE COLD, our heroes have their own party in the forest with each other. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was a very fun chapter for our heroes and the story of STAR WARS.
