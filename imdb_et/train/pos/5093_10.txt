The 1985 version of this movie is simple; Indiana Jones was so closely modeled after Alan Quarterman (or at least the character of Alan Quartermain Type) that the '85 director made a mistake when IJ's film and story was looted too deeply. The final product was that Alan Quartermain was confused, inexpensively imitated in the uneven hodge shop of the IJ-saga (a touch of Austin's Powers-esquire here and there). <br /> <br /> Many critics said it was a "big parody" or "involuntary comedy". The word is involuntary. This film was never meant to be humorous; witty, yes, but not humorous. Unfortunately, it's pointless, not funny. <br /> <br /> With this new M4TV mini series you get a lot more story, your leadership character, solid images and fine, even a fun mix. This story is a bit long; much longer than its predecessors, but worthy, because this version carries a real story, not just action and Eye Candy. Although it includes both action and Eye Candy, it also corrects the error made in the 1985 version, forgetting IJ all together and returning to AQ source materials, making a fine, well thought out plot and some nice additions to the plots. <br /> <br /> Now, this experiment is not all challenging-extravagant, it's Indiana Jones. Nor is it bad to try. This vehicle has a plot and character and it is a beautiful AQ / KSM saga transfer. The film was placed in South Africa, the audience is given beautiful (as hopelessly) views, cultures of aborigines of the SA, and some beautiful nature decorations that blend smoothly with performances and the event here. <br /> <br /> Steve Boyum surprised me completely because I never ordered my vision. In fact, I didn't like most of her work as a director until this test. I hope this is more of a new vein of talent and less powerful that it seems to be. <br /> <br /> The price of this version is on a "TV" scale of 9.8 / 10 ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
