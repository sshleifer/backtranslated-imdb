This movie is incredible. If you have a chance, look at it. Although a warning, your eyes are crying out. I do this every time I see it, and I own it and I've been watching it several times. The performances are outstanding. It deals with darkness, pain and loss, but there is hope. This film made me look at the world differently: according to my English teacher, this is an experience. Also, if you have seen it, note the interesting use of shadows and light. The home room is a phenomenal film, and I appreciate it as the 10/10 - true - thanks to an excellent actor, amazing land plot and a heartfelt dialogue. Very tight, very moving. Not giving all the answers, but doing a lot of good points about humanity
