Uggh! This movie was not really impressed, though I have to admit that it is technically well done. It gives 7 very high production results, but it is quite poor for entertainment values. In fact, I consider it to be the most overrated films of the 1950s. It won the Oscar for the best picture, but the movie is really great and dancing and dancing. This is because, unlike some musicals that have a reasonable number of songs with a strong story and action (like MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS), this movie is almost all singing and dancing. In fact, this film has the longest song and dance number in history, and if you don't, the movie quickly suffered. Give me more story! As a result, when it comes to redundant product numbers and a weak story, this film is like a permanent diet for meringue - it just doesn't match in the long run. <br /> <br /> I think it's a movie that beats the best thanks to A Streetcar Named Desire and Place in the Sun! And even worse, the "African Queen" and "Ace in the Hole" were not even in this category! Even more amazing is that "Ace in the Hole" lost the best writing, the film's scenario - although "America in Paris" had almost no story to talk about and mostly driven by dance and song.
