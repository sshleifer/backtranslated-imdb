Surprisingly, to see the relatively low score on this movie. I just saw this movie for the first time in 10 years and was reminded why I like it. <br /> <br /> Come back with me, kids, until Michael Keaton was a straight comedy guy and you can find joy in this movie. It's a delicate comedy - the thing Ron Howard specializes in - but if that's your thing, you should check it out. Keaton's weak charm is right for this project. <br /> <br /> "Gung Ho" is a bit outdated, as it is in the last stage of the global economy, if it is still important. It means that it offers a laugh and a lesson on how people learn from each other for great benefit. <br /> <br /> You could watch and enjoy this movie without remembering the scene you liked, but it's because the whole movie is laughing slowly but constantly. It's like I.V. drip. And I mean it well.
