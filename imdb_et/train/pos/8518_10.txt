I ran this movie at a local video store over the annual walkway sales. When you watch thousands of videos, hoping to sell some cartoons, I found this movie. I read the back of the movie and knew it was God's hand at work to buy this movie. I see that I have three families living with a family (and will soon be accepted). Immediately my kids made a bond with the three children starring in the movie. The film helped them better understand their circumstances. For the first time, the eldest sister-brother (7-year-old / woman) decided to open a bit of my past and trauma she had experienced. He has won the whole trust question. It was the first time I saw him. After watching the movie, I asked him what it meant to the child. He said, "That means being happy." Must see families who promote children and consider adoption. It certainly opened the lines of communication with us.
