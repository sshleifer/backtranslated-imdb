It's terrible and very convincing. Corbin Bernson drives this film very well when he is a sliding glimpse of a control enthusiast. Linda Hoffman plays with her cheating husband and she is very easy with her - a small pool boy "holy" brings serious punishment so that a good doctor knows best - shame for that pretty smile! The last half-hour of the film is devoted to a Bernson character who loses it completely and focuses on a young actor named Virginya Keehne. An exceptionally talented performer, hovers the luminaire from the moment the braces come out. Also nice feet!
