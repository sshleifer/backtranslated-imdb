Animation always seems different. It may not be the case in Japan, but in Europe and much more in the US animation there is a big fat "KIDS" tag. France is probably one of the most comic-liberal countries, classic homes like Tin-Tin, Asterix, Lucky Luke, Valereon and so on (if you have never read them, it's not too late. They don't wear DC or Marvel's nerd stigma.) It looks natural that such a movie will appear in France. It fits my reputation with the reputation of French as art-loving, anti-US and talented filmmakers. Fortunately, there is also a "scanner dark" to suppress this view - art seems to be quite international. <br /> <br /> Anyway, as you may have, the Renaissance is an artistic and French language. If you're a normal person, fears of it. However, this is not necessary! Under this cool and glossy look, a good thriller and a good movie are common. <br /> <br /> It was one of my fears about this movie. It's so easy turning a spectacular animation trick, much like Sony & C: o doing their Pixar rip-off. I was expecting a confusing, sometimes boring, and not very interesting film, but luckily I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I would have enjoyed it so much for neo-knights, but it was good to have that level. NOTE. I've seen a French dub that was as good as possible. English can be more interesting with Craig and everything. <br /> <br /> A final praise for animation. It was fantastic. Futuristic, well-designed, nice camera work, smart solutions (for example, eyes seemed very good, hard to do) and so visually stunning I felt it "it's so damn impressive!" Again, I really like animation and I appreciate the effort under the studio so my decision is a bit biased. <br /> <br /> A good movie anyway, definitely living beyond this "trick".
