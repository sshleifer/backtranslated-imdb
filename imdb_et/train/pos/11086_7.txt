I saw this movie when I was little - it was called "Glacier Fox". I was completely traumatized! This is followed by a cute little fox family. The beginning was great and I remember it was attached to very small foxes. I also remember my mother who was out of the theater when I was hysterical. I won't tell you what happened, but let's say it doesn't stop well for all the foxes. I was used to Disney-type nature movies, where animals don't really die. Oh man. This movie made me cry. It was a good movie ... I guess - I was really little and the truth was told - I remember being happy for foxes and then seeing one of them die. Rent it if you can, but don't show your children!
