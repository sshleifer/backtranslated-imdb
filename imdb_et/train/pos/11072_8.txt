it's all very simple. Jake goes to jail and spends five years with chess and chess players. they are compassionate about the history of their disappearance and failure, and the misery they live in, because it believes in the management of their little tricks and the rules of small fraud. they decide to give Jake the ultimate freedom: his most internal fears, what he believes in himself. to do this, they take him on a journey where he had to all the fears, all proud, all hopes to retreat to restore his true master of will. <br /> <br /> It's a clever film of enlightenment, of infinite gambling and games we do together and within. 10/10, no doubt.
