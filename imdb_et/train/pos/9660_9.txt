Only after some thought did I decide that I liked this film. And after reading and commenting on all the other posters' comments, I decided I liked it. I love American movies - probably because they're so telling. Usually they have a well defined start, middle and end. Conversely, "Presque rien" does not do such a test. I disagree with other posters that say it's too artificial. Anyway, this movie is meant to remind you of your mood. So often throughout the film you feel like you are ... you feel the sun, the wind, the heat, the cooling of the winter, the companionship, the loneliness, etc. in the summer. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the director pulls you into the lives of the characters - that's why so many people feel so strong that the movie cheated them. After I finished, I felt the same. But after some reflection, I admitted that it is that the film must be: "The story" is not a narrative, it is the emotions you know (the viewer). <br /> <br /> Lighting, scenery, and camera corners will put you in scenes - they are rich, fine and alive with details and nuances. Although I usually can't film without a well-established plot (after all, it's not a movie that should tell the story), this movie is definitely my new favorite.
