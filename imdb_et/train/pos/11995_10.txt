"Spin it!" <br /> The 90's opened with the Disney's favorite, "TaleSpin", a series of TV series featuring "The Jungle Book" characters. Join Baloo and Kit Cloudkicker as they fly with Sea Duck, as you have never seen before: Cape Suzette, Louie, up the mountains, jungles, water, volcanoes, looking for adventure, searching for treasure, looking for fun, all in one action pack with cartoon adventure !!!!! <br /> <br /> It was both my and my family's favorite. It ran on Disney Afternoon in the first half of the 90s until the original cartoons moved to the Old Disney Channel in 1995, which I saw on holiday once in 1996 before getting the cable in March 1997. <br /> <br /> And the good news: DVDs are here !!!!! Elavdage "Dun, dun, dun, TaleSpin !!!!!" fun and excitement <br /> <br /> 10/10
