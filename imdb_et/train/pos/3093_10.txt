Why didn't the manufacturers show that all TV junkies didn't give manufacturers a six degree chance? Is the series going to the video? I would like to see how it ends. Put one season on the video and sell it. I was a loyal fan of Six Degrees and waited for it to return. I set up my recorder for all exhibitions. Thanks to God. I just discovered that the exhibition was canceled and I had a broken heart. I wish I knew it would be canceled, why didn't they tell us? I thought the exhibition was only in symbols with some symbols. Writing was also pretty good. Steven (Campbell Scott) is my favorite of all time. I'm sorry to see it!
