If no one knows why no one is doing movies like before, with chat, character and simple friendship that is trying to evolve into new, better and different, these people have to take this film and look at top-notch writing, leadership and acting as it is wonderful Evening Observation of Things in Italy and England. On other days, at other times, the main roles of the funneled amazing comedy entertainment, made in 1992 by Alfred Molina, Joan Plowright, Polly Walker, Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent, Miranda Richardson and Michael Kitchens. In the direction of Mike Newell's brush, these actors perform vividly memorable performances that have been captured with the exceptionally fine painter's eye. Recalling the farce of a bedroom in the turn of the century, this film can be called a farce of friendship, which becomes a valuable experience in the growth of romantic nature in every character and viewer. The artistic telegram of the importance of carers around us.
