Hello all my names Larissa I am 13 years old when I was about 4 years old when I was looking curly to dig and knock my socks, I've been watching this movie for about 30 minutes ago. . Alice's porter is really a good actor and I love this movie as funny as it does with the cards. Every time I watch this movie at the end of it, I guess it said so, I know I'm only 13 years old, but its touching story is really strange that Alisan is now 25 years old. Every time I watch a movie, anybody is always young and the film comes out like a year after it does and when u watch it and find out how old the person in the movie is, how it gets from one age to the next. Like Harry Potter. This movie was also great, but Daniel was on the first film about 12 years old and I was about 11. SO how he could go 12-16 in about 4 years and I'm only 13. I'm not sure if he is now 16, I I think he's almost 18, but it's kind of weird when u watch one movie and then about 4 years old then u if they were the last 1 person. I'm not sure I have a great imagination and I like to revolutionize it. I am a computer person, but I also like a lot of kids doing things. I'm very smart, like a film curve, but one thing I don't like about the movie is when that guy calls the stepfather and makes the dick take away that I'd kill the guy if he'd really done it in real life. Well I'm going to finish writing I know to write a lot sometimes, but kids don't have much out there head that needs to get out and when they're not kids can never learn. <br /> <br /> Larissa
