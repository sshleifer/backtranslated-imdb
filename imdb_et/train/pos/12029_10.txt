I like the movie. Twisted Desire had Jeremy Jordan, one of my favorite and one of the most beloved participants. Melissa Joan Hart is a good actor. I've seen most of her movies, but all Jeremy Jordan. The thing I don't like about Twisted Desire is when "Nick" is arrested and "Jennifer" rats out of her. Twisted Desire is my second favorite movie. My first is The Goonies. But I still love Jeremy Jordan.
