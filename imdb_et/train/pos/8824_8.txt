Wife, Mujar (Marta Belengur) enters the restaurant one morning and: 35, knowing that the terrorist has kidnapped the people of this restaurant and makes them a musical number in this strange but exciting short film, which I only saw finding the director / writer equally exciting "Timecrimes" From DVD. It was a rather memorable song and it somehow brought a smile on my face, despite the tiny spots short. I'm glad I stumbled over it (didn't know it would be a DVD when I rented a DVD), and I wouldn't recommend it to all my friends at all. <br /> <br /> My Grade: A-
