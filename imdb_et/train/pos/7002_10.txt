Will Smith brings back a movie that talks about a man who has his own world weight on his shoulders and his crusade to make his mistakes in the way that even the harshest hearts do! Writer Grant Nieporte and Italian director Gabriele Muccino came together and created a masterpiece that I highly recommend to buy and hold in your movie collection, because you never see this movie when you watch / feel! I have the highest respect for Will Smith because he is not only a brilliant actor but can say that he has a real love for people and life, which undoubtedly made him perfect for this film (IRS Agent Ben Thomas). You'll find yourself feeling your pain and anger, the frustrations of her love of Emily, played by Rosario Dawson, who by the way was Fantastic as usual. I found myself in love that their characters fell in love. Woody Harrelson also celebrates this from the top films. It is very difficult for me to write this review without giving any points to the key point ... All I can say is, Look at it and if you make sure you have nothing to stop you, take your phone off the hook, sit back and get ready start off the mysterious life of the IRS and discard the past Agent Ben Thomas ... I thank you for Will Smith for another great movie!
