I remember this very much when I was 3 years old, but my parents accidentally killed another comic for a few seconds. Then I was about 8 or 9 years old when I discovered it again, and since I was able to understand things better, I thought it was a good movie. Just a few weeks ago (June 2006), when I discovered it again thanks to some Internet articles / video clips, it's not just the same movie. I'm sure it's still good with kids, but for us 20-30 sometime it's definitely "Cult Status" written everywhere. Unfortunately, the original production went through a painful process; if Fox gave him enough time, it would probably be better recognized by the public today. Perhaps, if they were to redefine it with a completely different story and all that star's voice might be, but it's Fox's decision. I know here, I know. I think it's a great movie, but it can be better than big.
