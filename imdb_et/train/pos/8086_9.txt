Recently I rented the animated version of "Lord of the Rings" after the live action version of FANTASTIC 2001. The Lord of the Rings, led by Peter Jackson, is undoubtedly much better than George Lucas's "Star Wars" prequel trilogy (episodes 1-3) is ever like the 21st century real fantasy movie series! <Br>> <br /> I remember seeing an animated version as a child and I didn't understand the depth of the movie at that time. Now that I've read the books, I understand what the whole story is. Certainly some characters are pretty stupid (Samwise Gangee is especially annoying, almost as much as Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars Episode One (AWFUL!)), But I have to say that it follows the book quite closely, and it goes into two books The Two Towers. The good thing is that the activity is somewhat interesting and some of the animation is quite remarkable for this time. The bad thing is that it ends sharply halfway through two towers, without Frodo's attempts to destroy one ring, and the animation is rather outdated compared to today's standards. In general, it is not as bad as many say it is. But the live-action version of 2001 is the Lord of the Rings' new badge! At least Ralph Bakshi took the script seriously! Peter Jackson has said that the animated version inspired him to read books, which in turn made him one of the greatest series of fantasies ever put on film, so we can at least thank Ralph Bakshi for that! I take the animated version of the Lord of the Rings daily to the lively version of Harry Potter! <br /> <br /> A 7 on a scale of 1 to 10, LESS is a violent version of the live action of 2001, but NOT so close! For fans of the Lord of the Rings books and film versions.
