Bad geeky Marty (Simon Scuddamore) gets terribly burned with a brutal April joke stunt that went wrong. Flash for ten years and those involved (including Caroline Monroe, who is known for horror fans in Maniac, the Faceless & Last Horror Film), is proud of a 10-year high school meeting that is unaware that the court is disguised as a hide away (now closed) ) at school and revenge. <br /> <br /> All this is an innocent pleasure, I knew it was a bad film. It has all the features of one. But there is something that makes me feel forced to watch it from time to time (preferably in beer). I'm even ready to forget the absolutely terrible ending (which I have to say I hate). I think I like it because it's a fun atmosphere for this and some pretty cool kills. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy (for men): Josephine Scandi & Donna Yeager both get topless <br /> <br /> Eye Candy (Ladies): Simon Scuddamore's free movie at the beginning of the movie > <br /> My Class: B- <br /> <br /> Lionsgate DVD Add-ons: Optional Spacebar; trailer for this movie; My Bloody Valentine (1981), Monster Squad, Dirty Dancing
