It's a cute, spirit-restoring film. From the actual wool that inspired Elizabeth Arngrim to write a novel inspired by the novel in the 1920s, every choice was right! The silent joy of this film does not recur after repeated views. Josie Lawrence, Miranda Richardson, Polly Walker, and Joan Plowright seem to have been born to play these parts! I would love to see Enchanted April appear on a widescreen format on DVD.
