"The Last Wave" is one of those films that depends heavily on the mind. The title refers to the Aboriginal Fate Day theory: there is one last wave that wipes out everything. <br /> <br /> David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) is a Sydney lawyer employed to protect some of the murdered accused Aborigines. About this time, unusual rainfall has occurred in Australia. In defending Aborigines, David learns the last wave of theory and begins to think about whether it is just mythology. <br /> <br /> The film's last sequence is a metaphor that lets you fall into the minds. Peter Weir created an amazing but thought-provoking film. Aboriginal actor David Gulpilil (whom you have seen in "Walkabout", "Crocodile Dundee" and "Rabbit-Proof Fence") offers an interesting supporting role as one defendant. <br /> <br /> Take a look at "Make" a DVD. Peter Weir explains some of the film's effects, some of which are related to Richard Chamberlain's background.
