I've never been a Farrah Fawcetti fan ... So far. He was really amazing in this movie. The emotion she has to re-take after re-taking has not thought much. It was a very hard movie to watch, the subject is decisively unpleasant, and you feel so helpless just sitting and watching a woman abused forever. In fact, I felt the whole thing disappeared somewhat when his friends came back to the house and I couldn't find the conclusion at all credible. The director seemed very high in his frames and loved reflections, I believe he should have paid more attention to the other side of this work. I'm sure this will make a powerful theater piece, this movie for me, though it was earned, just disappeared.
