This movie is the best horror movie, bar- none.I love how Stanley just tends the women to the lake. I've been a fan of Judd Nelson's work for many years and he blown me off. It's a mixture of horror and drama and romance, not so much comedy. His evil but charming look hit me right now and there. It looks in her eyes, I will never forget. Here's something, I can't describe it.
