This is the first one to see the movie I've seen last year! It is maliciously funny, incredibly original, incredibly good in appearance (they went to the look of this super cool wide-screen Technicolor that is fantastic to see) and it is actually deep and characteristic of society. It is a really smart satire that goes all the way from internal security to racial issues, while leaving laughing and realizing how much the world is living under fear. Carrie Anne Moss turns to a comic performance I never imagined from her! She's sweet, funny and sexy! Billy Connolly is great as Fido who can only scare and moan! And Dylan Baker as father is priceless. In fact, the whole cast is perfect. Henry Czerny as a bad man, Tim Blake Nelson as a hot sexy zombie girlfriend neighbor (idea got now?) Funny, though provocative and just amazing! Go and see this movie! It's like something you've ever seen.
