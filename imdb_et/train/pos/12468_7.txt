OK, this movie begins as a cheesy lifetime movie and doesn't heal almost through the movie. The script is full of "cheese" and "fluff" and most are not cast. In the first half of the movie, a little girl was hurting my nerves. I don't think this is one of his best-performing works. The only reason I bought the movie is because it was on sale and it was Ellen Burstyn. She's terrible, but it's not her best. The story is based on real events and it helps the film. Actually, I didn't even like the beginning of the movie, and I started to disgust when I saw the balloon pictures while traveling, I mean ... it goes where it should go and do it! But everything is forgiven when it reaches the destination and the story ends. If it doesn't let the eye drop, nothing! It is cheesy and predictable, but also makes the world good again.
