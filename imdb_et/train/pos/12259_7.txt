"Family matter" takes us back to America in a less complicated time. It's amazing to see how different everyone was then. It was a more innocent era in our country and we are looking at a 'functional' family that deals with things. The film also marks the beginning of the series belonging to the Hardy family. <br /> <br /> The film by George Seitz is based on a successful game. Judge James Hardy and his wife Emmily are facing an internal crisis that needs to be addressed. Married daughter Joan comes home after she has committed a social mistake and her husband is responsible. At the same time, another daughter, Marion, brings home who is obviously against her father. The happy servant Andy seems to be the only one who has no problems before her mother makes her Polly dance, which she does not want. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, Judge Hardy proves why he knows best when he puts the plan into action to get everyone back together. After all, he is the person who understands, not just the law, but how to deal with the external forces that threaten his views in the community and that makes his family happy. <br /> <br /> Lionel Barrymore plays Hardy with conviction. He's the glue that holds everything together. Spring Byington is considered a mother mother. Mickey Rooney is a small part of this movie, but he's always fun to watch. Cecilia Parker and Julie Haydon appeared as daughters, Marion and Joan. Sara Hayden and Margaret Marquis are also aunt Aunt Milly and Polly, a girl who surprises Andy in her beauty.
