This 1945 mystery thriller was greatly enjoyed by a young woman, Nina Foch (Julia Ross), who has been out of work and has left her rent and is desperate to look for work. Julia reads the advertisement in a local London newspaper, looking for a secretary and hastening to try this position. Julia gets a position and is hired by Mrs. Hughes (Dame May Witty), who demands that she live with her employer at home and would like her not to be related to male friends and Julia tells her she has no family and is free to devote all this time to this work. George Macready (Ralph Hughes) is the son of Mrs Hughes and has a very strange desire to play with knives. It was a low budget movie and most scenes were close to avoiding the cost of background and spending on the landscape. This strange family lives in large mansions on the Cornwall coast of England and has a secret door and a lot of aisles.
