I'm glad that the users (on that date) to whom this movie liked come now. I don't understand people who didn't like this movie - they seem to be waiting for serious (?!?!?) Treatment! Can you kill the fucker seriously? The filmmakers knew that it was a stupid assumption and they did not try to deny it. Straightforward delivery of scenes makes FUNNY! Yes, there are times when a low budget shows (like an explosion), but I think an expensive look would have taken the movie fun! So, if you like B-movies and rumors, you will definitely like "Jack Frost".
