It was great. Kurt Russell is fit, acting and fit. I loved this movie, it deserves more than 5.3 or more stars. This film is a story of an obsessed soldier who learns that life is more than a soldier, and that people who learn to have time to fight need to be protected. I cried, laughed and mostly sat down for this story. The job of writing a good job and the plot was suitable and quite certain. The end was not complicated, but it was still great. If you like to escape from New York or rooting a subgroup, this movie is for you. There was no excess whore or violence; Something for everyone.
