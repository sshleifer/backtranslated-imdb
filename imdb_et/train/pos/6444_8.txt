Of course, this is the line of the Lord's prayer - "Your will is done on earth as heaven". Sweden, especially its northern part, is not my idea of ​​heaven -30 ° C, the winter temperature for me is slightly lower, but the good people who live there think they are in God's own country. <br /> This story is familiar. Recognized international musician Daniel suffers from a mid-career health injury, returns to a small village in northern Sweden where he was born. Convincing the local pastor to help with the church's choir makes him an unlikely talent for class action, and they enter the Innsbruck Austrian competition. The "Brassed Off" band players have ("apologized") for "Calendar Girls" and "Full Monty" dancers. But, of course, it causes a lot of emotional upheaval, because some of the least fallen villagers understand their value and rebellions against their oppressors. He is faced with hostile spouses and an increasingly suspicious pastor, but nothing but death stops. <br /> <br /> Despite the somewhat horrible story, we know and like many people who have not met cartoons as people, although many of them are recognizable, I don't know that a woman who has been punished for so long is one in Sweden a country in a world where such violence is quite intimidating (he was also a bit young) to be one of Daniel's youngsters) and a puritan pastor whose passionate passion for girlie magazines was a bit of a stereotype, but Niklas Falk did it great. <br /> <br /> Michael Nyqvist is just as wonderful as Daniel, a weak but motivated musician, and there is also great music. I was shaken for two hours. The end is what you do about it, but it doesn't violate it when you say that Daniel achieves what he did.
