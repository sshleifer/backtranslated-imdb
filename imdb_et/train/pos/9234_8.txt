Reporting based on actual historical events, this disturbingly violent, bloody and shocking period in the epic retains the interest of the viewer, missing out on most of the films placed in far-distant timing. Mrs Bolkan is a depiction of a rebel nun. His gradual transformation from obedience, if he does not want his day to be in social injustice, is understandably proven by saying queues: his witness of a hated local duke's rape act, his forbidden love relationship with the Jew, his criminal violation of an invading Muslim by the sensual prince Ahmed (Anthony Corlan) in this film there are some painfully realistic gory sequences that are not cunning, but viewers interested in strong stomach and medieval history should find enough interest. It is worthy of visibility as the only antidote of Hollywood imagery in the medieval world.
