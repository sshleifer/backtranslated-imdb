"SÃ¥ som i himmelen" .. as above. This is the special point where the Divine and Man meet. I ADORE THIS FILM! Gem. YES amazing arm! <br /> <br /> Because of my very HUMAN quality, I was so deeply moved. I laughed and cried the whole registry, indeed through the octaves of many emotions. <br /> <br /> Mikael Nyqvist breezes BRILLIANT as Daniel, first-rate passionate, charismatic and powerful. His inner light and extraordinary talent shines through every scene, every communication, in every meeting. I was totally mesmerized, fascinated, and I tried the story of our collective story, the story of life. <br /> <br /> The film was so inclusive for many archetypes, messiahs, wounded children, magical children, artists, teachers, priests, criminals, abused, victims, bullying, divine stupid - ALL characters alive and real - everyone awoke me very affection and compassion. <br /> <br /> It's a real idea to see a thought that provokes a fun, fun movie. Oh .. don't forget the heavenly choir of angels and the breathtakingly beautiful sound. EVERYTHING - this Swedish movie is definitely filming people around the world. BRILLIANT!
