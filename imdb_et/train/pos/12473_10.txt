A warm and touching film with fantasy-like quality. <br /> <br /> Ellen Burstyn is always great. <br /> <br /> Samantha Mathis has given a lot of great performances, but there's just something about haunting your memory. <br /> <br /> Most importantly, you will see this amazing 5-year-old. old, Jodelle Ferland. I was so fascinated by his presence, I had to buy a movie so I could watch him again and again. He is a miracle of God's creation. <br /> <br /> Judging by the high IMDB rating, I am not the only one that this young actor has mesmerized.
