The plot is not going to describe the film: the man writes the film or rather * the movie. This is self-evident to the point that you think it will hit itself like a black hole. The writer writes something and it happens, or something happens and he writes about it. <br /> <br /> It's very philosophical, like "Waking Life", but more Zen oriented and on this issue, much better, in my opinion. At one point, there is an interview on the street and then you will see how these people are filmed, and then you will find that their answers are written when he flubby his lines. There is a beautiful landscape and optical illusions. <br /> <br /> I hope it will appear on the DVD so I can look at it again. Viewed Cinequest (San Jose, CA Film Festival) 2-25.
