I've seen this movie many times and I like all bad teachers wanting to give it out of ten, but they feel unfair about other good movies. However, I think it is one of those rare gems: perfect comedy. I would like to understand the greatest comics of all time. Matthau and Lemmon are perfectly fit and inappropriate. The script is so sharp that you need to prevent bleeding. The story is well known and has already been described in other comments. Both leaders give extraordinary performances, girls are great and situations are funny laterally. No prominent words (note that Hollywood, you do not have to swear to be funny, you have to be witty) and the movement of the production of the film is smooth. They don't do it anymore. Timeless.
