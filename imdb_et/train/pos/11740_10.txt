I have no doubt that the critics tried this film, especially the artistic fartsy, who needed a laxative. This is a great vehicle movie in Abbot & Costello or recently in Don Knot's tradition. It will not shake the world or change movies forever. What it does is entertainment. When all is said and done, it is most important. Watch this movie and forget your worries. He even has a simple and kind moral message at no extra cost. I always loved Elvira TV shows when I lived in LA. He no longer stole a schtick from Vampira as Vampira originally, Theda Bara. This mythical character belongs to the one who does the best; & Cassandra Peterson does it best. Elvira El Long; we need more such movies. There is never enough. The villain William Morgan Sheppard was also great. He expresses a wonderful refinement. I didn't find any technical errors. Filling is as perfect as an art form. My deep respect to the Director, James Signorell and all his team.
