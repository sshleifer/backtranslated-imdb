This is a truly classic movie of your story, acting and movie presentation. Wonderful participants are full of movies, Miss Sullivan and Jimmy Stewart are the most important characters. In real life, he admired and liked Jimmy and gave him his very first role-players and helped him to be more peaceful when he appeared in the set. The "chemistry" between the two was always obvious and so warm and enjoyable. She was so beautiful, a young woman, and so sweet in her personality design. The story of these two young people, and how they finally come together, is a charming look and pure magical entertainment. Heart warming presentations are also provided by other supporters of this great story / film. I wholeheartedly give Miss Sullivan the perfect 10 of the Golden Age Cinema Classic, a special appeal to all generations. Must See All!
