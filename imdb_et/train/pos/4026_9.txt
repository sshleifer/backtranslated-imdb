Pinjar is really a masterpiece .... It's a thought-provoking film that makes you think and makes you question our culture. This is undoubtedly the best Hindi film I've ever seen. This film should have been shown at film festivals around the world and I believe it would have been a serious candidate for Cannes. All characters were perfectly cast, and Urmila Matkondar and Manoj Bhajpai were haunting in their roles. <br /> <br /> The story the movie tells of a partition is a very important story and one that should never be forgotten. <Br / It has no prejudices or prejudices and has given the partition a human story. No country here is good or bad. There are evil Indians, evil Pakistanis and good Indians and Pakistanis. The film is great and the music is melodic, meaningful and haunting. Everything from the movie was amazing ... and the actor just took my breath away. Everything was completely cast.
