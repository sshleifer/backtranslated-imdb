Let me start by saying I'm a big Carrey fan. Although I testify that I have not seen all his films * cough * magestic * cough *. Bruce Almighty was enjoyable. No other review has really gone as the fun ends, I don't know what the writers thought. Somehow I couldn't help but feel that this movie was a bad attempt to recreate Liar Liar. <br /> <br /> According to a positive note, the Daily Show is Steve Correl HILARIOUS and so is the rest. Look at Bruce Almighty when you're a big fan of Jim Carrey, or just want to see a light (soft piano music) that is somewhat funny comedy.
