First, this film is a brilliant work of art (film). The plot was full of surprises, a little boy who claims to have grown, inherits one million dollars and how he spends it. I mean, how it is. This time Walt Disney took over. Comedy is mostly expected but the second time unexpected. I thought this movie was OK or it was OK. He also teaches wise youngsters and this child is really smart and a bit of a smart pants. But it also sucks. How the hell can such a boy get a hot police babe and his dad let him go free. It's like letting the killer release for ten years. If I wanted to do this, I'd beat it with a "suble jack" (a huge stick that attaches when your pants really tight). This baby is really happy. Back to the story. The filmmakers really knew what they did when they made this movie, but it is not perfect. Operation was good and bad. The child and the woman had no chemistry or father, but the brides were excellent. Special effects on the other hand were flat. Plus this movie is not based on reality. I hated and loved it at the same time.
