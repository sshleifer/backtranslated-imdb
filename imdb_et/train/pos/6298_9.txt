Fun. I went with 8 friends to preview this movie theft. We came to see you, but after 10 minutes I thought what the hell we got at that time, the jokes became funny and they were joking all the time. In the first part, you ask yourself about this "malinski" and "bellini" things (there are many more examples of this language) and because they repeat the same jokes (with different twists), they become more funny and funny. When searching for this malinski, all the main symbols are introduced first, even if it is the following. Until half of the movie was over, we didn't even know the name of the movie because there was no open credit and we went to see it, but we had a certain time. The house was loaded (about 250 people) and I think about half of them didn't like it and the other half loved the movie. If you like strange comic movies with great dialogue, you will love it. In addition to Clooney, this film deserves much better than the 5.6 IMDB rating that is at the time of writing, but when more ppl has seen it, I'm sure it will rise. 7.0 is reasonable, I think I would give 8 out of 10 (10 out of 10 with some beer) <br /> <br />
