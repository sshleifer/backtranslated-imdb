It's not the Masterpiece Theater. You shouldn't wait for that. It's a pure girl FUN with the most fantastic female leaders. As someone else said here, the movie Baby Mama was supposed to be. And the only downside I see is that Tina Fey wasn't there, besides, it stands for the smartest and brightest girls on the planet. Film is pure stupidity on the surface, but if you really look, you know that it has many messages and a deep meaning for all of us who want them to go back and do it again throughout their lives, knowing what we know now. PURE FUN and I recommend it to anyone looking for a great escape in 84 minutes.
