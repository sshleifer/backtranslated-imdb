SUNSHINE BOYS was a fun 1975 screen customization from the Neil Simon game of retired vaudevillia team played by Walter Matthau and George Burns, who had a very bitter break and have been asked to reunite once more for television or something like that. . The problem is that these two hate each other and don't want to do anything to each other. Richard Benjamin appears to be Matthau's nephew, a theater agent who has been given a monumental responsibility for making this reunion a reality. This warm and winning comedy is a lovely entertainment for a forgotten form of entertainment ... vaudeville and it works mainly thanks to one of Neil Simon's best scenarios and the outstanding work of Matthau, Burns and Benjamin. Burns won the Oscar for the best supporting actor, but I think Matthau is leaving this film with his fabulous fun as Willy Clark. Matthau was nominated for the best actor but was unable to receive Nicholson when he was one of the YEAR'S FLEW. but in the second year it was worth the Oscar. Matthau tells the screen and there is no false message in this beautifully timed work. The classic is a scene where he tries to trade potato crumbs and doesn't get the name of the product. SUNSHINE BOYS is a warm and winning Neil Simon comedy that stands out for its insurmountable chemistry between Matthau and Burns.
