I saw this movie at a time of limited release, mainly because of the novelty to see Pierce Brosnan's mustache, but it turned out to be one of the more fun movies I've seen during the year. It starts almost as a thriller, but it is steadily progressing into a fun work full of one-liner and great comedy energy between Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear. Also, although I say that this film is comedy, it does not forget that it sometimes has a heart and it can be very touching. I went to the theater I didn't know what to expect more than a mustache, but what I got was one of the best films I've seen for a long time. Leaving the theater felt like the movie was full and I plan to see it again when it was released. I recommend it to anyone who appreciates good comedy with a well written script and a big mustache.
