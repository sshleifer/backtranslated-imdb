Clara Bow (Hula Calhoun) is the daughter of Albert Gran (Bill Calhoun), the owner of the plantation, who is mainly interested in playing cards and friends. He is interested in riding the countryside until engineer Clive Brook (Anthony Haldane) sees the dam building. One of his father's friends, Arlette Marchal (Mrs Bane), is competing for her attention. His wife Maude Truax (Margaret Haldane) will appear for a well-established finale. <br /> <br /> Plenty of 'pre-code' elements like naked bathing. <br /> <br /> A wonderful location for shooting in Hawaii.
