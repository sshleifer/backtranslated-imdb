CHANCES ARE is a charming romantic fantasy about a woman (Cybill Shepherd) whose wife (Christopher McDonald) is killed right after her studies. Then we see a man in heaven giving them the authority to know that he was taken too early and that his wife needs him. He has said he can return to the land, but not as himself. Flashforward 19 years of seeing Shepherd's daughter (Mary Stuart Masterson) preparing for college graduation and meeting a young man (Robert Downey Jr.) who is his father's reincarnation. The film is a bit predictable ... the story goes to all the places you expect, but it's so charming as playing energetic cast (especially Shepherd and Downey) that you can't help but get in on the fun. Shepherd is rarely seen on the screen for a better advantage and he and Downey are backed by talented group character actors supporting roles. A lovely and charming fantasy that fascinates you and enchants you.
