12-year-old Arnald Hillerman accidentally kills his older brother, Eugene. His feelings are halted by the fact that his family cannot communicate with him (or feels that it is not right). His ONLY shelter is his grandfather who is ONLY the one who sees his compassion. Reality fascinates "true 2-life" film enthusiasts, but does not respond to those who want to act and excitement.
