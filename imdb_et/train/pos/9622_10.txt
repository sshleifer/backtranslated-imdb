I was watching this movie right now at Showtime. Quite randomly. If I hadn't been just 6 hours in the last two days, I wouldn't have come home. If I hadn't come home from work, I wouldn't have seen this movie. I wouldn't have known what I was missing, but I would have missed a lot. <br /> <br /> This is the movie. It's almost playing the Kevin Bacon effect. This and the causal relationship (hence my verbiage above). Any character is intertwined in some way. Action, reaction, interaction, non-interaction. This movie is just wonderful. I have to buy a copy for myself.
