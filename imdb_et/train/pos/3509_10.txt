I saw this movie a while ago and it is still at the top of my favorite movie list. It's amazingly put together and what really changes the movie is the detailed tidbits (such as the Cafe Bustelo cafe, which is reused as a cup to wash your grandchild's hair) so people don't see it because you don't know this movie HOW IS NEED HISPANIC. This is just one of those films that are very culturally specific and specific. Please do not bash this movie if you do not have prior knowledge of what base is built. I can fully see what the writer / director was doing, and he hit the target perfectly! This film is worthy of a better rating.
