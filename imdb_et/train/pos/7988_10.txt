The family and friends tend to stick to the tears for the movies all the time and they were not disappointed when I looked at it. I cried several times, but believe me it wasn't over sapphire. I hurt the family, and I hurt this man when he tried to redeem himself the only way he knew. Denzel was fabulous as always and so was Chris Walkin. Mickey Rourke, I didn't even recognize; years are not kind to him. My husband does not have to watch the movie again if they are not snore !!!! He's been watching this movie 5 times and I have to watch the DVD again because he's a worn tape and it jumped all the time I watched.
