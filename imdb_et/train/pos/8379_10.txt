I remember this movie when I was 12 years old, it was amazing .. I remember the day that I don't like most of the things I was looking at, I've even tried to buy it, but its like a rocking sh * t! Anyway, the actor is a little nervous, but the story is amazing given that it was a real B movie with a low budget and an event where the fighting scenes were amazing to watch, I had to watch it about 20 times. It was a very well made movie and I loved the idea of ​​fighting a giant man controlled by robots, sorry they had to loot it "Crash and Burn" by making this movie like it's in pants! If your true Sci-Fi movie fan is watching it, it would have been made again today, because it would be a winner. I really love to see again or even release this DVD.
