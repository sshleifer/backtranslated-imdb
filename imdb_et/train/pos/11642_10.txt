"Intervention" has helped me with my addictions and recovery. I'm a two-year-old married father. I am quite functional in my personal and professional life. However, I have a pain in the past to use soothing addictions and issues that I slowly recover from. If these addicts and their families share my life with me, they will help improve my life and my family relationship. <br /> <br /> The exhibition, unlike many others, digs into the past of the addict and exposes the events that are likely to cause their addiction. Many of us suffer because it is too scary to go back and do, as Alice Miller says, "discovering the truth and emotional acceptance of our individual and unique history of our childhood." The exhibition deserves a lot of credit, at least to start the process. This digging is painful and difficult but worth it. So much addiction - fancy and non-fictional - depends on ignoring the underlying problems. It is often assumed that the addict only one day started shooting or whatever fun or joy or self-interest, and now they can't stop. Not so: addictions are about killing pain. I can relate to different events and difficulties in people's lives. There are common topics and surprising exceptions. Many addicts have been wrong. Some children react badly to divorce. For those who think that addiction is a superfluous reaction to difficulties, I would simply say that different people react differently. While some children can do well with divorce, others like Cristy, the "collapse on the floor" and the event will change forever. <br /> <br /> For example, last night's counselor said that real young Andrea was looking for confirmation from men. He slips cash for a 75-year-old neighbor and allows men to abuse him. Are you familiar with everyone? The series is full of information we can use to understand our motivation and adapt our lives. Often these are smaller problems with us, who suffer the longest. As they say, it has even stopped the watch right twice a day, but a slow time may have been undetected for some time until it makes your life unhappy. <br /> <br /> For Manufacturers: Thank you for showing us how to dig into the past. Graphics, format and theme music are also great. <br /> <br /> For addicts, thank you for your courage to share. Have you helped me, you've helped me.
