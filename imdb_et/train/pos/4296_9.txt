It would have been my number one year film in 1991, except that it won a great JFK. This is such a wonderful movie! I love it. I love stories where the lives of different characters interact with others and how to cope with their lives. Kevin Kline is good here, but Danny Glover, and especially Steve Martin, is hidden. I've never liked Martin or his style, but it's great here. I loved the whole speech he gave to Kline about Grand Canyon. Writing was great. Larry Kasdan is an IMO, a great dialogue writer, on the roads of Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino. Here he has created a series of three-dimensional signs and a thoughtful story and messages that give a positive feeling to our lives. A really great movie. 4 out of 4 stars
