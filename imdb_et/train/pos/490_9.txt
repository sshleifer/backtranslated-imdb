Obsession is in many flavors and exists for many reasons; in some cases, it can only be a compulsive disorder, but for others it can be a way of survival. Lack of care, along with the inability to negotiate even the most basic everyday needs or basic social needs, can even force the genius to take on what offers a personal comfort zone. And in extreme cases, obsession can become the object of this satisfaction, the management of this person until the beginning of survival becomes a great momentum for his recall, and when we find "Luzhin Defense" led by Marleen Gorris, a high level of intelligence does not ensure a satisfactory solution to the problem and can actually deepen the situation. . It seems that obsession does not affect or prefer; moreover, it doesn't give a quarter. <br /> <br /> At the Italian resort of the 1920s, Alexander Luzhin (John Turturro) is one of the many people who have gathered there at the World Championship. Luzhin is a champion of the game, but he is vulnerable to the chess that has long ended his game; rather, his obsession is that one thing was discovered in childhood that saw him in his seemingly total failure in seemingly all aspects of life, and allowed him to cope with the subtle uncertainty of his close relatives. So Luzhin is a genius with Achilles' heel, which is a mistake that perhaps only one other person knows and understands, and understands that it can be used for personal gain in this very tournament. This man is Valentinov (Stuart Wilson), a former Luzhin mentor who, after a few years, has suddenly reappeared and made Luzhin known. <br /> <br /> Valentinov is an unwanted, disturbing presence on Luzhin and once again life threatens to execute him. Not only does she face a huge opponent against the tournament, but also Turati (Fabio Sartor), who got up with a draw after fourteen hours in the last race, but she also tries to solve a new element in her life - her feelings about the younger woman she just met, Natalia (Emily Watson). And the genius, though it may be, is gathering dark clouds above him, which can simply force Luzhin deeper that it has been a life-saving grace and curse. <br /> <br /> Tell Luzhin's story, Gorris effectively uses the setbacks to gradually unravel the elements of his childhood, which led to his obsession with him quickly. And when its background is created, it provides an overview that will allow the audience to better understand who Luzhin is and how he reached this point in his life. For their childhood scenes, Gorris textures them with a sufficiently dark atmosphere and a delicate sense of perception that carries and reflects the resort's current, more pastoral environment. The transitions through which he weaves the past with modern times are nicely handled and at a pace Gorris puts it on riveting, but not on impact, which works very well. He also lowers the danger of Valentinov's presence, focusing on drama rather than the interplay, which ultimately contributes to the overall effect of the film, making the Luzhin tragedy even more plausible and disturbing. <br /> <br /> One element that makes this movie so memorable is the influence of John Turturro. To make this film work, Luzhin must be completely credible; one wrong or weakened moment would be catastrophic because it would immediately lead the viewer to the story. However, this does not happen and the film works because Luzhin Turturro creates is impeccably honest and alive. He captures both the Luzhin genius and his inaccuracies, and presents his character under exceptionally speaking and very realistic conditions. This is a performance that equals, if not exceeding, Geoffrey Rush's image of David Helfgott's "Shine". And if you compare your work here with the other letters he has created, Sid from Lid "Unstrung Heroes" to Pete, "Oh brother, where are you?" For Al Fountain "Moonlight Box", you understand what an incredible choice Turturro is an actor and what a remarkable artist he really is. <br /> <br /> Like Natalia, Emily Watson is also an excellent, quite reserved result, through which she develops and presents her character quite nicely. Although he must be related to Luzhin, Watson must do it internally, which is completely effective. Most importantly, because of his details, he makes his accelerated relationship with Luzhin credible and gives the story complete credibility. You only have Watson's eyes to find out that the feelings he is giving are real. It's a great job for talented and talented actors. <br /> <br /> Supported by Geraldine James (Vera), Christopher Thompson (Stassard), Peter Blythe (Ilya), Orla Brady (Anna), Mark Tandy (Father of Luzhin), Kelly Hunter (Mother of Luzhin), Alexander Hunting (Young Luzhin) and Luigi Petrucci (Santucci). A well-designed and implemented "Luzhin Defense Minister" is an emotionally engaging film characterized by restrained compassion, which creates a feeling of sadness and perhaps reflection on human inhumanity to man. Of course, we don't need a movie to tell us that there is cruelty in the world; but we are well respected in cinema media when it reminds us of something we should never forget, because we all have the ability to make positive changes and change something in the lives of our people around us. I appreciate it 9/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
