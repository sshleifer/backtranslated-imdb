Well, I say a lie, it's not really the best movie all the time, but it's a really enjoyable movie that no one knows. <br /> <br /> This is a friend's movie featuring Jay Leno and Pat Morita (Mr Miyagi) who have some fluffy story about a car engine prototype or something, but that doesn't matter. The reason why this movie is fun is because of the interaction between the two generations who initially do not like and trust each other, but the friends in a shocking twist of destiny. The whole cultural difference is quite good because it is fun to watch, it is completely ridiculous but fun and enjoyable. The soundtrack is cool, again in the cheesy 80, it fits the film, I've been trying to find one song at age, but when I work on a memory of what I think some of the Word was what I don't seem to be. <br /> <br /> Another thing this movie is about is the most fantastic reward for any movie, but I won't give it any, oh no! Finally, I would take Eddie Murphys's output, including the Beverly Hills police officer, for over 48 hours, and any friend junk Jackie Chan or Martin Lawrence has their own names. If you are looking for a friend's movie and understand that "a straight white policeman answers a zany streetwise black policeman", give it down. You may be pleasantly surprised because it turns the whole formula upside down with a "straight Japanese policeman who responds to the daily white policemen". <br /> <br /> I will give it 7 honestly that I like it more. I'd rather look at how many things I would give 8. But I think I know deeply that this is some madness that makes me such a movie.
