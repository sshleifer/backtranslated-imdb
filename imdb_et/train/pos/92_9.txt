It's not an art house movie, it's the main entertainment. <br /> <br /> A lot of beautiful people, R&D and action. I found it very fun. It shouldn't be intellectually stimulating, it's a fun movie to watch! Jesse and Chace are also funny, which is just sauce. It is definitely worth renting. <br /> <br /> All in all, I would recommend checking it out for a little Friday night for boys or even your girlfriend (if she likes to see other girls!) <br /> <br /> Cabinets are good. Vinnie, Corey Large, hero hero. Very nasty villains.
