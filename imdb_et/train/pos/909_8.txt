I liked this movie. Your second Yash Raj movie, which you know, looks good on the screen, all the characters are always nice or very nice with one exception you know that the hidden is nice ... Another rule of the Yash raj movie is that hero s is only one or no parent. Think back to all these films. MPC Suman had no mother, HMAPK Salman had no parents, and the FINAL rule is that you are 90% likely Alock Nath crying ... <br /> <br /> The film is good. It's a bit slow at first, but keeps you entertained. There is almost no comedy, but it makes you quite often smile. The little boy (the hero's nephew) is well positioned and offers a very good liner. The actor is very beautiful, but it is a shame that you really can't. this film does not have tremendous happy families living in a BIG house that you had a good idea and made it possible to distinguish the film from other films. Many women cry at the end of the film. There is no strong message from this film, but good vision. If you are married (organized marriage), the film reminds you of what you went through. And if you don't inform it and can scare you ... <br /> <br /> Generally a very good looking movie. There are no big plots or twists, but a very gentle film, very similar to the Bollywood classic.
