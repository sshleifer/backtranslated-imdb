The twilight little potboiler, whose 65-minute length doesn't seem to be too short, is my name Julia Ross back to the English tradition, which is not what they look like - Hitchcock's Lady Vanishes is one example. Outside Julia Ross (Nina Foch) finds a dream job in a new employment agency in London, whose embarrassing representative seems to be very keen to determine whether she has a living relative or a boy. After reporting, he wakes up (being stunned) in a large Manderley-type pile on the Cornish Coast, allegedly by George Macready's harsh woman showing worrying interest in knives and ice cubes. His embarrassing, enabling mother is an irresistible Dame May Whitty (this time a model of brisk efficiency that is on the other side of the good-evil as she was Lady Vanishes). The horrible sight of this story opens claustrophobically; we know what's going on, but it's impossible to talk to poor Julia. This strangely enough, this film is regularly given honor as one of the first (and very few British) films to poach. I think it's closer to the Gothic old-blind house tradition than American cobblestones and urban corruption; it proves a more modern, psychoanalytic mind. Whatever you call it, it stays sharply a satisfying thriller.
