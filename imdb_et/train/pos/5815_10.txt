I was a kid .. crazy about Michael Jackson. His music, his dancing. He was and is the greatest ever. A few days ago a friend gave me a gift .. "Moonwalker" DVD .. I just couldn't believe it! So I took the time and saw the movie again. After many years and it put me back in time. I almost cried. Not because Michael Jackson, but good old times, was back when I went to my concerts, enjoyed music and dancing. The film gave me a different perspective than when I was a child. You can really see the parody of Michael's life. Thank you to Michael Jackson for bringing me back these great times, to your great music and dance. It's a shame that people have forgotten you. I didn't do that, giving you great moments with your music. All the best for you if you ever are.
