I never trust anyone's opinion about the film. This also applies to critics. Of course, if it gets positive comments, it's OK and plus, but most of the movies that get critical engraving, hate. I liked the movie that it was, a fun movie. It takes you a couple of hours of your life and a fictional character ... it's Catherine Trammell. Sharon Stone is fantastic in this role, just as he was first. Anyone who says he is terrible in this movie must feel the same in the first b / c when he has been back in the same way he did in basic instinct 1. Catherine is her and she plays her perfectly. His lining is great, like the first one. Who can forget about the first movie when he says to the police, "If you arrest me, do it otherwise ... get otherwise f ** k here!" Great scene and believe me, he does it again in it. I was surprised at her. His equipment, how he smoked his cigarettes, believe me, it's worth the price to see Stone's action. I can't wait for this movie to be published on the DVD, uncut, because I can only imagine how much it gets better. And yes, there are many twists, like the first, including the end!
