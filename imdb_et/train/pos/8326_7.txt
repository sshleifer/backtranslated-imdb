Fred Schepisi "I.Q." There are actually no essential features, it is still worth it. Walter Matthau plays Albert Einstein, trying to help mechanic Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) fall in love with Princeton's PhD student Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan). Probably the most fun scene is when Dr. Frizzyhead and friends (Lou Jacobi, Gene Saks and Joseph Maher) try to make Ed as a scientist: he can look like a French impressionist. <br /> <br /> Probably a little movie is historically accurate, but that's not the case. It's not meant to be anything but a light comedy, quite the opposite of Robbins' most famous film since 1994 (The Shawshank Redemption). Einstein's life-film should focus not only on his scientific achievements, but also on his political activity, namely how he wrote and came out against nuclear weapons on behalf of Scottsboro Nine (which reached the point where the FBI retained the file). <br /> <br /> So it is acceptable. Also starring Stephen Fry, Tony Shalhoub, Frank Whaley, Charles Durning and Keene Curtis.
