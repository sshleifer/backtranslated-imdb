The absolute masterpiece of the movie! Goodnight Mr.Tom has quickly become one of my favorite films. No one should see this movie, it's just too good! Mr.Tom has completely portrayed John Thaw as a tough old man who turns into a soft father-figure when William Beech (Nick Robinson) is sent to him for evacuation, almost like a "city mouse and state mouse". A truly heartbreaking film. The director knew exactly how to make the book into a movie and he did it very well. The film was so brilliant that the emotions of the characters and what happened did make the audience feel like they were in fear, and these emotions could change within six weeks. During the confusion created during World War II, this film also shows the difference between cities and rural areas, they are almost like different countries. The absolute must see those who do not lose a truly amazing and brilliant film.
