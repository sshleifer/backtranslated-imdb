It was a great movie. How these women tried to save their men. I thought the actors' performances were great. I had to think about the movie for a very long time. I think every student should see this film so they can think about war, relationships, friendship and love. I liked the movie because he said and showed me how strong love can be. I wish I was as strong as a woman. I really liked it because he told me something about relationships and that's what I want to see in the movie. I think you can compare the movie Der Untergang, the pianist. If you put these three movies together, you have a big case of war. We should remember something like war forever.
