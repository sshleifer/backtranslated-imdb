This game is very addictive, I played it for hours until late at night, but also the fact that you can't save a game in the room, sometimes I just helped play it, not to lose all the game data. <br /> <br /> So "freelance" is addictive, but also quite defective. There was also something that really disturbed me, that you could not skip some of the cut scenes, so sometimes you had to watch the same few minutes of the cut scene from time to time. I have a great opportunity to check my e-mail or chat with my friends and other things, even though I had to wait until the intersection is over. <br /> <br /> The story begins with promising, but the more you get more ridiculous, it all gets. Also the game ends quite suddenly, at least he did it for me. It is quite obvious that they hate the coming sequel. I don't know if the sequel is working, but I'm sure I'll probably pick one when it gets free. <br /> <br /> The game is very simple! Even for those who don't know the flight games. To be sure, every fool can play this game. Yes, some levels are quite heavy and need a lot of effort. To finish this game, I took about 1-2 weeks, which may be a bit too short. But thanks to God for the multiplayer opportunity! This will allow you to continue playing short missions, as well as a single-player game once you finish it. <br /> <br /> Even if the mission is the same, it will simply just leave. Sometimes there is a massive battle to fight. Graphics are good, but not just revolutionary or anything else. /> 7/10
