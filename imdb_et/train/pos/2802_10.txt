Like someone who has never been in sports, it seems to me difficult to get into football (or, as the Americans inexplicably call it, football) - it was "Bend It Like Beckham". But I have to say it was one cool movie! Anglo-Indian Jesminder Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) and his WASP friend Juliette Paxton (Keira Knightley) love to play football (yes, I say it British and internationally) and just adore the football player David Beckham. But Jesminder's traditional Sikh parents do not approve (his mother offers a description of football football at the beginning of the film). Okay, so maybe it was a clich√© in that sense, but you have to love that movie! And if I like, then you go to this movie who doesn't know what the "bend" football concept is ... don't worry, the movie explains it (I would never have heard of David Beckham before this movie). And we all know that Keira Knightley was hit by it: a few months after she came out of "BILB", she played equally "Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Heritage".
