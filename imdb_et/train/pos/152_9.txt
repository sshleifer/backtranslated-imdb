I saw "El Mari" yesterday and thought it was a great movie. It begins with the life of three main characters from childhood: Ramallo, Manuel Tur and Francisca. After that, we jump to the hospital for about 10 years, where three friends meet again. <br /> <br /> Religion, Disease, Love, Violence and Sexual Rage all over the movie and intense and tense movies. <Br>> <br /> I see people complaining about the film being too gory and I think they missed the story. It's a violent, intense and sad story. People are expected to suffer. Cry. Get hurt. Bleed. And I think what the film shows is not made for the value of pure shock or it is presented with a nuisance. I know some people like their films are "clean", even people with violence. But sometimes the film has to work from the movie. This is one of those movies. And this is a great movie. <br /> <br /> The only mistake I found was that at 3 or 4 moments some plot details were 100% clear and only after they had thought about the movie, it all made sense. But it was not important for the general story, so I still did the movie in 9.
