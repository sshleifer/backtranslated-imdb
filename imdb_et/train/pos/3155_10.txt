I want "70s exhibitions" to come back on television. It was the biggest show ever !!! They should make episodes between other episodes, but of course it would be confusing. But I wish it would come back and make more episodes. Please come back ... The show was a lot of fun. You couldn't laugh without seeing the episode. Every episode is really a funny part and the show was so much better than Hyde and Jackie left with each other. These were the best episodes. "This 70s show is the best" .... It's and is always the best show ever. It was really sad when the show ended. They should make new episodes.
