Michael Caine (like Sidney Bruhl), a playwright from New York, is 46 years old and fades quickly; when the movie opens, Mr Cain's latest flops on Broadway. TV reviewers make Caine fun and drunk. Passing on Long Island Railways in Caine Montauk instead of living in East Hampton. Finally, Caine, who is eagerly married to Dyan Cannon (like Myra) arrives home, unfortunately a patient with a high heart. There, Caine and Mrs Cannon discuss the new game "Deathtrap" written by Hunky's young Christopher Reeve (Clifford "Cliff" Anderson), one of Caine's former students. The couple believes that Mr Reeve's "Deathtrap" is the hit that is needed to kick off Caine's career. <br /> <br /> "Trap is set? <br /> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> </p> </p> <p> </p> </p> </p> </p> The cast is enjoyable and the story is still tempting. One thing that didn't work (for me) was to finish the curtain call, it definitely played better on the stage. "Deathtrap" is a fun movie to watch again; the performances are dead - but in retrospect, greeting Reeve Caine at East Hampton Railway Station, which should have been made easy by "Hello", not really in East Hampton, but the windmill and the pond are similar, and many ballyhooed love scenes are shockingly dull. good, "even a talented director couldn't destroy it." Mr. Lumet is not deceiving. <br /> <br /> ******** Deathtrap (3/19/82) Sidney Lumet ~ Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Dyan Cannon, Irene Worth
