Anime that got me anime ... <br /> <br /> In 2010 (hey, it's not too far now!) The Earth is now poisoning pollution and violence. Seeing how crimes happen in 30 seconds and so thieves who have a third world terrorist fire make a fictitious New Port City government a tank policy to deal with the problem - police tanks! Oh madness! <br /> <br /> The "heroes" of this series include new recruitments by Leona Ozaki, a Japanese woman with red hair (yes, I know they will never match the Japanese appearance of her clearly Japanese names), who have just prepared a tank for the police and is quickly partnered with blonde, blue eyes nice guy Al. Leona is new to the use of tanks and unfortunately she is destroying the tank of the Police Police Officer Charles UK (also known as "Brenten") who looks like a few good sunglasses, a big revolver and a bad mood, like Tom Selleck on steroids and sports. The UK didn't like Leona joining Tank Police, and her shattering Tiger Special (giant green monster tank) didn't tolerate her, nor did she like to take her giant tank scrap and use it to build a mini tank that she called Bonaparte and he is about to push it over to the child's well-being "when the boys are more of their size" as he puts it. There are also specifications, a bifocal genius, the Bible quoting / godly chaplain, the purple MO-hawked Mohican, and the tempting chief of the pot, who is on the right side thanks to the mayor always yelling at her tank police antics. Seeing how the police of the tanks often destroy half of the cities behind the bad guys and use extreme violence, people don't like them very much. <br /> <br /> "Roisto" is a cyber named Buaku, who has a mystical past associated with the Green Peace project, his gang and his two sexy cats cyborg sidekicks Anna & Uni Puma. In the first payment, these men are paid for the stealing of urine samples from a hospital that cures people who are not infected with poison gas clouds, and on the other they are hired to paint Buaku. The story was, however, an incomplete and finished cult comedy ("Manga"), which is very difficult to find. <br /> <br /> Any chaos and chaos will arise in this black comic. which examines how far people want their police to go to catch criminals and what happens when the good line between boys and bad guys changes. It's such a thing that if you did this movie, it would be better to go to Quentin Tarantino. Uneven places, but still fun. <br /> <br /> Following "New Dominion: Tank Police".
