I also loved this series when I was a kid. In 1952, I was 5 years old and my family always looked at this exhibition. My favorite sign was what Marion Lorne played as a rather annoying, bumblebee and very loving "aunt" -type person. I still remember his "ubba bubba um um" comments because he would try to say something important. And when he came back and played Aunt Clarat at Bewitched, it was a great pain! <br /> <br /> This was the first time I remember the vision of Walter Matthau whose career I followed as a fan for many years. <br /> <br /> I wonder if anyone can confirm: was the title or the end of the music of Hugo Alfven's "Swedish Rhapsody"? Every time I hear that it played in my classic radio station in Southern California, it brings back memories of Mr Peeper's picture that walked back to the camera. I'm not even sure if this picture is right for me.
