I just got embarrassed why fucking FOX canceled the season3, though the season2 wasn't as good as the season1, which is very good! I like it so much that I even mean buying DVD from Amazon. (failed !: _ (I'm a Chinese student and I'm uncomfortable I get an international credit card and $.) I hope FOX will be able to bring DA back one day!
