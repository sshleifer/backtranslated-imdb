Postfeminist image of freedom and sadism. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Disorder! <br /> <br /> This undervalued pearl of the film speaks of Flavia, a fifteen-year-old girl born with Noble's birthday, who, after the father and indeed the whole of the medieval Christian society, has fallen by looking at the Islamic warrior. as a human, not a demonic figure. <br /> <br /> The patriarchal rules of the monastery (explicitly stated in the scene where the bishop arrives with soldiers and monks) cannot be accepted. Flavia will explicitly ask for a society where he finds himself and all the persecution, repression and violence will inevitably lead to a tragic ending. only by himself, but also by everyone around him. <br /> <br /> Far from the truth. This is a film depicting the consequences of violence, the effects of patriarchal domination, the nature of the rebellion and the corruption of the human spirit. <br /> <br /> I described it as "post-feminist" in the title of this book, and finally Flavia triumphs must always be corrupted, threatened, and perverted. Even Flavia's harsh ends are men's men (women return and only monks watching without horrors. <br /> <br /> As far as much of the debate about violence is concerned, it represents the effects of violence, and the horror of the superfluous world of religion would have come out of violence, would have limited the effect of the film, made the film cheap and allowed it to embrace in the patriarchal discourse he is publishing a medieval society. <br /> <br /> Beautifully filmed, brilliantly acting (especially Florinda Bolkin and Maria Casares), which contained a great piano score and are still challenging after all these years.
