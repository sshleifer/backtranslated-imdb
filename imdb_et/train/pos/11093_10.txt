This is a big "little" movie. I say "little" because it doesn't have a hundred weapons that fired, or a dozen explosions, like John Woo's movie. Great performances by Roy Scheider and three "bad guys". John Frankenheimer seems to have more luck in these days these days. The movie is very easy to watch, the story is more than a washing machine - instead of all around and around, things seem to get worse when the plot thickens. Wonderful ending, very positive. I never read Elmore Leonard's book, but it can't be much different from the movie because he sees I'm watching Elmore Leonard's movie.
