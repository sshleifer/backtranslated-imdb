I knew I could see it when I saw the first preview. Dennis Quaid was one reason, but the topic of keeping my dreams tells me. People talk about it as a film for children, but I think it's a film for the generations that reach out to aging, sick parents, our own mortality, our growing and leaving children, and all the other things we never thought would happen to us. The movie is not a tragedy trap; that is, living your dreams means you have a real life. <br /> <br /> Quaid is too small for a trophy, but he does it well and Rachel Griffiths makes a small part of a woman with thoughtful and layered performance. The camera's work is slow and sweet. When they put together this movie, they left out everything they didn't need. Very nice.
