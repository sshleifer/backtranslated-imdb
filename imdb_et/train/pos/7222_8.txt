Definitely one of the smartest and the twisted I've ever seen. Christopher Reeve and Micheal Caine were great and kept me through. <br /> <br /> Very stylish sets and props give the process a real atmosphere. Minimalist feeling works for the whole picture. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is not the lack of the film itself, but the lack of a proper wide screen movie on the DVD. I have a full-screen version (which proves that I love the movie enough to withstand a full-screen presentation), but a fantastic Deluxe or special edition would definitely make my money.
