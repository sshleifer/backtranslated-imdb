Exquisite Martino outing, it's a delightful and enjoyable giallo that has great looks and great performances by George Hilton and Anita Strindberg. <br /> <br /> For me, the plot is a jig-saw puzzle. so complicated and confusing that you just sit back and enjoy, not try to predict. Just when everything seems to have been solved, another row of twists is taken again, the pleasant twists to be said. <br /> <br /> Sexy, with a lot of horrors, kills it well with the pacific movie in the coastal areas of London, Athens and Greece. The super finale of the Aegean rocks is surrounded by things and fun was all.
