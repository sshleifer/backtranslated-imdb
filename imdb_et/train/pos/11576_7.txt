It's trying to be a century's epic adventure. And as cast as Sh√¥ Kasugi, Christopher Lee and John-Rhys Davies, it's always the perfect B adventure. In fact, it's a pretty fun, varied adventure that even in the event of its shortcomings in your interest. It must have known the greatest film that has done it for the people who did it. Even if it was done in the 90s, it is not modern. More is the feeling that there was an old Errol Flynn movie. The big adventure movie is again a big deal in Hollywood, but I'm afraid that the feeling in them is never the same as in those old movies. On the other hand, it is a real feeling. You just can't hate it. I think this is a decent adventure movie. And I really love the soundtrack. Damn, I want a theme song.
