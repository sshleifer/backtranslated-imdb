I have to say that the seventeenth and the lost is much better than I expected. The perception of perception was that it would be just terrible, but I was pleasantly surprised by this impressive mystery. <br /> <br /> Dedee Pfeiffer is Emilie, the mother who demands her daughter Lori (Tegan Moss), not one weekday to participate in a graduation party, but Lori ignores her mother's wishes and will take any action against the party. When Lori doesn't come home, Emilie knows something wrong and she will see her daughter and the events that led her to disappearance. <br /> <br /> In the seventeenth and lost, it is better than many other TV movies of this type because it is not so predictable. Pfeiffer is the reason to see this movie, and most of it is believable. This LMN Original Movie premiered last night. 10/10
