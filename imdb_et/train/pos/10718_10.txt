Spacecamp is my favorite movie. It's a great story and inspires others. <br /> <br /> The show was great and my wife and I went to see Lea Thompson in a cabaret a year later because she was the result of her film. It is unfortunate that the Challenger accident delayed and damaged the film. <br /> <br /> The 20th anniversary of the Challenger accident is coming. I knew that one of the Challenger astronauts had been from childhood at Carnegie Mellon University, where my father attended school; I also know a late friend close to the pilot. <br /> <br /> I was a technical review of the National BSA of Boy Scout's astronomy last year, and I still think Spacecamp is a great movie to recommend to scouts the space-related decorations I teach. <br /> <br /> I was late as an adult astronaut and followed the engineering curriculum that we had put together when Challenger blew. I ended up with Willard Rockwell and his engineers, "invisible", at Astrotech's shareholders' meeting at random accidentally after things accident so I am much closer to the accident and the similarities between the films. I was sure I was a good student and graduated four years later, strangely, at Rockwell's engineering suggestion that they were not going to fly Challenger in 1986 and who later built Endeavor.
