In fact, this movie wasn't that bad. It includes action, comedy and excitement. There are good actors in this movie, such as Doug Hutchison (Percy "The Green Mile") who plays Bristol. Another famous actor is Jamie Kennedy, "Scream" and "Three Kings". The main characters are Jamie Foxx, who was pretty good and also funny Alvin, but the one who surprised me the most was David Morse Edgar Clentenina. He plays differently than usual, because in other films like "The Green Mile", "Indian Runner", "The Negotiator" or "Langoliers" he plays a very sympathetic person and "Bait" plays almost the opposite, a man who has no emotions it was nice to see. The only real negative thing about this film is the several pictures of the World Trade Center, which makes this film a bit dated. In general I thought it was a pretty good movie!
