I watched this movie on Friday, April 7th. I didn't see the last scene (I talked with my mother's mom at the same time). Can anyone tell me what happened to her? I looked a little at the fact that his wife heard someone talking to his wife in the bedroom and then opened the door, he's already dead. <br /> <br /> What happened to him? Did he kill himself? How could he organize everything like phone calls, in the meantime he is at home when his wife spoke to this strange admirer? I'm so curious !! (Finally, I read that he suffered a reproductive disorder under the personality). <br /> <br /> Prev.
