When this first came out, my father brought it home - we were surprised at it - It was so different from what we saw before. I was looking for a definite movie last night and I found "Mind's eyes" again. The box breaks down and I'm surprised that the tape is still working! Although it is not a "Nemo" quality graphics, it is still very good. They should resell it - this is a landmark for computer animation images. Highly recommended!
