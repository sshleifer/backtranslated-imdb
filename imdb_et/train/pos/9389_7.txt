Red Rock West (1993) <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage got into deadly crimes without first knowing it, and the domains lead to a growing threat, adventure, and mistake in the natural American West of the 1990s. Red Rock West is often brutal and sometimes fun, and Cage pulls the blend with its usual sardonic spirit and cautious ease. <br /> <br /> Is the plot up? Yes, yes. Is Dennis Hopper perfect as a crazy, almost pleasing killer? Yes, yes. Is Cage an Opportunity? Well, you have to look and see. It will never let up, and it surprised me for the first time I saw it. Last night I was surprised how well it grew up, how well it was built and how calm and funny it was at the same time. <br /> <br /> Director Ron Dahl (who also wrote) is more known for his TV work, but for Rounder and his film he is showing his sensational images. It's saved by humor and cartoons. The bar is weak, policemen questioned. And don't miss Dwight Yoakam's truly inspired firefighter as a truck driver.
