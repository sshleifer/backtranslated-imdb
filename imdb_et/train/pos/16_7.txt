I found it to be so romantic / drama that is a nice ending and a nice feeling in general. This is not a Hallmark Fame-type family film whose bed-before marriage is considered a "normal" behavior, but given that it celebrates Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro, I would have expected a much tougher film, at least language. <br /> <br /> The most memorable part of the film is portraying how difficult it is to learn how to read and write when you are an adult. This is a big theme in the movie and it includes some scenes, but to be honest, the movie is not so memorable. <br /> <br /> It's still a relatively light, nice story I'd be happy to recommend.
