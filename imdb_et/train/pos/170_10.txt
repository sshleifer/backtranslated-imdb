Don't listen to this fuddy-duddy critic, this is a pearl! Young wealthy Joan and his brother find themselves unreliable after their father's death - and now they have to live! Of course he will become a reporter and he will be as natural as a cell phone manager! Naturally, they meet their career head thanks to the gangster Clark Gable. In the meantime, there is a chance that the six-light underwear will float for a whole host of young things and Joan will have a couple of pairs of dance figures (all steam shovels). <br /> <br /> But none of this should be taken seriously - it is fun to have fun with these great pre-code days when Hollywood was really naughty. Joan looks good and shows a lot of emotional range that would give his career such longevity (thanks to God he stopped dancing!). Gable is remarkable as a slimy gangster - he was not yet a star and he didn't have to be a hero. Excellent to see something else. And William Bakewell is great as a poor confused brother. And there are some great assemblies and tracking directions led by Harry Beaumont, who is moving into pieces with a splitting pace - and from time to time with an audience! Fun!
