I happened to be 8 to 10 years old in the cold darkness of the afternoon of November. I had been playing outside the day, freezing, and when I came on Thursday, I had a cup of hot cocoa and sat down on the TV with a blanket. I was surprised to see a comic that wasn't all happy and silly - and was actually dark and moral. It hit my imagination. I'm sure it will be past the text and shortened in all the wrong places for Tolkien's purist. However, it remains the story of the mind, the choice of bearing on the welfare of others, the consequences of selfish, rash decisions, and so on. The quality of animation leaves room for complaints. However, the place where this film clearly rises above the new films is the character of the voice. John Hurt is great in this. If you don't like how the sign is drawn, look out and listen to it. His voice is extraordinary. I've seen it many times, many times, and it always brings me back to the time when a boy, thirsty for some magical adventure. That's why I say "happy", the film is nostalgic for me, so I don't forget its drawbacks. But between John Hurt and Tolkien's fantasy, it still came and still is.
