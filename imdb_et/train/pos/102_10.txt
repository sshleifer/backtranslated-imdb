I heard about this movie for the first time about 20 years ago when I was in a child's class (!), Just so I was once in the classroom with links through the classroom and movies (or cinema, I don't remember), many movies from different mainstream to experimental and movies one of those that appeared on the page was still for OffOn. I was really interested because it was the most eye-catching on the page (it was still a scene movie with other eye-catching elements). <br /> <br /> About 18 years later, it was possible to order the entire 4-DVD set of "Treasures of American Film Archives" issued by the National Film Preservation Foundation. So when I read a set of DVD case notes, I was very pleased to see that OffOn was on one disc. After all these years I can finally see the movie! After watching it, it wasn't a bit that I had been waiting for it (it was more organic, not that it was bad, but I expected it to have more electronic aesthetics), but it was still an impressive movie, IMHO, taking into account the techniques used by Scott Bartlett to produce the film, including the manual toning of the film and the use of video equipment for a movie scene (filmed from a video monitor), giving him more Don't get me wrong, the techniques used in this film were quite groundbreaking in 1972. That's why it's still one of my favorite short / experimental films, and it's also a creative inspiration for me ...
