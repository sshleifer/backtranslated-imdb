This movie about two Italian brothers who came to Germany with their family is just great! <br /> <br /> This is not an idealistic film, I would say it shows life as it was or was in the 60s and 70s when the main story is going on. The characters are very nice, but they also have some "blind" sides that make you believe they are real people. A great movie with great actors to show that life is not always funny, but that you will find happiness with "fire and passion" as the main character Gigi would say.
