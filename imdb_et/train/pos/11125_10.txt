What can you say about an exhibition of this size? "Sopranos" have redefined television literally. It has violated all the rules and set new standards for television excellence. Everything is flawless, writing, managing and most important to me. When you look at this exhibition, you realize that these characters are not real. Functioning tricks mean that there is a real Tony Soprano or any character. This exhibition is also very versatile. Some people don't look at this play because it's violent, it's not all about violence, it's business, family, and many deeper things that all depend on what your fan sees. I do not like me when people show this example of the Mafia exhibition. For me, this is a family show. A family that is a mob for generations. In general, this is a masterpiece of the exhibition. It should be on television. Here at the same time. Sophisticated characters from admirable, great readers to brilliant writing and what do you get when you mix these ingredients? An exhibition that defines excellence and dares to be different.
