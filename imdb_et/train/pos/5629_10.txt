I loved this great movie. Farrah Fawcett played this part phenomenally and with good heart. She plays a woman who goes to extreme action to protect herself and her friends after attacking a stranger. After rejecting the police, he understands that he is himself. <br /> <br /> Then one day will break when he is alone at home, in his home and attacking him again. He's not going to call the police or call him, he's forced to spray him and put him in the fireplace. <br /> <br /> I think you need an awakening call to Earth. They are too simple for these criminals. It's time for tougher penalties.
