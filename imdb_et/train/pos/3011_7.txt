One of the best Vance films will be succeeded by more interesting plot and artistic direction than anyone else, Michael Curtiz. This time, a hated financier is usually found in a locked and bolted bedroom on the top floor of a dead - head down. Philo Vance, listening to the situation in Italy, decides to end his vacation and tries to solve what he thinks is murder and what everyone else is considering suicide. William Powell is as good as Philo Vance. He never seems to be pressing and is always very fluent in what he says and does. Powell is assisted by many very talented actors - some first-rate characters and actresses such as Mary Astor, like her niece, who hated her uncle, Ralph Morgan's deceased husband secretary, Paul Cavanaugh as rival dogs, Arthur Hohl as a mysterious butler, Helen Vinson a really good performance by James Lee as a Chinese chef and portable Eugene Palette as a wisely cracking police detective. Add a wonderful comedy to Etienne Girardot as a public coroner who always had no food. It is the depth and story of suspects with lots of plots that make Kennel Murder Case a fast moving, fun puzzle.
