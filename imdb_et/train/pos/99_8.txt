Christmas came together before my time, but I have grown up in Denver and its special songs were always my family's Christmas music. For years we had an explosive cassette made of Christmas. A few years ago I finally downloaded this video from eBay, so after listening to all the music for about 21 years, I got to see John and Muppette for themselves. If you get the chance, it's fun - great music, warm-hearted and cheesy. It is also interesting to see the 70's version of the Muppet and compare them with their latest versions. I believe Denver actually took the heat of such an exhibition - I usually think that performers will not compensate for their pictures when they make a song-a-longs with Muppets, but I'm glad he did it. Even if you can't watch the video, it's worth it. It has some Muppified traditional favorites as well as some original versions.
