Yesterday afternoon I did not miss a dry eye after I left the cinema, seeing the slope of the movie as part of the sale of this year's film festival in Hamburg. And the tears were all laughing. This movie was fun, there is no other way to say that. It wasn't a bit boring in it, I laughed at it, and with me all three of us were lovers of French cinema. <br /> <br /> Alain Chabat was absolutely terrible. Necessary and serious clown if the situation requires it. The performance was, of course, completely up, but it was exactly what the story needed and what did it so well. Charlotte Gainsbourg was just as big, whom I love to see and my mother was very strong. The nurses could have been a little more detailed by the character script, but besides, there is nothing to exhaust. I had a big movie in the afternoon when Hamburg was drowning during the rain and I would like such French films to be released regularly in Germany. But distributors are the country that does not feel that the French are making good films. At least I can't wait to find a DVD that offers subtitles (Hello Australia? Please?), Because this movie needs to be seen several times at home!
