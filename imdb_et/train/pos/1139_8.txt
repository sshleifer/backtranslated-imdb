There are few such comedies where almost every line and character is almost flawless. It's so funny! And there is quite a bit of satire. Sally Field directs truly outstanding actors and does a good, if not perfect, job with their daily TVs. Sometimes his actions are only a bit wide and top, but 90% of the time he is in rebellion! In the same league, Kevin Kline, Robert Downey Jr and Whoopy Goldberg (who unfortunately do too little here). Downey Jr does not necessarily convince himself as a comedian and has no timing all the time, but he is fighting his part, which is, to be honest, the most ungrateful. However, the bright star here is Cathy Moriarty as Celeste, a real bitch if ever there was one more than one nasty secret (you see absolutely stunning in the finals!). Unfortunately, Elisabeth Shue never seems quite comfortable. I like it like Mrs Shue, but here she works with fish from the water and sometimes she seems to be in a different movie. But it is not damaging and in most cases it is at least sufficient. Otherwise, it is full of memorable lines and situations full of comedy to watch when it is on TV or wherever.
