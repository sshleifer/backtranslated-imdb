The collection of eleven short stories in one movie is a great idea and contains some big segments as well as frustrations. Based on the tragic event of the United States on September 11, 2001, eleven directors were invited to give their approach to the American tragedy. Most of them do not only result in individual compassion for the American people, but mainly for the intolerance of different cultures and people in the world. <br /> <br /> Ken Loach (UK) will present the best segment on 11 September 1973 in Chile, when dictator Augusto Pinochet destroyed Salvador Alliende with US support. <br /> <br /> Other great segments are Youssef Chahine (Egypt), showing the world of intolerance and the number of victims of US governments in modern history; and Mira Nairi (India), showing true injustice and prejudices against a Pakistani family whose son was wrongly accused of terrorism in the United States when he was really a hero. <br /> <br /> Some segments are beautiful: Samira Makhmalbaf (Iran) shows innocent children for Afghan refugees who prepare an unpleasant shelter for bombs, while their teacher tries to explain to them what happened in the second half of the world; romantic Claude Lelouch (France) shows New York couple lives near WTC; Danis Tanovic (Bosnia and Herzegovina) shows the effects of his war in a small location and the widows alone in protest; Sean Penn is very poetic, showing that life continues; and the story of Shohei Imamura is probably the most impressive, showing that there is no Holy War, but sadness and shame. <br /> <br /> The Idrissa Quedraogo (Birkina Faso) segment is very naive, but captures terrible bad conditions in this African nation. The Amos Gitaly (Israel) segment is very boring and manipulative, showing more violence and terrorism. <br /> <br /> The Alejandro González Iñárritu segment is very disappointing, terrible, without inspiration and certainly the worst. <br /> <br /> My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "11 de Setembro" ("September 11")
