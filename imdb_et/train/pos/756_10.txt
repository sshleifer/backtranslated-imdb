I have to say that although I despise these exhibitions, the shock, I'm a girl, I feel I have to express my opinion. I saw Dirty Sanchez before I saw Jackass and I think it goes beyond the Jackass program. A story and interviews are created to show more interest. I saw a few minutes in the second night of the Jackass movie and couldn't believe how bad it was, everyone just made a joke after the joke, without associating anything. It must be the fastest changing example that can be changed, shockingly amateur. Though the drink kit isn't really my thing, as an important entertainment show goes, Dirty Sanchez is the exit of Jackass League.
