I'm not a fan of Adam Sandler. Actually, I don't think I've ever liked her. The opening point of this movie confirmed my worst fear. There was Adam Sandler, who played a somewhat ridiculous view while driving around in New York on a scooter, looking bad and missing. A typical Sandler-type loser character again, I thought. Then and there I almost gave up. But when I shut it down, I discovered something I didn't know before: Adam Sandler can act! He is truly prominent in the film, like Charlie, a lost and lonely figure whose entire family (including the dog) was killed on a robbed plane on September 9, and who has apparently lost all touch of reality. Don Cheadle plays his former college roommate who unexpectedly joins Charlie and takes it for a mission to help him get better. Of course, Cheadle's Alan Johnson has his own problems and sources of accident, but somehow the two men can help each other through their difficulties. Two of them made a totally incredible team and Sandler made Charlie real, working through his emotions and feelings. It's not Sandler's comedy. If you are looking for it to go to some of his other bridges. It's a pretty hard film - sometimes sad, sometimes budding and always enticing. There are some funny parts. I loved this scene where Charlie persuaded Alan to face her partners, reminding her of how tough she was in college, and then a conversation that both were later. <br /> <br /> Personally, I didn't think Saffron Burrows added much to the movie, as Donna, obviously a deficient Johnson patient. The only reason for the sign seemed to be (based on one setback) that he looked gently like Charlie's late husband, but it was never really developed and I just didn't care about that character. Are you looking for a judge who was played by Donald Sutherland, whom I thought he was creating. However, when I'm worried, it's Sandler's movie and great results for him. Definitely his best in my opinion. 8/10
