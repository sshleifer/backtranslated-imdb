I watched almost all of Gundam / Mech's anime that has been shown in the US and still has the best story. The way his plots rotate is riveted. Gundam Wing is a series that focuses mainly on politics and war. The series is followed by a group of fifteen 15-year-old boys who have been trained for top quality mobile suits known as Gundam. Gundam pilots were taught to fight a powerful rebel named Oz. As things start to warm up between the OZ and Gundam pilots, the new political groups are forming and the old will start to disperse. Old conflicts end and new ones arise. For peace, Gundam pilots have to deal with their world events and end all fighting. But how far do people want to go to achieve their goal. I recommend this anime to anyone looking for an exhibition showing a deep plot.
