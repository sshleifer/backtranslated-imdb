A remarkable, ugly, nasty retro-acting thriller about a bodyguard who has decided to find (and destroy!) The girl's killers she was supposed to protect. This film is almost anachronistic in today's politically correct atmosphere. Director Scott has no desire to apologize for the dramatic structure of the film because of the inherent immorality. Scott is not aware of or does not care about 30-year-old social progress. I really do not believe that we will soon see a more violent film, so you will get better and see it when you can. Despite being a relentless grimness, I think the film is a powerful example of the most embarrassing, exploitative and effective cinema. It's hard for Scott to sell, but I think I'm a buyer. The extraordinary technical aspects of this film are too effective for me. Scott's management options are simply amazing and he pulls Denzel out of Washington with great performance. Sensitive souls have to stay away from it, but I suggested it to those viewers who were looking for a big, action-filled movie.
