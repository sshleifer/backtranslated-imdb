Well, I'm glad to hear that it can finally be released on DVD. If this happens, I do not know, but I grab it when it is released. <br /> <br /> In my humble opinion, this is Errol Flynn's most entertaining film, especially when "Gentleman Jim" Corbett's career starts from the movie. Then it gets big from a good movie. <br /> <br /> Few people could play noble men and still come out as a nice good man and Flynn could and this movie is a great example of that. It was known to be Flynn's favorite role and I believe it. You can just understand how much fun here is here. Ward Bond also looks like he enjoyed his role with the famous John L. Sullivan. Bond was never better either. <br /> <br /> Here's just the right amount of action boxing scenes and they're pretty well done. The Corbett family is also fun to watch while they're playing Jim's games. From the arena, the constant argument and shouting of the Corbett family can be a bit too loud and tedious, but they set a suitable summary for the stage. <br /> <br /> And speaking of the conclusion, Sullivan's speech to Corbett after a great fight is very touching and highlighting the film. Some average spiritual critics (such as the variety) did not like this ending or the fact that much of the film is fictitious, but - duh - most movies are fixed, enjoyable or not. And in that case, it made a nice story and a nice ending. (In real life, Corbett was a very gentle gentleman, not a Flyni image, but Flynn still has a good man.) <br /> <br /> This is one of the funniest classic movies I've ever watched and am looking for a DVD unexpectedly.
