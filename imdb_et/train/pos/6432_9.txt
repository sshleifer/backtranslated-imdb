Thanks to a smart script and Writer's / Director Kevin Meyer's persistent command, "Perfect Alibi" is an entertaining and very pleasant mystery thriller. The film begins methodically and collects steam when the tips begin to reveal that nothing is what seems to be. Teri Garr and Hector Elizondo are fantastic when they struggle with the team in disguising the mystery, reminding me of "Thin Man" by Nick and Nora Charles. Kathleen Quinlan is great as a woman tortured by Alex McArthur and the roles of characters played by veteran artists Charles Martin Smith, Bruce McGill, Anne Ramsey and Estelle Harris are well done and offer the right moments at the right time. Rex City even has a coat of arms. All in all, I felt that I read a good book through the fire.
