Beautifully assembled .. I want this documentary to follow some life-related events and celebrate the lives of other missing people ... should be the second part ... real. It was great .. the movie wasn't long enough .. I'd like to know why the movie creator did not follow !! it is so important for the community period ... if you read this, please think about making this second documentary ... I'm really tired of hearing about naive writers how AIDS and men do not go together; in fact, this is the heterosexual we have to look at ... this movie didn't even bother mentioning HIV or AIDS, and I was so glad I really appreciated dialects and concepts. Thank you for allowing this movie.
