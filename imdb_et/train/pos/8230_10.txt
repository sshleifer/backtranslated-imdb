Uncovered (= Crimes) is a story of small crimes that everyday people commit to a crazy scenario that can lead to an absolute catastrophe. One of the brightest Greek series! Actors like Ketty Konstadinou and Maria Kavogianni showed a completely new dimension to themselves and talent and gave us incredible "guilty" moments of smile. Every viewer felt that he recognized his own bad side with his symbols or at least in what they wanted. Participants of all ages who played the larger and smaller parts of the room got equal space in the heart of Greece. My personal favorites (except the first two I mentioned) are Vassilis Haralambopoulos, Athinodoros Prousalis and Stavros Nikolaidi, but so many amazing actors have gone through some episodes from time to time. Whoever understands Greek in the world should find a way to watch this series, even though it has been over five years when it was on television. In Greece, they repeat the series (ANT1) every time, like in the summer or early morning. Never forget Eglimata or some casting team!
