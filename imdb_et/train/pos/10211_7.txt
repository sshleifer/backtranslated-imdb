Narrative? a written, visual or poetic epic? generally also try to avoid signs; readers and viewers may be too easily executed, trying to track who exactly is. This is especially true of the movie because I just can't go back to refresh the cinema. However, viewers do not have this problem because we see all our movies on DVD or VHS. <br /> <br /> A year ago, I introduced the French actress Audrey Tautou, whom I first saw in the fabulous destiny of Amelie Poulains (2001) and later a very long work ability (2004), both of which were finely designed and complicated stories with a large number signs. This earlier offer goes beyond the two in both directions: more signs and complexity. <br /> <br /> Now, other directors have used these techniques: Robert Altman with The Player (1992), Short Cuts (1993), Gosford Park (2001) et al. Paul Thomas Anderson did the same with Magnolia (1999). Stanley Kramer did it with A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World in 1963, which was an almost epic proportion. The difference with this film is, first of all, that the director allows us to see some characters inside the head and secondly, repeat some scenes to refresh the viewer's memory story as flip-flops between different time periods. /> <br /> Basic? core, so to speak? the story concerns a young woman, Irene (Tautou), who is being told by a fellow on the train that she will meet that day with true love. It happens in the first few minutes of the movie. At this point, it is clever irony that Irene does not understand that a young man (Gilbert Robin) may be "one true love". And he won't lose ... <br /> <br /> They go their way and do not understand the potential importance of their close encounter. But chaos causes the rest of the day, not just for the two youngsters, but for the rest of the characters that appear in a series of intelligently built and intertwined vignettes that all seem to be somewhere and still ... <br /> <br /> If the story was just that, then it can be boring and even quite predictable. Not so. The script and the director are hanging on our expectations with many innovative scenes that are too common, but have become credible extraordinary events that allow two potential lovers to meet again. For example, the next time a birdie from the sky falls on your book or paper, consider your alternatives; The two characters make a clear choice that must happen before Irene and her fate man meet again. Or what is a rock chip flying on your windscreen? Think again what's going on ... <br /> <br /> All this is interesting enough. It was more interesting for me to evaluate every new person who came and tried to decide if this man was one for Irene or was it really a young man on the train. It kept me for a while. <br /> <br /> I'll let you think about it when you see this admiration. <br /> <br /> Recommended for everyone.
