My 3-year-old loved it. I loved it, my wife loved it. So out of 10 of our 10 families. What is the level of violence? Not really so violent, mostly in a lollipop. No one dies really, there's no blood, no blood or torture, so it's definitely suitable for kids, much more than many Saturday morning cartoons. <br /> <br /> This movie really takes the idea of ​​CG movies, which should, first of all, beautiful graphics, textures perfectly made, with real depth, not try to be realistic, but form an artistic whole. Stony moss, metal rust, wood and stone reliefs all change the whole. <br /> <br /> Unlike many modern CG movies, character modeling is once again peculiar, not a cute artistic whole. Faces may seem less malleable than some other films, but characters are more doll-like than human-like. I think this is a good thing, it gives the truth as to how weird it may seem, it is easier to stop your disbelief. <br /> <br /> Hair, fur, clothing, par, at least Pixar likes. Note that Lian-Chu fights in giant slug opening scenes; Gwizdo is in front of some farmers and they all have detailed clothing that made me pause to admire the film. <br /> <br /> Setup. Farther than cars and even on the wall? Space has been done many times, but the surroundings of Dragon Hunters fantasy are comparable to just a few scenes that are never endless story and Lord of the Rings, but again this is an artistic whole and many good ideas that were thrown easily. Great views like Monsters Inc.'s scene where they drive through their storage space, or Wall E, where we see the huge garbage towers he has made, in this movie, a lot, everything big, but never lived; it's just all the way! Range where they pass through a region of fantastic decline. Chinese wall, islands floating in the sky. Broccoli in the sky? This is really where I believe CG should go, do something that takes the breath away and does it over and over again. <br /> <br /> The sound is good, the music is diverse and not only epic and fortunately without all the vocals and the movie purely original. <br /> <br /> Animation is pretty good. Creating inspiration for cartoons, especially for some stretching and squeezing. Sometimes it's not as realistic, but 3D models aren't realistic either. <br /> <br /> The characterization is also well done. Lian-Chu, a gentle and insecure giant, is gradually growing under the attention of little Zoé. <br /> <br /> Gianizo, who is the ultimate leader of Lian-Chu, is finally redeeming himself, while Zoé hasn't really changed at all, but who wants this cute baby anyway? At least I loved Lian-Chut more than any other recent character after Sulleys is a Monsters Inc.. <br /> <br /> The group's internal conflicts are exterminated by external pressure, as should the story of the right fantasy <br /> <br /> The story usually resembles an endless story, especially the way the world stops. Monsters have a pretty normal price, except for flocking. It lacks the emotional effects of the wall E, which are really strong points in this film, but it is a much more fun ride and has no musical scene that irritates the former music scene and has the first scene. This movie is what you want to see for a fun and exciting time. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is as I mentioned all the vision that seems to have been strictly followed. <br /> <br /> It seems the device is ready for more adventures and I hope it will be so. <br /> <br /> One side denotes a French actress who makes Lian-Chut sounded a bit like Jean Reno First, but I'm happy she wasn't even though she's one of my favorites. Nice to hear a new one, a voice for me. <br /> <br /> I give her maximum rating, a bit surprised by average and low ratings; I have tried to address some of the two opinions that have the lowest vote. Approach this movie as an adventure and as a European film, not against Hollywood, but different.
