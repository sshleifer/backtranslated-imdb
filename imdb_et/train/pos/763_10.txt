This movie changed everything for me ... I heard about breakdancing and hiphop, but I've never seen it professionally (hey, I was an 11 year old child from Holland!) When I saw this movie, everything changed. I actively participated in the hip-hop movement of our city, started breaking and writing games. <br /> <br /> By now, I consider this movie a personal favorite. Of course, filming and the importance of "cinematographic" may not be so important. But who cares about how big a movie was filmed badly or when you see a microphone hanging over someone? What he does to you personally reads ...
