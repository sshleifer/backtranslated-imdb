I like two things about Elvira and they are both bigger than she is and she keeps them covered: her spirit and talent. Film is the best thing about showing how funny it gets or how it draws attention. Like the combined clone of Morticia Adams and Anna Nicole Smith, she only comes from her relative's heritage to discover that she is indeed the heir of occultism. The best thing about comedy in this movie, but it could have been much more scary and cool. It is mostly campy fare with so many bad horror movie references he like as an unrest or escaping hero who travels and stumbles on his heels. My favorite thing is when he uses his wonderful donations to break the chains that are locked into his cemetery. The end is sweet if it was written by Bradys, but at the end of the Las Vegas act it seems too big for this type of film.
