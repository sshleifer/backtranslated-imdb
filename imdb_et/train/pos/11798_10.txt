I've seen this movie literally over 100 times ... it's totally entertaining! Powers Boothe gives the star performance. As fans of actors such as William Shatner (Impulse, 1974) and Ron Liebmann (Up The Academy, 1981), I never thought that the actor could "play" in such roles as Shatner and Liebmann until I saw Boothe as Jim Jones! As for me, Powers Boothe is Jim Jones ... this movie hits his best results !!!
