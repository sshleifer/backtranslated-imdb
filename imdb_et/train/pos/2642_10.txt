Indeed, this is a "warm-hearted" film. It won the George Peobody Prize, winning over "Roots", so it can tell you something about the nature of this movie. I'm looking for how to order this movie on the internet because my ex-father Eugene Logan, co-author of this movie, has died for a couple of years, so I no longer have the chance to get information from him. I would like her only daughters, my daughters, to see this movie, and it would be a great story for my grandchildren. My oldest daughter was seven years old when I was watching television, and I've been waiting to see it since then. One of my friends said it was his favorite movie. I won't break this movie for you.
