I really liked the AWTWB of Tom Barman. You just have to let it come and enjoy it when it lasts, and don't wait for something. It's like sitting on a cafe-terrace with beer, in summer, and watching people. Certainly, it won't keep you thinking later, it's true, but it's not a prerequisite for a good movie. It's just a movie experience that's great. <br /> <br /> I felt that a couple of directions could have worked a little more, but being a Lynch fan, I don't care anymore :) <br /> <br /> And I loved * the style or elegance of this movie. It's slippery, but fresh and sound is beauty. Any music lover gets out of his AWTWB, I can assure you. <br /> <br /> I'll give him out of 8 10. <br /> <br /> (10 out of 10 music)
