The Baghdad Thief is a treasure. First of all, it's a good story. Although my four children 's main exposure to the story, which is the most famous of the Arab Night Nights, comes from Disney Corporation, Baghdad retained its own interests. The story moves at a good pace and contains twists or twists that reduced predictability. Saba, who plays the young thief Abu, also measures any contemporary teenage actor, deciding how many times I heard my oldest daughter says, "She's a c-u!" <br /> <br /> In 1940, the film won Oscar for cinematography and special effects. Of course, these effects seem very late today ("Look, this Barbie is flying through the air," declared my daughter in the eyes of Geneva.) Yet they fit well. The film is over 60 years old. Effects match the script. What's more, the ones you see in Baghdad's thief were pretty modern over the next twenty five years. To see this, it is only necessary to compare the opening montage of the 1967 Star Trek episode. It was quite an achievement in this. <br /> <br /> It qualifies as a family movie, although there are a few strokes near the end. Action is so obvious and wounds as bloodless as those scenes that are almost as artificial as animation. impact. I recommend it.
