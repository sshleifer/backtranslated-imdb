<br /> <br /> Charlie Kauffman is a popular metaphysical angst, but this Canadian pearl makes it fun. <br /> <br /> Like most strange movies, the less is said about the plot, the better, but let's set the scene, two friends Anthony and Dave have been together since childhood, they can't cope with the world and eventually they mean is no longer needed. But this is where even more problems start. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie, it made me smile for a long time after the final credits, and it's a rare experience with so many mass productions there. <br /> <br /> Don't miss it. <br /> <br />
