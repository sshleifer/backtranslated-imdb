I would recommend this movie to everyone. Not only for fans of rocker Luciano Ligabue, but for all film films. Because it's sincere, touching, funny and true. Because Ligabue is a born storyteller and movie lover, and every frame of his film is made with love and care. Because his characters are loved and asked to be loved. Since most of the Italian debut films are negligible and what has been done by an outsider is a real pleasure to watch and listen. Since Stefano Accorsi is proud and reminds me of Andrea Pazienza, who, like Freccia's beautiful and talented and good and lost his life due to heroin, Ligabue shows as it is, unforgettable and ugly, without light morals. Because this is a film that speaks of our heart, our ears, our soul. And because I lived in the FM radio experience and it was exactly that. Thank you, Luciano!
