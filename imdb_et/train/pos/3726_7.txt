I did not expect Joel Schumacher to lead it with the highest caliber, so I was surprised that TIGERLAND was not a complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> The technique is often the SAVING derivative PRIVATE RYAN with trembling camera work, grainy shots, the film sometimes runs like a wheelbike - all the techniques Speilberg used to make his movie are more realistic, but in the end it was more annoying than something else. <br /> <br /> But unlike PRIVATE RYAN SAVING, the emotional component was not as weak as the characters in this movie seemed like real people and a less lively story than the American flag (Speilberg gets F- ie) "fineness". <br /> <br /> Next to Kubrick's FULL METAL JACKET section, this is the most realistic picture I can see in the movie's boot camp, and that's worth, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> It's not a great movie, but it's not a bad movie either.
