I started looking back at "Read My Lips", a plate of Freedom Fries before me. The food was quickly forgotten when I got into the director and co-author Jacques Audiard's original and excellent thriller. <br /> <br /> Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is the secretary of a large construction project developer company. In fact, he has some important responsibilities that are often not secretaries, and he is capable and ambitious. And this is hindered by the men's hierarchy, which uses it, but does not pay. <br /> <br /> Work faster than he can, Carlale is told to hire a secretary. Enter ex-con and general panabout Paul (Vincent Cassel). He is lying about his skills and in fact no legitimate company needs it. After Paul's initial serious misunderstanding of Carla against him, these two allies will receive. Beginning a peculiar friendship. In Stunt, which would have given true Carla "The Apprentice" a great candidate, he will win his egoistic male opponent at work with Paul's respect. Exit the rival. <br /> <br /> Carla is almost deaf without her hearing aid. It almost hears it normally. It turns the hearing aid out to isolate unpleasant sounds and annoying people. He's also very lonely. The heroic makeup was made to appear to her, but she is really beautiful. He has no boy. His babysitters, so a friend can be in touch (this is a French film) Worse and humiliating, he joins the girlfriend's claim that he is getting somewhere while a married friend is in Carla's bed with his help. Not nice. <br /> <br /> As Carla and Paul get to know each other better, larcenous is hardly repressed by a non-former traitor. By the way, Paul also has a relationship with his password officer who completes the main plot and has his big surprise at the end. <br /> <br /> "Read my lip?" The brilliant Paul admits that Carla's ability to read his lips, even at a remarkable distance, is more than a fun salon trick that seems to be the first. <br /> <br /> A whim develops there. Helps say. <br /> <br /> Paul and Carla are a couple of real criminals. He wants love but also takes money. She wants her, sort of, but business must come before any erotic saturation. Together with Cassel and Devos, there are strong actors who carry extraordinary crimes to their end very convincingly. <br /> <br /> Rent it or buy it, but when you enjoy a good crime story, you go to "Read My Lips". And maybe you want to watch it several times: I do. <br /> <br /> 9/10
