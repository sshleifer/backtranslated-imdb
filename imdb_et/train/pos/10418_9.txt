The story of the early days of Baghdad's sons (as it was ever written) has created in 1924 by Raoul Walsh filmmakers who saw Douglas Fairbanks for the first time, quietly, changing the "Baghdad Thief" to less torture and recent attempts. The best, however, is the 1940 version, which for its time was an amazing, magical, top-notch special effect. These effects are still working under their magic. <br /> <br /> At least six directors are listed for a tech-colored film that celebrated Saba as a son-in-law, Abu, John Justin as a dream-loving, unleashed monarch, Ahmad, and June Duprez as a lovely princess that Ahmad was looking for and evil evil, Jaffari the quest for evil Conrad Veidt. The giant genie acts by Rex Ingram. <br /> <br /> Jaffar will betray Ahmad in a treacherous manner, and if he is arrested by an abominable snake, he and Abu will suffer, who is clearly incapable of destiny. Ahmad is rendered dark and Abu becomes a beloved mole. Their adventures through everyday decorated Hollywood backs are fun, but special effects make this movie work. <br /> <br /> Two men were responsible for everything from a magical flying carpet to a huge gene jumping out of the bottle. tornado-like black vortex: Lawrence W. Butler and Tom Howard. (Howard, by the way, made a special effect of the 1961 version of this film. Both men had a technical sorcery for a long and outstanding career.) <br /> <br /> Duprez is exceptionally cute but little called for serious action. Justin Ahmad designs a powerful but dreamy romance that is not affected by erotic impulses. Saba is the central actor of many scenes and she is very good. For both children and adults, there is a lot of violence, but bloodless. However, I do not believe that anyone under eight should not see a "Baghdad thief". <br /> <br /> This movie regularly performs on TV, but today I saw my teenage son and I saw it in a theater with a lot of young people present. It was nice to see that in affluent communities, computer-based children are delighted and delighted with the special effects that seem to them to be primitive. <br /> <br /> "The Baghdad Thief" is a military classical Hollywood class where strong production values ​​often caused persistent attractive and significant emissions. This is one of the best of its kind. <br /> <br /> 9/10
