You saw this movie at the Vancouver Film Festival and thought it was deadly smart, stylish and FUNNY. <br /> <br /> ROCK SOLID was cast. Great Work by Carrie Anne Moss, Dylan Baker, Tim Blake Nelson, Billy Connelly and Up and Comer, Alexia Fast. <br /> <br /> We liked to think about a movie a day after that. > <br /> Writers, Dennis Heaton, Robert Chomiak, and Andrew Currie have put together a lot of political subtitles - but they didn't attack you. <br /> <br /> The world they were hoping for was deep, and realized. This film has the obvious spirit of a carnivore. <br /> <br /> FIDO is guaranteed to improve bulk. <br /> <br /> Loved It !!!
