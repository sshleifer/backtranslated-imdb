"It's about you, Ed?" "Now you can play the game." On the day my father's mother left, he took me to watch this movie with his new girlfriend, at the opening day of Hollywood's Cinerama Dome. I was only 14 years old. I wasn't even quite sure what I saw, but I'll never forget it, especially Ned Beatty. <br /> <br /> Looking at it today, thirty-six years later, it's still a rebellion. My father was a big fan of Burt Reynolds, which was why he stood for almost an hour to see what the "action film" was supposed to be. Before that, I saw two films in the Dome: "Grand Prix" and "Norwegian Song". Well, it wasn't exactly Mario Andretti or Brady Bunch. After leaving the theater, I was shocked. But even at this delicate age I appreciated this art ... and after I saw it again today, I'm surprised that I was still after a very disturbing but extremely well-designed film. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that it was a traumatic experience for a fourteen-year-old who did not have to kiss his first girlfriend. I do not blame my father for me, but it was a bit of a child witness. <br /> <br /> As an adult, it is still quite disturbing, but I'm still very impressed. quality of film making. Burt Reynolds is an absolute miracle, like all the principles ... from Billy Redden as an internal guitar miracle to Ronny Cox as a frightened insurer ... everybody does a great job. Sound quality is different, from splitting birds to times. Photography, cinema ... all the technical aspects of this remarkable movie are first-rate. <br /> <br /> The moral issues that have arisen from the killing of sexual assaulters until the killing of a person remain the same today as they did it by unlocking a groundbreaking movie. And the classic queues to live in the wilderness after such unpredictable brutality are life-changing. These four men, the men of the city, who suddenly face a situation where they never imagine, raise the bar from fear. <br /> <br /> It's classic to be sure. And the phrase "you have a real mouth" has been quoted indefinitely, because on Saturday evening, there are comments on the water heater at work, this film is undoubtedly a big part of our society's pop culture ... as much as "Make my day" or "I'll be back" ever. <br /> <br /> So what would you do if you found your friends' sexual assault on a gun at a city out of the mountains, a cozy bed, a woman, and kids? And if you took the Burt Reynolds action (and I would have done the same), would you soon bark your body down the lake or try to judge and take your chances? The bottom line is: Deliverance offers. You can take it to the bank. If this film is not under the skin, it is not human. <br /> <br /> Even if you have seen it before, rent it again and ask yourself the question above. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie remains the same: Ed can't kill the fear ... then it changes. Life and its unpredictable situation can change a man. And I think that's what this movie is about Jon Voight, especially if Ed gives the best result here. And he remains one of the most talented participants in Hollywood history, from Midnight Cowboy to his very underrated performance, as Franklin D. Roosevelt at Pearl Harbor, his actor is raising the film to another level. Rock climbing, frightening and decisive to make it right. I guarantee that your heart rate will rise to a new level. <br /> <br /> Fast paced, tight, tight and tightly drawn as a banjo-string, this is a moral game that poses questions that remain today. Times are changing, but our choices are not human. <br /> <br /> Ten stars out of ten.
