This is a great movie. I sow that some people think it may not be based on a real story. Whether it is !, the film is very good, and all u don't think about why a meadow air balloon does not reach the seaside town and so on, but I thought "little girl's desire came true" and that means all our peaceful dreams come true true if we trust us and do everything in the world to keep them true. A little girl (in the Desi movie) and her mother were the best actors I've seen for a long time. Good for them, all participants, all for the director. If anyone can tell them, tell them, "A 25-year-old from Romania says thanks for making this movie."
