this film was an almost fantastic movie. A mix of Shakespeare, pop, jazz and faerie songs. This film was a Cinderella theme imaginative. With the tough pain, which was headed by the excellent cast of Kathleen Turner, this movie had done it all. All except production values. I hardly ever think that the film needs special effects or big budgets, but the top top production is similar to the same fruitful quality as any other made for a TV movie. In addition to better cinematography, this film was almost perfect. <br /> <br />
