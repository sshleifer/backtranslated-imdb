I saw this series as the premiere of the world for the first time at the Toronto Film Festival. I liked the idea behind the film, where the two men came together, and told the director of each country to direct the film about 911. WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All the pieces were very powerful and some were contradictory. If you are an American, you may not like it because some pieces may be anti-American. But I know some Americans who enjoyed these series. The piece I found was the best from India. It was a question of how the Muslim family living in the countries had two sons and one of them was missing. The Americans gave them a cold shoulder and automatically assumed he was involved in terrorist bombing. It puts the mother's despair and their accusations down so well that it brings tears to my eyes. Ultimately, we see that his son was dead when many victims were caught in a tower crash. It was a real story and it made it so real. There were many emotional and powerful pieces, and the African piece was one of the best. It was humorous, but just as powerful as the others. You must see for everyone and hopefully it will give up America and let it play in your country.
