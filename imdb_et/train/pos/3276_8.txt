49. PAPERHOUSE (thriller / horror, 1988) In a hospital with an 11-year-old fever (Charlotte Burke), there are only his drawings to keep his business. His health is gradually deteriorating when he is caught in mysterious "black squares". In every such episode, he dreams of a house in a pristine area, with only a sick, faulty boy named Marc (Elliot Spiers). If the dark, unknown threat threatens his idyllic "paper house", Marc's life is threatened. His life is also in danger when these dreams reflect his own state of health. <br /> <br /> Criticism: British director Bernard Rose's first debut film. Catherine Storr's "Marianne Dreams" has left many other "original" fantasies. If the story deals with dreams and nightmares, it's hard to change it to make it in the form of a movie. Director Rose successfully draws the aspect of the children's fantasy world with the darkness that is trying to attack them. <br /> <br /> Phillip Glass bounces bitterly, Rose knows how to use music wisely in a "jump out of place" moments. Most thrillers in this very important aspect are very sloppy to intimidate the viewers in order not to know what the next scene will bring. I also like how he hits the intermediate check and never lets it go or get into the next order of events. His mastery of the placement of objects (like his P.O.V.shots) also adds an extra dimension to cinematography, which otherwise seems to be inadequate. Only in Europe can you find malicious views as presented here: lonely houses, fields, beach towns, sightseeing towers, etc. <br /> <br /> Rose follows this movie "Candyman" (1992), a real spooky pearl of a "man of thought", and a bona fide favorite of the cult.
