"The Incredible Melting Man" is a fantastic, trashy and energetic Z-Class production that every self-respecting camp-horror freak must see for themselves! The ideal way to describe it with a low budget for the 70's is like a shameful copy of "The Quatermass Xperiment" by Damer ... just a thousand times dirty! Astronaut Steve West is the only survivor of the catastrophic space mission, but it turns out he has a terrible disease that makes him radioactive and ... causes him to thaw! After seeing your face in the mirror (could you blame him?), Steve strikes out of the hospital, leaving a trace behind the sticky abs and parts of his body. Doctor Ted Nelson has to find him quickly, because the disease also causes Steve to go unfulfilled appetite. The assumption may seem completely stupid, but this flick is enormously entertaining and contains great effects from Rick Baker. The melting guy looks like rotting pizza and his heavy breathing makes him sound like Darth Vader! Another big advantage is that the William Sachs scenario does not waste time on annoying scientific explanations or emotional speeches. The reluctance begins immediately and lasts until the last moment of the movie. Just enjoy this foolish horror game and try to switch your brain activity as much as possible, because if you start thinking about the script for many stupid things, leave it all for fun fun!
