This is a great contemporary movie noir .... "great" in that it is interesting to the beginning-to-end. Here are some holes and some funny parts that make you shake your head ..... but I haven't found anyone who didn't get that story. The film has the right number of actions, intercourse, plot twists and interesting characters. In addition, some nice colors and cinematography and a good guitar-based soundtrack are being sported. <br /> <br /> I labeled this crime movie as a "movie pointer" because it is sharp and not all characters are good. Even the only supposed good man, played by Nicholas Cage, is in trouble lying and has a quick thing he shouldn't have. He does something at the end that is not right, but I don't break it by saying. Suffice it to say that the rest of the characters are so bad that they make Cage look good! <br /> <br /> Speaking of "bad guys", does anyone do better than Dennis Hopper? Not much. At least in the "spoiled" category he is hard to beat. Lara Flynn Boyle is fun to look at the reasons. J.T. Walsh gives another great supportive result. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that never received much advertising, but it should be. You look at it in a fun way. By the way, try to say the name of this movie out loud three times fast without disturbing it!
