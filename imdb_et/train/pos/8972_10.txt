Jan Svankmajer's cinema discovered my eyes on the entire tradition of Czech animation, of which Jir√≠ Trnka was a pioneer. His Ruka is one of the best, technically impressive animated films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Potter wakes up and spends his plant. Then he goes to the pot. But there comes a big hand that covers the pot and requires the potter to make its shape. He casts his hand out, but soon he returns and puts him in a ribbon tree, where he is forced to let go of the stone. He sets it around, fades away from exhaustion, but ends up with the task. <br /> <br /> In a pleasant metacino order, the potter uses a candle to burn his visible doll chairs, keeping him informed and fleeing home. He closes himself and involuntarily kills his own beloved plant when he falls on his head. <br /> <br /> This movie does not hide the fact that it is pure animation, unlike modern movies that try to be realistic (why?). For example, a hand is probably a glove in someone's hands. Everything else is clay. The strings are visible and part of the narrative, making it the predecessor of Strings. The atmosphere is horrible: the hand that goes after a little potter succeeded in causing me more fear than many other horror films is obvious, but avoids the full manipulation of this simplicity. it is an artistic freedom and tyranny that cannot help everyone's heart and mind gain freedom as a natural right.
