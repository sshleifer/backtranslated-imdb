Another small piece of the Holocaust's enormous picture play is being turned upwards in this docudrama from the Rosenstrasse protest in Berlin, which was unknown at the end of February 1943. Details are given in the following appendix for this review. Here, his children and others who are dead are a scary, non-attentive Jewish woman who demanded an extremely Orthodox mourning ritual. He goes even further, demanding that his daughter's non-Jewish groom leave the house. <br /> <br /> Heavy daughter Hannah (Maria Schrader) is a first-time student of her mother, who was 8 years old in Berlin during World War II, was taken and protected by Aryan's wife. Hannah drops everything, goes to Berlin and finds her wife, Lena Fischer, now 90. Hannah convinces the woman to just tell her story. It all seems quite expensive. <br /> <br /> After the movie, it improves, focusing on a long setback mainly for the events of 1944 that surrounded the protest, where the fictional central character is the same as Mrs Fischer in the 33s (played perfectly by Katja Riemann), baroness and pianist is married to Fabian (Martin Feifel), a Jewish violinist who is one of the men detained on the Rosenstrasse site. back from time to time back and ends again in New York. The color of the current scene is quite saturated, 1943 scenes are washed out, strong blue-gray tones. <br /> <br /> The quality of action is generally quite good, which can be expected thanks to the deep reservoir of talent in Germany and Margarethe von Trotta, the most prominent female filmmaker of the new German cinema, a former actor. <br /> <br /> Just the story of the protest. There is only one feature that would have helped: the text has ultimately marked the end result of the people arrested at Rosenstrasse, which was the result, as the annex below explains, incredibly positive. <br /> <br /> "Rosenstrasse" has not worked well in most film critics. Too long, unnecessarily layered, gender stereotype reseller, manipulative with music: so does rape. It's too long. But in this movie I found protests from women who kept watch out for Rosenstrasse, where their Jewish relatives and others were detained. I didn't find anything soft, modern or manipulative in this image. <br /> <br /> The absence of extreme violence (no one is fired or otherwise physically brutal) increased my tension, which gradually increased as the film progressed. You expect a few minutes to start an attack. After that, somberness remained with me. I often woke up later at night when I saw the movie, in my opinion it was full of gloomy, melancholic, chaotic images and emotions caused by the film. It rarely happens to me. (German and English). My Rating: 8/10 (B +). (Viewed 05.05.2005).

Usually the arrested persons remained in custody only two days before they were loaded into Eastern Europe. But before the prisoners were deported, women and other relatives could happen in this case and appeared at Rosenstrasse, first in these and two and then more numbers. <br /> <br /> Maybe even six thousand, though not all at the same time, took part in the protest. Women demanded their spouses day by day. Armed, unorganized and without leaders, they faced the most brutal forces at the disposal of the third Reich. <br /> <br /> Joseph Goebbels, Berule Gauleiter (governor or regional leader), who wished this city to be racially cleaned up, was also responsible for the state's morality. In both cases, he was concerned about the possible consequences of women's activities. Instead of inviting more open dissent, putting women down the streets and threatening to compromise the "ultimate solution" secret, Goebbels released Rosenstrasse prisoners with Hitler's consent and even handed them back to the 25 who had already been sent to Auschwitz! <br /> <br /> For both Hitler and Goebbels, the decision was merely an inevitable postponement. But they were wrong. Almost all of Rosenstrasse's liberated survived the war. The women won an amazing victory against the destructive forces.
