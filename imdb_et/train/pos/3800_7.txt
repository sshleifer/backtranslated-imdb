The world of Dragon Hunters is a challenging world of 3D gravity. Planetsides, pieces of buildings, and strange flat plants float into the atmosphere, while the ground drops towards most of the characters, and is nowhere to be seen. This is a world that resembles an endless story when nothing came to eat the world. <br /> <br /> Funny is also the villain here in the world of Gobbler. This time, this big skeleton is a dragon with a hot eye. Heroes are a big but silent warrior, a tedious and greedy sidekick who manages the duo's entrepreneurial side and strange useless creature. They are united by the most talented girl in the world, who in my fear did not die a terrible painful and hopefully early death. <br /> <br /> Animation is great. Votes and sounds are top-notch. Too bad a story is as simple as imaginable. They're going to stop the world from Gobbler, they'll reach him almost immediately, they will win him. End. No real character or story. Even those I'd like to expect from a plot of such a movie. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: this is a lovely thing to watch, kids will probably enjoy it, but that's it. There is no depth for this world (intended).
