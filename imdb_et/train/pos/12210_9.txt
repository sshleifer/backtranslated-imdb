people claim their edited funny, but they had to significantly reduce it in production. I have a harry, as now professor ucsd, and honestly one of the best classes I've had, it's pretty funny here what happened to the movie, because Harry is so animated. I first looked at "joy of life" for the second class, where Harry called in the movie and started watching the movie after the class started. Harry initially made some results and is really real to create the moments that move you, especially when you need to edit things until you reach that point, but that's something you see in this movie.
