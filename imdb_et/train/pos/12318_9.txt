Although I'm not the biggest fan of wired martial arts movies, when the film goes straight to fantasy, not to fight, I get much more fun and this movie is one of the best fantastic drawings and crazy flying. shenanigans. Ching Siu Tung has created an enchanting delight and great beauty here. The great, tragic Leslie Cheung plays the hero of the tax winner who stays in a haunted temple at night and deals with the spirit of the fox and the mad Taoist. Cheung's performance is full of na√Øve but dignified charm and Wu Ma is pleasantly on the wall like a Taoist monk who shows some sword games and even gets a musical number. Perhaps the best thing is that Joey Wang is the fox spirit, truly delighted to see every movement and gesture that entrancingly attracts. The film takes into account the elements of fantasy, horror, comedy and romance, all of which mix into a constantly fun package. Ching Siu Tung, choreography management and handling gives you some excitement with pure wires and fills the film with misty, shady and gentle, benign forest colors, giving every forest picture a wonderfully amazing atmosphere. Also remarkable is hair styling and beautiful female characters, where, if I am not mistaken, Joey Wang's sporting hair will happen at times like fox ears. Although the film has relatively few activities and sometimes badly recommended pop music, it is a beautiful entertainment with swelling and drawing, even a strange clean character, an almost constant offering of visual places and a rich dreamy atmosphere. Essential treasure, highly recommended.
