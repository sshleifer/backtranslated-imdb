May 2004, Wonderland is quite new in the UK. Brilliant real story from the movie. When you know about LA from the beginning of the 80s, you appreciate how well it has been done. Using these elements of sharp cinematic styles is original, amplifying the experience and bringing the viewer very close. The use of a disaggregated "Pulp Fiction" schedule allows you to explore the uncertainty that has actually occurred, while the direction and presentation of cast command management and presentation, especially Val Kilmer as John Holmes; Oskari sure when I gave them out.
