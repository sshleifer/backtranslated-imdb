In 1986, I saw this movie on television one night. I was 6 years old. It was similar to my random view of how 1987 is not being looked at immediately. â€œI went to Russia next year in a silent fear, hoping my parents didn't find that I was watching it! <br /> <br /> Should I think if my parents knew I was watching Les Valseus when I was a child? I probably avoided my father even today, and my mother is likely to be condemned. I don't know if they'd still see it. I am never sure if this movie is an unknown trash that ignores the sexual revolution or if it is a sexy release movie, because it tends to tell you that you won't ever get lost be so offensive. <br /> <br /> It's definitely violent. It has a violent view of sex, virtually no recognition of love. Even breastfeeding of young people mimics greedy sexual abuse. But the scenario is very erotic and (God, I'm so British) awakens! Do they suck their breasts for themselves? This is exploitation. So why can I get wooded? <br /> <br /> Friends looking for an experienced older woman, find a former mother-mother? I do not know. It ends with a truly merciless suicide. I described it to my friend JB Nelson, who has the Cannibal Holocaust guts, and he went to eeuurrgghh! There is no mother-love for this movie, on the contrary. Distortion of the beginnings of boys. Why do they shoot a girl's leg? Why does he return to them? Should women be punished so that they can know what is right for men? <br /> <br /> I mean two films, one I wish I had never seen before. is not such a harsh world. Swept Away / Madonna, what a bunch of madness will never count on being so offended that a woman who is punished for a woman becomes a slave to a human being and maybe a madonna saying that everyone respects the boy ritchie im so angry that you can't use punctuation! Time in America / God of Leone, why does Noodles do it? Destroys the way we have been watching him throughout our lives. So close to finding Deborah for love. Now they're both destroyed. Why Sergio? Why? <br /> <br /> Les Valseus has no rape, but a lot of sex and nudity, both sexes. Very honest, no titillation. There are no fantasy shades, perfect Hollywood smooth moves. Jokes, yes. But there is too much darkness and jealousy and deception to call it sex sex comedy. Forget the Carry On Shooting Naked Hairdresser's Legs Cos She's coming back and you can Hook her up on her ex-con Lover's Vengeant Son and she learns how Cum Him. <br /> <br /> The two things I can't stand are rape movies and prison movies. Les Valseus is not a rape movie! God does not want to see it now! This is a great movie!
