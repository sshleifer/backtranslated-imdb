When this movie first came out in 1984, the prince was one of the hottest acts. Everyone wanted to see the movie, which was nothing more than an expanded music video. The actor was pretty bad, but what can you expect from the big screen musicians for the first time? Nevertheless, it was still a very fun movie! Morris Day and Jerome Benton all the time offer classic comedy, especially the "The Password" handover that makes you think of Abbott & Costello, who makes his "who's first" baseball. <br /> <br /> Appolina (who then went with one name) gave some beautiful breasts so you had a short nudity. In addition, he is very attractive. And, of course, the album's soundtrack is one of the best Princes ever recorded. Later, Prince Warner was broke with Bros and changed his name, but during this career he was at the top of his game. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a great category at all times, but it's quite fun.
