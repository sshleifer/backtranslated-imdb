Anyone who has never seen anything in the Matrix fighting scenes has ever seen this movie. Fighting scenes choreographed by the operational psychopath Yuen Woo Ping, who also made struggles in the Matrix. And fighting scenes is nothing. <br /> <br /> Li plays a supersoldier who doesn't know the pain that now lives in a pacifist librarian (ya got me). When other evil super-soldiers begin to take over drugs from local drug trafficking, Li will join his police force to help them stop. <br /> <br /> In this movie, some totally crazy things happen (one badguy gets his hand down with a glass and hardly notices). Fighting scenes are full of flying strokes and shocks; the body number is up there. Li has rarely been better and has surrounded her with beautiful female costumes (Yip strikes some serious ass as a companion supersold). Anthony Wong even makes squirrels a master of drugs (there are no surprises, he makes every head of HK movie). It is unfortunate that they do not make such films in the US; I shouldn't sit through all these terrible copying jobs to see what I want so much. Recommended.
