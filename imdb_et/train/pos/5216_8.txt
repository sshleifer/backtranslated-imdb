Erroll works for the Public Security Department and is tasked with controlling sex offenders. Sometimes he pushes a line in his work and strikes sex offenders. I'm not accusing him, but his boss is ready to retire him, so it comes to allison. Erroll is now training him to do his job and it's like shrouding work. Allison is somewhat naive from the start, but he doesn't understand how much he is really at risk, and that is all Erroll's fault. He will go a long way in his obsession with finding a missing girl if his work is not a police officer. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty decent film of a mad man who pushes the boundaries and works outside his "scope of practice". Erroll did a good job, but for the safety of Allison. It also has some good secrets and it was even more when I thought it was.
