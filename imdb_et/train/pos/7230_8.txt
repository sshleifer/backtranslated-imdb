"The Invisible Mouse" is a pleasant and different Tom & Jerry comic. It has common cat / mouse moves and battles, but this time in a different way. Jerry accidentally gets into the invisible ink in the bottle and is obviously very happy about it because he realizes he can prepare a lot of "surprises" for Tom, scare him, torture him and confuse him. because it's weird, it's also cool and funny to see what we don't see: Jerry invisible. It's fun to see things that lift up the air, not seeing who does it (we know who, right?) - it's like things that had a life or even almost a ghost issue. It's just as fun to see that Jerry eats refreshments and fruits. I like this instrumental music that plays when it's not visible. <br /> <br /> Some of the best jokes in this short are when Tom sees Jerry's shadow and hits him and even when Tom tries to put him in a pan. and Jerry writes, "Missed me". I also like Jerry drinking Tom's chocolate milk, becoming visible again and with a joyful vision on his face. <br /> <br /> Generally, this short, basic comic book is a basic ingredient: humor, entertainment, fun and enjoyment. also a beautiful work of art.
