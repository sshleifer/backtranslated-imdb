I just read the latest comments on this movie and I would like to answer. you probably haven't known the rap group N.W.A. the original story. which began in 1988, the ice cube left the band in 1989 and finally in 1991 when the band broke down when Dr.dre left. which resulted in a lot of beef, starting with the departure of the ice cube and dr.dre in 1991. this story was based somewhat on it. <br /> <br /> Even more, this film was a 90-minute laugh, they explained that the bootie juice song is a political statement that was fun. not to mention the "love song" tasty was hooked. and when vanilla sherbert got his ass kicked, as well as the board's management is fun and they also have the leaders to shoot every time. <br /> <br /> People who didn't enjoy this movie were probably not getting it or were idiots, my opinion
