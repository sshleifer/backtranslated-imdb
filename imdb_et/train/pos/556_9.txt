Cowboys James Stewart and Walter Brennan take their herd from Seattle to Alaska and Canada for a claim. When they're there, they have to fight with seductive, dirty businessmen, Ruth Roman, and ice-cold, happy lucky cable, James McIntire. <br /> <br /> John Wayne can talk more, but his good prayer, Stewart, also made some great, hard-edged western parts, some with great director Anthony Mann. Frankly, I would take it with my strong sequence and fine melodrama over North Alaska any day. <br /> <br /> In the Far East, there are some breathtaking scenery and cinematography that would surely have come on the widescreen. <br /> <br /> There is always a firm support for always trusted Brennan, Roman (who is great), incredibly cute Corrine Calvet and James McIntire, who plays one of my favorite types of bad type. it does not take itself too seriously. <br /> <br /> This would make a great double counting with Bend of The River, another highly recommended western part of Mann / Stewart.
