This amazingly pleasant and gentle success of yet another successful "The Boggy Creek" legend is a follow-up only under the name. Natural, self-evident creatures created by nature, called "Big Bay Ty", which lives deeply without the invocation of Boggy Creek, have many stories. Two gentle brothers and their older, more sensible tomboy sister (lovely, with a tiny future "Different punches" sitcom star Dana Plato) succeed in treacherous swamps to check if the creature of the local legend can actually be a real living being. The trio loses hopelessly a fierce storm and hairy, bear-like, humongous, but very gentle and benevolent Sasquatch comes to the rescue of children. <br /> <br /> Tom Moore's casual, non-frills direction is linked to this simple story at a peaceful pace, capturing the busy rural weekly details with a surprisingly precise detail, pulling mixed country characters with great warmth and affection, and fortunately developing the mood in organic, restrained and effortless in a way that never stops sticky - a happy mushroom. Lovely Dawn Wells (Mary Ann on "Gilligan Island") gives a marvelous image of a pleasant working group for children with a single mother, while Jim Wilson and John Hofeus provide enjoyable strong support as a pair of fake oils on the grass. Robert Bethard's capable, sunny cinematography displays the woody device in all its peaceful, peaceful and fragile glory of civilization. The result of Darrell Deck mixes with the sonic tuning of the meat-indexing synthesizer and the bluegrass of the trembling banjo-pluckin state. In addition, this image is particularly praised for the fact that he probably predicted Bigfoot's fashionable good for a child of the 90's in the 15-year-old.
