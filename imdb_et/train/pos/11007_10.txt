Jeremy Northam's description of the embarrassing, mild wise book of Morgan Sullivan, and his look, let the bits and pieces of his actual identity under the influence of a single malt dungeon, and Lucy Liu's presence under the spell is perfectly designed and delighted to see. His offer to his cigarette at the bar is an old habit that has been made without thinking or even asking, and he is lost on his face, neck and lips. Regardless of brain care, love is a permanent way. Love does not become "brainwashed" with either of its fake women. In gradual stages, he begins to give up his glasses, walk and talk differently, and even his face is different as the film progresses. Music is fantastic, hypnotic, sexy and at times driving. The widespread use of black and gray tones makes it a tradition of almost traditional film thrillers for many classic thrillers. I would have liked to see more vulnerability in depicting Lucy Liu when she sees her in her diverse frazzled states that she loves and for whom she performs a mission based on dark faith, some modest vulnerability and true compassion, and that would have altered its smaller one-dimensional performance. He's just not suitable for Northam talents, but I generally enjoyed this movie and enjoyed the knowledge of other scenarios written by the same author.
