Anyone with a young boy who doesn't watch black and white movies should put it on his TV. When a child walks, I was wondering what they were screaming and photographing on the screen, telling him that it was an adult image and that he wasn't big enough to watch it. It keeps him there for a few minutes; director George Stevens and his team will keep him up. <br /> <br /> I think my father did it to me anyway and I'm the better man. This classic adventure thread, placed in India during the British occupation, includes a troop of Sergeant Soldiers who find their close union that is facing departure, as they prepare to marry their loved one. Help comes to the fake Thuggie rebellion that the soldiers are against each other. <br /> <br /> "Gunga Din" was one of the great films that came out of Hollywood's best since 1939. Even more than most of the great movies of this golden year, it's fun in a very instant and accessible way. Theme music is an instant hummable nirvana. In California shooting, the camera works (the only thing "Gunga Din" got when the Oscar nomination is) is a wind-blown greatness that seems like Raji a hundred years ago. The battle scenes are released in a very realistic way, not too violently, but very dirty when people fall and shoot and run in every corner of every frame in a way that is real, not staged like some Cecil B. DeMille Bible killing festivals. br /> <br /> The script is not just scenes, it also develops a three-sergeant relationship with a great sense of humor. The main focus is Sgt. Cutter, looking back at high tales of golden treasures. It's a rare creator of Cary Grant and her lightness is just the right film that never takes her seriously even when it develops tight. <br /> <br /> The anchor of the Trio is Sgt. MacChesney (Victor McLaglen) who puts his elephant Annie on and tries to protect Cutter from his hare-skinned schemes. She's just so funny, leaving Sgt. Ballantine (Douglas Fairbanks Jr., showing a nice Errol Flynnish dash) than having a love interest and low enough to find out that he needs to grow up and grow up with his boy's sons. <br /> <br /> When "Gunga Din" was a lifetime movie, Joan Fontaine's efforts to save his man from his two losers and breaking their skull. But as this is a boys' film, the emphasis here is on how the trio must stay together and save Ballantine from a worse fate than death, not just marriage, but as Cutter shouts several times, including road work. > <br /> The political correctness police are hard on this film, not so much on the gender issue, but also on the idea that British soldiers will save poor Indians from malevolent. It tears the colony apology. Luckily, this movie was returned when the producers felt that it was not necessary to make clear at the center of the film the obvious liberalism that the three sergeants, who are so devastating and false racially proud, must be saved with the rest of the army is humble bhist that only one of them three of them had time for their approval. After all, the true sacrifice of the film for the whole of its ridiculous glory is the same name that Sam Jaffe played so close to his heart. <br /> <br /> Back when this movie was made, Jack Warner said, "You want to send a message, use Western Union." However, the messages seemed to fly fast and fierce "Gunga Dinis". I'm watching the movie now and wondering if the audience wants to think about what Gunga Din really was when she referred to Cutter's golden temple. Did he really revenge his British bosses? Would he justify it, especially considering MacChesney's cold processing? When Colonel Weed brought this horror, the poem by Rudyard Kipling, in which the film was loose, slipped into the stupidity of imperialism, that he wrote over someone who proved "a better man than I am". end? What they did about the great word of Guru presented in perfect cut in English: "You have sworn that the soldiers are likely to die for faith in your country, England. Well, I can die for my country and for my faith as soon as you do." .. India, goodbye. "<br /> <br /> Of course, the same character also guides your brutal followers:" Kill killing for love! Kill Kali for love! Kill! "Which means we are allowed to angry and root the British and save questions about what this all means for later. <br /> <br /> What "Gunga Din" means for me is the fastest 90 minute excitement on the video. Cutter never found his golden temple, but all of us look at Gunga Din.
