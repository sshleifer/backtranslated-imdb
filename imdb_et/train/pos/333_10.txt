Frankly, this series is as classic (as television goes) when the original poem is for the world's literature. It is far from appealing exploitation, it is a beautiful and respectful design of one Western culture. <br /> <br /> I was moved by the bad situation of Odysseus and his followers; Troy falling drama (what he felt but didn't see); intrigued the way the gods played with the mortal fate. (It should be noted that the gods present here are not ridiculous CGI creatures that are around their wings or badly molded fashion models in bikini. As in Homer's work, they also function through mortal representatives or rarely, in classical form) <br /> <br /> It is a pity that it is not available on DVD, especially considering Odyssey's very poor and cheesy options available in video stores.
