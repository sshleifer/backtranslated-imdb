It's not time for this movie. The contradictory customization of Jeffrey Konvitz's best seller now shows that this movie looks like the main version of your regular spookfest. Frightening touches aside (especially what's crazy, up to the finale), it's essentially a shiny horror movie for those people who don't know much about the genre. It has an extraordinary role to play in small roles (Jose Ferrer, Ava Gardner, Eli Wallach, Burgess Meredith, Christopher Walken and many others), but nothing tells me that the producers wanted to be so expensive to convince the audience that this is not your average movie (There was a similar idea from the 70's disaster producers). I liked to see familiar faces, but the story is very silly and no matter how big the class is in the movie, it works at your medium 70s exploitation film (though not a totally bad thing). However, this is an enjoyable movie, especially for those who enjoy stargazing. As usual, Albert Whitlock's work is outstanding. Generally pretty fun.
