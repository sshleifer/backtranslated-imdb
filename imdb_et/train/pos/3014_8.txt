This fantastic horse is an early prototype of what quickly became a very popular movie genre. I was delighted to see William Powell handle the story of a charisma and charm detective, and without his Charles Charles character (the "Thin Man" series) foolish attitude. Although the story is good in itself, I think this is a fun way to watch the movie, with Michael Curtiz's fantastic imagination. From a visual point of view, this is a richly textured film, which Curtiz shows the incredible command of the media; Curtiz demonstrates that he was one of the best Hollywood directors, from split screens, strange camera corners and imaginative setbacks. Highly recommended if you are a fan of such a movie.
