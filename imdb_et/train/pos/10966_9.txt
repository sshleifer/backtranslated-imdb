Gray gardens are the world itself. Edith and Little Edie live almost completely in isolation, eating ice cream and liver paste in an alternating kitchen in their (probably) shared bedroom. Cats are foolish, while mother Edith insults her daughter's elution. This is the Tennessee Williams game that comes to life and should inspire scriptwriters and playwrights because the odd and overlapping dialogue is 100% real. <br /> <br /> The house house reminds me exactly how my grandmother and her 50 - their daughter lived for ten years (except poor and clean). They would have beaten the whole day, grandmother spoke of her gloriously perfect past, while her daughter constantly accused her of being left behind by men, work, and self-expression. <br /> <br /> This movie is a parent / daughter relationship that is visible to everyone in writing. It is sad and voyeuristic, but the filmmakers did an amazing job that Edies would be comfortable enough to be so careless. It is rare to see real life in this way and especially in the context of the context - powerful family remnants that burn in the skeleton of your home.
