I got it a couple of times on Sundance several years ago and got a nice cinema clip system. Half-semi-hard but hard-knitted shooting takes a modern media culture (or lack of it), focusing on some serious shocks, the far-flung Hollywood inhabitant. It was an entertaining early performance by Mark Ruffalo and some memorable cinematography from DP who made Polish Brothers films. There was a humorous humor and a strange original feeling there, which definitely differentiated it. This movie was written with all this classic and I am surprised that it is not yet on DVD. <br /> <br /> Hopefully soon.
