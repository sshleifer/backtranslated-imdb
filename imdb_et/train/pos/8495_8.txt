The tea, the way back in the 1980s, long before the NAFTA was created, and the companies began to break their national identity, the United States and Japan were in a world of different production. Remember that words like "Union Yes!", "Japanese take over this country," and "Americans are lazy?" <br /> <br /> The fall of the Reagan era and corporations looked at the global marketplace, director Ron Howard made one of several trips to the comedy stud with his "Gung Ho" crack in 1986, which brought over $ 36 million in receipts from the US office. Although in many ways dated, the Howard-in-cheek story of crash cultures in the workplace today is a hard truth for industrial life. <br /> <br /> “Gung Ho” focuses on Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton), a Hadleyville representative of the Automobile Association, a small, depressed city at the foot of Pennsylvania. Stevenson was asked to visit the Tokyo Assani Motor Company (similar to actual Toyota) who is considering a US operation in an empty factory. Assan decides to move hundreds of residents and the city fell during the collapse, and Stevenson has been hired as a contact person between officials and workers on the conveyor line. <br /> <br /> 112 minutes of Gung Ho is a humorous look at these two sides, their strengths and weaknesses being equally weighed: on the one hand, the American workforce who values ​​its traditions, but is often caught in the madness of pride and trade union movement; on the other hand, Japanese workers, who are very committed to their work, but who lack personal satisfaction and feelings of self-dignity. In Stevenson, we find an American class of intelligence who has the skills to chat with people through misunderstandings. By retaining the jobs of its employees and on most of the Hadleyville route, Stevenson proves a pleasing man who does not want anything but a fair opportunity, even though his wisdom sinks to him with a great deal of affliction. In addition to answering Assan's leaders, we are witnessing a delicate balance between Stevenson and his associates, many of whom have grown up. This includes Buster (George Wendt), Willie (John Turturro) and Paul (Clint Howard, Ron's brother). <br /> <br /> The Japanese lie is led by Gedde Watanabe, also known as "Sixteen Candles" and "Volunteers. Watanabe plays Kazihirot, the plant leader, who is fortunate and begins to feel compassion for American life. He is a continually hidden Saito (Sab Shimono), the nephew of Assan's chief executive, who is desperate to take his seat. During easy touch, these characters are very good at communicating the ideas of working culture in Japan. <br /> <br /> When the script is dominated by Hunt Stevenson, Michael Keaton must give a definite result to this film. "Gung Ho" is indeed the success of Keaton, who also informed Ron Howard in 1994 of The Paper. He made this film in a series of lighter roles that included Mrs. Mother, 'Beetle Juice' and 'The Dream Team' before you reach Batman, 'One Good Cop' and 'My Life'. It is also hard not to like Gedde Watanabe as a strange man who first shakes the Japanese before joining Stevenson to make a car unit unified. <br /> <br /> Supported by top-Wendt, Turturro, Shimono and Soh Yamamura Assan CEO Sakamoto. Mimi Rogers offers a romantic interest like Audrey, a girlfriend of Hunt. Edwin Blum, Lowell Ganz, and Babaloo Mandel joined Gung Ho's letter. Random music, which received the BMI Film Music Award, has been compiled by Thomas Newman. Gung Ho's soundtrack songs are the 80's between the wall and the wall, including "Don't get me wrong," Tuff Enuff, and "Working class man." <br /> <br /> The success of Gung Ho has actually led to short-lived series of ABCs. Although twenty years ago, social commentary is more impressive, Ron Howard's film still has a comic value. It is available on DVD as part of the Paramount Widescreen Collection and is a short change. Audio options are available in English 5.1 surround, English Dolby surround and French "dubbing", but subtitles are only available in English. There are no extras, not even a theater trailer. On the plus side, Paramount's digital transmission is pretty good, with little grain after the opening credit and high quality sound. Although some of the appendices would have been useful - especially that "Gung Ho" was the success of the office - there are few complaints about the film itself. <br /> <br /> *** of four
