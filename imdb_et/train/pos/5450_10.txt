Barbara Stanwyck plays Lily Powers. He is the speaker of his father's jargon in a small ground-breaking mining town. He also sells to men. She flees to New York and literally sleeps her way to the top. <br /> <br /> Originally, I only saw a 71-minute version, but it is quite extreme - by that time. Nowadays it's pretty annoying. The movie is moving very fast and has tons of sexual enthusiasm - some of it comes out as pretty foolish (but fun) today. It moves so fast that you can simply ignore that most of it can never happen - even in 1933. There's nothing classic or monumental about it - it's just a quick, cleverly dirty little movie that's fun. It only breaks down at the end of the little "moral" end that the censors demanded. It's so incredible and stupid (I saw it in the theater and the audience laughed at it - one man rightly said, "No way") I just saw an uncut 75-minute version that has a different, somewhat tragic and much better ending. It was thought that this version was lost until 2004, when it was discovered in error! I believe this is the only one who will be released - but be aware. <br /> <br /> Actress is good - Stanwyck is jumping in its role and playing this WAY over the top. He makes you believe he's cruel and sleeping. There are also strong supporters of beautiful Donald Cook and George Brent. Also look for a pre-stardom John Wayne fun bit as a soft and light office worker! Fun, dirty and fast. I'll give it 9.
