The film hit me. Personally, I mostly had a bad buzz. Finally, after having DVDs a month ago, I started it sleeplessly at night. Though the film pulled out extra material for its passion and addition to his game, it would have been less realistic if they had left out all the scenes. The best thing about the film is its consistency with the relationship. There were no ex openings or characters that threatened the relationship. I usually mean that we see that a girl meets a boy with an amazing twist of fate, a date, something we've come to see, breaks them up, and then they get together in the last five minutes of the movie. but this movie did not follow this form. In fact, we experienced the relationship and its mistakes, and while the characters had moments of love, they did not have dramatic breaks when they went out and made the assembly every 15 years and then again love. I didn't feel the film was as predictable as the rest of the romance films. The story was unique and truthful to reality, so I felt that these people in the film were the most plausible that I had seen in today's romance. in the real world series, fate was little. It's not "My Fair Lady," but it's a lively and honest film. I'm just saying I like it.
