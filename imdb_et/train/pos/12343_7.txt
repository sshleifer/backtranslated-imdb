Artificially speaking, this is a beautiful film - cinematography, music and costumes are proud. In fact, this film is more beautiful than Akira Kurasawa himself. In this case, he only wrote the film several years after his death. <br /> <br /> So, as far as writing is concerned, the dialogue was well written and sometimes the story was interesting. But this story was also rather frustrating, but in no way related - it's a story of a group working in a brothel. Interestingly, while prostitution is considered to be a much more accepted business in Japan, women are for a long time a better life. It reminds me a lot of the movie Streets Of Shame, although the characters of Streets Of Shame are much less pleasant and one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> So it usually gets 7 - mostly thanks to everything in writing. It is too bad that the weakest link in this film is the great story of Kurasawa.
