"Vanilla Sky" was a wonderfully thought-out film. Or rather, "Abre Los Ojos" was thoughtful. I watched this movie late at night, excited about what came. I was not disappointed. At the end of the movie I was proud. I didn't get it out of my mind. All this idea just flew me away. The end was a surprise if Shyamalan could ever do. The plot line was also something that made me interesting and interesting. Cast, great. It was a wonderful movie. You can watch such a movie over and over again and always find something new. I've seen it four or five times and I'm always looking for something new. It's a movie that keeps you interested forever.
