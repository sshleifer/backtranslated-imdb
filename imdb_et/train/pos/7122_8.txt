Immediately after World War II, Hollywood's minds tried to distance themselves from waving a meaningless flag, which is a natural component of military forces. "The best years of our lives" and even the "gentlemen's agreement" explored how Americans saw themselves after the war, but Delmer Daves's "Navy pride" beat them. <br /> <br /> The movie is about the Philadelphia smart alec John Garfield, who goes to war at sea and after a breakthrough at the Foxhole, where Japanese soldiers shouted at him and his friends unreasonably "in Mariinia, today you die!" The hand grenade and his girlfriend are being dug back home instead of leaving home. <br /> <br /> Delmer Daves is uncompromising in his imagination of the men who are bold, as it was, almost by chance They are there, fox and when they are shot, they react so much to heroism, but they get the job and then comes with a selfish, dark, gloomy sense of humor, Garfield's angry denial of her darkness, and the film won't excuse "There's no free candy in this world" as her friend tells her. I am a man, Dane Clark's playable Jew, reminds him, "During the war, someone gets it and you are. Everyone has a problem! When I return, some guys will not take me because my name is Diamond. <br /> <br /> The big movies are made of such courage, and if the "Naval pride" in the first half of the hour does not fully increase, then from that time on it will become a real work of art, you cry and you think, you pain and hope in hope, just: art. <br /> <br />
