Linear travel in nonlinear structure. This is the fact that 12 times in the monkey flow between the present, the future, and the past. But the linearity of the film cannot be avoided: it is the work of the projector, the opening of narrative. <br /> <br /> What we see as the basis for time is a reflection of the inevitability of our actions. . The world of this Terry Gilliam movie is a world with little room for free will. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, we have known the prophecy of schizophrenia, where in 1997 the plague of the earth, the coercion of a few survivors to live underground, is the only place that the virus does not affect. <br /> <br /> Cole's (Willise) mission is clear: return to the mid-90s to investigate whatever and who is involved with this release of the virus. It is not possible to change the past: everything you can do is gather information that can help today's scientists (which is the future for us) to find treatment. Don't change what happened (the past is inevitable), but will make the current better. <br /> <br /> Cole is gradually coming to a striking dilemma in his "return" in time: his life in the past is better than the latter in the dark and dehumanizing, controlled by totalitarian scientists who choose "volunteers" to travel to the past (this word is sharp) ironic). <br /> <br /> <br /> Scientists have not yet reached the highest level in time travel, and Cole reaches the wrong date - it will later work on the plot as evidence of his peace of mind to psychiatrist Kathryn (Stowe). <br /> <br /> We see the story through evolution that linearity and non-linearity interleave. <br /> <br /> There is more than one moment when the scene, which is the first and almost reaches the end - and certainly the climate. It changes itself according to Cole's memories that come out of your dreams. <br /> <br /> At the airport, a man, when he runs, is armed, somebody else. Blonde woman runs after murdered. <br /> <br /> This is a scene that connects the past (where Cole is a child visiting an airport with parents), the current (storytelling time) and the future (adult Cole). The school has the feeling that it has already lived the reality he is currently experiencing. His prophetic dreams are proof that it is impossible to escape or avoid what happened. The authors who shoot him stop him from being killed by a mad scientist, doctor Peters (Morse), who is responsible for spreading the disease. <br /> <br /> What could not be changed. And for Cole, what was going to be. Every day. <br /> <br /> The film is not well understood by many. Something other than a masterpiece for me. <br /> <br /> Other good movies with a similar theme: Back to the future trilogy (which has another angle to the "mad scientist" character, and although it shares the decomposition of the atmosphere - especially in the second movie - is more optimistic than Gilliam's work, that's it strange Hollywood picture). <br /> <br /> In the second register, "Wild strawberries", one of Bergman's masterpieces, is a striking and enlightening journey to the past through dreams and memories.
