Although I was in the movie where I played part of Sheriff Hodges, I still managed to jump in many places and believe me that I'm not that easy. It can be said that I am biased about the film, and OK, I am, but I did not see the final product until 12/27/2006 and I was very pleased. I'm not a fan of horror films, but I love old "B" movies and black and white Sci Fi movies. This movie makes you "think" what you know when something happens, it is not, it does. This will keep you completely out of balance. I would recommend watching the movie first, then the director's notes and peculiarities. It's so well written, guided and filmed, and I can tell you personally that working with this pain and team was a real pleasure. I sincerely hope that I am part of Brian and Laurence's future projects.
