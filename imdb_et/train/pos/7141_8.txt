Since Siskel's death and Eber's absence, the exhibition has been left in the hands of Richard Roeper's inability. Roeper is not a film critic, he simply criticizes everything he does not personally like, that is, movies with land music are sealed because "I don't like land music!" and children's movies get the standard "Don't see it now, wait for this DVD to appear, and rent it to your kids!" Roeper can be idiotic but in some other area. A weekly guest who sat at Ebert for a better price, but who wants to pick a cow in the middle? All of this said it was the only exhibition in the city, and it alone valued this worthy viewing. As for Roger Ebert, if Stephen Hawking can talk, can you! It is your mind and the thoughts we are waiting for long. Do everything you need to use this self-declared throne.
