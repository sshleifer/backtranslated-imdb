I think a lot of viewers missed the fact that it is obviously a parody of Western films. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad movie - it's a smart language in the cheek that takes the west. I don't think this film took me for a moment. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie even more unique is that it is focused on four strong, beautiful women, two black, one Asian and one Mexican / Hispanic character. <br /> <br /> These are not your ordinary western women - they are tough - they can pull quickly and shoot straight. <br /> <br /> It's so tough even when the bartender throws whiskey. <br /> <br /> The plot that moves this story is typical of the west coasts - "I threw my brother - so I'm" convinced. get you! "Only in this western part has a woman's sister fired and she is revenge for the gang who did it. <br /> <br /> So she goes and rounds her old crowns on her bank robbery days. <br /> One of them, Maria, doesn't not really interested in Rachel's sister-in-law, but she is motivated by the fact that in the city where they are, hidden gold and jewelery. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of scenes that don't make sense, not that they are a lot of trouble, they can be ignored, but I was wondering why they were there, so the film could use a bit of tightening, but all over it is a well-made movie that hasn't found the audience who recognized it. /> <br /> My only disappointment was that the only lesbian movie is a "heroine" villain - one is obviously straight, other sexual orientations have never been publicized. <br /> <br /> 7 stars
