You can't believe a movie that can be done in 1987, which is virtually unknown in the West. Don't repeat other comments here. The result is very good and moving. Literally, "Dawn please never come" - when it comes, the beautiful ghost and lover will remain forever. After 24 years Joel and Leslie are still great. I liked Joel Gamblers Godis and many of Leslie's films, including Better Tomorrow.
