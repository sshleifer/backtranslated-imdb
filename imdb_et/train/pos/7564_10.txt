From time to time, independent filmmakers are trying to make their film public. When I can, I watch these low-budget movies and often tell me that Hollywood's future goes to dogs. However, from time to time there is a film born of pure passion and desire, as if the film industry were to be reminded that good movies are still possible. The short film BROKEN by Alex Ferrari is a real surprise and another vision. <br /> <br /> In just a few minutes, BROKEN tries to talk about a powerful (but surreal) story almost not. back story. The audience is put down in the middle of the action without a clue what's going on. A young woman (Samantha Jane Polay) wakes up from a dream and then robs her home. When she wakes up, she is surrounded by a group of mercenaries who look like they are at home in the comic book. These nasty boys and girls are bigger than life. They are all weapons and knives. There is no way out. <br /> <br /> Kicker here is that, despite being a low budget movie, it doesn't. From the outset, it has been felt that B R O K E N has been shot, edited and produced by professionals. It would seem that Quentin Tarantino could have interfered with Wachowski's brothers during his day. The film is sharp and cool, looks good and looks great. <br /> <br /> Actress is much better than usual in these smaller films. Polay and Paul Gordon (who plays the headdress, Duncan) were well chosen. Since two of the few are talking about the film, their task is to wear the film. No special effect, no matter how good, would have saved this movie from bad deeds. Fortunately, Polay manages to convey real fear and Gordon succeeds in having a real psycho. Some smaller roles seem to be filled with fewer talented ones, but hardly show it. The downside to B R O K E N is that it is only 20 minutes long. The story ends with twilight zone twists that seem a bit busy and hardly exquisite. When I looked at it, I felt that I should have had an epifhany, but only had the feeling that it was much more common than I had hoped it would be. The film tries to be one of those riddles that leaves the audience speaking at the local cafe, but it is not satisfactory. I think it's a longer movie first 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> MY EVALUATION: 8 out of 10.
