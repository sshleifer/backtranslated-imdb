Living a Life Homeless is a funny 1978 movie (and a 2004 remake) of Dawn Of The Dead. Only this time ... between the homeless. The episode is for homeless people coming to South Park and people can't understand why they treat homeless people like zombies who want change and some parents get to the supermarket like in the movie. So it's up to boys to decide where they came from and how to get rid of them. quite a funny episode with some good moments like boys singing their version of 2pac / Dr.Dre song "California Love" .Generally a good episode. <br /> <br /> 8/10
