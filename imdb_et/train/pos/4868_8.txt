I gave this movie from 8 out of 10, reserving the last 10 for example Amadeus and 9 for Slumdog Millionaire. This film is close to the Slumog, but it is difficult to judge such a film without understanding the life, mentality and soul of the Balkan masterfully present in Kusturica. To understand this, you must be one of the Balkans. This is an amazing movie, much better and more modern than its previous films that are boring now, I think Kusturica is moving on with this film. I like humor (Balkan humor), photography is art, every scene is artistic at the border. The plot is probably a fairy tale, don't remember it now, but remember that a similar story goes to my girls.
