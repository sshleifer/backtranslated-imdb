Steve Biko was a black activist trying to resist the Belarusian government in South Africa, as Gandhi tried to counter British colonialism in India. Richard Attenborough's film Cry Freedom does not talk about Biko or Apartheid as much as it is Donald Woods, the editor of the white liberal newspaper, who threatened to try to tell Biko's story of his life. In the film, after Biko dies in jail from the "police" of South Africa, he is embarrassed. Woods, played by Kevin Kline, has to choose whether to do the right thing and escape from the country to publish books on Biko or to allow his wife Penelope Wilton to force him to forget about books. In this case, Biko dies in vain. Starting with Biko's and Woods' life-changing friendship, Biko's degeneration over the border is degenerating. Oscar nominee Denzel Washington is good only in her fourth film, Biko, but something is wrong in the film that attempts to portray the struggles of Apartheid, focusing more on white family trials on more than half of the films. Attenborough would have served his subject better by focusing on Biko's highlight, not Biko's friendly meeting. Perhaps the role of black actor in the leading role of a 2-hour film was not favorable for large offices, but the film was still a huge box. Aside from film policy, the film still leaves for entertainment and sends a message or two, although in a disinfected way with PG. *** 4 stars.
