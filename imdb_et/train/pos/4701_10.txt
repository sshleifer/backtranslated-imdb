"Roman Troy Moronie" is my comment on the movie. What else to say? <br /> <br /> This character really brings out Moroni's moor. The harsh gangster, who fails to pronounce obedient words, seems to have been frustrating to be harsh and yet able to express himself intelligently. <br /> <br /> Roman Moronie is one of the greatest morals in the history of film history. <br /> <br /> Among other characters, of course, is a great comedy. Michael Keaton is F.A.H. and so is Joe Piscipo. <br /> <br /> I like the fact that Moronie kept the rating of "R" because she couldn't pronounce.
