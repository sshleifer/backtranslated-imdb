Only two comments ... SEVEN years separately? Hardly any evidence of the relentless pull of the movie! As already mentioned, the low budget telemovie status of 13 GANTRY ROW is limited by an attenuating circumstance. However, having said that it is not without profit - either entertainment or scary outing itself. <br /> <br /> True, the most basic of the plot is the re-working of THE AMITYVILLE HORROR - just without much horror. More intrigue! Gibney could have made a more impressive impression if he had played Halifax, investigating a couple of seemingly unconnected murders with a "house" as the main suspect. The script is better than average and production is generally high. It just can't capture the viewer in particular key moments. <br /> <br /> Taking just $ 3.95 for a DVD last week in my regular video store, I can't afford to cut costs. $ 10.95 would be a reasonable price for a movie. Just don't wait for the fireworks!
