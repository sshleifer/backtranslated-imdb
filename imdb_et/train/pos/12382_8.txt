Here is a decent number of 70's horrors that reflect the gate of hell in NYC, which just happens to be an old brown. There seems to be a lot of hell gates there, but of course this unwanted model decides that she needs her boyfriend / groom space, so she just chooses one that is hidden in a nice and reasonably priced apartment. She meets several strange neighbors and even experiences a cat's birthday. At a real estate agent meeting, because he hears strange voices at the top floor at night, he finds that he and his old priest are the only tenants. Where! Then who are all these? His boyfriend (a slimy lawyer played by Chris Sarandon) is beginning to swell and finds things are not what they look like, not long. It has some decent scary scenes and a sensible idea for old people who are "sometimes" neighbors that are different from what they seem to be quite intriguing. A little decent gore and even a parade of less than usual, which makes it finally decent, and although I've seen it many times on television, the uncut DVD version is, of course, much better. Not terrible scare, maybe a good companion to "burned offers". 8 out of 10.
