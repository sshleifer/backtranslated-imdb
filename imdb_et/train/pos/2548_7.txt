Karloff and Lugosi - Together! This is one of the films that casual fans cross and tend to appreciate. It's not an all-encompassing horror film, like the previous two hits of the duo, The Black Cat and The Raven. But it is very worthy of both talents and is re-filmed with a fun movie. <br /> <br /> The director of Invisible Ray was director Lambert Hillyer, who mainly made the West, but curiously during these last days Laemmles' reign at Universalis found that he had directed it and Laemmle's ultimate horror film, daughter of Dracula. Both are sharp and clean fantasies that look at fantastic elements despite the horror of the content. <br /> <br /> Just like Lugos wandering in Raven, a lot has to be said about Karloff's Invisible Ray. One aspect of the story that is particularly unsatisfactory is that Karloff's character, Rukh, acts so badly before Radium X poisones him, that after the glow it actually changes. It's very similar to the complaint people have about Jack Nicholson in The Shining - he's basically loony right from the start. There is no real transformation. Same here. On Karloff's side, he thinks he has an extra chance of revenge. I still enjoyed my performance, just as I did at the Raven in Lugos' Gates. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Lugosi surprises you completely and gives a restrained and thoughtful turn like Rukhi's scientist, Dr. Benet. Lugos also has the best features of the film, including a memorable warning to the police trying to catch Rukh, which I have adapted to the horror film writer John Soister - "And if he (Rukh) touches anyone?" the inspector asks. Lugosi hesitates in a way that only Lugosi can offer, "They die". Just as Lugos can do, he can be more perfect than any actor. This is one of those moments. <br /> <br /> That is why Karloff and Lugos interact very well when we get Karloff's mad firing against the cool logic of Lugos. Karloff played many crazy scientists many times, but he wants Lugos to have played more straight roles like this. He had only one chance (Ninotchka). <br /> <br /> Invisible Ray is a fun movie and real for Karloff and Lugos fans. It is one of those films that improves every time you watch it, not because it is a masterpiece, but the charisma of its stars and the talent of talent and how that story complements the darker and more terrible pairs they had. The special effects that are always innovative by John Fulton are terrible and supportive participants are all sufficient. Frances Drake looks as beautiful as she did in Mad Love and plays a strong woman, rarely seen in classic horror movies. The end result, if Karloff conceals him and he doesn't shout, is one of the most haunting moments of the film. Amazing, fun movie!
