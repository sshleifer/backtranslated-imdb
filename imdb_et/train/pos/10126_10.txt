There has been much talk about Shinjuku Triad Society as the first real "Miike" movie and I thought that such a description could have been a cliché. But like all clichés, it's based on truth. All Miike brands are here, violence, black humor, homosexuality, taboo testing, and a complex central character. However, Shinjuku is one of Miike's most perfected films. He says in the interview that if he did it again, it would be different, but not necessarily better. I think what he thinks is that the film has a truly enchanting energy and a raw edge that looks so fresh that although it may be able to capture more visually or technically more sophisticated movies, it cannot reproduce or improve the cleanliness of the film change. <br /> <br /> As you may think, violence is wholly visceral, bleeding and sharp beating is complemented by a fantastic scene where a woman has a chair that smashes her face. (Only Miike's movie can get rid of this sentence.) Unlike Dead or Alive, the movie has a fantastic pace that begins and ends strongly and falls to the center. Dead or alive with similar problems, Miike is clearly concerned about the relationship between Japan and China in the postwar period, and this emotional topic is well discussed here, the central character indeed to life when you begin to understand your past. <br /> <br /> I can't sing enough to praise Shinjuk. I don't want to give too much. This is Miike before he started using CGI for animating his films and almost resembles something like Kitano Sonatine. The central characters are perfectly realized and the final twist ensures that as soon as the movie is over, it opens again to work out everything.
