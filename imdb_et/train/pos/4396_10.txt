I really enjoyed the script's gone detail. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Rhys Myers (Wrongly Written) and Jewel were prominent in their support roles. Like Jeffery Wright. Toby McGuire gave such a subtle work as ever when he had to amputate his best friend's hand knowing that he would die without a procedure. <br /> <br /> Attention to detail, guiding a good dialect to catch the southern accent amazingly well. <br /> <br /> Why this film was wiped out by Hollywood directors, I can only imagine. I have strong doubts. This makes me even more appealing. I have given ten DVD copies for gifts. <br /> <br /> A movie that is completely overlooked. Rent it or buy it and give it the perfect attention for a few hours, then judge.
