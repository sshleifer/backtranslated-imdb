When I first saw them, it became one of my favorite events. Melissa Joan's Charter is very funny and talented, so the aunts and other characters and star stars from Salem were very funny. The first season was, in my opinion, the best one where Sabrina was a teenager in high school, adapting to witchcraft. they were the most funny, the most entertaining and the most um ... good. I'm not a fan when they started introducing Brad and Dreamer because I liked Valerie. if you have to keep at least new people. I didn't like Josh because he was tw * t, I preferred Harvey, but then he disappeared. and they got rid of Libby! it would have been fantastic if your seven years had been torn. as well as Mr. Crafts when he and Zelda married what would have been gold! then Sabrina moves out of his niece and Roxie / Miles / Morgan house. I also didn't like the people who didn't like Sabrina. Sabrina seemed to lose her charm and things, and the aunts seem to have fled out of their lives and they are their fools. I stopped it for a while and the old races were back and I was like whoo-hoo! LOL. I must say that the last seasons were absolutely terrible. they got rid of the aunts that suck because they were a big part of the show. then he suddenly allows these two freeladers to go to a nice house when they treated him as dirt. and now he works in a magazine shop, so they put the stars of famous guests in the exhibitions when they are in every episode it destroys. the program really went downhill and lost its luster. I saw the last episode. it had aunts (Zelda was reduced to candle) and she was getting married, but she ran to Harvey. I would have wanted to know what happened after. Well thats my review and the only thing I can say is the only thing that left it tempting myself through seven years was the Salem cat.
