It's a funny business, watching movies. These days, when "inner emotions" and "emotional separation" are preferred against direct sentimentality, it must be difficult to remain faithful to their true feelings. <br /> <br /> Soon after the jury's duties in the 58th Berlin Hall, Yoji Yamada Kabei will be caught. <br /> <br /> After screening, I dreamed people out of the theater hall, watermarks, men, women, and reviewers. Even Berlin's director, a clearly tempered cinema viewer, admitted that he was caught unexpectedly and found that he wept three-quarters of the way into this shamelessly sentimental experience. came after. Despite the motionless motion of the film, many reviewers decided to be soft and emotionally non-binding in their writing. Apparently, after crying, they had set their "limit of thinking", and consequently they missed what I felt as a Kabei genius. <br /> <br /> Let me explain. <br /> <br /> Before the war in Japan, Kabei's story is turned around a writer's family and their destiny after being imprisoned for what was described as "thought crimes" against the Imperial will. Through several protracted emotional scenes, Yamada gets to know a man, his loyal husband and two daughters, as well as three side signs: a man's pretty young sister, a worshiping former student, and an uncle? ? everyone comes to help the family with their situation, in the absence of a house. <br /> <br /> The story moves slowly, albeit at a steady pace, and heartbeats occur at times that everyone can predict. This, of course, makes the dramatic event too emotionally disturbed for the audience almost impossible. <br /> <br /> In other words, while you learn to love the family and their helpers and feel their regret, the situation is proven so that the certainty of the plot you expect for a certain end is certain. <br /> <br /> But two hours on the film (don't worry, Yamada offers enough moments for the viewer to grasp the gravity and lightness that you have to drag you), she will hit you with what I can only describe as a "sting". All you assumed is what the story was - an innocent man who had taken his faithful husband and daughter? suddenly one of the family helpers. Someone you have taken for granted is now being thrown into an unexpected fate. <br /> <br /> Something happened here, where I was. Everyone started scaring or not at all. <Br /> <br /> "My Word!" I muttered into my breath. Then it struck that "Kabei" was ultimately more than a film about the family broken by the empire on the brink of war. In fact, it was a cunning study of one common human cannon: how little we care about the secret knowledge of our close people. <br /> <br /> Now the most common film criticism was that it was technically sound, but there was no innovation. This happens when reviewers put their proverbial thinking cap on, I think. With Kabei, I believe that Yoji Yamada knew exactly what trick he was going to employ to touch one unique aspect of humanity. An evil old trick he used so smoothly in the Tora-san series and later in Tasogare Sebei. <br /> <br /> After being hit by the audience as a kind of narrative comfort zone, he throws us in the field of emotions rarely investigated. <br /> <br /> This is the most effective cinema tool for me. One that avoids detection but affects you deeply. And the proof of its effectiveness was a thousand wet Kleenex pieces that were just thrown in the trash next to this thousand-seat cinema hall. <br /> <br /> Now that only a few reviewers would be against them so smart they forget what the cinema really is. Human emotions. Clean and simple.
