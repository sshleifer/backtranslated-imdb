German special television is Dutch and ?? of course? US formats. Well, for Edel & Starck, xeroxing went as far as the basics: Screwball. <br /> <br /> You can't stand the comedy of a screwball? Don't look at Edel & Starcki. Seriously. If you expect another lawyer drama that resembles Law & Order or something, go elsewhere. (Or look at Law & Order, as it is quite brilliant, if it is, but I ground.) E&S is funny, often thought-provoking, funny, romantic, funny, funny and witty. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I am quite sorry that the writers did not get better deals after the series finals. And my cynical nature must re-regulate: German private television productions. German people understand what I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> In short, look at it. I don't have the blur that English synchronization has, but hey, it's worth learning German to watch these four seasons. Comes with a pseudo-happy ending.
