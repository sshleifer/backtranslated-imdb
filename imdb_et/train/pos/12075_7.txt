Nina Foch emphasizes that "My name is Julia Ross" in this 1945 movie Noir, who also plays Dame May Witty and George Macready. It's short and because it is, the film suffers. It could have been 15 minutes to half an hour longer. <br /> <br /> When I grew up, Foch was a husband on a television playing a neurotic woman with a cheating spouse, a nervous wreck. He became one of the great actors in Los Angeles. Here he is a pretty young person who plays the role of a title. Julia responds to the ad addressed to the secretary and has been hired right now by Mrs Hughes and her son Ralph. Little is he aware - though we are learning right now - that the employment agency is ahead of what is designed to be the right woman for this task, a woman who does not have a family and is not a boyfriend. <br /> <br /> This is a lively situation; when he goes to the house of Julia, he is stunned and when he wakes up, he said he is Mrs Hughes and she is not allowed to leave. <br /> <br /> Actress is very good. Low budget, but still fun - some things, especially at the end, happen too fast, so I said the film is too short. However, I recommend it.
