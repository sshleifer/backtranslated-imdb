This work is a bold look at the mindset of men in wheelchairs. This film never tries to tint the cotton candies or soft casings that these boys live in. I think this is its strength. But more is that the performances are fantastic, well thought out and communicated with a dialogue that draws you in and makes you feel part of this experience. The characters will never try to listen to the audience about the ignorance in their hearts that is in their hearts. <br /> <br /> I found it tiring, but enjoyable. <br /> <br /> This price is 6.6 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
