Lost is one of a kind ... its so enchanting and tense, the excitement and emotions all at the same time. I've never seen any such TV series. It is full of jungle excitement and has a good scenario. The actor has a sense of life on the island in such a natural way that I feel myself lost on the island. This is a great job that has been told in a very intelligent form. The series is like a movie that depicts the life of a landed island of lost survivors. I am tempted to look at another episode and I recommend this series to all lovers of TV shows.
