King Solomon's mines bring us Patrick Swayze (playing Allan Quatermain) who spent a lot of time in Africa, but decides it's time to return to England and be his son's father. She thinks that her husband's parents have taken care of their son and that he has very little chance of getting a lot of money for his custody. Alison Deedy (playing Elizabeth), whose father is in Africa and kept by the African tribe for the ransom, was brought in by Elizabeth's father. Elizabeth is looking for Quatermain to return to Africa to find her father. <br /> <br /> There are good signs that go with Quatermain and Elizabeth, and of course there are some enemies (Russians) who want a map. <br /> <br /> Film keeps your attention until the end. Patrick is once again playing a harshly beautiful, respectable man who comes to rescue a man in need. Patrick is a great dramatic actor who can easily portray passion, loss and despair, a tough silent good man, anger and power; In King Solomon's mind, his character smiles a few times. I would really like to see Patrick Swayze again having a relaxed love story where she doesn't have to grab her jaws and be so strong. Maybe a little dance would help. But it's a good movie for the whole family and it's worth watching this time.
