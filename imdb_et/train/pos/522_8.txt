A wonderful film by Powell and Pressburger. The film is about what we perceive as real and what is real, and how the two are very different from each other. Beautifully shot and acted, although David Niven does not seem to be 27 years old as his character claims. Have fun seeing very young Richard Attenborough. This movie made me think when I watched it and later.
