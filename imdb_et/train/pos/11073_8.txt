I've never known the film ever to create such a debate in my life. Believe me when I say that this movie is finally remembered as a classic of all time. I had been waiting for this movie because I had previously loved Lock, Stock .... and Snatch, but after some negative comments I thought I would be very disappointed. I loved this movie absolutely and I can't wait to see it again. This movie is completely different from both of the above mentioned Ritchie movies and also much better. I have a choice of my favorite leaders, but none of them pulls as much as Guy Ritchie has done with this movie. I believe he has taken the film to a different level (I know most people laugh with this commentary, responding to this film, but I believe time proves me right). This movie is very confusing and lasts much longer than 2 hours or more because I couldn't think about it or put things together. I am now quite good to take everything that happens in this movie (some answers from endless thinking time, some answers from reading other people's movie) and now can't wait until Sunday when I see it again. I hope people will go to the cinema openly and they will hopefully be rewarded because I and many others have been.
