This film speaks of universal language; it can be associated with yourself, the community, society or the wider world. It has the opportunity not only to open up a number of issues, but also to set it up to identify and ask the right questions to reach a point of conviction or property. The portrayal of the stereotypes of films is about the archetypes around us, which must be recognized as a repetitive cycle of destruction, a contradictory force of innovation, creativity and growth. The circumstances that disturb the natural flow of things must be made clear and dealt with. The idea is definitely a movie that you must experience and not only look at because it concerns your inner voice / conscience through review, it does one hour, not just look.
