For a low budget project, the film was successful. The story is interesting and the actors were convincing. Eva Longoria, who now stands for the TV show "Dragnet", is sexier than ever. The locations were ideal for the ganstri plot and the director shows his talent by taking a number of roles for his project. Of course, this low budget movie can use better editing transitions and more special effects on weapon scenes, but music keeps it moving by scripting. Although this film has some problems, such as consistency, I have to say that I rent the director's next movie. As a student of your movie, you can learn some of the director's commentary.
