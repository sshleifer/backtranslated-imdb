This movie frightened me out! I have to admit that I spent most of the movie watching my finger, but what I saw was really scary. I screamed loudly two or three times at the show. <br /> <br /> In terms of film making, my favorite aspects were sound and photography. The sound was particularly high and the device was really horrible. I read somewhere that this is a weird wife and wife team. For some reason it even makes me a stranger. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy jumping movies and jittery movies, this is for you! A very stubborn and wonderful movie to rent with friends who love watching movies that have emerged on the couch like little girls!
