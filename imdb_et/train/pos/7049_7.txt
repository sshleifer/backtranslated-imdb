In the commercialization of war and the "light-hearted" satire, John Cusack Brand Hauser, who has been sent to Turaqistan as an assassin, plays Omar Sharif, who does some oil activities that bless the former vice president. US own company. In addition, Hauser must falsify his fake position as a trade fairist, wedding princess Yonica (Hillary Duff) and a funny liberal journalist Natalie (Marisa Tomei). <br /> <br /> Technical Aspects: <br /> <br /> - Functioning (at least for the main characters) was good as expected. Some of John Cusack's dialogues were obviously not written to him because he often felt uncomfortable. . . perhaps the unreal is more accurate. Joan gave a great and often fun show. Marisa Tomei, though I have never been her big fan, was more than fit for the role and worked well. However, Hillary Duff was quite terrible. They needed an attractive Middle East (or Russian or what this accent should be) pop-star. Unfortunately, they went three times with three. <br /> <br /> - As I said before, writing seemed to be a bit stiff and inappropriate in points, especially in John Cusack's dialogue. Not much of that, of reason, but of some. The story also became a bit of a ridiculous point, a nice point for satire, but it took it to a whole new level. Luckily, Cusacks and Tome keep their relatively cool, calm behavior, which makes the film a crazy and smooth film, gradually and gradually. <br /> <br /> - Joshua Seftel, who previously had a real credit drought in his name, made a fairly wide spectrum of film. He handled a small ($ 10 million) budget very well, stretching it to seem much more. Seftel also managed to mix the story with humor. . . with the painful and difficult to follow parts of the real war (including the killing of civilians, etc.). <br /> <br /> - In the general satire, its exaggerated look at the commercialization of war. very well done, especially Golden Palace Poker ads in US tanks. It gets a little too much at the points, but in the end it still shows exactly what it fits for the young Mel Brooks. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is very well done for a small budget and it is definitely worth it. It doesn't go to one big cinema satire, but it is definitely not the worst. <br /> <br /> 7/10
