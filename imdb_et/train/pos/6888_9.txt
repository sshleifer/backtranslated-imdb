I watch movies to live by choosing good enough to distribute them ... Sneaking aside, which doesn't make a cut. I'm not saying I know more than anyone on this basis, I'm just directing you to how I came to look at "Lou's Gospel" ... Anyway ... So many bad movies on my desk and I actually sit through all of them. I actually don't "do everything" everything, usually watching television from time to time when I work on production value, performance, and performance. If something catches my eye, I'll look at that time. "Lou" pulled me in the first few minutes, where I shut down my laptop and rolled my chair on the TV so I can turn it on completely. Needless to say, I was amazed at the whole movie. The story is well spoken, the characters are either loving or reluctant (of course, depending on the actor's and director's intention to be a character) and everything is very well played. Occasionally, I occasionally tried to make amateur mistakes while working and editing the camera, but the emotional nature of the story makes these mistakes easy to dismiss. I have heard that other people's comments say that the film sometimes brought eyes to the eye, the other extreme extreme elation ... I smiled for a minute and screamed for the next and touched the film very much. Unfortunately, I couldn't get it because I was - as the saying goes - late in the week and the dollar short. So this sometimes happens ... but at least I had the pleasure of seeing it and I can't wait to see what the answer is. Happiness and great happiness to you Bret Carr (if you read it), you are undoubtedly the talent to watch.
