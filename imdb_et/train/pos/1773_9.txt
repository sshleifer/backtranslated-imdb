Obstacles seem to be one of those series that has disappeared in the timing. After its transmission in the early 80s and after one repetition, it has been imitated. It's crying shameful. <br /> <br /> I was looking at it initially when it was broadcast in the South TV area on Sunday afternoon and was a classic way to watch the road. Although I don't remember much about the program, some things are in my mind. The most remarkable were the unforgettable titles. Mourning flute music, accompanied by an escape attempt from the eastern border of Europe and the ensuing car accident (and this scene has left me with the love of the fintail Mercedes for Merc 200). Although it was not obvious at first, the solution to the series mystery was in these titles. <br /> <br /> A plot where a young musical student tries to let go of what really happened when he discovered he was accepted. many turns, but the barriers were surprisingly "adult" children's drama. Benedict Taylor was great as Billy and it was a shame that he didn't do much more. <br /> <br /> It was a high-quality drama, late for a DVD release, and I hope to get the chance to see it again in the future. <br /> <br /> A pleasant memory of my childhood
