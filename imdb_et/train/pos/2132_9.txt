The cast really helps to make it a pleasant surprise and a traditional man-vs-woman-arg-all-the-time-in-love up-in-love-type Hollywood screwball romance / comedy. <br /> I don't usually go for these movies and it's a tiring story, but it was refreshing, fun to watch and gently fool around. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play well for each one and make a very nice pair. A supportive mold is prominent - always from Felix Bressart to the Joseph Schildkraut. <br /> <br /> Frank Morgan also plays one of the most interesting characters I've ever seen during his career. She takes the film and turns it into a completely different mood for a while, if something dramatic happens to her. This "twisting" is another reason why the film comes from other peculiarities. <br /> <br /> Once again, a movie with a good combination of categories will usually succeed. This is an excellent example of this. In this movie, it is romance, comedy and drama, and it's well done. I'll take it over any day again "You've got us,". No comparison.
