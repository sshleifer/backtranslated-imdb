In the early 1970s, many of us who had heartily accepted the hippie / acid / alternative culture understood that the general society did not change as we thought. For me, this movie "now what?" that many people I knew knew at that time. Are we driving the community and creating our vision of utopia or are we radicalizing and striving for change? <br /> <br /> From unnecessary gestures to the police, to radical rhetoric, to Pink Floyd's music, to love - to the desert and to explosive images - so much is there. This takes good account of the important moment.
