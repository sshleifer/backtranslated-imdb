"Happenstance" is the most New York feeling of the Paris movie I've seen since "When a cat contest (Chacun cherche son conversation)." <br /> <br /> Last year's film released for attention Audrey Tatou has become "Amelie", this French title is more suitable: "Le Battement d'ailes du papillon" (like butterfly wings) a summary of our life-controlling element. <br /> <br /> Tatou's nervousness here is less disturbing because he only flashes from time to time that the dazzling smile is with his unfortunate adventures, and because he is part of a big, ethnic band, so big he needed a lot of characters , especially when some cute boys and older women saw me in the same way and some characters imagine what they should do so I wasn't sure if they did it or not. <br /> <br /> But I loved the way immigrants from the city love the nests to get over the crowded subway around cafes. <br /> <br /> Subtitles gave both parts of the dialogue a bit annoying once. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 12/8/2001)
