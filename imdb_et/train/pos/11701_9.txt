It's a great movie for all generations. Another world in 1972 in America was compared to our psychotic 21st century. You can understand what America's 1972 went like watching this movie. I found that clothing and car styles brought me nice memories of a much better country than we currently have. Just think ... there were only 4 or 5 TV channels. AIDS, Muslim Terrorists, Road Rage, 911, Bird Flu, Freeway Snipers, and others. 7 years before Star Wars arrives. The personal computer and internet would still be 29 years. <br /> <br /> When this movie came out for the first time, the producers had to market the film themselves, as no other film company wanted it. So he started to travel around small Protestant churches throughout the country, which was shown on film projectors (of course, before the VCRS). A church pastor interested in showing Avar to his church would send a copy of the film. Then he set up the evening to show it in the church meeting room or in the dining hall. The members of the church would invite "unsaved" friends and family members, and that would be a social event of the week. <br /> <br /> If you can bypass the limited product values ​​of the movie and just look at its nostalgic value, I think you'll enjoy the movie more. Of course I speak as a beginner. <br /> <br /> If I had a time machine, I'd like to go back to 1972 and say goodbye to the 21st century ferry we have today.
