"The Cross Eyed" by Adam Jones promotes the viewer in a ride as the protagonist takes control of the wheel and sets his life on a regular basis. Adam Jones has found an imaginative and refreshing way of giving and characterizing his character. These truths become apparent both in characters and in viewers when you laugh and gag those credits. Simple but attractive settings will carry you on what you see next. You can't help but smile and laugh at the antics on this movie. I can't wait for my other party's endeavor. It's just a matter of time before Jones strikes again. Bravo!
