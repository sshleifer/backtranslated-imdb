This is one of my favorite Govinda films of all time and the best of 1994. David Dhawan is doing an excellent job of managing this movie, making it funny and adding family drama. Govinda is great as Raja Babu and gives an excellent result. Karishma Kapoor is an actor I hate, this film is a little less annoying, but it is still irritating in some scenes. Kader Khan is maestro acting and still provides excellent performance. Aroona Irani is a great mother and provides excellent performance. Shakti Kapoor is great as a Nandu sidekick. This film has comedy, action, family drama and romance for the entertainer.
