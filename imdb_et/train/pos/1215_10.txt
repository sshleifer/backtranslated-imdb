This is my favorite that the three care media wear. I liked all the songs again. The bigger problem, as most people have pointed out, was that this story was against the original. For those who saw the first movie, the bears remembered their "cousin" whom they probably didn't know. It wasn't, of course, the end that the cousins ​​got their abdominal symbols after they proved how much they care. In this story, however, the cousins ​​grow with the care warts and have the abdominal symbols all the time. That means it's not a bad movie as long as you separate it from the first. I thought Darkheart's character was much worse then the first Nicholas. At the same time, however, I felt that it would add some balance to the sweetness of the care arms. I also liked our caregiver, although I know that other people felt different feelings about this scene. And of course I loved those songs. My favorites are growing and Forever Young. Care always carries such good songs. Ten stars for a great movie.
