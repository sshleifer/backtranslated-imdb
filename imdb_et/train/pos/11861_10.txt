This movie is very fun and is never boring even for almost 3 hours. Al Pacino, Michelle Phieffer and the rest are big and very credible in the film. Violence was a little extreme in the film, but then it showed how drug trafficking was during the film. The end is amazing and is probably one of the coolest scenes. Great movie and probably you enjoy it.
