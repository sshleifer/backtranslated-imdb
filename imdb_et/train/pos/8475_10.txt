This is a fantasy film for children based on the Boggy Creek Legend, although I don't know why they called it. Back to Boggy Creek as if it were a sequel. This film is not related to the documentary and its fantasy. Dawn Wells is the mother of 3 children who disappear around Boggy Creek with 2 other men, and the monster comes to help. Yes, it is very silly and the plot is a runny nose, but such a film is perfect for an 8-12-year-old group he was targeting. It's a harmless G-rated Kiddie fare and at least you don't have to worry if you leave your children alone when they watch it. Strictly 8â€“12-year-olds get older children and think it's flat.
