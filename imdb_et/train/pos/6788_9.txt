The story and characters were some of the best I've ever seen. the graphics were good for PS and the cut scenes and voice transmissions were amazing. I won the game at least 3 times and loved every second. I felt that the problems the protagonist stood were believable and realistic, and I believe it deserves to be followed. or at least remake. If they redesigned it for the PS3, I would buy this system for this game and maybe mgs4 for its amazing idea and execution of the dragoon system is enough to justify renting and interception of this ad, although sometimes it is cheated (silly buster wand) add-on system and plot makes this game fix.
