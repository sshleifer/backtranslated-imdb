Again, I was browsing for a discount on the video line and found this movie for $ 4.88. Fifty percent of the time I found the movies in the bin is clean (I believe it's terrible), but half the time they turn out to be surprisingly good. This movie is much better than I expected. I found it to be very interesting, although it was obviously done with an amateur. <br /> <br /> The direction is nothing special, but the story is interesting with some good excitement. I was expecting it to be more comedy, but I wasn't too disappointed. <br /> <br /> For thriller, this movie is surprisingly good. There is no bloody violence, no fear, no nudity, no sex. Usually these films need all four elements. The PG rating is well deserved - it doesn't like "sixteen candles" where the word "f" is used twice and there is a short free free scene. <br /> <br /> I just wish for romance with Corey Haim and her love for love could be more advanced. The film tends to be a primer-heavy and potentially good base plates are pushed aside. Instead of developing between these two chemistry, let's look at their careless three-minute assembly in their romantic endeavors. Finally, they can kiss, but there is so little chemistry that it seems to be forced. "Dream Machine" is not a pearl, but it is good, clean entertainment. It is quite unforgettable - especially in the case of unknown pain, except for Haim, but it is much better than you would expect. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
