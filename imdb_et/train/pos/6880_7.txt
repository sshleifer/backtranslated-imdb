You know what they're saying about the 70s ... if you remember them, you weren't there. One of the few things I remember about the 70s was the first social satire of hippie and hip, which was viewed from the "underground" or counterculture. Groove Tube. If humor seems faded or meaningless for some viewers, it can only be because a lot has happened over the last 30 years and comedy is no longer fresh ... but hey! When this movie came out, it was the first ... and some of these skits were made for the first time ... when Nixon was in office, he was robbed of the Vietnam War, the sexual revolution was in full swing. and J.Edgar Hoover was still responsible for the FBI. This is a film made before breaking Watergate and as such was one of the first to take a big pull in the company to entertain it and hippies at the same time. And to be honest, some sketches are still funny. If you liked Cheech and Chong "Up In Smoke" .. you love this movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to know what the 70s really liked ... check out Groove Tube. The Oscar winning "Network" in about the same year and believing it was like his wildlife watching on television, then digging Groove Tube, which comes up from the subject, but plays from a viewing angle. young viewers who turned off the television with other entertainment ... Ozzie & Harriet had grown up "Leave it to Beaver", Dad knows best, My three sons ... happy days ... so imagine our contempt than those of us, who experimented with a new lifestyle could see their box view from our point of view! The Uranus Corporation's ads alone are invaluable. <br /> <br /> If you liked Kentucky Fried Movie, you will love this movie. And if you ever wondered why your strange uncle Harold is still looking back at his college day, this would be the perfect movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Take it for what it is ... a memory of times ... and a small movie that will help us all who forget about the 70's to remember them again.
