This is a stage that is adapted to the screen. 95% of the movie takes place at the proud home of the playwright Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine). He is the author of the amazingly successful Broadway game, but his last four efforts have floped - terribly. <br /> <br /> An aspiring playwright, Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve), who participated in a Sydney-based gaming team. has sent him a copy of the game he wrote. Sydney tells his wife, Myra (Dyan Cannon), that the game is fabulous - a sure fire. But is it good enough to die? Time says. <br /> <br /> Intelligent dialogue and numerous twisted plots keep it at the end of the movie from start to finish. It looks like all the time is good. It resembles some other fun Michael Caine's secret: Sleuth. Worth a look. <br /> <br />
