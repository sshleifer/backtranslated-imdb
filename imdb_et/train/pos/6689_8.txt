As a comic book reader who still looks with the heart among the child, I admit that I can be slightly biased towards this film. I mean, it hasn't been a good superhero movie for some time (NOTE: Batman Forever was not a good superhero movie). I really wanted this movie to be good, and unlike most of my last movie shows (read Blair's witch project) I wasn't disappointed. <br /> <br /> The men of the mystery were certainly not big, the tension filled with action, it was comedy. On this basis, it was a success. It was a small theater for everyone, laughing and applauding and laughing through the final scene. Stiller and Garofolo are always fun, as always, and Azaria just adds the right madness. William H. Macy plays a big straight man, while Kel Mitchell and Paul Rubens, who work with thumb, are just added to make the kids happy. <br /> <br /> Although the kits are strange (and at times the ripofees are both Batman and Blade Runner) and some jokes are obvious, it's still just funny. There are a few lines that are trying to get even the most worshiped viewer and bring our stomach with a smile. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie. Although not a classic of all time, it's twice as funny as the newest Austin Powers. Writing is good and cast is great. If you're worried, plan on matine and pay less, but in either case you will be pleasantly surprised. I mean, who doesn't lose losers from time to time among us?
