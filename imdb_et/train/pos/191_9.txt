If he had had his drutre on Marion Davies and he didn't just listen to William Randolph Hearstit, he would have made more movies like Show People and much happier. In fact, if you see that he gets his first big break on two reels in comedy, he would have loved doing it instead of his epic such as Knighthood Was In Flower and Janice Meredith. <br /> <br /> What you see on all Show People accounts is real Davies, a talented comedienne, a great mimic and a generous good-hearted person. He could really identify the character of Peggy Pepper or Patricia Prepoire, he made his contribution to his Hollywood stardom. <br /> <br /> When the Show People plot is set to a legitimate stage that you would call it a backstage story. I think this is one of the first films that you can name behind this camera story. Marion is an avid young person who arrives in Hollywood like many others, looking for this great break. He wants drama, but his introduction to films is like a foil of comic books by burlesque. He gets his share of a pie and a seltzer from his face but learns his trade. And the heart of the young comic artist William Haines also wins. <br /> <br /> He does not get his first big break, but it doesn't come to Haines, and Marion is playing a legitimate drama actor Paul Rally playing Andre Telfair to pretend he's not Avignon's count. Someone here shot actresses Lou Tellegen, Sarah Bernhardt and Geraldine Farrari and other lovers and spouses, and hear it, one of the most despised people in the cinema. <br /> <br /> Show people was one of the first films to have adult stars like stars. You see people like Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, Mae Murray, John Gilbert, Eleanor Boardman, etc., being in the film colony and its surroundings. This in itself makes Exhibition People a movie that is worth saving. You'd be surprised, California, here I came. As the film came out on the surface of the sound, this song was introduced to Crossroads. It's not a bad number, but no credit is given to a boy and a girl who sings this song. I don't think it was necessary, because I don't see them. I would like to know more and I am sure you would like to be happy to see People. <br /> <br /> It's easy to understand why Marion Davies liked this movie and considered it a personal favorite. He sees this film at home and the lack of his real life pretends to be his way of making it a real treat for the audience.
