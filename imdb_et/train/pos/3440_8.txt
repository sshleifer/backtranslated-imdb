Love Rosario Dawson, I think he is one of the best actors in the modern era. <br /> <br /> Descent seems to be more about empowerment than anything else. It is a consistent undertone of the film. The dialogue is flat, the characters seemingly intentional and unilateral. The only continuity is the representation of self-powers in the characters and the Rosario's journey from self-empowerment to the loss of power and back. <br /> <br /> It is not appropriate to endorse this as a rape classic, and this is probably the reason why many people don't enjoy the movie. A standard "rape" audience wouldn't like this movie especially and maybe that's the point? The film asks more questions than it answers, and it faces this target group, whether they like it or not. There are compelling relationships between the characters and the target group, and although the film does not allow viewers to perceive themselves with righteous audacity, it involves the wrong viewer of what may or may not be. <Br>> <br /> Descent is a good film that IMHO has been seriously appreciated.
