Of course it was well shot and done, very well shot and done! But the story was just so weak. And Lincoln's depiction was even weaker. Not that Henry Fonda was not good, but the character he played was nothing but a creature. Do you want to tell me that Lincoln was a smart wolf without respect for law or court. I mean, who the hell was he supposed to be? Cousin Vinnie? I mean the fire, "I'll call you Jackass, then" ???? I understand that Ford went to a big funny hero guy, but I didn't know that guy at all. He cheats in sport, talks like a real sweet simpleton and doesn't seem to be sitting in the courtroom. How should I take it seriously. <br /> <br /> Twist was even weaker. I mean come! It was just stupid. The whole story seemed like a 5-year-old wondering in his dreams. I said I liked it, it was a lot of fun and made me laugh several times so I can't say it's a bad movie. In fact, I have to say that I have to say that it is good enough, something that attracts me and makes me laugh, may be bad, but this lively and stupid story was just so ridiculous that I do not understand how anyone could make it big be kept. > <br /> I have no idea how this movie was historically accurate, but if anyone were true, I really have to shake my head.
