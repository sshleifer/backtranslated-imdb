That's Neil Simon's job that got a lot of praise! An "odd couple" is a unique pearl that is inside. You have Felix Ungar (Jack Lemmon); a hypochondriac, a fake pure freak and a large back on the side of his roommate Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau); the whole slob. These men have great jobs. Felix is ​​a news writer and Oscar is a sports writer. Both men are divorced, Felix's husband is close, while Oscar is on the other side of the US (West Coast). What are you saying? Two men living on one roof without riding with each other are also impossible and unlikely. It's a whole series of laughs and lots of fun. I liked the part where the two British neighbors who both speak to gentlemen and after Oscar Felix kicking out, will be happy and live with them when he refused to have dinner with dinner. It's time for Felix to be made easier. I think everything clean-freaks are easier. They may be cunning, but they should also be patient. Very fun movie and nuevo classic. Neil Simon's "The Odd Couple" is a classic film. 5 Stars!
