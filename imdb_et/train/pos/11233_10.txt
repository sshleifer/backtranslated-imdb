I consider myself a fan of Hidden Frontier # 1, seeing that I am somewhat of a small group of fans who have actually come across most of these men - of course, no conventions are read. I've been looking at Hidden Frontier since 2001 and I have to say I still have the impression that these guys have brought out. <br /> <br /> The hidden border is Rob Caves and the spiritual spirit of his own studio. Areakt Pictures, which works from the back room of your house. Although not as "fancy" as the TOS-based New Voyages series (which sometimes gets some of the original series actors / writers like Walter Koenig, aka Chekov), Rob and HF's team manage to create a series that deserves this spiritual experiment, we called "Enterprise". The most controversial and successful story has been the introduction of Star Trek's first publicly homosexual character, Corey Aster (introduced during the second season), and his search for a soul-spirit. Somewhere later in the series, Excelsior will meet Jorian Zen, a Triller. In recent story lines with these two characters (WARNING: MAJOR SPOILER! Don't read if you haven't watched this series so far!), Be merged with the Zen expelled symbol, causing many changes and conflicts with his relationship with Aster. Although the future is uncertain - the last episode, "Beachhead," was recently shown to HF fans in the chat room - I think this relationship will last, but only time will tell. <br /> <br /> Gene Roddenberry has created Star Trek to make the story more of her characters than of the twilight space battles. For the same reason, Rob Caves created a hidden border, and that's what has made this series as popular as it is. As stated in the previous note, I would like to give it an estimate of more than 10, but it must be sufficient. Although the next building of Star Trek's next season is the last building of the seven seasons, I am ready to contribute a lot to the hidden borders after this last episode.
