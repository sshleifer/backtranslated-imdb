Diane Keaton gave it a rather sad but funny story that included quite a few young people and their deep dark secrets. Diane Keaton, (Natalie), "Family Stone", 05, who had the only daughter and loved her outside words, can be described. She always called her and told her: "Surrender Dorothy", which was the expression "Oz Wizard", 1939. Sudden car accident and Natalie are deeply involved with her daughter's friends and lovers. As Natalie examines, the more she knew and her true relationship with her daughter. A great movie to watch and enjoy, especially all supporting actors.
