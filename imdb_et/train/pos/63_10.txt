This movie is so misunderstood that it's not even funny. If you think you see it as shooting, stay clear. It deals with the consequences and trauma that survivors have to endure. Even detectives are looking for the answer we all do ... WHY? The fantastic behavior of the two leading women can see how those we ignore are affected by the same things that we have influenced. Yes, the language is sometimes tough, but it also fits well with characters. There are some loose ends left or unanswered, but all the movies have them. The main issues are dealt with and this film makes an important statement as to how all of us adults feel after such major incidents. Highly recommended for teens and adults.
