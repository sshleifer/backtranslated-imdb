Carmen is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's hard to say who's the best: Antonio Gades, Cristina Hoyos and Laura del Sol are great. They dance out of their breath. It is a beautiful story about the inseparability of life and myth; Myth invades everyday life. Dance becomes life and all life is danced. Real people living at the same time live their lives and become someone else, parts of old lovers behave. Magic continues.
