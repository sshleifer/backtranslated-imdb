It's perfect for a family look. We are collecting the TV to watch it on BBC America. This is an up-to-date version of Robin Hood and it invites both children and adults. Our teenager and tween ager enjoy sitting with both mother and father and watching Robin's next absence. We can't wait for the next episode every week and are happy to see "On Demand" for free. <br /> <br /> The wardrobe is the way it is. Every story is moral. This is fun. Violence is neither universal nor unnecessary. The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic when John William knows it. This is the story of the old world that is revived with the flair of the new world. <br /> <br /> Television has so much garbage that the brain's rotting "reality" TV is meaningless violence. You should do it for what it is and what has been updated with "Robin Hood", which shouldn't be compared to Errol Flynn's movie. It's a pearl that everyone enjoys. Parents who are concerned that children are watching too much violence enjoy Robin's loss of taste of war and bloodshed. He is Robin Hood, who rather tries to leave his departure than to fight. Maid Marian is also an attractive model for young girls. Instead of standing and doing nothing, he takes his role in helping the poor, being a "night watchman". The sheriff of Nottingham is delicately over the top evil as the Sheriff should be and looks like a cross between Billy Joel and Tim Curry. Guy Gisborne plays a very beautiful actor who wants most women not to have a bad "Guy" role. <br /> <br /> The only question we have is "Where is Friar Tuck?"
