Midnight Cowboy is not for everyone. It's raw, painful and realistic, but very fun. Leading actors, Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman, who are winning the Oscar winners, give amazing performances. Voice like Texas hustler, Joe Buck, who travels from a small town in Texas to New York to become a hustler. He does not apologize for his chosen profession, but it is not so easy. New York women like the rich lady played by Georgeann Johnson and Cass, played by Oscar nominated Sylvia Miles, are different from Texas women. Unfortunately, Buck is trying to escape his past from Texas. He raised his grandmother Sally Buck, who played a wonderful actor Ruth White, who died of cancer in 1969. The places in New York are wonderful to see, as is the relationship between Fatso and Hoffman. Men try to survive New York life if they don't play the rules like real work. When the film evolves, Buck's past comes to the surface and it's haunting, but not clear. The film is not meant for children, but Midnight Cowboy may be more about it than today's movies and television shows. I will not forget the young Brenda Vaccar and the party you will not forget. It is also a tear of the movie, so also put your clothes out.
