It was fortunate to be an extra in this great movie and loved every moment of filming. I went to the Prime Minister of London and talked to Phil, Peter, Martin and Joni like my wife. Then a few weeks later, the cinema went with our bike club members. What a great movie, it deserves to be there with all the big biker movies. Now we have DVD Sue my wife can't get enough of it and kids can't. Take the club a little, who seems to think I'm now a movie star. I think they're just jealous. The only downside to the first part of the movie was the weather, rain, rain and more rain, but we were in Wales. Hopefully, follow-up will take place to keep me in Jon's. Danny Beck
