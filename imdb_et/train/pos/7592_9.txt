You just stopped watching the movie and wanted to give your film your opinion (and justice). <br /> <br /> First of all, to make things straight, this movie doesn't look like a solid action comedy movie. Its purpose is not to revolutionize the film industry and to collect critical accolades and not to be seen as one. If you really want to fully enjoy this movie, I suggest you throw your critical mind and longing for it because you can't find anything here. Once it's created, let us go ahead in the movie. <br /> <br /> I had little expectations for this movie just because it didn't have a strong plot (yes, video players, I also underestimated this movie), but I never expected to enjoy this movie so much. I enjoyed it even more than Stephen Chow's flicks (which I think Kung Fu Hustle is his best effort and would have rated it as 9). Action is tight and epic, while comedy inspires the right place. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS warns, I think action may be unrealistic, but why would I want to watch a serious basketball movie? There are many other sports movies (drama) that already did well, why create another? End of SPOILERS <br /> <br /> I'm not sure why you're reading it. Go ahead and see it. Remember, don't think - just look, enjoy, smile, laugh and <br /> <br /> Every time they (film industry) create masterpieces like Pulp Fiction or The Godfather movies, and sometimes they create movies that are the landfill is better. I'm not saying that Kung Fu Dunk is worthy of the previous examples, then again, when we talk about Stephen Chow-ish comedy, it's ten. <br /> <br /> Very recommended if you love: - No brainstorming with very good action -Kung Fu -Death Trance -Kung Fu and comedy - what the hell look at. You have a great time. <br /> <br /> 9/10 Cast on Kung Fu Dunk. ^ _ ^
