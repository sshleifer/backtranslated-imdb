What was there in 1939, which helped produce so many great Hollywood films? Well, whatever it is, it can also be found in Columbia's picture. It's a long forgotten screw comedy that Turner's classic movies have started to show. (The Maltini movie book does not include it.) In almost all departments, Amazing Mr. Williams Jewelry. <br /> <br /> This is a story of a first-class police detective who will never be able to marry his time. As the wedding watches begin to ride, he is called to the scene of the murder. This lady needs to learn hard not only to enjoy the activities of criminals but to belong to the police forces. There's a lot of laugh in the process. <br /> <br /> Melvyn Douglas once again proved he had little companions with a light comedy. Joan Blondell was at the top of his career and joy. Edward Brophy and Donald McBride are fun. <br /> <br /> The film goes a little too long, but who cares? Scooter comedies are always able to entertain and this film is the best part of it.
