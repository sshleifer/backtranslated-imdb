This with "Hare Tonic" is one of the best Bugs cartoons, which is indeed one of the best mistakes. There are some comments on how Bugs are "basic" in these cartoons, which means I think he's not yet fully developed. I prefer this "basic" version of the mid-40s (Chuck Jones was the best version), which is actually more rabbit-sized and much more entertaining than possible, a long-lasting version that pulled over Yosemite Sam and Daffy Duck. The mistakes of the last day became pleasant and complicated for me. Also look at "Hair Raising Hare" (1946) and "Rabbit Punch" (1948) for great examples of classic mistakes and classic Chuck Jones.
