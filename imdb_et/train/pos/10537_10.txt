This movie was very funny, I could not smile while watching it, and has been watching it for two days already! The film is unique in its humor and visual manifestations, both of which are terrible and equal to the other caliber cube and cypher of other Natal films. I've been looking at Vincenzo Natal for a big fan of the time since Cypher, I've become very interesting. <br /> <br /> This movie has very nice music and "loser" characters Dave and Andrew, depicted by David Hewlett and Andrew Miller (co-author of the story), actors I really like. Also cool is X-Box Dead Or Alive fights (you can even see Dave playing Halot at one point) and Andrew's amazing guitar solo, among many other things. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a very good self-conscious movie about friendship. You have to see it!
