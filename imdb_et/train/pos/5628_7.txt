Looking at some other comments here, I have the main complaint with this presentation. <br /> <br /> The two main characters are attractive in their own way - a beautiful "victim" and a beautiful, obviously "blue collar" protagonist (if it's just "empty") ") - alternate between hacking each other like a caucasian The Kabuki Scenario. <br /> <br /> That's all right, and this is of course mainly a "turntable" story, but the complaint I am referring to is that I believe that the Director respected his desire to show Farra's well-known and obvious physical qualities. Starting from the fact that he is temptingly in a thin bathrobe and with many scenes that are more than necessary to achieve a dramatic effect - if they are very pleasing to the eyes, they disturb the level of drama. <br /> <br /> His roommates I'm sure they present both written and staged performances, but their skepticism and hysterical beating and sniffing are not true - based on Farrah's past experience, this boy is evident evidence that he is coming have had the worst intentions, and that he has no reason to exaggerate what has happened. <br /> <br /> But this is a movie and story that's so much, despite the director's job.
