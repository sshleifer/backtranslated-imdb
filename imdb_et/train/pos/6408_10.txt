Classic Hollywood biopedia is the best feeling in the genre. Gooding and DeNiro give outstanding leadership in both leading positions, and supportive cast is equally excellent, Carl Lumbly and Michael Rapoport present themselves. <br /> <br /> The only "nit" I could choose is that Theron's role was unnecessary and disturbing (not her performance, which was good, it's just that the movie seemed to add to her role In addition, two unnecessary scenes.) <br /> <br /> In addition, the actual story, characterization, dynamics and action are riveting and unforgettable. Developments of the main characters and how they experience their creatures uniquely with the developing artists. Despite the extreme length of the film, it remains unchanged all the time. The result is also terrible. <br /> <br /> Is this a predictable Hollywood movie? You wish. So, Mike Leigh's addicts should divorce the star, but everyone else should really enjoy it.
