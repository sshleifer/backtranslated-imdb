I liked Top Gun. It was in my interest. Predictable plot, decent character development and story. It is quite similar to High Noon because the people in the city seem weak and scared that they will not be able to resist the criminal. This film has some high quality actors who really didn't get the chance to share all their talents. Some participants also did not get credit for their role. Denver Pyle had a good looking man on his younger days. John Dehner, Rod Taylor is outstanding in his role. Sterling Hayden did everything he could if he had bad material. It's hard to imagine him as a pistol. Laura, played by Karen Booth, was nausea. He seemed thrilled that the two men could fight over him. Ugh. Finally, how can people travel without luggage? Especially women.
