I don't know the "Largo Winch" as a comic book (or is it a graphic novel? I don't really know), but I have to admit that I heard an agent / hero about the movie, I was expecting something different than what I actually got. <br /> <br /> Although it was first amazing, it was nice to watch this move. You can never really tell where it goes (some twists are predictable, but in general you will never be able to say when it would end). It is a leading actor and perfect support, which is more than a star result, it's an enjoyable watch. Not so packed, as some can count or expect such a movie, but a really good mix.
