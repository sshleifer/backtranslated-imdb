I would like to comment on April Love. This is one of my all-time favorites because my father Nelson Malone plays a horse trainer. I remember clearly when Hollywood came to Lexington, KY, where we lived to make April's love. My father had been in many games and a talented man. I talked about him to try one of the bits offered, and look and see, he came home. How exciting it is! Also, many of my classmates were in crowd scenes, especially in the amusement park. It's very nostalgic every April when I see the movie again, and the song April Love, which Pat Boone is still playing on the radio. Timeless and reminiscent of the time that has passed when you see the movies they are doing today, with all the sex, the unpleasant language and the violence. It would be refreshing to see more movies like April Love Love come back ...
