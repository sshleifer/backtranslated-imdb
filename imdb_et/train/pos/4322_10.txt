Perhaps the social commentary or the filmmakers' point of view does not care (I am a mysteriously insignificant angle to Kasdan's advocacy?), When the activities in the film promote the importance of CERTAIN. ended up confused with me). But the story has never been denied; all symbolism; threaded mark arches; visuals; dialogue? is an absolute craft. I watched the film tens of times and I still wonder about its perfection. There is no moment, action, cutting, or line that has nothing to do with this topic. Realistic human exhibitions from all actors. The scene of the scene is woven fantastically. <br /> <br /> I have a real level gauge. This movie never went out during this movie. If you are a thinker (not a casual viewer)? this movie offers. Exponentially. Absolutely mesmerizing. (Do you have to accept the message to evaluate the screen? Who cares about whether it made you warm and blurry or not, was it interesting?) <br /> <br /> Personally, did the film affect me? significantly. My Top 5. <br /> <br /> Note: The front page reviewer clearly speaks of an incorrect African-American understanding. What he couldn't recognize was that his hand was? shake. Not a hand. The spiritually dead white man just saw a man with respect and admiration. And he did something. The fact that he was black was a little, if any, with it (the color is simply used for parallel drawing. And the gap. There is no accident when the opening sequence shifts from black to white to color). When you watch black movies in this movie like? Token? you could reassess your anger. Maybe you only see yourself in black and white, eh. Just a thought.
