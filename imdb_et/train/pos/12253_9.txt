It has long been one of my favorite music in Austen's novel. Although it is certainly not in the same category as the grandiose "pride and prejudice", "Emma" is a lush and relatively faithful version of Austen's novel, especially given its short length. The biggest change between the novel and the movie is good, because what Austen exhibits at the end of the story is removed from here and replaced by much more similar to Emma's character in the rest of the book. I thought the characters selected to represent roles were well chosen. Kate Beckinsale walks between fine lines that are completely lost in the Gwyneth Paltrow '96 version between birth and social snob. Samantha Morton's weak blonde locks fit her attitude and character, as the simpler one that comes with the previous characterization has been replaced by Harriet, whom we know from the book. Mister Knightly's role is, in my opinion, very good; the serious and gentle sympathy the hero paints in the novel is here very neglected, in a proud film.
