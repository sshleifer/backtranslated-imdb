I like my Ronald Colman, who sees movies like If I Were King and Kismet. I like her as a civilization rebellion, like The Lost Horrizon and Random Harvest. Colman is not my favorite. <br /> <br /> A Double Life just because his part of actor Anthony John is so amazing for him, was recognized by Colman in 1947 with the best actor Oscar. he became the most famous part. <br /> <br /> Colman is an actor who really takes his method seriously. He has just finished a successful run in comedy and is a pretty cheerful companion. Now that this game has changed to complete the Broadway race, Colman brings Othello back to New York. About the opposite, as you can. <br /> <br /> Both of her leading women are her former husband Signe Hasso, who loves her dear, but can't change her mood in her work. Colman also loves him dearly and wants him back. But he goes to the spiritual break when he starts to confuse the jealous Moor Othello and Hasso with Desdemona's role. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Shelley Winters, as a poor waitress who pushes Colman up, is on her madness and runs like a bad Desdemona in the game. The same way he was killed and now the murder police are Joe Sawyer's thing. <br /> <br /> Colman's performance is so good that it is no wonder if it is a threat to the workplace for the creators? I would think about whether Laurence Olivier and Orson Welles, or around him, had unsolved murders, then they were dealing with Othello. <br /> <br /> For that reason, I could never buy this story, but I definitely appreciate Ronald Colman and what he did with that part. I'm sure he was sorry to win the Oscar because one of the other candidates was his good friend William Powell for his father's life. In the same year, other Gregory Peck worked for gentlemen's agreement, John Garfield for body and soul and Michael Redgrave's grief became Electra. <br /> <br /> Colman receives support for other pain, including Edmond O 'Brien, who finds himself in Cassio's unwanted part of Colman's jealous fantasy. There's still no Iago equivalent on A Double Life, no one can make jealousy, it's all in his own mind.
