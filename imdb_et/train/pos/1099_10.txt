Although it has been recognized as the best film treatment for the difficulties caused by the home-built (or purchased) specifications of a house, it is neither the first nor the last. In 1940, Jack Benny and Ann Sheridan were George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart in the GEORGE WASHINGTON SLEPT HERE. And about fifteen years ago, Shelly Long and Tom Hanks took the lead in MONEY PIT. The first was a 18th century country house that needed work. The latter was about building your dream house - in the late 1980s. Although both films have moments, they are not as good as BLANDINGS, which was based on an autobiographical novel of the same name. <br /> <br /> Jim Blandings and his wife Muriel (Cary Grant and Myrna Loy) are observing the tight corner of their apartment, which they share with their two daughters Joan and Betsy (Sharyn Moffett and Connie Marshall). Although Blandings has a good income as an advertising manager (in 1948 he makes $ 15,000.00 a year, which was like $ 90,000.00 today), and lives in a luxurious apartment - that day rents in New York! He feels they should look for something better. He and Muriel travel to the country (Connecticut) and soon find an old ruin, both of which suggest that they can be fixed just like the dream house they want. buying land and construction can lead. First of all, they are so hugging the idea of ​​building a home that they would not warn after a warning as a cynical friend and lawyer Bill Cole (Melvin Douglas, in a nice sardonic role). For example, Jim buys land from a Connecticut dealer (Ian Wolfe, sucking his shell quietly), checking for double control before checking the land that is Connecticut in that part. Bill points out that he has paid more than five or six thousand dollars for the land. There are problems with the water supply that both Blandings simply don't think of, like hard and soft water - which leads to the Zis-Zis Water softening machine. They find that the designs they think and have developed with their architect (Reginald Denny) cannot afford to break down Muriel's decision to build a little rookery that no one intended. <br /> <br /> The project's escalating costs are one thing Jim is struggling with. He has been assigned to manage the Wham account ("Spam" has become a popular result of World War II because the public began to use it as a meat substitute in the light of its success with the armed forces). Jim can't grab it (he's not alone - one or two other leaders hit him before). He comes up with the following "poem" (?): <br /> <br /> "This little pig went to the market, <br /> <br /> She was pink and as beautiful as ham. /> <br /> She smiled When they gave her an ax - <br /> <br /> She knew she was getting "Wham"! <br /> <br /> Her secretary looks at her so as she needs a straight jacket when she counts that one! <br /> <br /> Jim also suspects Bill's concerns about Muriel, though (in that case) Bill is innocent. But he's always around (Jim forgets that Bill is clear and keeps Jimi and Muriel from making so many mistakes). All three have drawbacks, the best is when they are locked in a room built in the room, as men are left behind. They can't open the door, and Jim (panic) is trying to break the door with a make-shift drag. He breaks the window and the door opens itself. <br /> <br /> The film works fairly satisfactorily, with all actors apparently enjoying themselves. This is one film that, in spite of price levels and wage levels, is really out of date. After all, most Americans dream of owning a home and are always there. <br /> <br /> For many years, the color company used delicious scenes with Myrna Loy and Emory Parnell for color work. He is showing red, blue, etc. The different shades he wants - even giving a polite Parnell to one yarn for a better blue tone. The ads suggested that the color company had many colors to choose from. When they advertised, they proudly called Loy "Mrs. Blandings". You can imagine how Parnell's excitement deals after Loy leaves her color team.
