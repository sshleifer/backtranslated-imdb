The trailer of this movie did not make the film fair. And although the film didn't know what he really wanted, the first half of the film was a light, romantic comedy, and the second more serious, more romantic drama, the overall effect was much better than I thought it would be. This movie was rather a date movie, but the trailer made it more a temporary thriller that he never showed. Kidman, being one of my favorites, is, of course, biased, but this movie turned out to be a light, sensitive, and somewhat original film that deserves better. Three of the four stars. 5/5/02.
