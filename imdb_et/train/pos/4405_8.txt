The war between states was probably the darkest hour in American history; a war that brother and family brother and family against knees and left scars, that even today have not healed, and probably never. And like in any history of any war, it is behind any major conflict because of any historical significance that creates this inclusive emotional impetus. It is a human element that makes the context necessary to give the perspective that director Ang Lee offers in "The Rattles with the Devil", a civil war drama in which he focuses on personal wars in a broader description of his own war. and along the way, is able to involve one of the bloodiest war chapters, the infamous Lawrence, Kansas, Quantrill, and his riders, which he is quite objectively capable of presenting from a confederation perspective. <br /> <br /> In 1863, the influence of the Union in the state of Kansas, and even Missouri, which is adjacent to the border, dominates the confederacy's loyalty to people increasingly hard to withstand the offending northern Europe, especially without the help that could be considered any "ordinary" confederacy. And when things really get around their city, Jack Bull Chiles (Skeet Ulrich) and Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire) make up their own band and join in the fear of damaging the Union's reason for doing it. Jack Bull and Jake don't like war and don't like killing; but they stand for what they believe is right. <br /> <br /> There are others, even among themselves, such as young Pitt Mackeson (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), who use the conflict as a personal benefit and nothing more than an excuse to express their violent character due to unnecessary cruelty that is in many cases committed against innocent victims. And so, both Jack Bull and Jake, as well as many others like them, will change the time when loyalty and moral decisions are tested; the time during which their souls are hardened in the blood. And they have to ride themselves very hell against seemingly insurmountable odds. <br /> <br /> As with all of his films, director Ang Lee approaches his story through his traditions, cultural aspects of people and times, and the moral attitudes he represents. By doing this, Lee gives his audience at least some insight into his subject, which goes beyond the actual story and finally offers a deeper understanding of the motivations that drive his characters and the drama in which they participate. Are these traditions and practices that take into account the relationship between the father and his daughters ("Eat a Man"), effects of class differentiation ("mind and sensitivity"), honor and code with which a warrior lives and dies ("Tiger, Hidden Dragon" ”) Or the moral ambiguity promoted by all the above-mentioned shortcomings (“ Ice Form ”), Lee makes his films aware of the human condition, leading them to a higher level. This movie is no exception; and (as he does with all his films), Lee presents his story of breathtaking cinematography (in this film Frederick Elmes, who also made the "Ice Form" superbly), under his guidance, nothing but visual poetry. This is because the special Lee touches, and it adds a cozy, reflective thought to every story he speaks, one of the elements that makes his films so memorable. <br /> <br /> Like Jake, Tobey Maguire initially brings a sense of innocence to a film that is so effectively opposed to what he later passes on when the story evolves and his character with it. Most importantly, Maguire reacts convincingly and credibly to the events taking place around him, which enhances the credibility of the whole film and highlights the realism of the presentation: His stoic acceptance of death and news of those murdered in various fears and battles; the moral aptitude with which he meets remains even in such difficult times; betrayal, which is almost normal due to the nature of the conflict; and the loyalty and beliefs he and his companions adhered to. All of this is that Maguire achieves its achievement and it is not a small achievement. However, often underestimated performance is taken for granted, which is regrettable; such work deserves praise and should be recognized. <br /> <br /> Skeet Ulrich is also effective because Jack Bull and Jewel (in their film conversation) turn to Sue Lee. Shelley. This is Jeffrey Wright, who stands out in a strikingly supportive role as Daniel Holt, as well as Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who brings Pitt a similar threat to Christopher Walken for his cooling. Mark Ruffalo, which is the role of a hero (one scene), also leaves an indelible impression with very little screen time. <br /> <br /> Supporting casting includes James Caviezel (Black John), Simon Baker (George Clyde), Tom Guiry (Riley), Tom Wilkinson (Orton Brown), John Ales (Quantrill), John Judd (Otto Roedel) and Kathleen Warfel (Ms. Chiles). The domestic war is the wound open to the people forever; but hopefully, as time goes by, filmmakers such as Ang Lee have objective reflections and films such as "Ride With the Devil", which ultimately help to close schism and promote healing. In the light of recent events, it is very necessary in the world. Film is a powerful tool; it can be both educational and entertaining, and maybe in the future more filmmakers like Ang Lee will embrace and promote a sense of unity through the delicate portrayal of events and attitudes that make us what we are. 8/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
