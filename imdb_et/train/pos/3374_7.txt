"Soylent Green" is one of the best and most disturbing fiction films of the 70s, which is still very convincing even by today's standards. Although apocalyptic touch and environmental principles (typical at that time) are still faulty and dated, they still feel very confused and thought-provoking. This level of film quality exceeds most of today's SF clips thanks to its strong pain and some intense sequences that I personally think of as classic. New York in 2022 is a depressing place to live, because of the population, unemployment, unhealthy climate and the lack of any essential food. The only food form is synthetic and distributed by Soylent. Charlton Heston (in excellent form) plays a policeman who is investigating the murder of one of Soylend's most prominent leaders and gets into scandals and dark secrets ... The script is at times somewhat sentimental and the climax doesn't really come The big surprise, however, is the atmosphere very tense and surprised. The order of the rebels is really exhausting and easily one of the most peaceful moments of the 70's. Edward G. Robinson is extremely impressive in his last role, and Joseph Cotton's ("Baron's Blood", "Abominable Dr Phibes") role is great (but too modest). This is a science-fiction in my book: a horrible and inevitable disappearance for humanity! Some fictional spaceships with furry monsters attacking our planet.
