The original animated Dark Knight returns in this ace adventure movie that competes with the Phantasm mask in its coolness. Batwoman's mystery has a lot of style and intelligence, as much as Batman Forever or Batman and Robin. <br /> <br /> Gotham's streets have a new criminal fighter. She dresses like a bat, but she is not an adult Batgirl. And Batman denies any connection with him. Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne has to deal with ordinary romance and detective work. But the penguin, Bain and the local Mob make things a little more complicated. <br /> <br /> I had no great hopes for this because it was heavily suppressed, but the weak Batman: Sub Zero (Robin isn 't) here so much!) but I was delighted with imaginative and exciting pieces, smart with lots of land and fine sense of humor. This is definitely a movie that Batman fan shouldn't be. Keep your ears open for a truly memorable song called "Betcha Neva" that is highlighted. <br /> <br /> It's a disgrace that the DVD is not that big. Don't do me wrong, have some great features (a short Chase Me is awesome) and a very cool Dolby 5.1 soundtrack, but ... the movie will be featured on Pan and Scan. Batman: Batster's mystery was pulled and shot at 1.85: 1, but this DVD is presented at 1.33: 1 a compared to the features that are displayed there. I find it extremely annoying given the Phantasm mask with an anamorphic wide screen. Warner has literally had dozens of movies on the DVD, because people have complained that there are no headlines in some headlines. Why did they decide that the same mistake is here again is behind me. It's a shame, because the widescreen would have got an excellent DVD package.
