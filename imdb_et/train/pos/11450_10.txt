This movie is amazingly beautiful. The art of Goldsworthy is really useful for the film environment because you can see art in the most beautiful, moving and changing and flourishing. I strongly recommend this movie to everyone. I don't think about anything else about it. This is the kind of movie you need to see, because it is so visually convincing and left me very refreshed when I left the theater.
