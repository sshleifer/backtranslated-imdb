I found this film a common French blow to the American face. Too often, the camera focuses on greasy people, sloppy homes and sticky rural areas. Although narration seems to be sympathetic and admires the small town that introduces the viewer, cinematography uses them and discourages them. Undoubtedly, Glencoe was a beautiful person and a clean, organized home, but Malle decided to show us the worst thing that was there. I can only hope that some American filmmakers will go to France to publish the worst elements of the American public. I can assure you that it is often a French visitor that everything is not right there. Foreign immigrants are not easily equated, thus creating serious social inequalities. But Americans do not want to let the French out of their prejudices against their compatriots and their envy against the US, so we don't see movies on this subject.
