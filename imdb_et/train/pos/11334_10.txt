I would say that this film gives an overview of the trauma that a young man can face when a family is separated because of a divorce or other disaster. I would recommend this film especially to people who plan for parents or families. <br /> <br /> I found that characters are tempting and very sympathetic in many dimensions. <br /> <br /> A frightening monster, though apparently not scary for most adults, is a very real hint of what might be an overwhelming imagination of an infamous child.
