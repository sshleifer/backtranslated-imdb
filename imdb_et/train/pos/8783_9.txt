Gentleman Jim is not really a boxing film. Errol Flynn is a vehicle for Jim Corbett. But by saying this, boxing schemes are a real eye opener for today's viewer. There are no 12 rounds here, no decisions. <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn plays the Irish Bank's secretary, who gets a world-wide title. Flynn fits well with the smooth but unpredictable role of Corbett. However, his opponent, John Sullivan, is better off than the old school player played by Ward Bond. <br /> <br /> The theme of the movie is the man who is trying his great opportunity. Corbett leaves his daily life and builds a new personality with Gentleman Jim. Jim is a breeder who can adapt to any social environment. He is a liar and an egoist. Sullivan's heavy-duty boxing champion is depicted as simple, but his honesty and athletics give a firm contrast to the main player. <br /> <br /> There is action and excitement and wonderful ending with all the necessary redemption. And Errol Flynn gets a girl.
