I recently came to this small film with a pearl cable. I was surprised, though, I should have expected this movie from the team involved. <br /> <br /> Henry Bromwell directed this movie with a firm hand and shows. One always wonders about the secret lives of the killers. One doesn't have to go too far to realize that they are probably their neighbors or social acquaintances or even friends; they do not differ from us, at least on the surface. <br /> <br /> In this story, the grandfather is a despicable character who does not hesitate to lose the right price. He has no disruption to teaching his son and even his grandchild. <br /> <br /> Alex is a man who is confused. He knows what he has done in the past and suddenly understands the consequences of his actions. He must see someone who would help him find peace. While visiting Dr Parks, he tries to find a dismissal, although he can't find it there. On the contrary, there is a dramatic twist when Alex learns who should kill the next. <br /> <br /> Alex, perfectly illustrated by William H. Macy, tells us. He's not just a fantastic actor, he believes he's the man. One of the best things about the film is the late John Ritter. He is equally convincing as Dr. Parks, the man who understands the secret. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland because your grandfather is perfect. He is a natural actor in everything he does. Neve Campbell surprised Sarah's central role. It shows the ability and scope that is incredible. Tracey Ullman is a patient woman, Martha, and she can't do much. Barbara Bain is also an old-fashioned grandmother. David Dorfman is a joy in the film. He shows that the deadline is over his years. <br /> <br />
