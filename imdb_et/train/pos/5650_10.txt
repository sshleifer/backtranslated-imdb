"Somebody at the door". OHHH, How I miss this example so bad ... but we are happy that we now have an "invasion". Thank you, Shawn Cassidy. American Gothic had it all. If I had to choose one of the things I liked best, it must be his "not a predictable graphic line". Favorite actor was Lucas Black. I adore this southern accent. I bought a DVD and my kids are also fans. There are some hot n evaporating scenes. Some also fucking. So, if the kids look, you might want to change it (fastforward / skip). He has humor, Joss Wheedon's level, which so many show a lack of. The spirit of adults and the situation of adults, which is treated with the finish. There are some extras on the DVD, but I want it to be much more. If you want to get excited and enjoy a great show, look at "American Gothic"!
