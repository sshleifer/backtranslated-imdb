Diagnosis Murder is shown most of the weekday afternoon on BBC1 because I looked at it badly 10 years ago - I know I shouldn't really enjoy it the same way I shouldn't enjoy "Murder she Wrote" But I'm totally addicted to both and even DVD boxes ... OK. I know it's sad! <br /> <br /> Dick Van Dyke is in the show when he celebrates Dr. Mark Sloan at the General Hospital of the Community in LA, also a police consultant at LAPD - his son Steve (Barry van Dyke - Dick's real life son) is a policeman who needs his father's help in very many suspicious deaths. <br /> <br /> Driving by Dr Amanda Bentley (Victoria Bentley) is a Community Generation Pathologist and during the first few seasons you played Scott Baio DrJack Stewart, who rose and left the series in 1995 hoping to move on to bigger and better things ... he should have been where he was, he hasn't done anything because he's done .... and his only theatrical look has been Baby Genius 2 for years: Superbabies .... Oh dear !!! <br /> <br /> Anyway, DrJack Stewart replaced the younger dr. Jesse Travise played by Charlie Schlatter, who stepped into Baio's shoes quite comfortably. <br /> <br /> The series is very unlikely, but what is the Whoduniti series? (Murder, which he wrote - everywhere Jessica goes, somebody reaches the dead or underrated mysteries of Dowling's father about solving the murders from Priest with a nun sidekick) <br /> <br /> The series was much easier until 1997 because it was a supportive majority, which included Michael Tucci's Norman Briggs, head of hospital, with Doreses, Delores Hall's sister and Mark's secretary. After 1997, both characters were no longer involved and the series became a bigger-looking budget, some episodes contained much more action, one episode has been blown into the hospital. <br /> <br /> It was a family show for Van Dyke because both Dick's Son Barry and Dick's daughter and all of her grandchildren had a look at different episodes. <br /> <br /> As the series went a little stupid, one episode I remember Dick van Dike plays with all his family, which was a bit of a habit, but a really good TV show with lots of good things guests stars. <br /> <br /> Since this show ended in 2001, Dick & Barry has once again appeared in the "MURDER 101" series of films made by The Hallmark Channel, a lot of watching the same path and still enjoyable. Dick, who is now in the mid-80s, doesn't seem to change much and looks like he's working until the bitter end. <br /> <br /> TV SHOW **** OUT OF *** **
