I remember this movie when I was a little child, I loved it and I still do. I managed to get it to my 18th birthday on a DVD and I was happy because I was so hard to find it before and it was rented only when I was younger. My favorite character is Charlie because he's learning to be a good dog. The film is full of fun songs and music. Animation is brilliant and character voices are perfect. This movie has always been a tearjerker for me, but I think if I hadn't seen this movie when I was small, I wouldn't find it so brilliant and exciting as I believe I still believe I would like it is still because i'm really animated in movies.
