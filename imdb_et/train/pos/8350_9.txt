As with this movie, we follow the adventures of 2 guiding figures that are unlikely. But although C + J intervened sexually in childhood, this couple enjoys their muscles even at the time of homoerotic research. Most of the sexes they acquire from reluctant or unwanted partners, but despite their profound anti-computer behavior, are all smiling. Like C + G, they are all innocent, insurgent, civilian, restrictive. As someone else has commented, I wouldn't want to know 2 of them and it's a little wonder that their trip mostly reveals comedy and very little tragedy (and what can't be put on their door there) and so the reason it left me poor, but sweet in the mouth. Dare to say that only the French can escape from such films. And that's part of their genius.
