Although this movie was pleasant enough to be musical, it was an unexpected comedy of chemistry between Basil Rathbone, as on-on-composer, and Oscar Levant as his assistant. The Rathbone character looks like he was unable to get out of his bed without help when he is playing a tight, distracted artistic type (far from his familiar roles as threatening villains and cool logical Sherlock Holmes). And this is Starbuck, played by Oscar Levant with his usual sense of humor. After renting Crosby's character as a ghost songwriter, Rathbone introduces him to Starbuck, saying, "He's doing all my thinking for me." Levant replies: "Ah, it's just part-time work." Of course it goes bypassing Rathbone, who is too busy to talk about where his next hit song comes from. As another reviewer said, who knew Rathbone might be so funny! Too bad he had no more chance of giving his comedy.
