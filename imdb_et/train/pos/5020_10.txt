This is what the film should be very surreal. This is the color film that is rarely captured on the film, it seems like a dream and really takes you to a dark haunting memory. The children were extremely believable and I hope some things will come in the future. For such youngsters it is very natural, I do not know if Bill pulled them out of them or just so good, but no less excellent. Bill threw as much as I am and KevNJeff's comment on Mr Paxtons is bad, which can be done in this role. He played it very well in my opinion. It comes from someone who said Hamlet was good (The Ethan Hawke version?) Wow ......... Don't listen to his comments. A big flick so you really feel uncomfortable when you want it? Cinematography also has a higher than average rating.
