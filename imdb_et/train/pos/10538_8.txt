I work in a movie shop and so I'm always watching a great movie. I decided to look at something that sat in our Canadian section, and I've been trying to support my country's film industry. I was surprised. In the film, David Hewlett and Andrew Miller are in a very fun nature, which seems to have had so many thoughts and relationships ... without working hard. It's consistently comic through the interaction of two characters, as well as some funny shifts ("We can't be dead, we have a cable!"). The more I can say without mentioning that it is worth the picture, even if you give up in the first half hour.
