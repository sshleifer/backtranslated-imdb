Gordon Gekko used Wall Street to find out that greed is good. Now Michael Douglas takes the GG staff and morphises it into the secret service agent Pete Garrison. Guess? It works! This is a definite political thriller that kept me away. It was also an intriguing detailed work to show the security measures taken by the chairman of the SS and the first lady. All the wires were pretty good, but try, as I can, I couldn't accept Eva Longoria as a secret service agent. If Jodie Foster just made you believe and really thought he was an FBI agent in Starling, "In Silence of Lambs", you will not get the same experience in Longoria. Nonetheless, it's a fun movie, entertaining entertainment with Beltway backgrounds.
