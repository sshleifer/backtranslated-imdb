This is a great movie about the fishing village brothel, which could best be described by the events of the constellations and old Kurosawa works, with Dostoevsky's psychology (O-shin - Sonia Marmeladova), Shakespeare's drama and Hans Christian Andersen's tragic and joyful. The scenario is wonderful, the scenes are colorful and the beautiful scenes are printed in my opinion. The plot is interesting and unpredictable - every character is very well developed and interesting - there is also little activity, so if you don't like all the feelings then you will come to your expenses. It's not a mysterious geisha and a gorgeous samurai, where their Bushido pours out all of them, but about life, work, and people that are everywhere. A lovely and exciting tribute to Kurosawa is definitely worth it.
