I enjoyed this movie very much. Maguire delivers excellent results like Jake. He must be one of the best actors I've seen. And I was surprised that the whole movie had so many humorous features. He was also very good, although I have never seen him in the comics before. The film can deal with the characters and really wonder what all of them can do. I didn't know what to expect from Jewel's activities, but I think he did quite well. Lots of exciting scenes. Thoroughly good driving. I'm a completely Maguire fan. See Cider House's rules. One of the best times ever.
