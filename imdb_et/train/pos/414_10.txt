Cecil B. deMille really knew how to create a classic, and after 7 decades she is western, like Real McCoy, tempting, fun, spectacular; by no means obsolete. <br /> <br /> Like a real TV DEADWOOD fan, I will tell you Gary Cooper's performances as Wild Bill Hickock and Jean Arthor, as Calamity Jane is much more targeted. /> <br /> We have no giants in Hollywood. PLAINSMAN is just one of the dozens of classics from the 1936-1945 decade that has seen a decade of business in the decade: released, reissued, reissued. Filmmakers like Spielberg, Jackson, Bruckheimer are like kids playing in a sandbox. No contemporary movie is searched for 7 months, let alone 70 years.
