Partly we perceive the need to perceive the addition of a traditional love story to a plot to make the film public in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> The film starts with a somewhat funny character from the Foreign Ministry's top-class bureaucrats - the Britons are pillars in such a way that only the British can do it themselves. But after that, the film loses its way on the usual pharmaceutical plot. Terry-Thomas watches as always, but big talent (Peter Sellers, al) is largely wasted. <br /> <br /> Redirect, but not a big movie.
