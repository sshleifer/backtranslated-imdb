I love Paul McCartney. I think it is the greatest ever. I could not, however, allow a ticket for my concert at Tacoma Dome during a US tour. I was at least saying. Then I found this DVD. It was almost as good as there. Paul is still a man and I have enjoyed it for years. <br /> <br /> I have one complaint. I'd like to hear all of Hey Jude. <br /> <br /> Paul is not dead either. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest concert DVD ever. <br /> <br /> ** *** at the end *****.
