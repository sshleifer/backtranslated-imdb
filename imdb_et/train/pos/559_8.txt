A good movie - with your time - an intense, sprawling, rather dark story that resembles somewhat John Ford's "Seekers", though not so brutal. The story begins quickly and does not allow itself to have several scenes between a very good dialogue (Stewart), Jeff Webster, Ronda Castle and Sheriff Gannon. In a sense, this film resembles a "river curve" (1952), as well as the work of Mann-Stewart, but I found it to be much less sentimental and interesting. There are some warnings: too fast packed (and rather sentimental) end; The 24-year-old Corrine Calvert is not a very naive French teenager convincing and of course the film takes place in the mythical western part of the country where the real laws of peoples and physics do not apply. But these are minor problems. James Stewart is surprisingly good as a blind, off-man who thinks he doesn't care about anyone but the mountain landscape cannot be won. Fine Western costume drama.
