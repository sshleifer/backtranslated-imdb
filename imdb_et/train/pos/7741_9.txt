The first of the two adjustments made by Jim Thompson in 1990 (the second is known as GRIFTERS), AFTER DARK has all the features of Thompson: dangerous women, trust and characters that are not as obscure as others suspect Jason Patric is great as a former boxer who was disqualified from sports because of the ring (director James Foley uses the RAGING BULL-esquire sequences to refine the story) and Rachel Ward, who has seen too little, also performs well. But Bruce Dern is the secret weapon of the film: his sweet-spoken admirer Uncle Bud commands his scenes in peace. <br /> <br /> There is almost no comic in this movie, so make sure it's ready to suck.
