This is an extraordinary film that tricks you constantly. It looks like it moves in the direction of the clich√©s on several points, and then something amazing happens that really amazes. It would give a lot more to say but would stick to this movie and you will be rewarded with a lot of reward. William Haines is absolutely pleasant - he is definitely a star that deserves to be rediscovered. Gay subtext in his relationship with Jack Pickford is amazing - there is even a scene where Haines rubs on Pickford's chest (Pickford's cold). Both players play this subtle finely and with great depth of emotion, so there are moments that are very moving. And I never thought I could get involved in a football match when I made this movie - and I don't even understand the rules! Also great is Francis X. Bushman's son Ralph as a rival to Haines's girls (yes, it's not a totally gay movie). Wonderful Quiet Classic - A great example of Twenties commercial marketing with an edge.
