........... when I saw this movie) I never watch this movie, not because it's a bad movie, but because it scared me so much! As I said, I was 14 when my English teacher decided to show it to us; The reason for this is that we had read an excerpt from the book. <br /> <br /> All my class girls were TERRIFIED when a black woman came through a window and swims over the Kidd bed, though just before there is something that scared us as well, when Kidd finds a toy soldier under the pillow and hears the voice of the child saying "It's for you". This scene still haunts me today, nearly 7 years after the film. <br /> <br /> If you are frightened, DO NOT REMOVE THIS FILM !!!!!!!!
