GONE IN 60 SECONDS / (2000) *** (out of four) <br /> <br /> "In 60 Seconds" is an energetic, slick, stylish action with high octane power and many fantastic looking cars. If you are an interesting viewer of cars, the production is produced by Jerry Bruckheimer ("Con Air", "The Rock") to see his eyes in shiny vehicles. Though the film excels in many areas, its exact sense of action and excitement is moderately successful in the summer. <br /> <br /> The movie stars Giovanni Ribisi ("Mod Squad") is a young plump called Kip Raines, who is unable to deliver a strong criminal Raymond Calitri (Christopher Eccleston), the expensive cars, when the movie opens. If Kipi's life is threatened by such a reason, his older brother Randall "Memphis" in Raines (Nicolas Cage), who is a retired but skilful car thief, is tasked with fulfilling his brother's survival: steel fifty cars assigned to the model, color, year and make-in in just four days. <br /> <br /> Memphis will pay the first three-day recruitment team's bandits to help him pull out. The team includes Sara's "Sway" Wayland (Angelina Jolie), a sexy but terrible pensioner who knew Memphis through her previous company, Mirror Man (TJ Cross), aging and wisdom, Otto Halliwell (Robert DuVall). Tumbler (Scott Caan), Atley Jackson (Will Patton), Toby (William Lee Scott) and Donny Astricky (Chi McBrde). <br /> <br /> Helping to control and tension the film is a block of participation of two police detectives, Roland Castlebeck (Delroy Lindo) and Drycoff (Timothy Olyphant), who suspect past experience that Memphis and his team are up to Well and carefully follow them. <br /> <br /> There is not much time for character development here; The audience can get to know these people through their harsh lifestyles, and through tough hearts, a stylish atmosphere, tough personalities. In order to make the film even worse, characters cannot be defined in the dialogue with a sharp cultural tone. I am not saying that I think misery and vulgarism are necessary for thrillers to flourish; In fact, I respect the director's decision to keep from an extreme language in a movie that could have earned R-ratings very easily. However, I believe in this film, such as "Gone in 60 Seconds", to strongly develop the illumination of the sign, the dialogue must be credible and authentic. <br /> <br /> Despite the problems, the characters are effective thanks to excellence, responsibly cast performers. Nicolas Cage's melodramatic performance is intense and convincing. The amazing look of Angelina Jolie is perfect here. Delroy Lindo is delicious and credible. Giovanni Ribisi, Scott Caan, Robert Duvall, Will Patton and Christopher Eccleston offer convincing supportive roles. <br /> <br /> The film contains a standard structure, a satisfactory first action that specifies motifs of style and character of the story, introduces a fast paced theme, but does not have a deep and strong character. In the second book, there are still some problems: the story wastes a lot of this segment, never for a third act. If there is a lot of time in the middle of a movie and sex music is a solid average plot, the whole lot won't happen. The third thing is pretty much an adrenaline rush that includes furious wall-to-wall excitement and one of the most intense tachographs ever filmed. <br /> <br /> The "Gone in 60 Seconds" soundtrack helps you to explore inspiring action scenes. It's scenes like the car is driving, which makes this movie work despite several devastating mistakes. Dominic Senal, whose career has mostly been targeted at advertising, is an attractive style and a decisive attitude "within 60 seconds", giving the audience two hours of embarrassment, excitement and excitement? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
