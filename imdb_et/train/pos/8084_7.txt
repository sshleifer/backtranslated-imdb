<br /> <br /> I bought this movie on DVD and watched it for the first time the second night. I've been a Tolkien fan for 4 years since graduation from high school. I didn't grow up on this film ... maybe my mother kept her away. This is definitely not for children. Not that it is graphically bad, but things would go to most of the 10-year-olds. In general, the animation was great considering it in 1978/1979. In. I thought that the story followed the book quite freely. But I have bothered that Bashki didn't add another 40 minutes and that it was about returning the king's parts. It would have made it the final movie. I was disturbed by this sudden end, and when I heard the king's return, I was still bothered. Too bad it wasn't one big animation film. It could have got a bigger voice from me. I'll give him 7. I can only hope that Peter Jackson will make LOTR with a new live action on the books.
