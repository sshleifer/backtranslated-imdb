Withdrawal: In the morning after his bachelor's evening, Paul wakes up with his mother-in-law-to-and finds that there is a woman sleeping next to him. Unfortunately, it was the waitress at the bar, not her bride. And suddenly he rises everywhere ... on the road pocket and his parents dinner. And it's hard to keep a secret when her jealous ex-boyfriend followed her and photographed her. It's not just about saving your wedding ... it's a matter of survival. <br /> <br /> Comments: In fact, much better than expected. Not that lovely romantic comedy that I was expecting, but something more funny, nothing less. This movie was not afraid to go a little further. And Jason Lee is doing now how to edit comedy, especially when his character is panic and trouble, as he is here. And she became beautiful women Julia Stiles and Selma Blair. And actually I thought Lochlyn Munro was a beautiful part of the ex. <br /> <br /> So more emphasis on comedy than romance and end result was good. I enjoyed it very much. <br /> <br /> 7/10
