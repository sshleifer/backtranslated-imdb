I gave this film some reluctance because it's hard to praise something that haunts me and scared me for years. The black woman's smile is just pure horror and the accompanying music deepens the fear. I saw it when it was for the first time on television when I was 10 years old and it really disturbed me for years. I am interested in the fact that so many other users have said that. With so many movie reviews to go about, how annoying or frightening the movie may be, but you can believe all those who have posted this board, it's really incredibly powerful stuff. I mean, I really like horror movies and usually find them pretty funny, if not, but it's really dangerous and probably bothering most people. I haven't seen it because I was 10 years old and I am tempted to look at it again, but I'm afraid I may have sleepless nights. I can't say my finger exactly, but I think it has something to do with fear being the woman's biggest weapon and that we as spectators are as susceptible as we feel so intensely. It is noteworthy that the feelings of other viewers are so unanimous. <br /> <br /> I've also seen a production that was a great production ... but nothing can compare it.
