For me, this is the most complete film in Ealing's studio - so fresh and relevant half a century later, when it was the day it appeared. <br /> <br /> Siege growth concepts and commercial need. Built-in aging, it can hardly be more minutes. And what other film can you say that the hero bears literally? <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, Jurassic Park has parallels where environmental protection literally changes and bites you. But Spielberg abandoned the book's brilliant middle mindedness to deal with some nonsense about "children." Hmmm. <br /> <br /> Man in white suit Alec Guiness is the ideal young scientist to come up with a cloth that will never get dirty and never wear out. Suddenly, the workers of the Northern English mill and the capital where he works are united, as ever, in protecting their livelihoods. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is Ealing, it's comedy, but it doesn't have to be. Acquired (if it should fit?) The complex interplay of interests plays beautifully, because one by one all the parties realize that "progress" is a threat and that disposable and waste material keeps looms complicated. <br /> <br But, yes, this is comedy - although witty - and in the middle of political irony there are delicious performances and some good old-fashioned knocking laughs. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, this biting satire can withstand - dazzling and white.
