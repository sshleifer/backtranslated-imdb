As a warning, I've seen the movie 5-6 times over the last 15 years and I just saw music this week. This allowed me to rate the film without having it been musically or not (but it cheated me on watching music :)) I believe Michael Douglas worked quite well in this role with Kasey. I think his "Let me dance to you scene" is one of the best parts of the movie, which is a useful addition to music. Movie dancers and songs are much better than musical, but also cast, which is at least 10 times larger (of course, easier to make in the film). Decorations, lighting, dancing and singing are also much better in the film, which should be expected and indeed delivered. <br /> <br /> Songs that were common to music have been made better in the movie, the new ones are pretty good, and the whole movie seems to me more than musical, especially when compared to music. music with little decorations. One bad point in the movie is the obvious cuts between the participants who speak and dub the singers during some characters, but their dancing is impeccable and the final product was more enjoyable than the musical
