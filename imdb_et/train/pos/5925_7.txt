Because of all the negative reviews of this movie, I almost didn't look at it. However, I was pleasantly surprised that it was a rather pleasant horror movie. Action was not great - except for the wonderful Alice Krige - but some dialogue ("I consider myself just for lunch") was quite fun. <br /> <br /> Overall, Stephen King's effort was above average - 7/10.
