The erotic cinema of the 1970s was good compared to today's triple X romp, which is good. Because there is a good story around naked rituals and sexual scenes. Of course, I want them to have some vampire effects they had at the time and the sex got a little story. In addition, some accents were difficult to understand in time periods, but it is worth looking at the non-modified version, the edited version, which is entitled "GALLERY GAME". But if you don't care for bare women dancing and having sex, it's not a movie for you. But I enjoyed it and I give it ... 7 STARS.
