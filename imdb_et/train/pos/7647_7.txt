Ok, so it borrows a little "It's a wonderful life", but it was 44 years before this movie, so why not a new test. Belush has a rotten 35th birthday. He didn't get his Wheaties, his coffee and lost his job. The captain is when his own "big blue piece including **" car breaks down at the end of the day. He drives an empty bar to make a call. Waiting for his bartender (Caine), he was a boy who lost 20 years ago in the city championship baseball game. It can make her think about how life would have been if she had won the game. He finds out when, without knowing him, Caine earns a way of moving in a glass that gives him a manor house, a prom queen (Russo), and makes him the president of a sports goods company he is preserved. Later, Caine publishes himself for who is responsible for this change, but Belushi is not entirely on board. He has never fully adapted and in the development of a plot that does not kill the film, but is still strange, he tries to meet his wife (Hamilton) about his real life, who is now married to someone else. The good thing is that they don't spend too much time on it, because basically they hang from "Ghost" because Belushi is constantly telling him about Hamilton. It also brings about a dramatic dramatic element, as two of his lovers kevetch shade, the new woman Russo and her unbalanced lover Cox. But the keys to the movie are somewhat long start and fun ending. Also the great and recognizable pain of a good job, such as Belushi, is very pleasing, very attractive ladies selected and Caine is quite simple as the title boy. Strangely enough, it was Belush's second film of 1990, which touched him on getting an alternative lifestyle from the "Taking Care of the Business". Similarly, both films are laughing at the same level. So check it out for fun in "what if?"
