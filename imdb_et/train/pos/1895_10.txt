I watched it at Christmas, I don't know why, but reminds me of Christmas, so I looked at it, so we are. <br /> <br /> Arthur is a movie that I look at all the time with a big smile on my face and the special performances of this mix, great fun music and a script that breaks its mindset and charm. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore is a character that can be hated very easily (spoiled, abundant, lazy drunk, who feels excusable) but turns him into someone you love. Liza Minelli is great when Linda Morolla is a queen waitress who succeeds in pulling a tough / soft interior lady Arthur almost gives up her world. John Gielgud gets all the succulent lines and polishes them to taste. <br /> <br /> I can look at Arthur over and over, and it always works well for me to check if you need to lift your cute movie.
