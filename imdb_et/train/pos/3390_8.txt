Time is the future and many are unaware of it, this day is now. In the latest film by legendary actor Edward G. Robinson, "Solent Green" becomes classic. Many film buffers and environmentalists believe that this is our potential history. The film is taken from the novel titled "Make a Space, Make a Space", but the title of the work is changed to "Solent Green". The story concerns Earth because it is developing into the future when the world's environmental problems become catastrophic. The planet's natural resources are depleted and the main food is reduced to simple staples. They come in a variety of colors, such as Solent Yellow, Solent Red and now Solent Green. However, there are those who know the "real" ingredient of Solent Green and feel guilty and fear divine punishment. The first is a food business man named William R. Simonson (Joseph Cotton). In the event of his death, a committed police detective, Robert Thorn (Charleston Heston), is seeking the truth for a true suicide. Although corruption is coming to an end, it begins with Simonsons' bodyguard, Tad Fielding (Chuck Connors) and Donnovan (Roy Jenson), Security Officer, who direct Thorn to a waste disposal site. Thorn's boss, Mr. Hatcher (Brock Peters) believes in his suspicions, but warns him of those "higher and hottest" who want to close the case, but Thorn does not threaten his "work" as an easy way out. Thorn discovers her death, but like a movie, she's waiting for the last warning. ****
