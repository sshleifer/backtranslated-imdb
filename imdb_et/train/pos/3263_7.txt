Usually I really enjoy movies like "Chances Are", but I wasn't quite happy about it for some reason. The first half was pretty well done, as Alex Finch died and was back in the body (played by Robert Downey Jr.). She meets her wife (Cybill Shepherd) and her friend (Ryan O'Neal) and her daughter, who has now grown. The scenes meet again, and Downey once again discovered who he was, well done, and there is a good deal of emotion and happiness when the shepherd finally believes his wife is reincarnating, but then the film goes down. There are several sex-related scenes that completely turned me off, especially Downey and Shepherd, who want to come back together again despite their age difference. After that, however, the film is best suited to the circumstances. I was disappointed because I did not expect the film to eventually become immoral. This story had great potential and the scenes in the sky are well done. Peter Cetera and Cher sing a good song song, but in the end the film is not great. For a better and similar movie, try "Sky can wait." Good, but I really wish I didn't see it because of the scenes on the other side. <br /> <br /> *** out ****
