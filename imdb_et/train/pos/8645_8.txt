I had seen this movie years ago and I had had a lasting impression. Unfortunately, over the years, I have tightened up a lot of films and I do not expect California to be impressed again by looking again recently. I am pleased to say that it is a bit nervous and traceable as it was ten years ago. <br /> <br /> There are two things that really give this movie its power. The first one is cast. Young Brad Pitt is amazingly disturbing because of his early grace. Knowing Pitt, as we all do, when one of the most persistent heart feelings Hollywood has ever had is refreshing to see that he is playing such an unpleasant character. Pitt pulls the show out without the white trash bin climate or parody and is able to remain truly frightening throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Juliette Lewis is as impressive as Grace's tragic girlfriend, who is playing for 10 years. old girl forty years old with a life experience. Lewis succeeds in causing harm (his character for the station alive) and contempt (for his naivety), but he supports his performance with a little bit of sophistication that is rarely seen by a young actor. Personally, I think it is a tragedy that neither Pitt nor Lewis had applied for these prizes here. </p> <p> </p> <p> David Duchovony and Michelle Forbes are both perfectly cast pairs who unwantedly travel around the world. USA Pitt and Lewis. Duchovony is terribly naive and naive, and Forbes seems emphatically cynical and closing, but both sides can convincingly portray the changes of their characters because they are attracted, irritated and strangely attracted to Pitt. <br /> <br /> The subtle and uniformly brilliant acting pulling away, this movie pulls us through proverbial balls through its flawless pace. At a time when California appeared, Hollywood released some nice-character-turning-out-be-psychotic movies ("Single White Wife", "Pacific Heights", "Hand Holding The Cradle", "Cheated", "Enemy sleeping ”, etc.). Most of these films followed the same formula, the only variation being the nature of a good boy-boy relationship. "California" is not too far from this territory, but its first two acts are a perfect example of a slow cooking thriller and we are waiting at our seats waiting for the tide to turn. /> <br /> When the penny falls and Pitt is released for manic bad play, the movie shifts completely and the last twenty minutes still doesn't live the movie. This means that the action is thick and fast, and the resolution is cold. The fight is over, but scars are always there. <br /> <br /> Much of the storyline (offered by the somewhat subtle, pre-X-files of Duchovo) is lively. Of course, this is meant to be a book written by the character of Duchovony's journalist, so it could be said that self-conscious narration is meant to drip into the sensational style in which most journalists write. <br /> <br /> The film is largely successful and is definitely over 90% of the last twenty years. Highly recommended, but not weak belly or mind. This movie interferes with more than one level. But then it's meant to be.
