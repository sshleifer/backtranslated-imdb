I'm totally surprised at some of the forum's comments and many comments. I think Tony Scott made a good movie here. Yes, it is very stylized, flashy and up, but it's very fun. I'm happy that at least Ebert and Roeper agree with me :) <br /> <br /> This movie may not be for everyone, but if you like general, dark humor, cool action and dialogue, look at it. <br /> <br /> I've seen a Scott man before, Crimson Tide and the enemy of the country - all good movies, but I like this one more. It's like rollerblading with great soundtrack choices, visual styles, and at the time when all the movies seem to be pg13, it's nice to see that no one is afraid of nudity, gory violence, and clear dialogue. <br /> <br /> It doesn't hurt that Keira is super-hot and even shows its nipples.
