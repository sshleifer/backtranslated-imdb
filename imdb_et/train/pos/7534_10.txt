I disagree with other comments. Everything is basically negative. everyone likes and convinces.Dee Smart reminded me of Marcia Brady's Brady Bunch. But it can really work. The Australian Outback setup is perfect. Secure scenery.Great soundtrack or Paul Kelly.God blesses Paul Kelly. also here.I've seen this movie twice in less than 24 hours. I will probably watch it again. It's so interesting. It will make one think. out. Recall is pleasant. Well captured movie. I couldn't find anything wrong with it. Check it out! My First Review!
