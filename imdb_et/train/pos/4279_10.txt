You know that the end> ​​is not going to be rosy and tragedy, but it is> actually the journey and the characters and their dynamics and how they all fit into "Yugoslavia". > Although I am not Yugonostalgic and I tend to stay away from the current crop of Yugoslav films (give me Ademir> Kenovic at the end of the 90s Kustarica), I would be happy to have the> opportunity again to stumble upon this film as it seems in my> pulp memories. Ever since we see who's singing> 15 years ago, I still hear the themes that the gypsies sing> remembering my head? "I'm miserable,> I was born in this way?" and a horse that makes tunes both funny and sad - late, great actor Pavle Vujisic (a musician when father> was out of business) was memorable as a bus driver that was> a bad trip in his typical but lovable way.
