JIST: Look at something else. <br /> <br /> This movie was rated by Gene Siskel, but after that I can't figure out why. The film is definitely original and different. He sometimes has an interesting dialogue, some cool moments and a horrible feeling. But it's not just fun. Nor does it make much sense in the plot, especially in the motivation of character. I don't know anyone who acts like these characters. <br /> <br /> This is a tough movie that needs to be taken - I advise you not to accept this challenge.
