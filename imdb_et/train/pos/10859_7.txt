Not to be confused with the same name as Resse Witherspoon's high school film, this is a stylized look at the Hong Kong trio gangs. Invited to the election because the new chairman or chairman is elected every two years by ancient traditions. Two candidates are in the post, and through the ego, bribery and past events are the least tense. Expertly led you to introduce you to an expansive lie, without being confused before you express yourself in all your brutal respects. It's not the Asian godfather, but it's an enjoyable thriller in the genre of gangsters that leaves you on the edge of your seat and fights against violence. Subtitled Volume 1 I think it's safe to say there are other contributions when we go deeper into the dark world of triads and all their embarrassing and insecure business transactions. In both cases, this is a good start and if there is no big movie in the queue itself.
