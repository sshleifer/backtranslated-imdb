Stand By Me, Vern and Teddy discuss who was tougher, Superman or Mighty Mouse. My friends and I often talk about winning the fight. Sometimes we get absurd and compare boys like MacGyver and Terminator or Rambo and Matrix. But now it seems we're discussing guys like Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee and Jet Li. It's a pointless comparison that Lee is dead, but it's fun. And if you go from Jet Li to Lethal 4 and Black Mask, you have to say at least that he would fit well with Chani. In this film he is like a God of martial arts. <br /> <br /> The black mask is about a man who was created with many other men, being the highest fighting machine. Their only purpose is to win the wars that other people lose. They are in some ways invincible. It is now a prerequisite for the film, but it does all the amazingly choreographic fighting scenes. Jet Li is admiration. He can do things and with his body that no man should be able to do. That makes her watching so much fun. <br /> <br /> In addition to martial arts, the black mask has humor and is caused by the chemistry that Jet has with his co-star, the police. officer. They're big together. But be honest. if anyone reads this review, they want to know if the film is in the competition department. And the answer to this is surprising YES !!! A lot and lots of trouble with meaningless activities. You love this movie.
