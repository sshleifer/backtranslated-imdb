One of the greatest everyday life secrets is why beautiful girls are so often interested in twitches and heels as a nice boy. <br /> <br /> Worse than nice boys even want to marry these girls, girls STILL prefer jerks and heels, even after the jerks and heels have shown their contempt, they have shown they are just interested in using girls. <br /> <br /> Stu Erwin is a nice guy who is still nice after lying and deceiving and even after a girl's complete loss. <br /> <br /> Clark Gable is a jerk and he has a perfect role, a rather sad note for his fans. br /> <br /> Jean Harlow reaches out as Mae West even when he has heard of La West on some of his cynical tracks. <br /> <br /> It is somewhat puzzling that so many other characters, bad guys - I mean, they're locked, so they have to be - are so nice people. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are many nice people here, people who cheated r movie or story, would be snarling and back-stabbing, but here go out of their way to help someone else. So, maybe the story is quite a clich√©, at least for modern standards, but eventually the viewer has been happy to watch. <br /> <br /> The biggest complaint is that so many really good actors don't get credit. Again, we can say that IMDb.com has a very sharp "thank you".
