Although I do not consider myself a big fan of fairy tales, Stardust was interested in seeing Michelle Pfeiffer as a trailer frog (especially since I saw her as a Velma Von Tussle in the hair color). Boy, is he so convincingly so witch, especially at the beginning and end of her age-ugly makeup! Robert De Niro is also a great captain of pirates who are forced to hide in a "cabinet" to protect their "reputation"! Almost all actors like Claire Danes, Rupert Everett, Ricky Gervais, Peter O'Toole and many others are doing a good job here. Although Danes and Pfeiffer are classic beauty, Sienna Miller, Olivia Grant (like Bernard) and Kate Magowan are stunning faces, especially when we first meet her. Newcomer Charlie Cox is a leading Tristan and he saw as much as his father Dunstan as a young man I thought was in his early scene with Magowan (actually Ben Barnes). Many comments have compared it to Princess Bride, and while I see some similarities, the main difference was that with PB you knew it was just an imaginary story the old man told his grandchild. Stardust usually makes you believe that what you see and hear could actually have happened with all the fun. So I urged Stardust.
