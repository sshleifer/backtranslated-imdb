We are not exposed to movies about brother-sister relationships in Indian cinema or any other language. There are several aspects to this relationship that have not been used in films or novels. Usually the nurse is depicted as piles that can be used for ransom at the peak. This film deals with the substance in a completely different light. <br /> <br /> It is inspired by George Eliot's novel The Mill on the Floss. Brother is very prosaic, all good, blue-eyed boy who is usually a good son and mother's favorite. The sister is romantic, wild and defiant in the unwritten rules of society. Nevertheless, the winner's brother-sister's love is the winner. <br /> <br /> This film talks about the love of the two siblings who have been separated in childhood and have the same feeling of revival when they meet years later. It is also the attempt of the weak brothers to reunite with their sister who has chosen to defy the world. <br /> <br /> Although the film and novel have been separated for about 3 centuries in two distant countries, the feelings are still the same and still true.
