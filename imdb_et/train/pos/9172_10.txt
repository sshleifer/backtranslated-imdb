I learned Charlotte Bronte's novel in high school and I got a great impression. Here was a beautiful novel about a young man's struggle to find love and acceptance in Victorian England's dark time. This young woman was Jane Eyre, a poor and ordinary character with a strong mood and will. His story, told by Bronte Jane's own eyes, was so sad and inspiring. <br /> <br /> In our study, we looked at the 1983 story adaptation, and it blew me away. The Mini series not only made efforts to keep the original text and story of Bronte, but the characters who portrayed the characters were just big. Both Zelah Clarke (Jane Eyre) and Timothy Dalton (by the name of Jane's lover, Rochester's name) struck the character of their characters perfectly. I can't imagine anyone else in my roles. (Other Rochester performances in other versions, such as the 2006 version, lack the passion, energy and tenderness needed to accurately portray Rochester. I say Timothy Dalton comes out because he has all these qualities in his Rochester. Clarke doesn't see not only Jane Eyre, but she captures Jane's quiet but firm and passionate nature perfectly, she keeps her emotions, like the book Jane, in the right moments, but lets her fire out in Jane Language by Clarke and Dalton in their scenes are also plausible and true in relation to Jane's and Rochester's dedicated relationship.) Supporting actors are also perfectly suited to their roles, and the sets fit the story of the story. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this classic Bronte story. If you haven't read this book before, you can watch this production as a beautiful story of this beautiful story.
