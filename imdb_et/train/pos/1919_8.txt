I have not read this book that it was based / inspired. This is some (others are movie roles) last work by John Ritter (RIP), hopefully it's fun. And that is. Almost every time he is there, it really is. Most cast, supporting and regular, play each other well and the material tends to be great. He plays Paul Hennessy, a three teenage father: Rory, a typical man of that age, Kerry, a depressed middle-aged child fighting for causes and awareness, and Bridget, a fashionable loving, popular ditz. Sagal returns to the female main system and her character is far from the Peggy Bund. The exhibition changed somewhat after Mr Three's Company passed on, and for some time it did not seem that they were willing to think if they wanted to laugh or be embarrassed and take care of being respectful. One might ask how and why it lasted so long after that: It may be pretty good, some additions were happy (if you like David Spade, most of his part is made up of his schtick) and who had things to say. My personal favorite episode is last season. Humor is a nice mix of "stupid person" jokes (mostly related to colleges), stupidity, dark comedy and raw materials. It dealt with gender and other adult topics, but never graphically. The tongue is light and sometimes moderately strong. I recommend it to all its fans. 8/10
