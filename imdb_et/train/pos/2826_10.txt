I had the opportunity to see this 1926 movie in a wonderfully restored theater that was once part of the extensive Paramount Vaudeville house chain. This Paramount has the Mighty Wurlitzer organ? also perfectly restored - used to include the silent movies of the day. <br /> <br /> We were fortunate to have Dennis James, who is a key player in the international revival of silent movies, with Mighty Wurlitzer music and thematic compositions that fit the film's action. The publication was an almost perfect digital copy of the rapidly decomposing nitrate volume, and the whole experience was a once-a-a-life opportunity to see a quiet movie as it was meant to be visible. <br /> <br /> was Greta Garbo's first American film. He was only 20 years old, but his repertoire already contained 6 Swedish films. <br /> <br /> It is somewhat ironic that it is a silent movie opera; Though Mighty Wurlitzer added an enormous mass scene, much imagination was required. <br /> <br /> Modern audiences mostly don't understand silent movies? The action was then different, with expansive gestures and wide facial expressions. That's why viewers laugh at the inappropriate time? to act is considered to be a tooth and too much done? but it was just a period style. <br /> <br /> Garbo, along with all his nuances, did a lot to lead the new exhibition era: he could say more with a semi-closed eye and volumes could be counted down or with a simple shoulder. He showed the truism that "the picture is worth a thousand words". <br /> <br /> Although it is Garbo's first American film, it is obvious that the studio knew what they had in their hands: it was MGM's best film making. Sets and costumes were great. Special Effects? What are today's weak standards? were still electric and amazing. <br /> <br /> The Vicente Blasco Ibanez (Entre Naranjos novel) script seems to be customized for Garbo; it shows its strengths, increases its assets and is not tedious to deal with a language problem: a Swedish actress can play a Spanish sense of language without having to stop unbelief. <br /> <br /> His co-star was MGM's response to Rudolph Valentino: Ricardo Cortez. She does a wonderful job and did something that would make a couple of romantic stars in the movie: let herself look insecure, seem stupid and grow old. <br /> <br /> Are some good features that have worked more than enough? especially if you think Powerhouse was Garbo. Notable among them is Lucien Littlefield like Cupido and Martha Mattox as Do√±a Bernarda Brull. "<br /> <br /> Is this when the extraordinary operator William H. Daniels met Garbo? they made 20 movies together. (He was the operator's operator on 157 films and his career lasted for five decades!) He was able to capture his essential beauty and his photography was primarily a responsible moniker through which he learned: Divine Garbo. Without her excellent abilities, she would not have had the success she had. <br /> <br /> Seeing this movie is too rare: if you ever have a chance, don't miss it.
