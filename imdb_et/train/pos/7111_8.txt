*** SPOILERS *** Movies from the First World War II, coming from Hollywood, showing how war on those GIs or, in this case, the US Navy who fought in it. <br /> <br /> 21-year-old Al Schmid, John Garfield, just started living with a well-paid job, earning about $ 40.00 a week at a local steel factory and a girlfriend Ruth Hartley, Elenore Parker, whom he was going to marry when the Japanese all for him spoiled, and millions of young Americans attacking Pearl Harbor's US Pacific fleet. By doing his job as an American citizen Al, he immediately joined the US Marine Corps, hoping to get back to Japan to find out correctly that the Navy would be the first American combat units. Finally, Al finally became an opportunity, as his unit, the 1st Maritime Department, on the 7th of August 1942, in the remote Solomon Islands of Guadalcanal, the Japanese, who were under his control. During the Battle of the Beauty River, Al almost stopped one massive Japanese Banzai attack, holding a wave with its machine gun after the identified Japanese suicide attacks were helped or strengthened. It was during a bloody fight Al hit the face of a Japanese garnet that ended up dazzling him. <br /> <br /> Now back in the States Naval Hospital Al has faced something much harder to overcome then battling battalion-sized attacks with Japanese or German soldiers. He is facing a future where he never sees again and has to depend on others to take care of him or her! <br /> <br /> In the movie "The Pride of the Navy", Al's battle is much harder, he made the Japanese troops in Guadalcanal just with his disability. Not wanting anyone, especially his girlfriend Ruth, to feel bad for him, is actually the one who feels more than someone else in the movie. It is with the help of the naval soldier Virginia Pfeiffer, Rosemary DeCamp and Rutd, with the US sailor Lee Diamond, Dane Clark, to finally give Al the courage to face his darkness with the same intensity that he faces a wave after a wave of Japanese troops in Gudalcanal. Courage Al thought he had lost back the hell of this God-abandoned island in the South Pacific. <br /> <br /> Based on US Sea Sergeant Albert Schmid, "Navy Pride" brought out what we expected from tens of thousands of injured US military personnel who came back from the war. We see how people fighting war are in many ways more difficult to adapt to a peacetime America than when they left something like Al Schmid on the battlefield. Ali's battle against his personal demons was much harder than the Japanese, that he fought for being part of him and so they had to fight themselves to overcome them and eventually win. Despite the help she received from her sister Virginia as well as her girlfriend Ruth, as well as her naval doctor, with a striking resemblance to actor Gregory Peck, Al was still able to overcome her fears. The fear he and only he had in the battle, as well as the way he was all in the film, was all.
