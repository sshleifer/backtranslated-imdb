I read that it wasn't good that the story wasn't sure Volckman felt like he was in some way unsuccessful. <br /> <br /> I disagree. First, it is well done. Volckman is doing well to not only try a new technique, but to focus on what is worth thinking about: does immortality reduce the value of life? The big question ... <br /> <br /> I see he is trying to build a lesson and he is not a compromise. That must be praised. I am sure that in this form the creation of the characters was interesting. I've seen artists minimize the minimum form to build the current state. I identify this movie with it. <br /> <br /> In addition, it's much more interesting than Richard Linklater's Roto Scale and Volckman's story have more meaning than Linklater's recent stories of drug use. Old news. Everyone knows this, but nobody does it. Renaissance has more to offer, something new. And there are many more stories with lots of holes that do much better. <br /> <br /> Well done, Volckman. Really nice work.
