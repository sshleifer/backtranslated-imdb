Yes, I say before the commentary begins, this movie is incredibly underestimated. <br /> <br /> Sharon Stone is in the role of Catherine Trammell as Morrissey as Dr Glass. He is an analyst who appreciates him after the death of a sportsman. The glass is pulled into the seductive game that Trammel uses to manipulate his mind. <br /> <br /> Operation was good (except Thewlis) <br /> <br /> Stone really has a talent in this role. She's slippery, naughty and seductive and doesn't look like a day when she did the first. He really impressed (like in the casino). Morrisey was also good. He showed a lot of vunerablitity role that needed it. However, Thewlis was flat. He destroyed his character and was all the way. She really sucks. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is not the first, but the stone is nice to watch. Just ignore Thewlit.
