Seeing this movie was a bit skeptical because fantasy movies aren't always my cup of tea. Especially romantic fantasy. <br /> <br /> Little did I know I was driving through cinema. All the movies in the movie from dialogue to effect were very close. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes shines like the movie she's in this movie. From the beginning to the end, you fall in love with this character. <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer is a threatening witch who has been cursed to capture the star for ever young and beautiful. <br /> <br /> Robert De Niro is a lovable character who gives the audience the greatest comic relief, as the film has been gaining momentum. <br /> <br /> In general, it was a movie that surprised me and was a fan of the film. If you're looking for a fun and enjoyable movie that's fun for both children and adults, Stardust is the way to go.
