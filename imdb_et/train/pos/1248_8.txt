"Golden Child" was Eddie Murphy's first film after her megahit "Beverly Hills Cop". And while it's not as good as "Cop," it's a fun comic adventure. Murphy stars as a missing child finder who has been assigned the most unusual case. His task: to find the character of the title, the child with mystical power. This movie could have been titled "The Beverly Hills Cop and Doom Temple" because some of this movie plays like the Spielberg adventure, like Indiana Jones comedy. It has a laughing comedy and special adventure. A lot of fun. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
