Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen AND Robson Green! Wow, what trio ... OK, so it's not Anna Karen, but it's a good love story, very well written and well-acted. Even a couple of "laugh-loud" moments that have been mixed with some very serious observations of fidelity, age, and age / Alzheimer's disease. <br /> <br /> Pretty guitar music also added a story. br /> <br /> Although I've been an Annis fan since 'Lillie' (70s) and Mr. Kitchen is from "The Buccaneers" and "Enchanted April", I recently discovered Mr.. Green ("me and Mrs. Jones," "the evil", etc.) that makes me ask - why haven't I recently seen "Reckless"? Indeed, more "chick flick" than anything a man is sitting through is ideal for a lazy look of a rainy afternoon.
