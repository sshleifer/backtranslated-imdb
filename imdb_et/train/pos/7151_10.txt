I read the 5th grade holes, so when I heard they were making a movie, I was ecstatic! Of course, being my busy myself, I didn't get the chance to see the movie in theaters. The holes were just near the city, but unfortunately we were just too busy. I was surprised to hear that all my friends had seen it and one of them hadn't invited me! They all said it was good, but I've read great books that have made harsh movies so I was definitely concerned. <br /> <br /> Suddenly this was a great way to see it. It was this week and my parents went on a cruise and had a babysitter. My sister who is 9, and I looked at it and loved it! Then I took it to other people I was a babysitter and their children, 9 and 4, liked it. Even my parents loved it and they are very filmmakers. In general, I recommend this movie to anyone who understands family morals and loves fun! This movie should be on your top 5 "look" list !!
