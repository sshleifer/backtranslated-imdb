I first saw this movie. I was about 9 years old. old and found this movie so much fun and terrifying and unlike other movies I had seen until then. <br /> <br /> BASE: The expedition will be sent from Earth to the Fourth Planet of Altair, a great success in the constellation Aquilae, to find out what happened to the colonies who moved thirteen years ago and had not heard since then. <br /> <br /> THEME: The lower civilization (namely, we) is exposed to the remnants of a highly developed alien civilization, Krell-200,000 years removed. The "seed" of destruction from one civilization is passed on to another, unknowingly at the beginning. The theme of this movie is very good and evil. <br /> <br /> I first saw this movie with my brother. I was just a boy and the tiger scenes really scared me, as well as the battle scenes with invisible force. I was also surprised to see the real things in the movie. (if at all) comes into contact with an advanced (alien) civilization that is much more advanced than we are. Advanced technology and responsibility seem to go hand in hand. We need to do our job to gain knowledge with the wisdom of using high technology. This is, in my opinion, a great moral of the film. <br /> <br /> At college, I learned that "knowledge is power" is actually the right one at best! Knowledge is "potential" power depending on how it is applied (... if applied at all.) [This is not what you know, but how do you know what you know!] <br /> <br /> The effect of this film can sometimes be possible in the future of mankind. This is knowledge and it is not enough in itself, we have to be able to really depend on the control of our destiny. <br /> <br /> Thanks to those who have commented and corrected on previous versions of this article, they are all very welcome! I hope this story is so fun when I've been in the last 40 years ... <br /> <br /> Rating: 10 out of 10 stars
