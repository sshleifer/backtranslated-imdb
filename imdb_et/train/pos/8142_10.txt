This movie may be incredibly silly when you first watch it. But if you randomly look at this second and third and fourth and fifth times (I'm well hundreds now), you'll find yourself out of here and there and burst yourself! My friends and I are actually scared of Black Hat parties to get more friends, "as they say, with riots".
