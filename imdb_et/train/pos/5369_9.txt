Small Spoilers Arnold celebrates in the near future as Ben Richards, an improperly convicted, playing a deadly television game "Running Man" where people have to move to try and brutally escape deaths. Of course, people will eventually have to die and Arnold to misrepresent the system. <br /> <br /> I have not read Stephen King's book, but this is a great movie, no matter whether one of Arnold's best. He does what he does best, doing death with unforgettable one-liners. The classic is probably "He was a real neck neck" after a boy stroke of strangulation and "He had to share!", Referring to the location where he was just someone vertically in the harvest. Dawson is excellently irritating the TV tuner and all "Stalkers" are in the camp. The action is violent, but his action film. That's the thing. The movie is fast paced and after 90 minutes it will not exceed the greeting. <br /> <br /> Starsky and Hutch with Paul Michael Glaser, who was in the wheel and made the success of the Terminator, was previously considered to be another meaningless passenger car by Arnold and far removed. But today, everyone who watches a lot of TV saw the film coming closer to reality. I would not be surprised to turn on the TV in the "near future" and see an example that is far from it. <br /> <br /> In this depressing remark, I still have to recommend a "running man" to anyone who likes 80s, Arnold, ridiculous deeds or violence, or just a good movie. 9. 5/10
