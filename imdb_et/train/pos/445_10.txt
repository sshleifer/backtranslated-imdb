I saw Enchanted in April about five years ago. I loved it so much that my husband surprised me with the next copy of Christmas. It is about two women who decide to rent a castle in Italy in April, leaving their misery behind them. They are very sad women at the beginning of the film and you can't help but root them when they plan to leave with the other two women they call together to share the cost. This is probably the best-known film I've ever seen. It is clean and simple, without cars, hostility or death. It was prepared carefully and with a very good taste. You can't smile at it unless you're crying for happy tears!
