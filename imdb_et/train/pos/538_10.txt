Back to the Cabin by the Lake is perhaps one of the few queues that can live on the original. It was black humor, a good stop, nice girls and of course Psycho Killer. What do we have? I mean something. Except we have a small amount of gore and nudity because it was meant for television. Aside from being one of the best offspring, it is one of the best thrillers looking at the family. Recommended for everyone.
