Suppose people give up the bad effects of the original because time is the original Battlestar series masterpiece, even with all the stars, the story and the art. Lorne Greene was great because Adama and Richard Hatch were perfect because Apollo and Dirk Benedict were funny as Starbuck, but I dare say it's not as beautiful as Katee as Starbuck. <br /> <br /> I loved the episode with Pegasus and greeting from Earth was good John Calicos was great because Baltar, God's War, the best was Experiment Terras, I thought it was a tribute in Heaven can wait, then Battlestar's women were not to compare them to say that Tricia, who is as beautiful as six, but Jane Seymour's beauty could not be compared. Not to mention Loerrta Spang, because Cassiopea was fantastic. She was beautiful to make the rainbow embarrassing. I loved the original as much as new. <br /> <br /> Could you imagine if John Calicos had six months? :) <br /> <br /> Thank you for listening.
