This movie is definitely one of my favorite films. The communication between honorable and morally corrupt characters is a competition and honor code among shadows and policemen. It deals with issues such as commitment, guilt, word, manipulation and trust, as some films have done, and unfortunately I cannot be reminded of the death of the police in the late 1970s. The order is delicious, up to what is necessary, living something out and putting the spectator on a masterful plot correctly and wrongly, without the need for outstanding and remarkable scenes that are often needed on smaller copies of the genre to keep the audience awake. There is no need for such scenes. The argument is flowing and honest to the spectator, which is an important genre that often reaches the audience. No, it won't leave Marble ... For the music, congratulations on watching and enjoying every minute, not just seeing.
