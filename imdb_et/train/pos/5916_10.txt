I watched this movie from Ralph Baksh (Wizards, Hey Good Lookin), one night ago at www.afrovideo.org, and I didn't see anything racial (I'm not stupid), I admit that character designs are a bit raw and unlikely today, but I think this is a satire and the stories of the very old town of Remus, created by the Black American culture, as the main characters and blatantly "Tar Tar Baby" and "Briar Patch." These are not dedicated stories in mind, but created by black Americans cultural icons and I was a white woman who read and loves these stories. And I found it also an interesting time-capsule view of black culture in New York, Harlem, in the 1970s. <br /> <br /> Well, to reach the mood of this movie - this movie is a lively action / animation that begins with live action with a man named Sampson (Barry White) and a preacher (Charles Gordone) to help his friend Randy ( Philip Michael Thomas) escape from prison, but stops the roadblock and stop shooting with the police. While waiting for them, Randy involuntarily listens to Pappy's (Scatman Crothers) release, as he begins to tell Randy about a young brother Rabbit's story about a new big city that rises quickly over Harlem. you know me, Rabbit, Bear and Fox are versions of Randy, Sampson, and preacher animals. Abstract stylized animation and the deviation of living film material, the film is a graphic and condemnation satire of stereotypes that have spread in the 1970s? racial, ethnic and otherwise. So, this is another good Bakshi movie; and should we sweep such films? pretend they never exist? hmmm ... I think it would be a shame; I think we should look at these films to entice and learn what happens when we come from that time.
