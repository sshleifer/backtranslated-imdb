*** 1/2 Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Hope Davis, Adam Scott, Philip Baker Hall. Director Richard Shepard. <br /> <br /> A well-crafted story and movie, Brosnan has never been in a movie role outside his "Bond" movies. After 2004, "New Sunset" is her newest role to laugh and a great time. A professional brawler, Julian Noble at a workplace in Mexico, ends up on the contrary, a high-stake businessman, Danny Wright (Kinnear, perhaps one of his best roles) in the business there. The two duo on the screen produce a comically charged, smiling rebellion and can't laugh. Davis has one of his best roles as "American Splendor" gives another charming and spiritual performance. One year's most enjoyable and best movies. My last rating 9/10
