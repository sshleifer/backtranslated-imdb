Gorgeous Barbara Bach plays Jennifer Fast, a television reporter who travels with his team (Karen Lamm and Lois Young) to Solvang, California to cover the Danish festival. The problem is that their accommodation has failed and all hotels in the city are full. So they travel far from the city and use the seemingly friendly hospitality of Ernest Keller (phenomenal Sydney Lassick). Don't you know, Ernest and stupid partner Virginia (Lelia Goldoni) hide a big secret in their basement: the unfortunate, deformed, diaper-clad "Junior" (Stephen Furst, a remarkable force) who ultimately terrorizes girls. <br /> <br /> Lassick, a clenched slut, plays a real monster in this disturbing little horror film. It relies slowly but surely on intense confrontation / climax, giving horror in small doses up to the last half hour. Hotel and Predicting Basement - "Psycho" great echoes here - have great settings. The most perverse plot is the incest and patricians, which allows the film to have a really dark quality. And yet it becomes poisonous when we realize that Junior is not a one-dimensional evil bogeyman, but as much as a victim as girls. The final picture is particularly sad. <br /> <br /> "Unseen" is a definite little horror that deserves to be discovered. <br /> <br /> 8/10
