It's a strange but somehow impressive story of love. Personality, I never go in such a difficult story in real life. But I can have a picture there. <br /> <br /> This is a story that promises to be "sick". But after I look at it, I did not get the feeling of "illness" that would surely be related to the rules of society. There's something beautiful in this movie ... something impressive ... that I can't resist with any moral or social rules. <br /> <br /> The film focuses mainly on the relationship between Kiki and Alex. You will see how this relationship begins, develops and finally ends. You know the moment when this love flourishes, the first whispers, touches. You know the connection. And nothing, though it is moral. You even hope it won't end ... it can't break ... it's not right. Ultimately, it seems that the intermittent pain is ... <br /> <br /> But I have to add this comment to the negative spin ... I don't know if this story has anything * showed * to feel these relationships are ill only in form but not in content. You don't have the whole story, just the fragments. When the film started, the relationship between Kiki and Sandu already existed. So, there is no hint of the nature of the relationship. You only feel the tension between them ... fighting between the need for love and breaking it. I think this is what Kiki says to Sandu, "I want to stop ... and if you love me, you do as I ask". <br /> <br /> This movie is likely to interfere with some of the issues that are love and what is moral ... and where is the boundary between them. I don't know if the idea of ​​this movie is "love conquers all ... even social and moral standards" or "love is beautiful ... no matter how or where". But in my opinion, this movie is already successful for the simple reason that it makes you think ...
