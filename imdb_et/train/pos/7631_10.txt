Kurt Russell's chameleon-like performance, along with John Carpenter's flawless film making, undoubtedly makes it one of the best boob-tube bios ever seen. It also holds back: the emotional foundation is strong enough to never get old; Carpenter has survived the life and supremacy of one and only King of Rock and Roll. (I was the biggest Elvis fan of my life, but only when I saw this desperate movie that I was looking at myself in the picture. It was a revelation.) ELVIS remains one of the top ten films of all time.
