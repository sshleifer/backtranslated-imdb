I was not a fan of seeing this movie, but when my gf called me and said he was free with an advanced screening mark, I only noted eva longoria for sight and jason biggs smile. <br /> In general, it was actually better than I expected, but not much. it was like a hybrid of how a boy would lose in 10 days and like heaven. a typical romantic comedy with your moments. the film was quite short (about 85 min) but it was enough to tell the whole story, build some character developments and be a decent happy ending. The whole idea that the ghost was before his former husband was an interesting plot to follow. eva did a good job of keeping sarcasm and paul rudd and the rest of the cast (especially the jason biggs) kept laughing smoothly. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie just liked it because there was a good deal of laugh to keep me different if I had given it a lower rating. Hey his chick flick and i watch this movie boyfriend persepctive alright, it would be a more fair fight if women review this movie and gave there thoughts about it.
