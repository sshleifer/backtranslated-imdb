Michael Cacoyannis has had a relatively long career, but his name has surprisingly few credits, including some real duds, such as the ununny cold war satire day when the fish came. However, Iphigenia has been highlighted. The Cacoyannis-adapted Euripides game is higher than the classic tragedy, and the latter made its first television in the United States for many years on the Flix channel. The film is filmed on an epic scale, but it is certainly not a "big" film, with an emphasis on a simple story: by asking the gods, King Agamemnon (Kostas Kazakos) is forced to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia (Tatiana Papamoschou), a lot of fearfulness of Queen Clytemnastrae (Irene Papas). Kazakos and Papas are both prominent, but it is a stunning Papamoschou who brings the most interesting elements of the screen, mixing the innocence of childhood with the consciousness that he is a pawn of a political game. Recommended for international cinema fans.
