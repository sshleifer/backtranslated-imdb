Life is a very fun SCI-FI movie from Japan. I've noticed a lot of disappointed films that loved Versus's debut film or his third film Azumi. I've heard that they are bleeding movies with swords and zombies and all kinds of sweets. Frankly, I went to a video shop to get Versus, but I'm just Alive. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a wall-to-wall action, Alive is not your choice. Nevertheless, there are quite a number of measures that are paid for the whole hour-long set-up. Personally, I think it's well done and worth it. <br /> <br /> Of course, some of the plots are stupid as with many SCI-Fi films, and I think that subtitles using the term "foreign object" could have been replaced by a parasite for greater effect. This film is brutal if it has to be so weak that the heart does not have to be required. <br /> <br /> They only kept the budget mostly by limiting their activities to one underground building (taking out the cube)), but the film doesn't suffer for it. Another bonus for this movie is the intense Gothic imagery made with great artistic elegance during many Flashbacks and dream sequences. <br /> <br /> Rent it!
