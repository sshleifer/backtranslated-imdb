The sudden effect is a two-part story. Harry is targeting the mobile who wants to kill him and Harry is very pleased to return the favor and show them how it is done. This little war puts Harry in a halt, which he doesn't care about, but he goes on a little vacation. Now the story of the second part. Someone kills some punks and Harry gets into a situation where he meets Jennifer Spencer with a woman who has a secret that a small tourist town wants to remain silent. The police chief is not a subtle person and he warns Harry that he will not interfere or cause problems. This is Harry Callahan's Trouble. The crowd is watching her in this city and hell opens when Harry goes to war. In the meantime, the vigilants are attacking again and the gang who guessed it is ready for him. Jennifer Spencer is caught and Harry will be able to save the movie at the peak. The sudden effect is not the biggest dirty Harry, but at that time it gives us Harry, a very big hero who is ready to go just to continue justice. Again, not the best not the worst, but the one with the most memorable line. Go ahead Make your day.
