This movie is available from David Shepard and Kino before Hollywood, featuring Fort Lee, NJ, although it is a shortened version with only "movie back". I'm not sure if Blackhawk's movies had just a movie Printout those parts, or they changed other scenes. The original Blackhawk version was withdrawn from A Movie Romance. The full function will survive, but the printout of this version was somewhat of a disintegration of nitrates and a few sections seemed bad, so there may be a reason to edit the Blackhawk version. <br /> <br /> The film is directed by Maurice Tourneur, who has been played by Tourneur himself or more likely by his caricature, presumably by the director Emile Chautard, and the future director Joseph von Sternberg, the painter Mary (Doris Kenyon) longs for a romantic man who wipes her from the legs, he dreams of a troubadour who wakes up, but it is only interrupted by the local boy, Johnny Applebloom. <br /> <br /> Meaning a movie company from New York is shooting in the western countryside. Mary sees the Indian language (full-length) and creates a disorder - the scene that the film company is filming is spoiled. He has immediately attracted the attractive film star Kenneth Driscoll (Robert Warwick). She encourages her to leave home and try to become an actor in a big city. <br /> <br /> When he arrives at the studio, he discovers that all the films are fake. Doors and walls are just apartments that are quickly assembled for the kit. This western hero or heroine's happy midfield has just behaved. Sets are in a large rotating phase, so the sun's angle can even be manipulated. The black sender of the studio signs all the "autographed" photos of the movie stars. Signs on the wall say "Positively No Smoking", but everyone smokes anyway. Even movie titles (nicely illustrated) emphasize everything that is fake about the life of the film. <br /> <br /> The star of the movie, Driscoll, has been bullied against everyday filmmaking. He temporarily makes a girlfriend from Vivian (Jun Elvidge) to continue this "exciting" girlfriend. His plans are crossed when Mary's screen control is smelly. We don't see the real movie, but only the audience's painful reactions to it. <br /> <br /> Mary is devastated, but she does not want to return home to her for failing, so she continues to see Driscoll and we have her dinner with other policemen, soldiers, cowboy, and others. <br /> <br /> Mary decides to stop with Driscoll. At a party with his film "friends", he agrees to marry him, although there is not much love between them. Surprisingly, his mother appears with a cake, especially for Mary's birthday. It forces Mary to evaluate her future. <br /> <br /> This movie has all kinds of exciting studios, movie sets, changing rooms, editing rooms, etc. scenes, when a quiet movie was made, this film is hidden behind the curtain.
