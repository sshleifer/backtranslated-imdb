I do not agree with the "ctomalvelu" Jim Belushi talent. I happen to be like Belushi. Of course, I was skeptical when he first appeared on the scene because I was so late a brother John's very big fan. But Jim has the magic of the screen that has come to him very far - and he has developed well over the years. <br /> <br /> Curly Sue is one of her earlier films - her weight is a gift (isn't it most of us?) - and I like the movie. Yes, it is a touching and affectionate warming, so if you are driving, exploding, and free sex, you might want to pass it on - it's a warm movie of three lost soles who find each other. Don't get me wrong, I have all three of the above keys for a successful movie, but I also like this nice, solid story like this. <br /> <br /> And while Belushi and Kelly Lynch perform great performances, the real star of this movie is Alisan Porter, who is absolutely divine. <br /> <br /> I don't know what happened to her career, but who is responsible for dropping the ball (agent? parents)? You couldn't ask for a more prestigious presentation to be famous than this movie, but you haven't heard of it since then. <br /> <br /> The second sad Hollywood story ...
