In the autumn of 1979, the birth of the US television film "The Beatles" has actually been the best movie ever to talk about four Liverpool stores that have revolutionized the music industry and the world. As was said from former Beatle Pete Best. The whole cast is great, but especially Stephen Mackenna's performance by John Lennon and Rod Culbertson like Paul McCartney. The film was made by legend Rock and Roll, Dick Clark. Who In 1978 Was The Second Television Film That Has Tried Over The Time The Leading Role Of "Kurt Rusell" With Another Musical Legend; "ELVIS". This film was directed by an unknown director called "John Carpenter" who led other successful films, for example; "Halloween", "Escape from New York" and "The Thing". The same can be said of Richard Marquand, head of the "Beatle Birth". He led many other theater artists like "Star Wars Return Jedi", "Needle Eye" and "Jagged Edge" among many others. The only other film about Fab Four, which I know, is Back Beat, which had a theatrical edition in 1994. But critics do not care about this, nor the public, because it did not have a long life in theater. The Beatles Birth is a very charming and simplified film that gives you the beginning of the legend and the struggles and hardships, and ends where they arrive in NYC and appear in Ed Sullivan's exhibition in 1964.
