A pretty funny Jim Carrey vehicle that has him as a journalist who temporarily gets the power of God and breaks down the chips. Carrey has returned to a familiar country here and is looking forward to a good time, and Jennifer Aniston, with her girlfriend, is also charming and influential. The story is extreme, but the cast (including Morgan Freeman as "God") is great and makes the movie a valuable asset. GRADE: B
