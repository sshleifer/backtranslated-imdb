Kubrick proved his brilliance again, now in a film of horror, based on Stephen King's book. Jack Torrance is a man forty years, married, with one child and worries and alcoholism. Overlook Hotel in Colorado stops service due to extreme weather conditions during the winter, and a person who takes care of those five months is well paid; and Torrance, who wanted to become a writer, found it perfect. But the chairman advised Torrance at this point of loneliness in the winter, potentially dangerous, and told him that a past caregiver went crazy and killed his family. Even before he got there, his son Danny, who had some imaginative friend who would shine him in the future, knew that the place was not good and he didn't want to go. When they installed the hotel themselves, things started right, but within one month, Jack started to act strange, upset and depressed. We know now that something is happening, but do not know when and how. Frightening things happen, for example, with two twin girls talking to Danny and someone who attacked him violently. They are not alone in this place. Later, Jack began to see other people and feel good with them as if his family were; among them was the psychotic caregiver Delbert Grady. Grady tells Torrance that she must kill her family because they are invading the hotel. Following this procedure, Jack went to the goal and many of the most frightening things I've ever seen. The end is remarkable and the viewers remain interested and shocked until the last minute.
