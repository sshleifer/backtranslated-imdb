Nobody is working on this job! Awesome movie! In a letter, loved by Ira Levin and represented by Christopher Reeve's best result and one of Caine's best, it's just great. I wish I could catch a staged version somewhere ... maybe I'll never. I hope that this highly undervalued, neglected film has not become too complicated because it is necessary for any Hitchcockian, Agatha-ph or great movie lover. One of the very few films I could not immediately solve or predict and which was worth the second or even the third viewing, "Deathtrap" gets 9/10 and earns every iota. We need and deserve more such movies!
