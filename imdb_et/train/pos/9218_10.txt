First of all, let me say that I wanted to see this movie for about a year because I knew Angelina Jolie was in it and I love her. But my love for him is not my opinion of the film. Anyway, no video store was wearing it, but low and look at the local library. I watched it and loved it. Yes, there were Italian stereotypes, but it was good and funny. It was in no way humiliating. <br /> <br /> Every actor and actor did a great job. I laughed very sexually with humor. In general, I think this movie is worth watching when you find it. It's divine and just fun to watch. I rarely put 10 on movies, but I'll give it to 10! <br /> <br /> Go find it and watch it!
