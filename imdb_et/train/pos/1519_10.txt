Given how these movies are, you have to show that they have to have fun. The film focuses on a house that strangely accommodates people living there. The inhabitants were: author Charles Hillyer (Denholm Elliott (with hair!)), Haunted by one of his own creations; Philip Grayson (Peter Cushing), who gets a little too close to the shape of the wax; John Reid (Christopher Lee), whose daughter's brightness is probably the facade; and actor Paul Henderson (Jon Pertwee), getting a little too much character. Lee). Apart from being just a pure situation, there may be some effects: it may call into question the real horror and the anticipated horror issue. Like "The Shining", we could ask if the house / hotel itself remembers the events of the past. And if nothing else, Ingrid Pitt (with Paul) is HOT HOT HOT! At the time it came out, he also played "Countess Dracula" and "Vampire Lovers" (also with Peter Cushing). Perhaps he - like Barbara Steele - is still known as a laughing king, but celebrates her words: SHE IS HOT SCREAM QUEEN! I would like to see that Ingrid Pitt and Barbara Steele together participate in the stars. You read that right. What's the name "Denholm" anyway? Oh well. Very cool movie.
