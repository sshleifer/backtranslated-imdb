"This" 70th century show "is definitely the most entertaining show on TV now. I started watching it about two and a half years ago and as soon as I saw it, I can say it was a great show. I like all the characters, but my personal favorites are Fez and Kelso. Leo was also a great place when he was there, I hope he'll come back because he's fun. It's classic when Fez goes "your slut!" And when Kelso "burns!" they always make me laugh. They are both big characters and they always have something funny to say. Jackie is hot, there is just one reason to watch this example; she started with a very good look, but fucking, somewhere in the season 5-6 she just really hot I've seen most episodes more than once, some 10 times, and there's more fun, which is one of the few that I can see again and again and still laugh as much as I saw it for the first time. almost every One of the funny, where many exhibitions are some funny characters. I'm sad to see this show next year, but it's going to be like one of the best shows.
