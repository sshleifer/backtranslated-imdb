OK - Up to 2 versions of this movie. Two people took part in the production - John Korty and Bill Couterie (George was just the manufacturer - he didn't really have anything to say in the movie - he just helped with money) - The "Adult" version was made possible by Bill Couterie. John Korty disliked and disapproved of this version (as it was done behind). Thanks to submissive Ladd movies, they didn't advertise this movie and threw their ad spending on "The Right Things", hoping it would pull them out ... and it wasn't. So, this movie never got any chance. When "twice" led the cable (HBO) - they showed the Bill version of the roll and John threatened to complain when it was shown (did you notice how the "adult" version wasn't very long?). Showtime got a "clean" version. The video tape and the CD have a version approved by John (who has more energy than Bill). It is a pity, really, because the "adult" version is actually better and it makes sense. But it is very doubtful that it will ever be released on this version of DVD (or any other bootleg format). Sorry to cheat on everyone. I know all this information because I used to be twice as an occasional fan club president (still having many movie elements - using my adult version of a letterbox version, but it was stolen) HBO has a partial HBO copy. 8 letters for the "adult" version - 5 for the clean version. Other questions, just ask.
