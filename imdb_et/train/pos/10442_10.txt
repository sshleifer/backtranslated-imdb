It's really one of the best movies I've ever seen about love. No other than "Before Sunset", which is technically not yet another movie, because it is about the same people and the same romance. <br /> <br /> It's "love" in the real world. OK, this is only when most people are as smart and beautiful as the film's leaders. Reading other comments, I want to know how many other people are crazy about dialogue-based movies. And that's what makes "before sunrise" so good. Dialogue is perfect. It's so real, so interesting and funny. It is hardly a surprise that Jesse and Celine fall in love, "coz with whom you love them at the same time. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is in a cafe where they pretend to be their best friends over the phone, others pretend to be the best friend. Brings you back to the moment you love your first time. <br /> <br /> I have to say that if you have a choice, check out "before sunrise" before "Sunset" before watching. then I first looked at "Sunset", it is hard to show two young lovers regret and sadness during the whole show. <br /> <br /> Again, the greatest romantic film in my books, wonderful action, great script and beautiful places. .
