A 14-year-old girl develops her first serious breakthrough for a 17-year-old boy who lives close by trying to overcome his feelings over his older sister. This is the simple premise of Director Robert Mulligan's beautiful and poetic age movie. Mulligan is famous for his formerly '42nd summer of 1971 and killed a regrettable bird in 1962, two giants of age. Here he leads newcomers in key roles: Reese Witherspoon, on his film as a 14-year-old girl; Emily Warfield as an older sister; Jason London, court, 17-year-old boy. Reese Witherspoon is amazingly good in her film debut, showing every emotion a 14-year-old girl knows about the love and hurt of young people, never in a false message. Warfield and London are equally good. The film accurately depicts the thoughts or feelings of each adolescent with a heartfelt sensitivity to love, never to break into the excess of maudlin. Kudos is Jenny Wingfield's autobiographical scenario; it is one of the few films of young love that is honest and consistent without being emotionally dishonest or sensational. Music is wonderfully simple, emphasizing the tone and mood of the scene to the scene, but never intrusive. Beautiful cinematography is the famous fearsman Freddie Francis, who was in his 70s when it was shot. Tess Harper and Sam Waterston play girls' parents with a dead target in 1957, caring, rigorous and emotionally simple. Gail Strickland is also good as a boy's mother. In this sense, the sensitive film has feelings that need to be identified, learned to learn, and the truths that need to be addressed. It is now Robert Mulligan's latest film. This is one of the best films of 1991. **** 4 stars.
