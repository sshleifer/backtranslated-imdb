STORM STATE TESS is probably the best movie of all Mary Pickford films. After two hours, the silent movie of 1922 was quite a long time, but it continues to interest about 80 years after filming. Mary sometimes plays a role in her best performances, which seems to be the "greatest hit" performance, with innocent Mary's little devil, Mary, Mary's little mother, Mary's spunk, Mary's romantic heroine, etc. previously used in one movie. The film is surprisingly sincere about one supportive character of an illegal child in 1922, and at one point our little Mary is believed to be the mother concerned! If the Academy's awards had been around 1922, it would undoubtedly have been the best actor of the year, Oscar.
