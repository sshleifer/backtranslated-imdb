This is a better adaptation of the book than to Paltrow (although I liked it too). It's not so much that Beckinsale is better - they are both very good, but it's better. Davies is a master of Austen filming, and production values ​​are great here. It's not as shiny as Hollywood treatment, but it's close and I thought the places and costumes worked better.
