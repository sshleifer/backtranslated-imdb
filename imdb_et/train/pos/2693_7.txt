Although the story is essentially routine and the "surprise" end is nothing but a bad joke for the audience, you see what attracted those good actors to the project - it offers them roles where good actors can shine and shine them. The film is perfect - by then. It was restored in "suspected" in 2000, and if you only want to see one version of the story (that's all it deserves, really), I suggest the latest Hopkins up-to-date and more specific references to plot points that the original may only suggest. However, the end is blowing. (** 1/2)
