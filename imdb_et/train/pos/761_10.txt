I just want to say that among all the so-called classic hip-hop movies I can see Wild Style, KrushGroove, Breakin, Style Wars and so on. IMO BEAT STREET is the best among others. When I ask other people who are their fave, it seems that BEAT STREET appears the most. However, it is the lowest. 4.3 is just "under the belt" (if you say, 5 points are a belt). I like music performances, breakdancing wants me to spin, RAMO makes me want to throw ... c'mon, its classic !!!
