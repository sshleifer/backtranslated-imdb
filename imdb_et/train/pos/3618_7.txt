The first step to getting to the road that leads somewhere is to admit that you are the first; then it becomes a self-confident and positive step to overcome the negative effects in your life that may start you off. This is exactly what a young Latino girl does in "Girlfight", written and directed by Karyn Kusama. Diana (Michelle Rodriguez) is an eighteen-year-old senior secondary school student from Brooklyn who, after the fourth fight in the halls, stands out after the semester begins. He influences the "whatever" attitude that masks the deeply seated anger that threatens him in places he does not go. He lives with his father Sandro (Paul Calderon), with whom he has a very original relationship, and his younger brother Tiny (Ray Santiago). When his life is disrupted, he desperately needs an outlet to direct the demons who break him. And one day he will find it without looking if he stops in a gym where Tiny trains. Ironically, Tiny doesn't want to do anything with boxing; he wants to go to an art school, but Sandro has decided that his son should take care of himself on the streets and pay ten dollars a week he pays for his lessons. When Diana persuades Tiny's coach, Hector (Jaime Tirelli), to pick her up and approach her father for money, being hidden from it for weekly support (she doesn't want her to know what she wants) Sandro turns her down and tells her he goes out and earns his money. Ultimately, with the help of Tiny, he finds his way and the ring will soon become his second home. It is an environment to which it easily adapts, and it seems that its life is getting better. And the fact that he has to fight men, not women, in the case of gender blinds, does not reduce him the least. Diana has found her element. <br /> <br /> Karyn Kusama, the first writer / director, has done an excellent job of creating a realistic device for his story that portrays honest portraits in projects and promotes this despair to so many youngsters who find themselves in deadlock and on the road, which leads somewhere. And there is no candy cover; when Hector tells Diana when she asks how she is, where she is, 'I was a fighter once. I lost.' Then looking around the busy gym, "as most of these men disappear, they too. But that's all they know ... "And this is the attitude to honesty, the way the characters are portrayed, it changes the film as well as it is. It's a gloomy world stressed by the dimly lit, hanging gym - you you can have a pretty odorless boxer sweat - and a sense of destruction hanging on it like a ball that protects those people who grab and hang one and the only thing they have, all they know. </p> <p> < / p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> <p> </p> <p> p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> > <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> <p> </p> <p> <p> </p> p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> <p> <p> </p> <p> > </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> <p> <p> </p> <p> </p> On the waves, it is so real that it makes you think about how much it is Rodriguez; exactly where the actor leaves and the sign begins? This is a powerful, memorable force that the actor, from whom we expect another aspiration with great expectation. He makes Diana a positive example, many of whom will hopefully find inspiration and realize that there are alternative ways of living, at least for those who are looking for them. <br /> <br /> Both the positive and this movie ends with an ambiguous remark; Although Diana is probably her feet on the ground, there is no sign of where she is heading. Is it a short-term correction for her or is she forced to become a female Hector partner? After all, it is real (and given the fact that realism is one of the strengths of this film), professional boxing is not a profession that is meant for women and does not open up their weapons. And, in line with the film's theme and the filmmaker's approach, it would have been appropriate to confirm Diana's confidence in the results. <br /> <br /> Supporting casting includes Santiago Douglas (Adrian), Elisa Bocanegra (Marisol), Alicia Ashley (Ricki) and Thomas Barbour (Ira). Although it gives a very realistic picture of the life that many are able to identify, there are certain aspects of "Girlfight" that are somewhat of a confidence in some of what is happening in the circle. This is a positive film that is mostly a satisfying experience. I appreciate it 7/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
