Anyone we meet will affect our thinking, change our ways, a little bit of this person rubbing on us. The "Eighth Day" takes this topic (Compare "Rainmaker"). In this film, Harry (Daniel Auteuil) meets a sales psychology expert with Georges (Pascal Duquenne), a child with Down's syndrome. Winning both actors is the main strength of this movie. The opening order is great when Georges binds his theory of the creation of the world and in the closing phase we discover what God created on the eighth day. The story is a few moments that are very frustrating for Harry. For example, Georges, who is completely unhindered, needs a pair of expensive shoes and does not have enough money. This is the scene where you laugh through your tears. I liked the scene where the Down Syndrome group travels to the art gallery at the bus and gate of the paradise amusement park. All the embarrassing events that Harry and Georges pass through the road on horseback are the most strange, and when looking back, Georges gives the driver a rude greeting. But there are also some delicate scenes, especially the impressive use of close-ups - hands that feel the sun, the wind and the rain, the hands reach, the hands reach and love and the friends. It's a real cinema that touches the heart. There are very moving scenes where Georges makes a proposal to Nathalie, where Georges holds Harry's head, where Georges still requires his dear mother, where Georges teaches Harry to laugh ... I felt that the film had a deep message that life was beautiful - Presence of grass (did you know that it cries when you cut it?), trees, head over, bird song, small insects - all wonderful creatures of nature. They are all there so we can enjoy it if we just look around (like Harry and Georges) and listen ...... Beautiful movie.
