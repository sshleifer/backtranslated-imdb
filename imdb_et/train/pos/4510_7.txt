Emphasizing that Martin Luther King's inspiring spirit lives not only in American civil liberties but in people's hearts and minds, Danish Niels Arden Oplev transmits this belief to the Danish High School in 1969. Specifically, this young man, Frits (Janus Dissing Rathke), is acting against his oppressive rigid and passionate abusive director Svendsen (Bent Mejding). By adjusting the actual story, the performances are filled with a certain aplomb, and the refreshing command of its versatile characters keeps it. The struggle between the ideologies of 13-year-old and demented disciples gives way to natural humor, but an uncomfortable shift in mood disorder, despite being cynically held in the same way as the "dead poet society" more than "Matilda". It goes on a familiar path, but continues and provides accurate service to its young main character, including a personal sub-block that rounds out Frits as a young boy who becomes a young man.
