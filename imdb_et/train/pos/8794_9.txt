Chang Cheh's "Shaolin Temple" can be a very high-profile mark on the Shaw Brothers martial arts cycle. This kung fu epic is amazing cast - real who is stable to Shaw. Although the plot is quite common and combat choreography is traditionally excellent, Chehi is a topic that makes this movie remarkable and enjoyable. A sense of respect for the history and traditions of the Shaolin Temple is felt in every frame. Not unlike William Keighley's pawn caught in the 69s same-sex movie, or John Ford's salon at West Point's "Long Gray Line", Chehi's "Shaolin Temple" is a beloved man of the same style. <br /> <br /> The cultural correlation I am tempted to make is to compare the Shaolin temple with Alamo. Watching this film gives you the same admirable and nostalgic feeling you experienced years ago in the history of school students, when you knew the courage and sacrifice of the heroes of their Alamo heroes. At the end of the movie, you may also be tempted to call, remember the Shaolin temple!
