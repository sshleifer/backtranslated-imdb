It is probably not fair that I have to see most of all the interesting comments of Sopranos and then I can add what people have forgotten, but oh ....... <br /> <br /> How could any actor act in spite of their characters ? Everyone enchants and intensifies their lives. Tony Soprano - as a mob "Capo" and mental illness still suffers his life in front of him and knows what needs to survive. Every one of his men sees his life practically from the inside, like a true form of voyeurism. It will definitely bring out a "nervous" side for every viewer, and I'll add myself to it! <br /> <br /> Although some don't care about Bracket, I have to say that this is the latest role he has been in for years since good Fella. He is Tony's side, which makes him listen to the mind that makes him decent, offering him breathing when he deals with his human emotions that he has not felt for as long as he does. He's just his savior. (Don't talk in religious tones) <br /> <br /> But here are undoubtedly promotions by Edie Falco. To see the role of your prison guard in another recognized HBO series "Oz" and then see him as Livia is the ultimate compliment for every actor or actor. He has crossed the boundaries of a recognizable actress, only actors such as Merle Streep. A sort of chameleon quality that transcends roles. But as I mentioned earlier, how can any actor be forceful if no actor can? <br /> <br /> The strength of Livia is his belief in his daily affirmation. She is a survivor because she hopes her husband and family have survived. She's ready for the worst because she knows the dangers of her husband's business, but knows what lifestyle she's more than most women from Jersey. He's smart, if not wiser and street-minded, then Tony himself. <br /> <br /> In summary, the biggest crime in the Sopran family is that the observer has to wait until January 2000 to see the next season. This is, in my opinion, the worst thing about the HBO series. That's what brought Larry Sanders Show, Sex and City, Dream, and others back to popularity and eventually killed them. Too much space between the seasons and very casual. So far I look at the hunches with the hope that this gap is being programmed.
