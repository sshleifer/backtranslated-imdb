Not one of Scorsese's movies that would be on my favorite movie list. But this is the best way I drive through my DVD player for about five years. Scorsese's patient explains the moments of his favorite film and how Hollywood's work is incredibly graceful, calm and intelligent. <br /> <br /> It's worth 3 material on DVDs. It should be British production, because all American corporate culture would have adhered to the silent, methodological, dissatisfaction, fitting-out approach taken here. And the American production would have demanded that he said he liked only popular favorites. I wish everyone took the page from their love for films. You should love movies that you do for personal, peculiar and specific reasons. Not only more "We too too" votes for the godfather, etc. People have no idea what ideas are being explored in their favorite movies. If they did, the movies would be more interesting than they are. Scorsese I know what ideas are being explored and what makes him impressive, involved in the speaker. I really appreciate his wording, generous interviews over the last ten years. <br /> <br /> With a negative comment, Scorses is the best when he is happy to show you some hidden movie, not when he teaches you about the history of a well-established movie. And I wish he would throw these three hairs out of his nose. This is very disturbing.
