I swear when I first saw this movie, I called my eyes! STAR IS BORN is a movie that lets you know what love really is, despite the obstacles that John Norman (Kris Kristofferson) and Esther (Streisand) see. At the end of the movie you will also experience what it likes to lose such love. Streisand and Kristofferson have such great chemistry and the music is fantastic! When Streisand Sings Another Look at You / Look closely, it's just pure magic! This movie made the song Evergreen one of my favorites and Queen Bee is such a fun song. I also love the fashion of the 70s (except Streisand's Afro. It is also a beauty.). The star is born is my favorite movie. This movie is a joy to watch and is at the end of a heart breaker.
