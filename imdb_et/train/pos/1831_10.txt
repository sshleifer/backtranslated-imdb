this movie was quite terrible Vipul Shah's last movie was good, it was just bad, although it is a good story and it is treated in a great way Aatish Kapadia, who adapted this movie from another gujarat game "Avjo Wahala Fari Malishu", did a good but slow piano 2 and a half hours to see if there are a lot of mistakes in this movie, but it's still an entertaining song that is rather blinded and doesn't work well, but they are still general, not a movie that you eagerly watch. take into account and it is good if you are a type of relationship with a pretty good movie with lots of bugs and humor, not really needed even a bit
