Here I thought the "northern Nanook" was the last word in the archaic poetry "Eskimo" films. How wrong! The Avid Sea kayaker was up to 330 to look at this hope of looking at some hand-made leather boats. The film won't let me down. The Kayak / Umiaki student should look here. (Note to fellow citizens: they use the Norton Sound recesses with one blade of swords). <br /> <br /> But the film went beyond that narrow interest. Even though others have noticed some small back-shot-fakey bits, the film has so many hearts that they are just a few outrages. It was (from this very amateur tropologist's point of view) probably the perfect time to make this movie. In the early thirties: "stories" are so new that they (including Louie B. Mayer!) Actually allowed the Inuit to speak their own language. And there is so much that, despite the infusion of melodrama, it was authentic. They are indeed the polar bear that whale and these caribou. The fiftieth version of this movie would have been wounded by "stars", "technicolor", and so on. The seventies version? Don't even. A very good companion to this great film is "White Shadows in the Southern Sea" (1928) Geographically, "Eskimo" also reflects the ruthless and profound disturbance of Western culture / technology with unsuspecting people.
