While most Americans have little to do with Star Wars, Alec Guinness has an amazing job - especially in the 1940s - 1950s - from drama to original comedy. I especially love his comedies because they are so well-made and seem so natural and real on the screen - a lot different from the usual price of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> That was the film that made me interested in these films. This plot was so strange and cute that it was very unlikely that the film would be made everywhere except Ealing Studios, which was particularly fond of such "small" films. <br /> <br /> Guinness is a nerdy little scientist working for a textile company. He wants to experiment to create a synthetic fabric that is indestructible, although he does not work as a researcher, but as a janitor! So he tends to sneak into the lab (day, somebody suspects or at night), and try to invent his hand. He has been caught repeatedly (for example, after he blew up the laboratory) and started up one day when he actually succeeds! Then, despite the importance of the discovery, he gives up a completely unexpected chain of events - and then begins to have fun. <br /> <br /> Film is a wonderful satire that amuses industry, trade unions, government and people in general.
