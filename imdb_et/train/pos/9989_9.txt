I was able to see the film screening recently. I believe this is happening in Canada at certain times around Mother's Day. If it's in a nearby theater ... GO! It's not a funny feeling-good movie - it's more of a feeling and think of the movie. <br /> <br /> The director is making a great character by letting you in Hagar's heart, spirit and pain. little by little. At first, his attitudes and behavior are not meaningful. When his story develops, he gets someone you can understand. Like life ... understanding brings empathy. I found it pleasant at the end of the movie - especially when she opens her heart to a young man by the lake. <br /> <br /> Hagar's relationship with his two sons is painful - and so many of our own experiences in this world reflect. His youngest son, John, who is full of life and adventure, takes the viewer to the edge of his seat - and such a raw emotion that is so authentic and rare. <br /> <br /> It's fun to see Ellen Page act in this movie. She is as different as the young woman she is playing with Juno. This gives me even greater recognition for his ability to act. If you love her in Juno, love her in Stone Angel. <br /> <br /> Of course, Ellen Burnstyn is Hagar. It is probably not possible to express the ability to act as strongly as the actor's ability to forget you about every other character they have ever played. Never in this film did I ever think of Ellen Burnstyn - I've always and only thought of Hagar. He wiped me with his character - hook, row and sinking. <br /> <br /> Kari Skogland is able to hold a book from one of Canada's most expensive authors. He brings to the screen the stones and angels of this complex woman, Hagar, a stone angel.
