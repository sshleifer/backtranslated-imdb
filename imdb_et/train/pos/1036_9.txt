Watch the Rhine is one of the best anti-Nazi propaganda movies during World War II. Paul Lukas was definitely worthy of his Oscar. Bette Davis shines perfectly when she was a great actor and beauty. I recommend it to those who are interested in the film and who are, of course, late, with the wonderful, wonderful films of Mrs Bette Davis.
