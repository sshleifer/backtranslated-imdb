British comedies are divided into one of two main types: quiet, introspective, usually romantic teaching and pharmaceutical social satire. The settings, characters, and concepts vary, but certain features place most of the exhibitions in one of two categories. Butterflies are probably the first type of epitome. The scripts are very verbal, including long internal monologues, characterized by the main character Ria, a mainly happy but dissatisfied housewife, who is curious about what she may have missed when she started her usual life thoroughly. When he meets a successful but clumsy and emotionally accessible business (who makes his interest quite clear), he plays toys to find out what the other path would have been. <br /> <br /> Functional and scripts are always in money, making the exhibition almost completely personal: I was not blown out or turned off. My mother loved this example. I think the identification of Ria's dilemma is the most important factor that determines your reaction to butterflies.
