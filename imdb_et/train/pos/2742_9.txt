Richard Brooks, an excellent 1967 film from Truman Capote's novel COLD BLOOD, is the ideal companion to Philip Seymour's Hoffman Oscar winning 2005 CAPOTE. They play very well (try these separate nights). It is unusual for the 38-year-old film to be so good. These two really strengthen each other. Although different players play the role of murderers Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, the two pieces mix well. Only a part of the writer (played by Paul Stewart) in Brooks' films is weaker because they give him another name than Capote. I first recommend CAPOTE followed by IN COLD BLOOD. This is a powerful experience!
