I read some of the comments from the message centers here, waiting for this movie to be a complete push - but when I watched it, I couldn't laugh! It's officially become my new favorite movie. <br /> <br /> I don't know what all hate here, maybe it's because such a movie has never been before. I'm sorry to call another comedy that is completely female-led. Many comedies are in the lead by one or two actors, but there are many supportive male characters. It was almost all women - except Seth Meyers, Justin Hartley and Will Arnet's short look - and it worked. All the actors gave very funny performances (especially Missi Pyle) from a peculiar and cute script. <br /> <br /> The charm of this film seems to me to be in my fine feminist message: accepting who you are in the public sphere of success, the strength of female friends, and the violation of gender roles. Bright, though it is, every sign is facing a challenge, because their attempts to have more fun conflicts with their feminist values ​​and who they knew themselves. <br /> <br /> Miss Pyle suggested that the film was left behind by the release of her female cast man and a large-scale actor to release the studios behind it, and I have to agree. Anyone I have suggested this movie, and I think it is a disgrace, that the comedy of women dorky is not widely accepted and successful. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who has an open mind or love for female-centered comedy.
