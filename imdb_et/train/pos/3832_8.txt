One night, an empty cabin, Martin Sheen, was destroyed by Hopalong Cassidy Robert Carradine and his friends watching some murderers who killed some men and kidnapped Cassidy's girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Writer / director Christopher Coppola May has dared William Boyd's purists to make a modern low-budget movie with his beloved Hoppy, but I'm glad he did it! No character should be so involved with an actor that no one else can play him again! <br /> <br /> I thought it was a fun and interesting upgrade for classic programmers in the thirties and forty. Though it is to blame for some bad behavior, it is serious and modest enough, so I don't like it. <br /> <br /> The whole production is a bit strange, but I really enjoyed the scenes between Sheen and Carridine. The fact that we look at the story in one story makes the odd and exaggerated ones more beautiful.
