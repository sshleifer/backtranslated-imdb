"Ardh Satya" is one of the best films made in Indian cinema. Under the leadership of the great director Govind Nihalan, this is the most successful cinema in the hard-hit, which also proved to be a commercial success. Even today, Ardh Satya is an inspiration for all leading Indian leaders. <br /> <br /> The film talks about the real scenario of the 70s Mumbai Police. Unlike the other Indian cities, the police in Mumbai have a completely different system. Govind Nihalani creates a very practical display of the real living environment of the Mumbai police environment. <br /> <br /> Among the various police officers and colleagues, the film describes Anand Velankar, a warm-blooded police family of young people. His father is a tough police constable. Anand himself suffers from his father's ideologies and father's malignant events with his mother. Anand's approach to the immediate action of the crime is the inertia of his desire for work satisfaction. The film will be turned to the plot where Anand's constant efforts against crime will be driven by his pensioners. This is disappointing because it is unable to achieve the desired job satisfaction. As a result of his disappointments, his anger manifests itself in excessive violence in pre-trial rooms and bars, making him an alcoholic. <br /> <br /> Spirit within him is still alive because he is constantly fighting the system. He is aware of the subway system, where police and politicians are far from inert to the end. His compromise on unethical practice is negative. Finally he is stopped. <br /> <br /> Direction is a masterpiece and a thoroughly hard core. One of the best memorable scenes is when Anand breaks into the Underworld gangster Rama Shetty's house to arrest him, followed by a brief conversation that is fantastic. In many scenes, the film has moments of hair color. <br /> <br /> The practical approach to a script is a great punch. Alcoholism, corruption, political influence, courage, fraud are an integral part of the Mumbai police even today. These aspects are excellently addressed. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, movies belong to unanimity, Om Puri depicts Anand Velankari, which passes through all his emotions perfectly.
