It must be independent for film fans, but it also keeps the mainstream movie going well. I think we have the following Woody Allen themes or <br /> <br /> Trentin Tarrentino. <br /> <br /> The budget is painfully low. There are no special effects and they apparently used ambient lighting (shot in digital video.) - And yet this movie grabs you and never lets you go. The scenario is somewhat odd, but the actors and the directors pull it out with complete realism. It has humor, it has an intrigue and it has a sin, and it all works together. <br /> <br /> There is no point in describing the details. If you want to see an independent masterpiece <br /> <br />, a virtual lesson about making a small budget flick that really works, look at it. <br /> <br /> -Yeah, it's also really entertaining. <br /> <br />
