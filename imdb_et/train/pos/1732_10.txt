"Sandra, Making a Woman" is extraordinary in fictional films, and it is for two reasons: (1) Monica Gayle's great but effortless performance and (2) the fact that Gary Graver was in the helm of the project. The two talents, both of which are quite undervalued, make "Sandra" a movie that should be seen. <br /> <br /> Another key element of the film's success is its realism - nothing is fake or "Hollywood". from this California movie. It's really part of life. The modest house where Sandra lives at the beginning of the film, characterized by simple dresses, a scene where Sandra wakes up in the morning to find Uschi Digart behind her door, and Sandra sits on the couch. up, while Digart is trying to sell his cosmetics, looking really like he just woke up (but still beautiful), the harmless weird Sandra picks up who loves him when he's wearing a bra, one room apartment Sandra moves - all these movie elements it seems completely real and as such, the viewer is pulled out from the beginning to Sandra into a small world and she is immediately interested and wants her to succeed. Sandra also makes her love and dignity free love and she comes with a lot of class. <br /> <br /> This movie could easily have gone through less competent hands and could have gone some of the usual sexploitation instructions, but the Garver / Gale team will make sure that Sandra is not just about making a woman, but making an excellent movie .
