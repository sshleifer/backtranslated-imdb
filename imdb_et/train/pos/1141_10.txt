Anyone who doesn't laugh at this movie is embalmed. I've been watching this for at least twenty times and I have to face tears in many scenes. Sally Field is absolutely perfect, because Celest Talbert, the fading soap star, which the supportive majority is trying to replace, hopes that their own star will rise. For 45 years, the squares are still a wonderful and beautiful little quality and perfect figure that believes he has three children. I'm biased, I love her. <br /> <br /> "Soapdishi" is cast with full letters filling the stars. Kevin Kline is flawless, as does Robert Downey Jr., ingenue Elizabeth Shue, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher in one of his early roles, Carrie Fisher as a top-down director who listens to the actor for a small part of the waiter without his shirt. Kathy Najimy is great as an unhappy costume designer, and best of all, Cathy Moriarty as nurse Nan, who drives the nature of the fields removed from the show, is fun. <br /> <br /> This film could have won Oscare's best comedy, the best leading comedy, the best leading comedy and a host of other awards, including writing, directing and supporting actors and actors. Get a DVD so you can watch it again in the next two to five years. You're still laughing when the disc is worn.
