Funny. Sad. Old. These are all the words that swam through my head, watching this beautiful, simple movie. <br /> <br /> It's rare for a movie to really move me, but "Do we dance?" it reached grace to save. Gentle humor, which occasionally blends with subtle torment, easily made it one of the best experiences in my film viewing history. It remained silent for me, but touched with a bit of sadness. <br /> <br /> And dancing, yeah, dancing. Even if you are not a lover of art or you can't put one foot in another, the steps shown here will take your breath away and want to register as soon as possible. It was absolutely enchanting, even the parts that show Sugiyama (Koji Yakusho's touch) were the first to dance for a nice humorous, childlike. And yet, this film was not only a dance, but a nuance of human behavior and feelings. We see a shy man who learns through his dance to express his repressed feelings, a beautiful dance teacher, who again discovers his love for art, and the personal growth of every great member of the support cast. <br /> <br /> Beauty. Pain. Emotion. All love and small forms of life are here, expressed in terms of fine Japanese watercolor painting and emotional strength and grace of culture. <br /> <br />
