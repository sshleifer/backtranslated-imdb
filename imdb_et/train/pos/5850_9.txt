It has been 16 years since its initial launch, I would have hoped that now some "marketing wizards" have promoted a living actress version of this classic or at least tried to restore 65 original episodes. I can't understand why a network of sci-fi or comics is not a hit. The Galaxy Rangers really did have well thought out plots and even better scripts. The animation was above average and excellent than the Japanese animation we are talking about today. It was before the heavy tone-game gateway market, it can also be closed. I'd love to spend money on a GR DVD if one exists.
