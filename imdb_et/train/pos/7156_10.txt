Holes are an awesome movie. I love it a lot and this is one of my favorite films. This is one of the few Disney products that are not cheesy. Holes are generally a very cool film. I want Disney to do more of these pictures. The holes are indeed rare in Disney's flutter. Don't get the wrong idea, I don't want a bad mouth with Disney, but most of it is for kids and that's OK. Children also deserve entertainment. But Disney has tried to turn to the servants and they usually fail. But not with holes. This is the type of movie that every age can watch and enjoy and never think it's bright. Indeed, this is a movie that even many young hoods could enjoy because there are signs they can associate. <br /> <br /> Holes do a good job of being a good family entertainment but not too cheesy and live a little edge. I hope Disney takes more risks and makes such nervous cocks.
