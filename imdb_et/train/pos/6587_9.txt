Master Blackmailer, based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's short film, "The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton," is the first feature of Sherlock Holmes with whom I have seen Jeremy Brett. The story is interesting and dark. The film has a somewhat harsh, sad feeling, but it's pretty fun (some especially funny scenes). <br /> <br /> Spoilers * Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are trying to discover an illusionist who has destroyed some of England's most prominent families by publishing personal letters that in one way or another destroy their lives. Finally, it turns out that he is Charles Augustus Milverton, "Art Dealer", with little tragic consequences for victims who could not pay. Our heroes must help Lady Eva Blackwell, who has to pay an amount that is not higher than her funds, or else her future marriage will definitely come out. The scene where Holmes and Watson broke Milverton's house is intense. Although the film has a very happy ending, the tone is sad and regrettable. <br /> <br /> Exceptional performances by Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke (as usual) and Robert Hardy as a notorious scam (most viewers are likely to recognize him) today as Cornelius Fudge in Harry Potter), Serena Gordon as Lady Eva Blackwell, Norma West as Lady Swinstead and Sophie Thomson as Agatha (her and Holmes-related scenes are a rebellion). I'll give her *** 1/2 out *****. My only complaint is that Inspector Lestrade was not enough. (I wish they had added the end of the short story of the scene, where he describes the description of two burglaries, one of which suits Watson.)
