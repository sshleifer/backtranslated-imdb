Of all the filmmakers of the 1940s and 1950s, this must be one of the most strange and fun. I say this because of the four main players: Orson Welles, Rita Hayworth, Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. The first two names are familiar to everyone, but they were the last two to make this movie so interesting, especially for Anders. His character "George Grisby" is one of the strangest people I've ever seen on film. His voice and some of the things he said must be heard to believe them. Slone is not far from the "strange" category. Hayworth is not so glamorous with a short blonde hair but is Hayworth, which means that if you're a boy, there is a lot. Welles is as exciting as ever. One tip: If you have a DVD, turn on English subtitles. His character in this film is Irish and you need subtitles to understand everything he says. <br /> <br /> Welles also ran a movie, which means you have great camera angles and wonderful close-ups of your face. You also have a unique end, visually, with a mirrored mirror in the house. Good stuff! As strange as this film, I still thought that at the end of the trial, the buffer-like carnival atmosphere was too much and took the scene seriously. In addition, there are no complaints. <br /> <br /> This is a great entertainment that is the name of the game.
