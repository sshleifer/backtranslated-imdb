I love this movie. This is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again and still find interesting. Congratulations! I believe that all filmmakers and scripts should be proud of themselves. It's so terrible, you feel you're looking at the real life line. I'd like to see more of these movies. I'm glad they didn't pick Hollywood stars in this movie because it probably wouldn't work. And even if Billy Connolly is pretty well-known, he actually played a role and I couldn't play anyone else. Congratulations, I really believe this film deserves a Peter Sellers comedy award for Bill Nighy. And when you reach the last scene ..... well what can I say !!!!
