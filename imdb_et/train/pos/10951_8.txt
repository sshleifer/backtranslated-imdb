Big S doesn't play with taboos or compulsion like Mencia or Chapelle (though I both like it). He claims that this is obvious in a subtle, conscious consciousness. His exhibition does not change the world nor does it. But with the famous Brian Posehn and Paget Brewster's former boyfriend Jay Johnston's famous "Mr. Show", this is one of the indicators that he wants to destroy! My side is thoroughly crushed by the first episode. Look, I love this woman and like her famous boyfriend Jimmy Kimmel, she just gives the lines and lets the viewer go. Best such comedy. Calling something and someone like "Mary Poppins" in the second episode, when she sings fake birds to quickly comment on the outdated existential nonsense of society and college. This is highly recommended, but only for those who still have funny bone (and did not lose it with their last flag-sucking or boob work).
