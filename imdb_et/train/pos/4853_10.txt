I have black and white films of this type, Will Hay and Abbot & Costello films, especially if they are my favorites. I chose this movie on DVD because he used the same idea as Will Hay "Oh Mr Porter", one of the best comedies. I finished watching this movie less than ten minutes ago (the movie was closed at 12.45 pm). I find that films related to Ghost Trains etc. are best viewed at night with lights. That way, you will get the story more and watch the night work with this movie well. <br /> <br /> The individual film liners may appear slightly dated for some viewers, I think it depends on the viewer. However, they are not dated for me. I am 28 years old and although I am not old enough to make this film for the first time (my father was). I am still very grateful for some old films of this type. Sitting in front of a TV in a room with some snacks and drinks, and watching these movies back and forth at night, many things can't get the feeling you do during that time. It is a escape from reality for a while. <br /> <br /> I noticed that one of the men in the movie (he has black mustache) appears about three-quarters of a movie after the car has fallen and he is looking for a woman he has followed. This man was also in Will Hay's "The Stost of St Michaels". I thought I would point out that no one noticed :). <br /> <br /> The pieces in the movie are very atmospheric. Outside the deserted station looks good and like there would be no miles in any direction, and the inside of the station is very cozy, watching the rain storm away. I felt I would have loved to be in the movie together. The atmosphere of this film is something that many films currently lack. It keeps you busy from the moment the movie begins until it ends. <br /> <br /> We need more of this type of movie in today's market. Unfortunately, however, it may be overcoming nudity and swearing and raw humor. Such a film making era (Ghost Train, Oh Mr Porter, etc.) is a golden time for the cinema.
