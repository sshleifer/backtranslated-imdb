It should be one of the funniest TV shows coming out of countries after the death of "Everybody Loves Raymond". Warburton is always fun and adds the rest of the ensemble to perfection. David Spade continues to tie his funny bone with his rather unique delivery. After the British series robbery, I see "Coupling" where exactly where the "Rules of Organization" creators got their original idea, but it is not meant to be a "brickbat" - an absolutely brilliant dialogue and the way it is transmitted makes this particular series completely separate. But this means that the new series, especially in the highly complex comedy field, will only bring about a successful casting. As part of a professional TV comedy writing team in Australia for 7 years, I can especially understand the role of the director and the perception and creativity of the camera team. One of the few complaints I have with the series is obviously "canned" laughter. It would probably be possible to use a live audience when shooting a series.
