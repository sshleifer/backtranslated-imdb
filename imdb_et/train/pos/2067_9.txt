Although it is generally accepted that the symmetry of fear was heavily influenced by the Kolchaki episode, they are, they are, they are, whether it makes its rip-off or a tribute is a more controversial point. As a big fan of both series, I agree with the latter belief, though less charity might not do it. James Whitmore was bold to take on such a heavy episode of leadership, invisible elephants and gorilla suits sound like a disaster recipe, but he pulls it out of style, being an absolute pearl. Lance Guest makes Kyle Lang credible and Jack Rader sees a threat with Ed Meecham. Forget about the suspicious originality of horrible symmetry and just enjoy it as a deeply satisfying X file.
