This 1939 film attempted to take advantage of the much better Michael Curtiz movie "Angels with Dirty Faces". As led by Ray Enright, the only interesting thing is how these children tampered with what is happening in American youth cities today. Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan, who showed they were well connected. Dead End kids are bigger parts because the plot focuses on them rather than the older people. New York. It was the fastest way to switch real estate in the face of ever-created social problems. In today's climate with so many weapons, there is a new reality. The story of young children seemed to be mere pranksters rather than criminals. How times change!
