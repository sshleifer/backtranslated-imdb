To my surprise, I really enjoyed Disney's latest animation. The film was lower, but in general I felt that the story was strong and the characters were easy to associate. It was also pleasant to see an animated Disney movie that was not musical. I was very limited with Tarzan. Luckily, they gave the music a rest. Another nice feature of the movie is that comedy was not completely puzzled (a la Hercules), but rather subtle, so it still made the children laugh but didn't make adults nervous or just stupid. <br /> <br /> One disappointment was animation. With all the great animated films that take place outside of Disney's studios, you think they would move and get a little. There is something to say about tradition, but imagine the possibilities with the Atlantis story! In general, the film was entertaining and definitely worth a trip to the multiplex. <br /> <br />
