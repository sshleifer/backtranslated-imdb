If you enjoy romantic comedies, you will find the story of two 30-year-old singles who fall in love with the American League pennants competition. On the other hand, if you talk about waiting for Kill Bill Volume 3 or Sin City 2, you should probably stay away. On the plot there is a compulsory man who meets the girls 'friends, the girl meets the boy with friends and the boy meets the girls' older scenes. There's even a boy who meets a girl's pets. It's all such a course in such a movie. But what I liked was that people made the decision-making process from the plot when they realize that their romantic interest is not perfect and is actually a bit peculiar. The center of the plot is answering questions; How much quirkiness is too much and how much love does it take to transform the princes? It is interesting to see that the characters work through it because deep (if we admit it) we all have problems. Barrymore does a great job in his role and Fallon sorta surprised me - he is also good. I appreciate it from 7 out of 10 as a romantic comedy. Add one point if you are a baseball fan or romantic. Add another point if you are a Red Sox fan and divide two points if you are a Yankees fan.
