An excellent film that shows how people relate to the obvious ordinary beads that are exchanged during Mardi Gras. The film is much more than a comment on globalization. In fact, it humanises Chinese workers, the factory owner, the New Orleans bullet divider, and even many New Orleans. The most striking feature of the director is the ability to tell a complex story with a complicated detail in a simple and seductive way. His amazing access to the factory is another aspect that is intriguing and I just wish I knew how he entered. It is a beautiful story without sentimentality or guilt, and the conclusion gives hope, leaving people unaware of alienation.
