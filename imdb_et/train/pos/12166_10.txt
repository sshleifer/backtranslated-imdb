Very strange and delightful film. It is about a very uncomfortable and tightly wounded man who tries to look for his life as a door-to-door fund manager. The director was able to capture a very unknown tone that really served the story well. Original and restless, while also finding a lot of humor in life's pain. There is a sequence in the testing facility that really looked like and made me laugh out loud, which is nothing I do as often as I should. One of the most memorable films I've seen for a long time. Have not left my point and look forward to Bronstein's future efforts. A fantastic play everywhere. Simple line "I really appreciate it." is now an icon for me.
