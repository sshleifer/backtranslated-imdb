Alexandr "Sascha" Luzhin (John Turturro) is a former leading chess player who is trying to come back to an Italian hosted tournament. His brilliance is indisputable, but his detention in Chess has undermined his life in all other aspects. Natalia (Emily Watson) is a beautiful heir who has her husband with her mother Vera (Geraldine James) to build up possible marriage partners. Vera is inclined towards beautiful stories, but amazingly Natalia is more fascinated by Sascha, whom she met on a walk. Sascha is also taken with Natalia and is married at her second meeting. But how does the concentration that Sascha has to give to chess games and when other past events still cause problems, does he get Natalia's heart? And can he also become a chess champion? This is a lovely movie based on Nabokov's novel. Action is amazing because Watson is very beautiful as a beautiful little rich girl and Turturro's perfect perfection as a shy, uncomfortable male-enthusiast. Jacob makes a pretty nice move when the overwhelming mother and other cast members are also wonderful. As far as the appearance of the film is concerned, it cannot be better. The landscape is out of sight, vintage costumes are proud and cinematography deserves great applause. Yes, the story is unusual and sometimes it is a setback, making it a movie that everyone doesn't know. Then there are bitters at the end. However, if you love romance, periodicals, great actors, fallen landscapes or cinematic works, don't miss it. You are defenseless when resistance to its plethora of charms.
