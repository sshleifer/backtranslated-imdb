I saw this movie again and noticed that it was close to the novel when we ignored part of Cary's [Leslie Howard] childhood. Given that at the moment there is not much to be shown on the screen [not in the novel], the obsession with the character of Mildred [Bette Davis] is very well communicated to the audience. I recommend this movie to anyone who has ever fallen against another person and the other half tried to take advantage of it. I've read that Maugham was asked to sell the novel to save, but when he started to study in the studio, he started crying and couldn't finish more than a few lines and the whole project was finished. It can be said that the novel is written from the heart and the film is at least a good adaptation of that part.
