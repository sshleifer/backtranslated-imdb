The film only enters the cinema in Indonesia this year (2007), two years after its official release, and after many illegal DVDs have found their way to the public. Obviously, the popularity of illegal DVD distribution is in the theaters, where the public is still in sight. <br /> <br /> Film is a great epic that brings Japanese culture out of your house. Sometimes the story is told by a theater writer who writes a story to his theater because the usual Kabuki theater games are something he is bored. <br /> <br /> At first, the audience may be a little confused about the story we follow, but when the story opens, we see that the love between men and women in demons leads to a great story of the new Kabuki theater. <br /> <br /> The audience is left in the dark when it is a story that should really happen in Japanese traditions and mythology, but that doesn't matter. <br /> <br /> How the story is reported to the theater, expression, vivid colors, humor, and tragedy make this Japanese cinema a great runner and roller. <br /> <br /> Shoot yourself when you watch this movie, try to see it at home, not on television. <br /> <br /> One critical point: Sound is sometimes a bit annoying. Although most of this is great music, there are some moments in the film that I think should have chosen more dramatic music. But maybe the fact that the story contains humor has made the director a lighter moment.
