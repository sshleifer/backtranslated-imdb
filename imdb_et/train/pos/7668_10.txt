I loved this movie for two reasons: 1) Jeff Combs is absolutely wonderful. Plays the role of a modern wizard on the hilt. (And it is absolutely divine.) 2) The film helped inspire the role play I thoroughly enjoy, Mage: The awakening. I have shown it in different LARP parties and it is always a big hit. <br /> <br /> D & D love and Jeff-squeeing aside, it's not exactly a masterpiece, but it's well done and enjoyable. The plot movement is fast and its simplicity is taking place, special effects are pretty good for such a low budget, and the script, though not a few stars, wasn't too badly made and cheese in all the right places. Good opportunity to spend the evening.
