I have to say that this TV movie was the job that really showed how talented Melissa Joan Hart is. We are so accustomed to seeing him now in sitcom and hope that the TV channel will show this television movie again if it shows Sabrina fans that MJH is shining in drama. Looking at how we've been watching Sabrina now for 5 years now, and to give viewers a lot of untapped talent, this would be a plus. Melissa plays her role as well as she wants her parents to "go away" so she can be with her love. One thing that all Sabrina viewers are saying is Melissa works with David Lascher before taking Josh's role in Sabrina. So it would be kind of clean to see it now when it breaks again. Hopefully, in MJH movies or even more films, you will get good roles, such as Kellie Martin, who has always appeared in TV. A lot of untapped talent waiting for Melissa Joan Hart to shine always in Melissa !!!
