In her first debut, this film has some moments of riveting and cooling. With the best horror movie, your cramp will tighten every moment during this movie. The end is great. The Blaire Witch makers probably watched this film not end, but the beginning of the end. A great movie and just one piece of Japan's great fear factor that gives you a perfect score that makes you think and scare.
