I got this movie from T.V. Last night and you know that Danny Masterson was a very good actor in the movie and it was great to see him other than in the 70s. The film has not been rated, but in my opinion I would appreciate it just because it is naked and a lot of adult content. But all I loved was thinking Wisecracks of dirt were pretty funny. Its just basically about a man who has no job, girlfriend or money and finally gets a job as a private investigator (more messenger really.) He gets framed by killing Rock Star and Rock Stars Girlfriend is one of the people who really need to help him. I'll give her .... *** 3 stars.
