Much has been written about Mama's "Game House"; most of it is good. I decided to fuck again to see how it rose after 17 years and was surprised how much I looked at it again. The success and durability of the film is probably much related to the two main components that are always fun on the film; good story and good fraud. Mamet succeeds in bringing his signature mood and the obvious histrionic film to the same time as us, the audience and the trademark deceive. Then he explains the art to hit it only to do it again, and so on. "The House of Games", which is now a cable freebie, is worth searching for the first timer and working properly for Mameti fans.
