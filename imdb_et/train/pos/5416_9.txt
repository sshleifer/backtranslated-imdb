I saw it only once. It happened in 1952, I was seven, film 13. <br /> <br /> We were so young ... But I kept in mind the strong moments of Gunga's sacrifice forever. <br /> <br /> I realized that the time a lot of people could hardly present and use abroad. In these historical circumstances, in the film, in the friendship, in the friendliness that ignores oneself, what arises between people who share everyday life, who see each other's faces, who know each other's names, but belong to different worlds, can only appear. Then, at the most critical moments, the worrying question arises: "To whom should we first be loyal?", What do people, family, homeland, person you know? You do not have time to give a perfect answer, there is urgency and it is for life or death. Gunga-Din gives her answer with her own sacrifice. Somewhere, confused, the problem remains unresolved, the emotion grows with the rhythm of the movie until someone dies, just one life, nothing compared to so many other fictions or realities that we see today, because this death, this unique disappearance of the life I lived, shared with my child unconditional friendship. It was the viewer I was living with. That day I created Gunga-Din forever. When I left behind later, I was in real childhood when I left so many worlds. I missed everything and these lines are a short visit today that I didn't expect to get up this morning.
