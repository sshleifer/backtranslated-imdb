There is no connection between Fortier and Profiler, but the fact that both are police series of violent crimes. Profiler looks crispy, Fortier looks classic. Profiler plots are quite simple. The Fortier plot is much more complicated ... Fortier looks more like Prime Suspect when we need to notice similarities ... The main character is weak and weird but has "clarity". People like to compare, evaluate, evaluate. How to just enjoy it? The funny thing is that Fortier writers see America but claim they prefer the American series (!!!). Maybe it's a language or a spirit, but I think this series is more English than American. By the way, the actors are really good and funny. Operation is not at all superficial ...
