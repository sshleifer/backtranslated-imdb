I'm sitting here in November 2006, and I still can't play this movie. Arnold's best films came in about 4-5 years. Running Man, Predator and Total Recall (1990). All 3 are amazing. Arnold's cheerful film in this film makes you laugh more than once. I find this film surprisingly good, as it was in Predator and Totall Recallis. They did a great job of trying to make the scenes futuristic, as it should happen in 2017, but you can't help but the 80's haircuts for men and women in the crowd and the usual TV monitors. The Running Man studio, which we all know here in 2006, has an exit to flat screen and HDTVs. Also, the "The Running Man" game show does not seem to be a computer graphics intro in 2017. Nevertheless, the story is absolutely fantastic. Never in this movie did I ever want to get up and care about ending, which is something I often do with today's movie. I really think that Arnold's behavior is much better than the credit given to him. Now, I wouldn't have chosen him as governor, but it's California for you. Buzzsaw, Dynamo, Fireball, SubZero are also fantastic "stalkers" and I find that manufacturers are not trying to fight scenes. When the stalker is dead ... he's dead. It won't continue for 20 minutes. Stalker scenes are fast and fun, but they don't try to play it over. I give this film 10/10 and it comes from someone who doesn't enjoy much movies these days. If you have the right actors and the right story, the 2006 futuristic graphic displays are not essential or necessary.
