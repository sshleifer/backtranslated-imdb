I've been looking for the name of this movie for years. I was 14 when I think it was on television in 1983. All I remember was that it was just teenage girls who had lived alone on the plane. I remember people looking for her (family) and knowing how to care for her - she tells the story and I remember alive that she knows the mistakes were under her skin. I don't remember this movie much more and I want to see it again - if it's the same - and if someone else is a copy, can you email me at horsecoach4hire@hotmail.com? I'd be curious to get a copy to see if it's actually the same movie I remember. In 1983, it went to Thanksgiving (USA), and I went through my own problems, and this film influenced me very much. Thanks in advance!
