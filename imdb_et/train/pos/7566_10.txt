The young lady's name is Bonnie (Polay). He is attractive, probably living a decent life, but suddenly his Evil Dude and his various and various evil Henchmen have been inexplicably infected with his home and life. Now he has no idea what happens to hell, only that a number of armed teeth will probably want him dead ... and he dies even without knowing why. <br /> <br /> God, I always hear whining. Now that content is so cheap to produce and people can create their own movies / books / comics / internal organs, there is no one who would guarantee quality! We're getting drowned! The only people who really think they are people who haven't recently watched movies or read books because we are already swimming a dead man. It's like people like Ferrari and Rodriguez, who put the lie on those unaware and unscathed, throwing $ 8K on the table and doing ... well, what I would say is better than something you've seen in cinemas a year ... but you did not see any activities in the cinema this year. I've seen a box. You're away from the droves. You would do a better copy, spend twenty minutes of entertainment and go on with your life. <br /> <br /> It's just entertainment. You enter, like Bonnie, a lot of questions and where the whole thing comes to be confused. The whole idea has been done in many ways in the past, but not with such a compressed time, rather than without such a concentrated delicious gunpowder. You're in the atmosphere, mystery and weapons. That's all - it's all the promises of filmmakers and they offer it. <br /> <br /> It warms my heart's black cores to think it was made for such a budget. We get a good deal of indiefs here, but we rarely see anything like it would be short, and we've never seen what happened in the genre that saw it good. Hell, you could get these two guys MI: 3 and it can look at me. Bond franchise. Damn, something. No, actually better: I'd like to see these guys make a feature of themselves and stay away from Hollywood hell. Whatever it is out there, the film industry will certainly kill the infectious. <br /> <br /> The best indie we've seen for a while and the most effective indie card we've ever seen. The DVD is $ 20 and has bonus features. Go to your movie ticket budget and place it instead.
