Wow it was a movie was totally enchanting I couldn't believe I started to wake up so late to watch it, but it came late in the ounce that I started to look at, which I couldn't stop when was filled with very good cast members, even Eartha Kitt and Ruby Dee Forrest Whittaker and James Earl Jones and many other famous actors and actors were more than a glimpse into history. It was the opening of the eye to another part of society that people do not know and can even talk about. I've never heard of this book or movie before, and that's something black history doesn't just look down on because they were privileges and mixed contests, I recommend this movie very much
