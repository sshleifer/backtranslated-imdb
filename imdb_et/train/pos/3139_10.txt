There are many different gatherings. One of these is where the old actors have been removed from mothballs and set to revive signs they haven't played for twenty or thirty years. They have different results. "Returning to Mayberry", despite some stupidity, was okay; "Back to the green acres" as an executable (Eddie Albert used a word for the script, which I do not repeat here, but the smell of the film and the film); "Salvation of the Gilligan Island", which is filled with the necessary gap if it is a story, even though the exhibition itself was stupid even from the point of view of Gilligan Island. In most cases, scripts are weak; Sometimes, scripts that are too aware? and comedy is almost always fatal if the characters know they are funny. Introducing new characters that do not match the mix. These meetings are mainly weak. Another, again, "reunion" exhibition is one where the majority puts their past aside, but sits around, telling stories, recalling, mixed with exhibitions. Then there are films based on exhibitions that are rarely good; and the history of the film, based on the history of the exhibition ("Brady Bunch" has both happened, with different results). <br /> <br /> "Back Batcave" is used by almost all of the above, along with a wonderfully twisted viewpoint, which makes it the best reunion and has raised the bar for others. <br /> <br /> Adam West and Burt Ward invited them to show their original Batmobile. If they are there, the car is stolen. <br /> <br /> The western film of Adam is a man who is demented. He called Jerry, his butler, Alfred. She opens a Shakespeare bust in her apartment and reveals a hidden Polish to push the parking house. He's obsessed with being a criminal if he's just a savior. When Batmobile is stolen, he doesn't believe he's the task of restoring him as a criminal, he's dragging and doesn't want Burt Ward as his assistant. <br /> <br /> The exercise is largely lush, reminding the West and Ward of the old days. It is interrupted by "setbacks", where West and Ward play in the old days. Modern scenes and "setbacks" have a funny lack of reality. There are also running gags that show that West is able to entertain itself: In Ward's book about his time, he spoke honestly of West's libido and also of his being (West makes Wardi pay everything they pay for their activities) tips and bus prices). Tracked hints, the characters they encounter (even in setbacks) all fit with the old series mentality, and there are several respects, including fist fighting with written sound effects. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is very funny and made with a big panache. Julie Newmar also has fires (as she has seen too much) and Frank Gorshin, reminding us why she has such a cult next. Gorshin is Riddler when his obvious successor, Jim Carey, has long been forgotten. The film is based on a rather obvious but funny climax. <br /> <br /> This show is a reunion model? unfortunately, there are few suitable for the pattern. At this show were actors who played their old signs; young actors playing a movie about making an exhibition; actors West and Ward recall; and today's movie, where actual Adam West plays Demented Adam West. It has it all. If you love an old show, it's a bottle cap.
