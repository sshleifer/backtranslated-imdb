Eddie Murphy will surprise you at any time. <br /> <br /> Especially in a movie like "The Golden Child". This is a movie you think Harrison Ford or Kurt Russell may be, or someone. But Eddie really works; he's smart, he's funny, he's brave, kind, polite, economical, clean and everything else the hero should be. <br /> <br /> Being chosen to secure a mysterious child who has the key to defending the world from total evil (perfectly through dance), Eddie goes from California to Nepal and back, all while the beautiful Kee Nang (Lewis) wonders whether she says she is and crazy old holy man (Wong, perfect as always) She is exciting, breathtaking spots, shocking and of course funny. Eddie is the only hero I know who could start the film by making dirty comments behind a boy reading some magazines and ending with smart comments on Ed McMahon. <br /> <br /> No problem with this "child": it's "golden" to find. <br /> <br /> Nine stars. Viva Nepal!
