This supernatural thriller by Peter Weir is really one of the strangest and most exciting movies ever seen. Richard Chamberlain is doing his best here as an Australian lawyer who protects a group of young aborigines accused of murder. When he comes closer to the case, he finds out more about the main defendant Chris and not less about himself. Chris tells him he is Mulkurul, which seems to be the race of supernatural beings that lived in Australia thousands of years ago. At the same time, the extraordinary large amount of precipitation seems to confirm the coming of the aboriginal prediction of LAST WAVE, which drowns the world. <br /> <br /> Dream sequences and supernatural effects improve this movie and make it a great experience. Olivia Hamnett and David Gulpil are strong masters, but also a hard-won captain who plays Charlie, an old aboriginal who can become an owl. The peak and the end are not disappointed, unlike many other supernatural thrillers who fall after a promising hour. But it cannot be called a pure thriller. It is also a drama and talks about spirituality and spiritual identity in today's world. The masterful work of Peter Weir, the master of visually stunning dramas.
