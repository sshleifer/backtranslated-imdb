Dr. Alan Feinstone, Corbin Bernsen makes the "dentist" perfectly uneven. Dr Alan Feinstone is losing its understanding every day. torture, murder, antiquity! "Dentist" is a solid film! At the same time, Bernsen makes the character of Dr. Feinstone relative and hateful. Although she is completely out of her pumpkin, the audience still feels compassion for her. That my friends ..... is a hell of a good actor. Excellent direction, good killings and gore, and effective stimulation will keep you entertained throughout the film era. <br /> <br /> RECOMMENDED!
