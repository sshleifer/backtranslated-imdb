I'm not usually too specific (except OC & Desperate Housewives ... hey, I'm 20!), But I'm not kidding after one of the Reunion episodes was hooked. <br /> <br /> I can't even tell how I was disappointed that this time slot was in contradiction to Bush's last night's speech because I was very looking forward to the 1987 episode, which is now coming up next Thursday. Again, this conflict was unfavorable because, as a new example, it has to build up the next one and the second episode, which is rejected weekly, kills some momentum. <br /> <br /> That means the TV doesn't always have to be Emmy worthy to be enjoyable. I don't expect Reunion to take home prizes, but I hope it will be able to get my attention throughout the season. Never look for the first time in a beloved exhibition for years? Sometimes you don't know how you ever tried. Character building takes time. <br /> <br /> One episode of every year's idea is great in my opinion. The only other show I remember to do something like this is 24, each episode is an hour ... and the eventful year is more realistic than the day's eventful! Please let it show. Relax in the form of art ... it's just a TV!
