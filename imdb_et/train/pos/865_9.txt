Vincent Cassel plays part of Paul, an ex-con assigned to office work, where he meets Carla, who is quite deaf secretary when his hearing aids are very deaf? if not (playing Emmanuelle Devos). Together they help each other to develop as people. <br /> <br /> Was this movie especially interesting because of the complexity of the characters? does not fit into obvious stereotypes. Paul seems worrying in the office environment, is he not just cut off for work? This belief is scattered when he gets a bar and shines his work. <br /> <br /> The film has some immorality that I find refreshing and shows how easy it is to act criminally, even if we think it's harmless or Finally, it's a movie full of moments, so touching as well as humorous. One is when Carla is babysitting and trying to comfort a small child. Is he going to continue this cuddle? but takes your hearing aids for your convenience.
