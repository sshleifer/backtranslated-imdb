All films made before 1912 really have to be viewed in time and place. <br /> <br /> In 1894, the men of the Lumiere family [father: Antoine (1840-1911), sons: Auguste and Louis] owned and managed a photographic plate and a paper-making plant. Not a small business; the factory had over 200 employees who received pension and social security benefits - by that time. It was located in Montplaisir on the outskirts of Lyon, France. What caused Louis Lumiere's interest in building Cinematagraph in 1894 remains open to speculation. My suggestion is that in the fall of 1895 in Paris, the Kinetoscope (peep-show machine) organization of the Edison organization appeared. <br /> <br /> W.K.L. In February 1893, Dickson, Edison's staff, invented a camera with a patented upright piano. It was electrically operated (using energy from strong batteries). The Eastman company) took about 40 frames per second (fps) of a lens that was almost black real estate "Black Maria" (essentially the first film studio). Kinetescope machines showed staged presentations (less than one minute) filmed in this studio. <br /> <br /> In 1894, Louis Lumiere sought the invention of a moving imaging camera, which had determined that even at 16 fps the survival of the human eye / brain would allow the normal movement to be perceived. His camera, called a cinematograph, was about a big shoe box size and equipped with a removable film magazine that made enough movie to store. Let it last about one minute when it was 16 fps above the lens. <br /> <br /> The camera's size and light weight (which can be converted to a printer or projector by adding a light source) made it portable enough to be taken to record an event anywhere (provided there was enough sunlight). In the spring of 1895, Louis filmed some cavalry men; fire with firefighters who arrive and destroy the towed building; and several other scenes in and around Lyon. Using the Molten lamp, he turned the camera into a projector and filmed his films for scientists who had been gathered at the Revue Generales des Science reception. Images were projected on the screen, 5 meters away from the lens. The screen was stretched between two spaces. At a meeting of professional photographers, Louis photographed the delegates arriving in the same year, and the same evening they showed films on their arrival. By the end of the year, he will publish his exhibition of the invention. Since all his films are about one minute long, he needs at least a dozen movies to make a good presentation. One of these films put his camera at the entrance to his factory, taking pictures of the workers at the exit. <br /> <br /> The public place chosen by Antoine, who presented himself as a "booster" for a cinematographer - was a Grand Cafe salon at Indien, Capucines boulevard in Paris. Lumiere's slideshow of the Lumiere photos, but then the camera / projector crank and movement started. Louis had the innate feeling of taking films. This film is in the beginning, in the middle and at the end. leave the workplace, the middle of the people flowing out - many are trying to ignore the camera and the operator, because they seem to be happy that they leave the work day behind them. Finally, the factory gates will be closed. intended for public entertainment.
