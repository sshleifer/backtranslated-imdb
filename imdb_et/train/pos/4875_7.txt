"The Father Is Still In Business" was the title of the title after the premiere of "Promise Me This" in Cannes. I understand why many think Kusturica is the same, but the unique expression still exists in her new film and why critics can't touch her. I had two hours of clean energy without rest. Even though Kusturica suffers from lack of concentration or fear of empty space, it is still unique and intact. Stribor Kusturica is surprisingly good. Lots of close-ups and fewer landscapes, then "Life is a miracle". Marija Petronijevic has a world-class potential for femme deaths, please don't break it. I definitely recommend everyone to see this movie.
