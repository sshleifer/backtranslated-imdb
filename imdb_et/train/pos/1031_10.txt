This series is set one year after the mission of Abydos in the movie Stargate. This explains many things that the film did not mention. For example, how was the Stargate activated without a human computer? Where did the Goa'uld come from? How much is there? <br /> <br /> Jack O'Neill (written with 2 lats) retired in the first episode, recalled by General George Hammond's active commitment to Apophis' powerful Goa'uld, who was shut down due to a Stargate attack. killed four men and kidnapped a woman. We meet Samantha Carter, a great scientist who claims to have been through the Stargate for the first time and has decided to go through now. We find Daniel married Abydos and there are hundreds of gate addresses that they can choose from. Then Daniel's wife comes to Apophis and becomes her new queen. <br /> <br /> This continues in another episode where General Hammond announces the formation of SGC, which includes nine teams, where Jack's team is SG-1, consisting of Jack, Samantha and Daniel. They go to Chulak, the homeland of the Goa'uld, to save Daniel's wife and the other Abydos, who is called Ska'ras. They get stuck and, as Apophis commands to kill them and many other prisoners, Jaffa named Teal'c, Apophis' first prime minister, rescues them and goes with them to Earth where he is part of SG-1. <br /> <br /> It was just the beginning of the adventure. During the exhibition, they have gone past and future, transported to alternates, exchanged bodies, obsolete, met with strangers, including the Goa'uld Rebel Alliance, called Tok'ra, where Samantha's father becomes a member, Asgard, a cute little contest , where we see Thor most often (he's Jack's friend) and avoids countless times with the dental skin of the global catastrophe. <br /> <br /> The show was recently canceled but lasted for ten seasons. In the ninth season, a new enemy, the Ori, emerged in fierce new powers, new threats, and new secrets that surround the Stargate and its creators, Ancients. The ninth and tenth seasons were also introduced by two new characters: Ben Browder Cameron Mitchell, new leader SG-1 and Claudia Black as Vala MalDoran, a female from another world who brings new entertainment to the team. <br /> <br /> Very well produced, interesting characters, fantastic special effects and subtle love of interest between Samantha and Jack, that's all. The different way to travel with the galaxy and the various adventures is one example you don't want to miss. Open the gate and step through. You won't regret it!
