I saw a long day of death when it first appeared in the cinema, I thought the film gave a good position of soldiers, gave a real overview of the soldiers. The story is moving at a nice pace, showing a group of people behind the enemy lines and trying to return to their enemy prisoner. The characters are well developed and credible. <br /> <br /> David Hemmings is a good actor and plays a leading role with convictions like Alan Dobie (German Helmut), I was surprised that I couldn't find this movie on VHS or DVD, and I feel that has become a forgotten film that is sad because it is better than many other war films I've seen.
