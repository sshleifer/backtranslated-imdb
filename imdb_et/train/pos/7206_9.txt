Excellent plot within the plot. Shame about two of my heroes with a good look. Must be my upbringing :) <br /> <br /> Everything has worked very well. You never know who goes out, who. The last small twist allows everyone to get their own deserts. <br /> <br /> Recommend to everyone. Dangerous, tongue cheek thriller, which, if it has any flaws, is probably Michael Caine's excessive use of the word "bloody", but this is his signature, no. <br /> <br /> 9/10
