Great movie with great performances by Zack & Lochley. Much to their dissatisfaction (& mine) Garibaldi arrived at the station. (All respect for Jerry Doyle, but on the 4th and 5th anniversary I lost sympathy for this character.) He doesn't take him for a long time to criticize Zack (who I love best at exhibitions) and accept. I'm sure Zack could have caught up. The Soulhunter plot is exciting, especially if you believe in heaven, as Zack does. Humor complements it nicely. 10/10
