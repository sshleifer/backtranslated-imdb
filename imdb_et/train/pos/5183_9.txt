<br /> <br /> This movie is my favorite. I saw it in college at the beginning of the 90s, and although I couldn't associate the film with the thirties, I felt that this story, characters and film were generally top-notch. For people who spoke negatively about the Indian summer, you can freely stick to Armageddon-type movies and leave the movies with a great, healthy story to those who appreciate them.
