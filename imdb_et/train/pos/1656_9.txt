"Thieves and Liars" present us with a very natural image of the levels of corruption affecting many in Puerto Rico and forcing them to make trouble, if not impossible choices about the lives of themselves and their loved ones. This is great given that some are non-professional participants; a great choice that enhances the film's reality. Photography pushes the story without intrusion, as it should be on this type of film. According to the script, the character and attitude of "Boricuua" is very deep. Sometimes you seem to be watching a documentary! Looking at this film, you seem to have secretly entered the real society of Puerto Rica and you are invisibly looking at how it is absorbed. I love it!
