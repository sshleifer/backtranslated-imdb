STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday evening *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> A particularly bad actor who gets his (now blinking) appearance The strong dramatic talent, Richard Gere, has always been a rather curious, always firm contribution to the roles of leading men who have a significant presence today in the American Hollywood scene. But nowadays it seems that he is more into such direct DVDs / limited release tasks and maybe he seems to be more satisfied with his security now. <br /> <br /> He has to rely on some cumbersome question here as a tougher cynical worker Earl Babbage, one of the workers assigned to a hundred sex offenders in a US region, who, along with his new member of the Defense Forces Allison (Claire Danes), must take the last case, forcing him to abduct a young woman who is trying to forgive her for a case she could not. <br /> <br /> This is a kind of diving on the darker side of humanity by training material that is not necessarily for the people or for those looking for light. viewing. And as such, it is a pretty strong, convincing film, unreasonable and not limited by the direct DVD budget. The only thing that is really pulled back is the excessively used nervous, fast-cutting camera series that are used at more dramatic moments, which after a while look a little horns. But it is still one of the strongest materials I've seen in Gere, trying inadvertently to darken and over the edge. ***
