This review is for the long cut of this movie. <br /> <br /> For the first time I looked at Dragon Lord when I bought this DVD many years ago. I liked this movie and I can read some more positive comments to get a general idea. <br /> <br /> This is said. I've always found the story a little confusing. After all, the film is a love story. And it always seemed strange to me that the story of love should end in a 20-minute struggle. <br /> <br /> In the extended version, this is no longer the case. The old "original" version starts with a large barrel-climb / rugby-like sequence, which is the new final sequence of the extended version. The opening order is Dragon (Jackie Chan) who hangs around his house and pretends he is training and repeating when his father is around. <br /> <br /> The other is also extended and extended, and the story makes much more sense than you look at it. Stimulation is also better and generally works better. It seems like a story of love and leaves you with no questions as to why it ends so drastically and dramatically as a regular version does. <br /> <br /> I suggest to anyone who is a Hong Kong cinema or just an ordinary Jackie Chan fanatic to get an extended version and watch the movie as it was originally intended. (Or at least how I think it was meant. Why else would they do it and redesign some scenes) When I looked at it, I felt like I was watching a completely new Jackie Chan movie, although most sequences were the same.
