Wow I loved this movie! It's a normal life in a small village. About hypocrisy and honesty, love and surrender. Great! This is something that everyone in life is facing. You have to do things with passion. But some people don't know your passion and try to stop you. There are people who find the opinion of others and "what neighbors think" more important than following their heart. Don't let someone else stop you from fulfilling your dreams and passion. I loved the fact that the actors were all really normal people, it could have been my family. There is no great beauty, but all the people you love while filming.
