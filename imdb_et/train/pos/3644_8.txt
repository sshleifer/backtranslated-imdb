Rookie builds on the true story of a 40-year-old school teacher at Big Lake, Texas, reaching major companies. Jimmy Morris (Dennis Quaid) is a small town high school science teacher and baseball coach. His team loses terribly until the team discovers that their coach played smaller leagues and was able to throw 98mph. <br /> <br /> After practicing throwing and betting, Jim agrees that if his team wins regional, he will try for big leagues. The film tells Jimmy's story that the boy is playing in his main game in his first game. This is a great underwear and a very friendly family film. Dennis Quaid at the same time makes the film valuable, giving emotional performance, and is supported by an excellent form of support that includes: Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths and Angus T. Jones. <br /> <br /> The story develops for a while and some scenes are a bit slow, but everything works fine. Baseball scenes are fun, well-filmed, and are superbly depicted. The film is not really about baseball, but about one man's dream to dream. It's inspiring, it's emotional, and it's funny. I liked it, I hope you do it. <br /> <br /> Rookie. Starring Dennis Quaid, Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths and Angus T. Jones. <br /> <br /> 4 of 5 stars.
