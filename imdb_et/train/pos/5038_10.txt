What is real treatment and quite unexpected. That's what the real thriller movie is. I hurried to the video store, grabbed the movie without reading the whole back and hoped for the best. I was completely surprised and happy. I really enjoyed the actors and their characters. I thought they all had a great result and made their characters real. The plot was well thought out, well-written and directed. It kept you interested from start to finish and never got bored for a minute. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to those who love thrillers, especially thrillers, who are well-paced and those who keep your attention. Certainly 10 out of 10 of me.
