The film was completely Awesome and Cool. The graphics were great and it was amazing. Especially, Flik was great and awesome in the movie, and he was funny and he was and sometimes he was intelligent. Circus errors are colorful and are great in the movie. The cops were also cool and cool in the movie. Hopper was a clean and perfect villain. Even, Dot was cute. When the bird could make mistakes, this scene was great and good. Even the last scene was fantastic and cool. Even Flik's inventions were good. The construction of artificial birds was a good idea to scare the deer. When ants build an artificial bird, this scene was good and nice, so I really appreciate the creators of A Bug's Life.
