David Duchovney creates a role he had to repeat somewhat in Californication - a talent in difficulty. And this is his playable role. <br /> <br /> This thriller starts with good speed and takes you to the end. Timothy Hutton plays fine cable and Angelina Jolie pouti. The story of a disgraced doctor who found his way into the criminal world is well written. Drug addiction and the desire for a ridiculous Jolie to mix a stop cocktail. Unfortunately, the story ends up a bit weaker and the relationship between the villains and the FBI is confusing and rushed as it would only be for the final scene. But it's aside, a movie that's worth seeing.
