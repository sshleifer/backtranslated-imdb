The full-length adaptation of Terry Gilliam's Chris Marker short film LA JETEE is full of entertaining surprises, but touches your heart thanks to the great pain. Gilliam's fantasy work with a script by David and Janet Peoples to play with his head as much as it is with poor James Cole (Willis like his most Steve McQueen - better than McQueen, even!), Time traveling a convicted future who literally does not know if he is coming or going when the team of scientists sends him back to the wrong era, at the same time trying to prevent the 1995 plague that is lethal to humans but safe for animals. A properly reasoned psychiatrist will give Will, rightly Oscar-named Brad Pitt and Madeline Stowe, the best results in his career. Even Paul Buckmaster's tango-style score is haunting. This is a non-miss!
