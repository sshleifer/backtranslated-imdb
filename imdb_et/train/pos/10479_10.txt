This is the movie my dentist actually suggested to me, and I'm glad he did it! The mix of British humor (when I should say humor?) And the reality of a lost, middle-aged widow who is trying to maintain her lifestyle was hoot. Add to this mix the reality of what the pot actually cultivates (these plants under the bushes didn't start doing it without TLCs), and it's really a fun but touching movie. I'm laughing every time I hope for a vision of all the bar patrons who sit in sunglasses with sunglasses for counting lights! Maybe it's just the blood of my Mendocino County, but the British certainly got that right !! 10/10
