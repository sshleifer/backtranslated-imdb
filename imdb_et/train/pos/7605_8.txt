Lost is a very well done TV series for some people who have disappeared on the island. there are so many turns that you can't really decide who your favorite character is, one minute on him, he does something that is the coolest, then he starts doing something that is the coolest and the intercourse accumulates and just As you are breaking the episode ends and you like noooooooooooooooooooo !!!!!! so you have to wait for a whole week too to see the next episode, but it's worth the wait. The thrill, action, romance, humor is all this except for the topless girls, but it's good because it means you can actually focus on the story more and the story is what it is. so if you like a good story and like intercourse, it is good, but 24 I think it's probably better (I also have an overview that you could check it out). because it is so unpredictable, you never know what will happen.
