It's a lukewarm docu-drama that doesn't cover any new lands, all clich√©s, and is sloppy with facts. For example, Munich is a very flat city. Why is the movie hills? For example, the great end of the war in 1918 was not an assignment but an enemy. However, it is declared overdue. For example, European news sellers did not call (and did not) headlines when they laugh at their papers. However, this strictly American practice is used in the film. For example, the Nazis did not take a German eagle before they took power, but there is a lecture when Hitler equips one of his chillers. Indeed, most of the disappointing production is slightly more than Hitler's oratorio. The film also confirms the myth that the Hoffbrauhaus in Munich had putsch beer. It wasn't. Robert Carlyle describes his subject well. But his support cast is the best and very often not even. These comments are based only on the first episode. One can only hope that the other is better but does not.
