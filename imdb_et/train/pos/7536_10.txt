In a personal comment that Pat Robertson is evil and his program is evil, there is nothing to compare what is evil and just. His evil concept is the opposite of evil. The Bible itself says that in recent days, people call good and evil good! He doesn't even know that he fulfilled the Bible prophecy! If you don't know God and refuse to know him now, that's okay. He still loves you, but when you finally kneel at him, it's too late for you. God sends someone to hell, not even you! You go there for your decision and your spewing determines it! May God be merciful and give you the experience of Damascus tea. The 700 clubs and the Pat Robertson ministry are one of the reasons I am here. Alcoholism, adultery, and apparently death on the edge of God came on the TV screen and was used by Pat Robertson and thanked God! You have the right to say what you said, but you have no right to be cursed with your words. God is merciful to you.
