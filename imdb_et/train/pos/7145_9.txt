This movie was a great ensemble of adult actors with cast youthful actors that will be in the movies for long if there is a right. Leadership and editing were great. I can search for a book from which it has been adapted, it must be great. (I liked it.) Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight and Tim Blake Nelson were watching! Henry Winkler and Nathan Davis had not seen enough, but they were fun on the screen. The camp's children couldn't be better. (as I said, I liked it!)
