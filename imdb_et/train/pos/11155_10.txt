Young, beautiful, muscular, Joe Buck (Jon Voight) moves from Texas to New York, thinking he is living as a stud. He gets there and quickly finds that it's not easy - he's going through one humiliating experience after another. At the end of his rope, he grabs the struck, buggy Rosso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman). Together they try to survive and get out of town and move to Florida. But do they do it? <br /> <br /> Very dark, annoying but exciting movie. Director John Schelsinger paints a very gloomy portrait of NYC and its inhabitants. In this way, it is dated - the city may be so bad in 1969, but it has now been cleared up. It also uses every camera in the trick book - the color becomes black and white; trippy dream sequences; flashes on; flash units (especially rape); impact cuts; strange sound effects ... you call it. It keeps you exhausted and out of the center - but I couldn't see the view. <br /> <br /> There is not much story - it basically focuses on friendship between Rizzo and Buc. There is a reference that they may have been lovers (the last stroke shows it). This is just a portrait of two damaged characters trying to survive in the cold, cruel, urban jungle. <br /> <br /> It was originally rated X in 1969 - the only reason why MPAA didn't think parents would want their kids to see it. However, it was a big hit with higher education institutions (then X meant someone under the age of 17). It has also been the only X rated movie that won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Hoffman and Voight were prizes, as was (mysteriously) Sylvia Miles, who was in the picture for 5 minutes! Finally, it was lowered to R (without a cut) when it was released in 1980. <br /> <br /> This movie also introduced a great song "Everybody's Talkin" and got a big hit. br /> <br /> Big movie, but very dark, I'll give it 10. DON'T see it on commercial TV - it's cut into strips and incomprehensible.
