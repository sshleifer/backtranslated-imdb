It's a modest, characteristic comedy filmed in Brazil with a low budget. The premise is familiar, just like in the 1950's Danny Kaye movie ** double **: someone who makes a joke about a famous person is dragged into the real person. <br /> <br /> A contract between two wires is very effective. Raul Julia is a secret police officer of the German parade, long, cool, threatening and Latin. He deliberately sports an obvious blonde color work. Richard Dreyfus, animated, short, New York Jewish, is funny and likeable. There are many references and jokes about the show. <br /> <br /> The device is clearly designed in Paraguay. Indeed, from the beginning of the fifties to the late eighties, Paraguay was ruled by General Alfredo Stroessner, an unelected military dictator whose father had emigrated from Germany. But Mazurszky, the writer / director, shows his ignorance of local conditions when he paints Paradorics in Paraguay into a typical Latin American tyranny with great differences between wealth and active guerrilla rebels. What's more, Mazursky complains about the comic Jonathan Winters as an American pensioner who is actually C.I.A. The Parador station manager and the number that is so powerful that he can give the President of the country embarrassing chewing gum. In fact, the US has little influence in Paraguay, which is largely without the social and racial tensions seen elsewhere in the region. This is because the country has won long and costly wars against much larger neighbors in the 19th and 20th centuries. The male population was destroyed at almost both times, but the society that was formed was patriotic, racially homogeneous, and strongly connected. <br /> <br /> Another level is the feminism bow in Madonna's form. Brazilian actress Sonia Braga played Madonna's former nightclub dancer, who is a presidential election girl at the beginning of the film, but this is seen on television by the president - now politically and cosmetically correct, no makeup, hair demurely pulled back, swept up the velvet by revolution. <br /> <br /> Once such an event occurred in Latin America, the management of Isabel Peron of Argentina (not the beloved Evita who was never in office) lasted. two years after his wife's death, the legendary ** Juan Peron.
