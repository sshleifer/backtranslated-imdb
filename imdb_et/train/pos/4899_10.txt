I'm so glad I saw this video in the store. I was looking for some happy movies and it turned out to be a real pearl. I loved the fact that the movie, a love story, wasn't about the beautiful twenty; Rather, it is a story of some beautiful sixty who were twenty times earlier. It is a good, well-written and wonderfully performed story with the fabulous WWII band music. It is also a delightful surprise for this Scottish castle lovers. It left me smiling and ready to look again at what I did a few more times before I turned it on. I highly recommend it.
