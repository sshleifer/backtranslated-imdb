American wife, her European husband and children return to their mother's home "Watch on the Rhine", a 1943 film based on Lillian Hellman's play, starring Paul Lukas (whom I believe he will repeat here), Bette Davis, Lucile Watson, George Coulouris, Geraldine Fitzgerald and Donald Woods. Antifascist, underground movement, repeatedly injured by the Nazis, wanted Kurt Muller (Lukas) to have a long vacation on his wealthy mothers. But he discovers that there is really no escape because one of the households (Coulouris) is suspicious of his true identity and more than willing to sell him. <br /> <br /> Great productions in this film are written from Lillian Hellman's liberal point of view. Certainly, it was a powerful propaganda vehicle during the release, because the evil war and things that happened to people from other countries would come to secure American homes. The big contradiction of the film today is that Paul Lukas won the Casablanca Humphrey Bogart Oscar. Humphrey Bogart was a wonderful screen presence and fabulous Rick, but Lukas is transcendental than Kurt. The monologue he needs to kill is intestinal picking, just to mention one scene. <br /> <br /> Although this is not what is meant by Bette Davis's film, he gives a masterful performance here, Kuri's loyal and loving woman, Sara. His acting tugs in the heart and the love scenes between Kurt and Sara are beautiful and delicate. In the last half of the film, I had tears of honesty in emotions. Lillian Hellman is not a cup of everyone, but unlike the "Little Foxes", he has written some really sympathetic, wonderful characters and the good story that Warner Brothers gave to A and his production values. Highly recommended.
