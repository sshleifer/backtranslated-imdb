When John Singleton is on, he is * * *! And this is one of his best films. Not as tight as Boyz-n-the-Hood, but close to it (and much of the same letter cast). This film was very well written, very well assembled and well captured. There are very few critics and most of my complaints are superficial (eg where Fudge got money for a 6-year college and a lot of expensive things? A rich background was not mentioned ... And why not Professor Phibbs He has his term * that he should have one. .. And while we are with it, being an engineering student, hick or not, Remy is a pretty stupid character - I think he would have a little more basic information on his way - he's talking and acting like a whole bottle). <br /> <br /> But this was a very sharp film. A good number of characters and perspectives; and Singleton doesn't take the story away - many characters are atypical and do a good job of mixing the Panthers and Supremacist scenes together to show stupidity on both sides. <br /> <br /> Much cinematography was great; I especially loved this scene, where Kirsty Swanson goes into intimate with Taryn and Wayne. The scenes from Malik / Deja were also really good. <br /> <br /> Dialogue was sometimes a lot; this film had a tendency to preach from time to time, and it also tends to grab the points he was doing with his head if the dots were quite uncomfortable (we don't really need the US flag) "UNLEARN" is written, give credit, we are not morals. ..). And if most of the time * most of Singleton's melodrama works quite well, sometimes it gets too * fun (like Deja's death, which is good until she screams out "WHY !!!", which just destroyed the whole effect and scene). <br /> <br /> But in general it worked at the top of the line. Omar Epps' great performances (perhaps the best I've ever seen), Kirsty Swanson (who knew Buffy could act?), Michael Rapaport (surprised me by hell ... after True Romance and beautiful girls, although she was a one-piece actor and of course Ice Cube and Laurence Fishburne are * always * outstanding *. <br /> <br /> Fall? Jennifer Connelly was flat; although it is not entirely his fault: his role was stereotypical and one-dimensional. General to the highest degree. And Tyra Banks, who played a role, was not terrible. He teased and whistled and whirled. Another model-reversing actor who failed (though there are few who prove the exception to this rule). <br /> <br /> Finally, the soundtrack! Wow! An amazing soundtrack (which is definitely worth it!) That fits the film like a glove. Every scene has a double song (although Tori Amose's songs really * annoy me at last ... not his best work). Liz Phair, Rage Against The Machine, Ice Cube ... How Can You Go Wrong? <br /> <br /> In summary: a really good clock, really strong cast, great script, great movie. 8/10
