"Killing High" is a completely ridiculous slasher flick about high school nerd marty who can choose all the time for some pranksters.The prank goes wrong and he gets to get fabulously burned. Six years later his torturers all attend the reunion with just ten of them of course and low and see, Marty murders them one after another. Critical actor Caroline Munro ("Maniac") leads the hero (who dies anyway!). a little grotesque death scenes to satisfy the gore freaks: the boy's belly explodes, the second female victim literally becomes an acid bath, the couple who is in bed, gets an electric shock, the boy is broken by the tractor, one girl is drowned and the doctor gets a hyperdermal needle . The killer carries a decent and rather horrible jestri mask and the device (a beautiful old English castle) is really nice. However, the dream finale is totally pathetic. All this is true, "killing high" is a garbage, but I enjoyed it.
