For a long time in my life, I did not like this film or I liked this film, but not as much as it did. I looked at it recently (dreamily enough) and I liked it more than I had done because I was under 6 years old or something. Now I appreciate it more because I do some other Disney classic I recently watched (including "Sleeping Beauty" and "Pinnochio" or spell it). <br /> <br /> I now appreciate the great animation, the smart "Disney" plot, the humor of mice, the expressed emotions and the plot. Animation is very well done, often it seems you are everywhere other characters are watching them. Animation also represents the style of the background, including the city (which is shown twice briefly). Disney changes it from the original fairy-tale to a surprisingly good way, injecting a smart plot, such as clothes and bulk (usually I don't like Disney movies if they're not like the original story I don't think they made the book good in some of my movies because I don't think The Disney movie is a good movie. <br /> <br /> You already know the story, Cinderella is a girl who works with her terrible mother and sister. She goes to the ball with her fairy tales and loses the glass ash ... <br /> <br /> This is a movie that you have to watch very much with other people. The immediate family is not good enough. To enjoy this, I suggest you do it with your friends (and a close family if you want to.). <br /> <br /> I recommend it to people who like Disney at least a bit, people who like fairy tales and people who like mice. Enjoy! :-)
