How a normal day starts at Point Place, Wisconsin ... <br /> <br /> First, Redi, the tyrannical father of the Forman family and veteran of World War II, sit at the kitchen table and reads his newspaper while his happy wife, Kitty, serves breakfast . Then their skinny son, Eric, sits at the table, and his father starts his daily shouting, usually involving his leg behind Eric, if (include a reason here). When her unsuccessful angel-faced sister Laurie is at home, she goes, then the red stops shouting and kindly speaks to her, making Eric away from the family. <br /> <br /> Once this day (painful) ritual is over, Eric runs down to his basement, where all his friends are hanging. And when we see them, it becomes obvious to Eric and his redhead tomboy girlfriend, neighbor and childhood friend Donna Pinciotti. Meet Steven Hyde, a conspiracy theorist who hates discotheque and doesn't care about what is about as long as it's not funny to watch; Michael Kelso, a boy who thinks he will get his life through his appearance and carrots as trees grow; Jackie Burkhardt, who considers herself the most beautiful girl, enriched her rich father and, of course, the cheerleader child; and a naive but superfluous alien who loves candy and can't keep a secret. At first they just hang out, talk and have fun with Kelso, but then they all sit around and let real fun ... before you go for something they will regret later. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Red will go out and meet Donna's wonderful parents, Bob and Midge. He's rude, but they don't mind because they think he's joking. Somewhere around is Leo, an aging hippie who is constantly confused and does not play the word without even noticing. <br /> <br /> Did you see a seemingly peaceful neighborhood with all these awesome characters? Of course, most of the "clichés" seem, but the exhibition takes a new level of cliché. Now throw in some of the worst stories that sitcom can offer, sit back and enjoy one of the best TV shows. What never dos the same thing twice, and what is most "cute funny" compared to purely hysterical sitcoms. If you get stuck, don't let this show go. Bite the hook over and over and, man, you see the sitcom genre from a whole new future.
