Melvyn Douglas once again gives a polished object, where this time he lives in the role of a detective who cannot love before duty and adventure, and warmly loves Joan Blondell (who is far from illiterate, as suggested by one reviewer) wrote a novel about his early life) is as enjoyable as ever Earlier than his eternally suffered sweetheart. It's almost a screwball comedy, almost a Thin Man-type movie, almost a series, I think it didn't give this sequel. It doesn't reach classical status, but it has all the ingredients for 85 minutes with an episodic but pacey script, fine character actors and a direction that keeps it all fast enough that you almost don't notice that Williams (Douglas) isn't exactly Columbo . I want more of these movies.
