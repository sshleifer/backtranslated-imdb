Okay. It has been a favorite of the 14th century. Allowed, I don't look any more once a year, but ... It's not an older generation film that wants a deeper meaning or some brilliant message. This movie is FUN. It's pretty dated, almost a passport, but Parker Posey is so brilliant that it's incredible. If you want to have a 90-year-old breakfast in Tiffany, you were in the 90s, or you love Parker, this movie is for you. Otherwise, don't worry.
