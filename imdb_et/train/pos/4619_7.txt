First of all, I am a big fan of 80s movies and also Jennifer Conelly. So yesterday yesterday at a local used book / movie store and found a VHS copy. I read back and it sounded good and for $ 3.99, it was good. So I took it home and put it in a videotape. What a sweet movie! I am now more involved with films such as "Last Night" or "St. Elmo's Fire, but still remember what was 15/16 and in love with older men and so on. we are younger. And if it doesn't work, we're heart-breaking and we think we'll never get over it. But of course we do. Many times. This is the sweet quality that I really got from this movie. "Oh, I remember if something happened to me ..." is through it. The characters are interesting and well developed. I recommend it to anyone who loves 80's movies, especially movies, or to anyone who just wants to go back and remember the simpler time in their lives.
