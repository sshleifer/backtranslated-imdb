Showing good activity, but nothing new. It was high in the mountains, showing some beautiful landscapes and such. One man takes a group of mercenaries, the lead flies and he strikes behind. It could have been called "Rambo Goes to the Rockies", it was a pat. It had one very effective scene on the first film I was in horror. Not a bad picture, but the same thing, 'same thing'.
