Modesty Blaise's comics and novels, which are great in the film, have a lot of material. Unfortunately, many attempts have been made and they have not fulfilled their great potential. So, no, it's not modest what you know about a comic (currently printed in a nice edition of Titan's books). It is modest about 5 to 6 years before the first strip and what you can put on your back is the right one. <br /> <br /> Miramax has film rights for the character, Quentin Tarantino acts as a lawyer and technical advisor. The early projects of the Miramax project tried to adapt one of the best novels, but they always managed to exclude some important elements. Tarantino was not happy with any of them and offered his name for the project so they could move on. The studio wanted to keep her in the process of credit because they knew she had a "character" and her world. When the rights of the film are out of date, they decided to try a very different approach. The result was "My name is modest", a small direct video that introduces the character. <br /> <br /> Will not feature Willie Garvin or Sir Gerald. These characters are important to Blaise's adventures in most of the published stories. What this film is about shows the strength of its own character. He never loses his tenderness and you will never doubt that he is even armed with a gun-filled gangster. Most of the movies are in the casino, which undoubtedly saved money in production. It doesn't matter. The film is not that cheap. Instead, it gives the character a rather broad (and plausible) story and shows how far he thinks. If Miramax now adjusts any comic or novel, they have beautifully shaped the character's background and do not have to spend much time on their origin. I understand that the words "Direct-to-Video" do not create confidence, but this movie is worth it.
