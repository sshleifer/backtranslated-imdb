When first screened in the United States in 1972, The Night Stalker became the highest-named T.V. movie history. Based on the unpublished novel by Jeff Rice, it was told how the fearless researcher Carl Kolchak (late Darren McGavin) discovered a vampire in today's Las Vegas. When he came to British television four years later, it did not have the same effect, but my friends talked about it at school on Monday morning as it was I. We all agreed that it was one of the most exciting things we had seen. <br /> <br /> I didn't know the Night Strangler was there until it appeared almost ten years later. I.T.V., who reviewed "Kolchaki" films, had apparently decided to pass on the spin-off series; they felt "Barnaby Jones" draw in Buddy Ebsen's main role and viewers can "Kolchaki" mix with "Kojakiga"! Over the years, my only source of information about the exhibition has been the Fangoria magazine. I couldn't even buy Jeff Rice novels. <br /> <br /> Then something wonderful happened. In 1990, B.B.-2 exhibited a part of the late-night Friday series dedicated to Richard O'Brian's supernatural "Mystery Train". "Kolchak" found himself rubbing his shoulders, such as "Brain Eaters" and "Earth Vs. Spider". The open titles were cut off by removing Kolchak's whistling and closing credits ... well, they weren't. <br /> <br /> The first episode reviewed was a werewolf. I can't say I was too impressed, but I stuck with it and I'm glad I did! <br /> <br /> I really want to see it in 1974. Creepy, humorous, exciting, no wonder he unleashed Chris Carter's imagination. The biggest asset of the exhibition was, of course, McGavin. Unlike the recent Kolchak, the original was original, eccentricly dressed, rather conservative. He was supernatural what Columbo was for crime. The recent Simon Oakland was also great when Kolchaki's bad tempered boss Tony Vincenzo. The scripts were surprised by the wonderful and dry spirit. I found myself in the program more humor than horror. When the twenty episodes ended, I felt unsuccessful. <br /> <br /> "X Files" came a few years later and filled the gap - but only to some extent. I wanted Kolchaki and Vincenzo back. I'm glad the example was never revived. Without Oakland it wouldn't have been the same. <br /> <br /> I now have Rice Books and read them several times. I was very surprised when Stephen King created the first (in his book "Danse Macabre") as it is as good as what he has written. <br /> <br /> Okay, so some monsters were barely state-of-the-art, but what then? The new Kolchak was completely out of the original point. What you don't see is sometimes more frightening than what you do ... <br /> <br /> Best Episode - "Fear of Heights" Worst Episode - "Sentry"
