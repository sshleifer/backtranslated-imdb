This is one of the films they promoted too much. If you watch T.V, you may not be able to watch the movie. Almost all of the funny scenes are spoiled in the preview, except one that just happens when Jennifer Annisten is funny. It is typical of Jim Carrey's humor and it's really funny. Just don't look at this movie while waiting to be surprised. All in all, if you like Jim Carrey or comedies, then this is a must-have, otherwise look at the previews and you're just as happy.
