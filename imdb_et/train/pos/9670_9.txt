One of the best films I've ever seen was the Irish movie Philadelphia, here I came. I read the game before seeing the movie and I both loved it. This is the story of a young man getting ready to go to Ireland from America because he can't live in Ireland. It is said from the perspective of a young man (seen by other characters in the film), as well as another young man who represents his uncensored thoughts and feelings, but who is not seen by other characters in the film. This is a very sad film, but deeply touching, and I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to think of something. I love all Irish movies or almost every movie from Ireland, and all the movies with the late Irish actress Donal McCann get my voice. I'd look at the person looking at the rubber for 2 hours on the screen, and unfortunately I have it. shame that he is so young.
