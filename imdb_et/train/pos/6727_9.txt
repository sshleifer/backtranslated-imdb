A few days ago, I realized that the authors of this film put words in their titles. This film is not primarily an act of "riding giants", but mostly of people who are giants of sport, giants of RIDING, to change the emphasis. <br /> <br /> My teenagers lived in a Wedge block, one of the hardest and best places to build in the world. I've been surfing 15 to 18 feet and I've been driving 10 and 12 feet on several occasions. This experience is why I am completely scared of the surfers in this movie. My idea that Jeff Clark, in all the ordinary mortals, could get away with Midingick's HIMSELF ride over Miding for more than ten years, I don't think so. The first safety rule for every water sport is "Never surf / dive / swim with yourself." He went to where there were no sensible people and lived to talk about it. I wouldn't go there if the water was 75 degrees and the sharks were all left. In the world of warm water: The first blow to the jaws on the jaws always makes the skin excite the whole body. These are not just scary waves, they are uncontrollable waves of gut-evacuation. When we see Laird Hamilton not just over 40-60 feet of waves (I can't hardly write these numbers), but I actually work faces like a fun day in Rincon, I've blown away. Great wave riders are committed and focused on anyone who is comparable to everyone in the world. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie. I just gave 10 to this 10 instead of just not mentioning the fact that the world has Hamilton / Kalama out of the big waves, and I think they deserve to be mentioned. Tying Ken Bradshawis outside log houses and 10 is!
