I really enjoyed headache performances. Emma Lung is bold and interesting. The director has developed performances where characters are not one-dimensional. A complicated story about the change of ages. It was also assessed that unions are losing power and the impact of large employers on a small town. I disagree with the comment that the older man must be attractive. There are many relationships between older men and younger women without a good appearance. The depth of symbols may not attract so low. The film has good looks and cinematography is also good.
