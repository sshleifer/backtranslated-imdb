It was a little odd and evil and I enjoyed it a lot, the characters of the exhibition were great and congratulated each other well. I was sorry to see that it was interrupted. I would have loved to see where it could have gone. Lucas was scary and tempting. And I would have liked to see him more and how his character changed. However, I buy an exhibition to enjoy, it was great to do something else on television. And Paige Turrco, who was Caleb's cousin, was a big secret about where and what he was planning for Lucas. It is a shame that it is still not ... or never finished, I would have loved to see what would have happened.
