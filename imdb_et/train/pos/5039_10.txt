Stunning. Absolutely stunning. This is a film about two children who have a sudden vision. He says the angel is visiting him and tells him to kill "demons". He gets instructions later and they start demons that are ordinary people with the naked eye. They kill these so-called demons with the head of the ax and cut them up, burying them in a rose garden. Their father says he sees their sins when he touches them. The film continues, turning at the end. <br /> <br /> What I love about this movie is that it takes full account of the weakness of human perception. Is their father totally crazy? Or does he tell the truth? The audience is left to decide. Go make your own decision and watch the movie. Now.
