This movie has everything that makes it worth watching a bad movie - sloppy editing, little or no consistency, crazy dialogue, bad (maybe even telling non-existent) acting, pointless story, pictures that move to the FAR for too long ... and this ideal for MST3K-style reeling, not to mention "Corpse Eaters Drinking Game": Scribble forms ... take off - write your name ... take down - Try bad Foley editing ... take a lot, the only reason I don't rated it more than 8, is that there is not enough free free nudity and, despite the madness it is only an hour - hell, such a movie should have been at least 20-30 minutes longer!
