First of all, let me say that before Sunrise, like all movies, is NOT all the flavors. It seems that some people are less intelligent to admit this fact, but it is remarkable to think about what is not really like this little harmless film created by some people. For me, like most people here, before Sunrise hit a deep chord, I was really stunned, moved, inspired. This is a movie that is ultimately useful for more than one viewing. It creates some of the most awesomely unforgettable feelings and emotions that you can imagine. It is impossible to imagine this world without thinking about what inspirational feelings I got from it. It is very intelligent and inspirational, not so much as one conversation necessarily involves the next importance of Jesse and Celine discussions, but rather the small nuances, the perfectly worded answers that they generate from each other. It includes an honest, romantic, but short human emotion that will bloom awesomely from above in the Viennese atmosphere; it convinces us that their evolving relationship can be the world's greatest compliment. And what happens after that night is open for discussion, but I have no doubt that they will not start again. <br /> <br /> Simple comments by RockytheBear and the user below are a hopeless example of a doctrine worker who does not want to accept and respect those who love this movie. <br /> <br /> Look at this and it can change your lifestyle.
