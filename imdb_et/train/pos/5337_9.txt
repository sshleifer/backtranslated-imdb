It may be a 19-year-old post-autumn rewriting, as claimed by Director Mabel Cheung. Mabel uses rock music as a tool in this movie to express his personal attitude to life where love, desire and the resulting disappointment play an important role. Rock music may not be the best tool for delivering a deep mood, but it's not too inappropriate to use it because the life of underground rock musicians is bitterly more intense than normal. The director focuses more on the lack of subtle affection and the supremacy of life than mere rock music. Love between father and son, lovers and friends is delicate and touching through fine performance. Mabel does not try to decorate fish musicians as artists, but instead tries to reproduce the real life on the screen, working for years on this project and gathering information in pubs in the Beijing area. <br /> <br /> Daniel has probably given the best result in all of his current films. Her innate peace of mind and peace of mind are perfect for the film's blue mood.
