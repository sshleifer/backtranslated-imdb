In New York, Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle), a host dentist, meets his former roommate and friend Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) on the street. Charlest, after losing her wife and three daughters, got a lonely and abducted man in the tragic time of September 11, when Alan had trouble discussing her inner feeling with her wife. Alan drives back to Charlie and they go close to each other. Alan tries to improve Charlie's life by sending her to psychologist Angela Oakhurst (Liv Tyler), but Charlie reacts aggressively and sends him to court. <br /> <br /> Reign Over Me is good for drama disappearance, friendship, family and loneliness. September 11 is not important for the plot; it can be a car accident, a fire or another tragedy, as well as Donna Remar's sexual harassment, played by proud Saffron Burrows Alan. But the family drama works, supported by big performances by Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle. It is impossible to recognize Liv Tyler, I do not know if he uses an excessive make-up to look older, but his face is weird. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Reine Sobre Mim" ("Reign Over Me")
