Who did this movie? I love this movie? Somebody has a funny sense of humor ... <br /> <br /> This Zany, surreal filmmaking style is tempting, but it's hard to create - or just forget - the substance and characters that actually have souls, whether it gives the depth of such a movie. Without it, comedy is just a few ideas. Who cares. It may laugh, but it goes out of your way like a semi-good hamburger ... next ... <br /> <br /> Crosseyed may not be able to change anyone's life, but I appreciate the depth and content. They sneak on you. I started thinking about this movie: "Oh, I get this - indie comedy - wall alt - gonzo ... yup." And that is - but if we pay attention, it is sub-text and character moments. In this sense, the film breathes. It makes suggestions that will give a break - if you have seen them - and then, of course, it will consistently happily. <br /> <br /> You leave a point if you don't sign an agreement to stop the belief in the movie moments. Interacting with reality and surreality is one of the points in this film. <br /> <br /> Crosseyed is not perfect, but smart people did it. I want more. <br /> <br /> Dining room scenes are absolute HOOT. <br /> <br /> Put on your seat belt.
