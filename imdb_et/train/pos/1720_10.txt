This early biography short was so fun to watch. The second plate is one of D.W. The Griffith DVD Discovery of the Years (highly recommended) has three main points of interest and it is interesting to see Henry B. Walthall (nationalist, birth of a nation) as a chamber musician who gives an eye artist (and other things). <br /> <br /> Krahv's husband goes to betray a woman and has a small room with her walls with her marriage. It's sort of incredible that they didn't hear the wall running, but hey, maybe this wine had something to do. Here, Mr Johnson (the silent player's father Raymond Hackett) woods and adds melodrama, but unexpectedly in a comical way. The best moment is finally. When a woman goes out of shock and fear when she realizes she is doomed, Henry picks up her instrument and "fans" over her. The way he did this was such an unexpected and strange way of sexy, and I just lost it and laughed at my head. Expression on her face! From that moment I was fascinated by Henry B. Walthall.
