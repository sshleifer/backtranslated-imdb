This film is over head and shoulders above most cinematic comedies. It's virtually flawless! Writing, acting, production design, humor and sin are all wonderful! Even music - from Dean Martin to La Bohemen - is enchanting and delightful! - Olympia Dukakis, Vincent Gardenia, John Mahoney, Danny Aiello - Even Grandpa With Your Dog Pack! All of these performers and Norman Jewison as director of their ensemble perform their usual quality. For many participants, this film had an early exposure to the film, so casting is extraordinary - and we have many running power systems whose career was changed by their effectiveness in the film. have seen this movie many times - it can sometimes clear the effect of the film. Even more clearly, a few years ago, I realized that when I was looking at the scene of this film on any scene - any scene - that scene had been massively and beautifully designed. There are so many stunning and memorable scenes where the characters Cher and Nicolas Cage originally met, where Cage tells his story of trouble; Vincent Gardenia discovered opera with his parameter in the middle of his gold mine sanitary ware. In Olympia Dukakis, John Mahoney captures with his pupil a philanthropic line of contacts with co-workers: "Don't go where to eat!"; Danny Aiello in her dying mother's bed; Nicolas Cage "took" Cher's as an aria with a backlash! <br /> <br /> There are, of course, many great romantic comedies, including Sabrina (both versions, but especially Audrey Hepburn / Humphrey Bogart / William Holden original); When Harry met Sally; Apartment. <br /> <br /> Not quite equal to Moonstruck!
