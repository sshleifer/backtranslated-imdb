I saw this movie in a video store a few years ago and I rented it. My husband and I liked it so much that we bought VHS and enjoyed it since. The thing is that this film deserves recurring views. In particular, Americans do not intend to first joke. I know I didn't. <br /> <br /> This movie is funny, touching, sad - all at the same time. When Ray makes a toast for his daughter's wedding, it is disgraceful. When Karen calls Tony when she tries to kiss her, it is heartbreaking. When Beano is black at the end of the black woman, it's too funny for words. I danced in the living room "all over the world". <br /> <br /> Every result is perfect. Bill Nighy is rightly thanked for his portrayal of Ray, who has had too many bad trips. Stephen Rea is the perfect Tony, a lovable keyboard player who has carried Karen all these years. She has an attractive hangdog that makes women hug her. But all the actors are equally brilliant. <br /> <br /> Ignore all the tracks on this movie and watch it. It's a pearl.
