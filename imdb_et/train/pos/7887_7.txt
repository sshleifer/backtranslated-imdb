If your Freddy is a fan, you may not like it. It looks like it's a nightmare serum. There is not much to see here. The only reason he keeps it himself is Freddy's back attack. <br /> <br /> One thing that is always great in Nightmare movies is death scenes. But the scenes of death were very clever in it. The visual effects were great and the actor was OK, but in the back story was great. Basically, Freddy's story is full of it. <br /> <br /> I have read bad comments about it, but I enjoyed it despite many mistakes: <br /> <br /> 1. A nightmare on Elm Street. (8/10) <br /> <br /> 2. Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 3rd Nightmare Elm Street 4: Dream Master. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 4. Nightmare Elm on Street 3: Dream Warriors. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 5. The Dreadful Elm Street 5: The Child of Dreams. (6/10) <br /> <br /> 6. Nightmare Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge. (3/10) <br /> <br /> I recommend it when you enjoy the series. That was when Freddy was fully explained, but that's all there. Next in my list is Wes Cravens New Nightmare. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
