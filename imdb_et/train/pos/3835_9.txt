This movie is amazing - it's like a nightmare. Strange story, dark decor, insect insects everywhere, the idea pops up and surreal dreams ... Really great! People who love cultural figures or very dark thrillers will find this fantastic. It looks a bit like David Lynch's films: strange story, bizarre dreams, red curtains. Nuit Noire contains almost no plot. It is rather the order of surreal events, nightmares and meetings. This is a shortcoming. If the film had a really exciting line full of tension with an exciting denouement, I'd give it to 10 out of 10. But that's missing and that's why I gave the movie 8. Nuit Noire is a movie that's worth watching. Search for this DVD and get paid!
