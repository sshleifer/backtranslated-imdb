Indian directors are harsh, they have to compete with films like "Laggan", where 11 henpecked, castrated males defend their village and half of them are certified idiots. "Devdas", unhappy fedar-festooned drinking from foreign countries, the characters running in endless corridors do not feel any feelings or feelings - they probably live in a red tapestry and competition. But to make a good movie, you have to struggle to attract front runners who are quantitative, hidden in Split skirts and Dishum-Dishum struggles, preferably involving the nitwit "Bollywood" leading actor who is little beautiful. So you can connect with a director who wants to tell the story of Leonine's village leader, who in his words "protecting his village" is considered to be a violent film or a male audience too masculine. There are very few participants who can pass on anger and sins like Nana Patekar (Narasimhan). Nana Patekar lets you watch and watch her beret in her yard and mock a politician when her loyal admirers laugh at every satire's word she gets, meanwhile her daughter is bathing with her grandson. India. Nana Patekar is an important actor who belongs to the old show school, which is a lost breed in Hindi films. The alleged violence is a complicated part of storytelling with songs and dances thrown to the Germans, for whom the films are not selling, a sad but real situation. The faster it becomes for "Bollywood". Everyone said and did a good movie.
