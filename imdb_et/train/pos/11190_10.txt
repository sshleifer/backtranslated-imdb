One of the best (if not the best) screenings by Stephen King. Dark may be dark, surprisingly non-Hollywood ending, terrible atmosphere, amazing book customization, outstanding cast, education (not playing after life), short - all the great horror should be ... <br /> <br /> My favorite horror movie , line 10+.
