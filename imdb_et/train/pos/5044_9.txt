Bill Paxton celebrates this very original movie. Being the first time to see how good it was. The opinions I heard were OK. As a result, I waited most for the average thriller. But because of Paxtons, the movie is worth watching because of its excellent leadership and action, especially if you are a horror fanatic. closing credits. The strongest film is the story I have to say, it's very original and it's like I've ever seen. Well done for two young drivers who convey these emotions perfectly when they are confused boys. I give it to movie 9/10 and I recommend everyone to catch it.
