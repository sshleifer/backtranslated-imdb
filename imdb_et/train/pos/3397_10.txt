Soylent Green IS is really a good movie. <br /> <br /> I would never have thought of it. I don't like Heston in my sci-fi efforts. He is one of those actors who, like Superman, are able to meet all sneery and invincible at most times. I prefer the more vulnerable heroes. And indeed, he also throws his way through many of Soylent Green's, but as he is supposed to play all over the temptation, I really don't want to think. <br /> <br /> I understand why some people are turning their nose to this movie. Soylent Green does no effort to create futuristic images (what you know - it looks like 1973), and it doesn't work. But I admired the film's vision of a complex, corrupt and highly stratified society, and I was so pleased to see that Edward G. Robinson had such a touching, funny final role. Nice little moments - like when he shares some valuable food with Heston - really makes a movie. <br /> <br /> Soylent Green's message is quite relevant these days if nobody seems to know what the heck of a government or companies are up to. Funny, isn't it, to see Heston's prototype Michael Moore in the movie ...
