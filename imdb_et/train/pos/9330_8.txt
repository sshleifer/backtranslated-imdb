"Dangerous offender" is a story about a seemingly antisocial girl and how she got in that way. It is based on a true story, and while I am agitated by one notion of eternity, the nature of the title, and the difficulty of believing in his lawyer, I have to accept that life imitates art and that there are people who like it. <br /> <br /> The film succeeds for me, because although the title character's behavior is almost over, he gradually moves to his compassion, as the film shows how he got to his current situation - which turns out to be more self-destructive than antisocial. <br /> <br /> A really moving movie that brings the throat to the cucumber if you think it is - which is often the case. <br /> <br /> Despite many errors (including the difficulty of viewing, sometimes due to body functions and suicide attempts), this is another product I am proud to call Canada.
