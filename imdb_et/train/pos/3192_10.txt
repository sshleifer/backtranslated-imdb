Yes, it gets ten stars full. It's a simple day when this filling is a genius. One day, the universe sent Trent Harris's young, wonderfully strange man and Harris hit him on a tape that was really wrong, which you can't fake. Too bad it ended with a tragedy for a young man if his story could only be written in the alternative. The other two trilogy stages are the story, according to Sean Penn and Crispin Glover for young men. The world has expanded and the oddity is contextualized with retelling, which gives us a wider look at the vanilla growth of America. Recommended for everyone and everyone!
