I've been happy to read Martin Torgoff's "Don't Find My Home", full of information about American drug culture, which dates back to 1945-2000. This man knows his things !! I found him an excellent representative of this documentary. I was particularly pleased to watch the film of the Hippie Age and the 70's stoner culture. The soundtrack was great. Anyone who made it was definitely related to the sounds of every era. Hopefully, they will offer them and sell them as a CD. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in how the 1960s LSD experiments changed American culture as we know it. One thing that was missing was the mention of George Jung (Johnny Depp's "Blow"), allegedly responsible for a large proportion of marijuana and cocaine that came to this country in the 60s and 80s.
