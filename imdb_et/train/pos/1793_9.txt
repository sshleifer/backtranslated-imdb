I saw this movie on Sunday afternoon. I loved this movie. I loved it all, from the moments of mothers and daughters' successful moments to scenes where Mamie Gummer (Lila) was crying because she had decided to marry a man with her parents and not because she was really in love. I loved those moments because they were just so real. First of all, I was really scared because I was hoping that it wouldn't come like Bobby, which was a great, but badly written film with no real meat. But in the middle of the film I felt completely different. You laugh and you cry, but in the end you want to see the evening again. Trust me when I say, GO!
