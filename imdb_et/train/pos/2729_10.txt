I voted perfectly for how well it worked, not for content. After reading the book, it still gives chills and watches the movie. Two former minuses travel to their destination to steal money safely from the family to find out when they are in prison. Tensioning is taking place while driving because the soundtrack of the movie adds to the overall expectation. After killing on the farm, the next morning, a friend of the daughter's family is found in the family. The blood coughing scream, when the scene was put on a string, the phone pulled my blood cold and gave me chills. The fact that the killers just met their fate is the little comfort of this disastrous family. Robert Blake was great at portraying Perry Smith. The book is perfectly written by Truman Capote.
