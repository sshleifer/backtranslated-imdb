I'm disappointed that Reiser (who wrote the movie) felt the need to use so much embarrassment for some reason. Maybe this is the idea of ​​his "adult" movies, with many nasty words that throw the bathroom humor? I thought about her better and thought about her less about this movie. <br /> <br /> Falk is active and has some humor and some of the important issues that have made me give such a high rating. <Br>> <br /> It can be a good movie for adult children to watch and laugh at their people and their foibles. But ignoring the audience of the audience seriously undermines what might have been a family film, but not. Certainly, no money will be spent, although it may be worth watching for free on television.
