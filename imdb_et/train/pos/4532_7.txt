It was the first feature of Keaton, and it is actually three short short short periods (Stone Age, Roman Age, Modern Time) in the eternal triangle of romance. The stories are parallel to Griffith's INTOLERANCE, which was designed to satirize. The strengths of jokes and gags are based on almost all anachronisms that bring modern business to ancient devices. <br /> <br /> **** WARNING - SPOILERS THAT ARE SUCCESSFUL TO THE BEST POINTS ****** <br /> <br /> Here are the classic moments: <br /> <br /> Turtle who are on the generation board (stone age); Wristwatch with sunset (Roman age); Spare wheel (Roman age); Use of a helmet as a wheel attachment (Roman time); Early golf with clubs and rocks (Stone Age); The dictation of the will of the stones (Stone Age); Changes in weather conditions (Roman time); Snorkel racing with snowboarding - Buster, using leggings and huskies with a chariot notebook (Roman age). There are also unforgettable moments: <br /> <br /> Buster takes out the shaving tools to match the girls; A fantastic double take-off when the initial Buster looks at his disc to find the crab that looks at him (in one second he has jumped to sit in the sitting position and jumped into the waiter again - one of the most fun moments I've ever seen). And this lion - manicure - is just great. <br /> <br /> There is also color racism when four African-American litter bearers give up their mistresses for a rumor of rum. <br /> <br /> Cinema print is a bit blurry and contains a lot of nitrate damage and film damage - probably at the ends of rolls. The subway is played by the piano and the flute and borrowed heavily from Grieg. <br /> <br /> Lots of fun and full of laughs.
