The Pimlico Pass is a real affection for all British movie fans. Not only is it an enjoyable and thoroughly entertaining comedy, but it is a kinematic setback for an old newspaper, attitudes and scenarios are unfortunately only memory in British life. <br /> <br /> Stanley Holloway plays Arthur Pemberton, a resident of Pimlico, who finds a rich medieval treasure belonging to the Duke of Burgundy of the 14th century buried under their small suburban street, after the explosion of an unexploded bomb, for the last 600 years. <br /> <br /> Treasure is an old royal decree signed by King Edward IV of England (which has never been officially revoked) to confirm that this particular London street was declared Burgundy, which means that in the eyes of international law is Pemberton and other local residents are no longer British subjects, but Burgundian natives and their small street, which is an independent state in its own law and law itself. <br /> <br /> It sets war-torn and impoverished attacks when they believe they are outside England's law and jurisdiction, they burn their books in their drinking behavior, destroy and ignore their clothing coupons, ignore British licensing laws, etc. Independent Britain. <br /> <br /> But what is happening is still spiv, black marketeer and dishonest crook follow the example and cross the "border" to Burgundy as a shelter from the law and post-war restrictions to sell their bad goods and half of London consumers follow them to avoid foods, making your quiet happy little paradise, the early generation and quite crowded. <br /> <br /> Helping Whitehall, they said that thanks to developments, it is "now a foreign policy that His Majesty's Government does not want to involve," which leaves the inhabitants high and dry. However, they declare the legal boundary of the site and form a fully equipped customs office at the end of the road, mainly to monitor smuggling and to ensure the safety of the Pimlico population. <br /> <br /> Finally, the limit is closed, starting with a big limit, while the Bugunds are slowly running out of water and food, but never less struggling with real British style. Like one of Bugund's inhabitants, "we are English and we were always English, and that's just because we're English, we're fighting so hard to be Bugund" <br /> <br /> all the time the capital is when the rest of London learns from the poor Bugundi people they all feel forced to climb and help, throwing food and supplies out of the barbed wire blocking. <br /> <br /> Is Whitehall, who has fought this way, can bring this new batch of aliens to the knees over the centuries, especially since they are English !!!! <br /> <br /> Great story and fun all the time. Must not be skipped.
