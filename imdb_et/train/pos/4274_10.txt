I like this movie a lot, but it's a fact that you don't understand it if you're not from the former Yugoslavia. Most of the participants are now dead and they were the best actors in the former Yugoslavia. I appreciate that this movie is now in Divx and I get it in my collection. Macedonia. Serbia. Montenegro. Bosnia and Herzegovina. Croatia. Slovenia. It was all the former Yugoslavia, the melting pot of the Balcal peoples. It could be a dream country when Slobodan Milosevic, Franjo Tudjman and other nationalists do not dwell on the people's mind with their ill idea.
