Maybe Disney hoped for another Mary Poppins, but this is a very different story and Angela is glad she was a very different performer to the great Julie Andrews. Having said that, Lansbury is completely cast and gives magical performance. There's something delicious about her character, and David Tomlinson gives him great support. Tomilinson is able to bring sound, but he is definitely not much of a singer. It doesn't matter that he was such a talented actor you hardly notice. There are some great fires from other times, such as love stars, like Roddy McDowel, who gives a winning result and a very loved Tessie OShea who does very little, but it's nice to look at the old ones. It is also lovely to see the small roles of Sam Jaffe and King British Bruce Forsythe. Score has a few beautiful songs, especially The briny sea and The Believing of Not Believing. A large number of Portabello highways reach the border, but it has a lot of theatricality. Effects nowadays look a bit cliche, but the scene where the German invaders attack the film by the most ferocious army is quite impressive. Children are not as annoying as other films, but it is not difficult to understand what the youngest boy is saying. I loved the home army marching. The home guard was very important to Britain and it is a warm respect. Animation is pleasant, much better than Pixar, which I find grotesque. Warm happy movie and the miracle he didn't make on stage.
