Even in the 21st century, babysitting is dangerous: women are pregnant and prematurely born. Seventy-five years ago it was not unusual for women to die during childbirth. This is the theme of "The Beginning of Life": a look at the "difficult cases" of a maternity hospital. Loretta Young plays a leading role, a woman who has brought her to this prison (what crime she has not done to give birth); he contradicts the fact that he must give the child after birth. He is in the congregation with many other women who share their joy and pain with each other. <br /> <br /> Although Loretta Young is in the lead, Glenda Farrell usually performs outstanding performance. Farrell was one of Warner's "B" women in the 1930s, showing quite a lot of support roles and sometimes B-film leadership (Farrell played Torchy Blane in several "Torchy" B-series). Farrell plays the expectant mother who doesn't want her children because they only get the way. He does everything he can to get to nurses, including smuggling to dinner (which is naturally forbidden during the days) and drinking like fish - they probably never heard of the fetal alcohol syndrome. Interestingly, unlike most of the film from the early 1930s, women are not worshiping idiots to get heroic men - this is the opposite of waiting dads shaking their capsules. (See that being an veteran actor Frank McHugh is one of the waiting fathers.) "Beginning of life", having spoken early, treats this issue with a fair melodrama slope, but it is a pretty charming little movie. Turner Classic shows it, though rarely; I've seen it just a few days after honoring Loretta Young. But it is highly recommended to check it when it appears.
