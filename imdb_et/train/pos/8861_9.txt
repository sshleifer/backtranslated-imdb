Andy says, "No one can hurt, everyone wins." Before he says this, we know the opposite is true: everyone gets in, nobody wins. This is a new strand of American films, or perhaps an old branch that was finally put back. Consider "Eastern Promises," "Blood," "For Old Men, Country". These movies are dark, serious, very well done and do not care about happy endings. I love them. "Before the devil knows you're dead", it fits the general description, but creates your entire atmosphere. Kelly Masterson's debut script is as close as a Hollywood film ever to a Greek tragedy. Sidney Lumet is extremely excited and a beautiful story of an outstanding, old-school character drama. Open shots, although an obese accountant who is a woman of her trophy is the look and feel of the Dutch masterpiece. In contrast, the drug dealer apartment looks more like a Mondrians. Great performances everywhere. Only Albert Finney's character Charles feels a bit overwhelmed, his eyes wide and his mouth agape almost all the time. But then he is in trouble deeper than any of us, most of whom ever knows. Marisa Tomei is very hot to get compensation. But of course you don't have to tell me. Why his character Gina would like to be a boy of Andy, we never said, but that's okay. After all, it's a character. The unique and magical touch of Carter Burwell's music makes it a good movie masterpiece. Don't miss it.
