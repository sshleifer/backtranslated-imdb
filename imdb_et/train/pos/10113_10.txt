I loved this movie. Being not a successful Ed Wood Jr fan, I prefer my "unlimited enthusiasm" and acknowledge his shortcomings. His movies are fun, but his personal story is painful. I was hoping and happily found that this film would rather be an understanding of his turbulent life, rather than just praise him posthumously. From the beginning, this film evolves from documentary to mythology, leaving the cast and the viewer unexpectedly with each other and with Ed Wood Jr. <br /> <br /> What we get is the people who knew Ed Wood was best talking about all his perspectives, positives and negatives, and showing us his character as much as Ed. We get an insight into Ed's personal and professional life: his romance, his drinking, his sexuality, his friends, his enemies, and even his cinema. <br /> <br /> The film itself has been photographed in a low-budget way that seems to have been made against Ed's respect, as if you were using the most famous film technique from 1996, if it were disrespectful (sort of more beautiful than a president) . The designer of the set uses a sense of humor and also has a great overview of the matching of each cast member with their background. <br /> <br /> Fans are delighted to hear personal testimonies of Ed Wood's contradictions and new enthusiasts are surprised that this man was real. It's impossible to find gems ("Lorado crossroads" and photo galleries) on the DVD, but the real treasure of this movie is a surprisingly interesting and interrelated story. <br /> <br /> Ed Wood had a habit of defining people who are related to him (better or worse), to a woman's past as a "pool owner" when he gave him and his friends baptism in his pool. This ability to define a human legacy comes through universally, because the film's most striking effect is not only to give a well-rounded idea of ​​who was Ed Wood Jr. but also to give a comprehensive overview of the community that he created. Somehow, without ever having more than one cast member interviewed on the screen at once, the link that Ed Wood created between different people in his life becomes clear and the viewer is largely involved. <br /> <br /> Even the title implies a B list horror genre, but in the end we can see that even this is kindness. What begins with the independent stories of random people ends with the conclusion that everything cast is forever threatened with an unpredictable fabric that brings history to the haunted unity of Wood's legend. <br /> <br /> In many ways, there is a contradiction between Ed Wood Jr. Such collaboration is the closest to the knowledge that we can ever get. Being side by side, it is instantly respectful, provocative, thoughtful, engaging, fun, sad, kind and satisfying.
