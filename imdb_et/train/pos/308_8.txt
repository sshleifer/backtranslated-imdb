First of all, it wasn't a three-hour movie - two hours, ten minutes ... last time I checked for ads that didn't really belong to the movie! Maybe it should have been two parters in total for about 3 hours? Yes, I would have been more, able to explore some more emotions. In general, Lucy's and Des's life was interesting to watch. I watch from time to time that I love Lucy and love it, but never read or seen the biography, never knew anything about her life on the screen. Because of this movie I'm doing now, but I'm not sure it's good. Everybody here really didn't know. It was essentially a movie that was not needed. But this has been done and the reason is that Lucy & Desi are still such big stars and some people in American society feel that the rest of society needs to know everything about our TV and movie stars. It's not so true and very, very sad. <br /> <br /> Anyway, what Lucy showed here is pretty good. Two complaints - an actor who played Viv Vance - wasn't a big cast at all. And the transition from Madeline to Zim to Rachel York ... proud, as Lucy had plastic surgery, and maybe she's a brand new person! It wasn't too big. But this story went on and focused on the stone relations between Lucy & Desi. No, the children were not shown very much and this was not necessarily a drawback of the film because, as I said, the focus was mainly on Lucy & Desi. If there had been more time, this story would have been for Lucy's life, maybe the kids were more. But they weren't so we saw very briefly Gable & Lombard, Red Skelton and Buster Keaton. Wow, this was one of the stories I thought it was very cool: his presence and influence in Lucy's life. Really clean and it is too bad, which was no longer studied. Oh well. Mostly, it was well studied. Honestly, I don't think I'll ever look at it again and I don't think this movie would be memorable. Someone who digs I love the bitch but is not a big Lucille ball fan, it should be an interesting time. My price: B
