Three flash-back introduces the main characters (Abu, Jaffar and Princess) who interact with Ahmad; Three are songs, each with the same characters. Three times Ahmad proclaims the absolute word "Time" when preaching love to the princess, answering her three questions in the first three meetings. It is so strong the impression that it causes the princess to resist three Jaffar's attempts to conquer her - with three consecutive ploys: fraud, hypnosis and memory deletion. Yet Jaffar has what he describes as a means of dominating three inevitable women: whip, power, and sword. Three are the number of flying units: a mechanical horse, a Genie and a Genie, and a magic carpet. Genie offers Abu three requests for three meetings; Three times Genie laughs in the mountains of the mountains out loud, and three are her considerations of human weakness before leaving. Abu crosses three obstacles in the Dawn Temple (armed guards, giant spider and giant octopus). Three are the instruments of justice: the magical eye that shows Abu's future, the magic carpet that carries him in time to save Ahmad and the princess, and the bow and arrow to fill Jaffar. The third is magic, and this film has magic.
