Like the "City", this musical seaside seamen will have a later classic temple and quality of songs, but it has its own charm. Kelly has three fabulous dance routines: one with Jerry's "Tom and Jerry" fame, one little girl, and a fantasy series where she is a Spanish lover who has decided to reach her wife's high balcony. Sinatra, who plays Kelly's shy, inexperienced friend, and Grayson, a woman who earns the love of both men, do most of the song. Iturbi offers some piano play. For almost two and a half hours, light music is a bit too long, but it doesn't drag.
