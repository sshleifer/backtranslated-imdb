I think this movie would be more enjoyable if everyone thought it was a colonial Africa image in the 50s and 60s, not a story. Because there is no real story here. Just one vignette on top of another, like small light points, which doesn't mean much until you have enough picture to paint. The first time I saw Chocolat, I didn't really get it "until I thought about it for a few days". Then I realized that there are many things to "get", including the end of colonialism, which was just around the corner, there is no plot. Anyway, this is one of my favorite movies of all time. The scene with a short shower and beautiful music was pure poetry. If you like an "exciting" movie, don't look at it - you'll have tears forever. But for some others ... you can thank me later for recommending it to you.
