With all the "adult" enthusiasts in contemporary family movies, it's nice to see where you don't have to worry about it and just sit back and enjoy a family with your children. Yes, this movie may have some swearing words (there is Swox swear, but they won't let you hear full words), but this movie is mostly as clean as they come (and it's also movies). Not only that, it's very enjoyable, one of my favorites, but just a great and fun movie to watch with your family. <br /> <br /> The only thing I have against this movie is that it is too short and I want there to be some memorable parts, I don't want to mention them because I don't want to be here something about a spoiler. <br /> <br /> Overall, nicely made and great movie to watch; so go and go kids, make some cookies and watch this movie!
