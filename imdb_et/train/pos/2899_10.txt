Very Intelligent Humor Excellent Performance I can't believe how people might think it deserves 1/10! I hope this movie will be shown everywhere so everyone can enjoy it. If you have the opportunity to look at it, look at it ... don't miss out on the main actors flying and singing "Happy Birthday" and "el payaso plinplin" (Argentine song for kids (I think it may be South America, I'm not sure)). These two songs with the same melody ... but people usually don't understand that ... it's just a latch! I tried to write it both in Spanish and English because it's an Argentine movie ... but the page doesn't allow me :( I hope you enjoy it!
