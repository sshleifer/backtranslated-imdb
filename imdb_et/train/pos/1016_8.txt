I would have given this second terrible series a total of 10 votes if Claudia Black hadn't continued! His involvement in foolish "Velaks" has brought a series in my assessment. It was a mistake to bring him at the same time as Ben Browder's involvement in RDA replacement. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we were just about Jack's disappearance, and in fact, this big series doesn't need to become new Farscape episodes. <br /> <br /> I was a big fan of "Stargate" and when the series was first announced, I had doubts that it could live up to the movie, but after watching the first episode I have to admit I was hooked. I have always been expecting new expectations with great expectation
