But, unfortunately, because of rights issues, it almost certainly does not happen. Joe Bob's commentary scripts about the sub-films he has reviewed are available on the Internet, but they don't hit a really crushed delivery that was a real hoop. Today, Joe Bob (real name: John Bloom) is confined to the classical extra features like "I'm talking about my tomb" (characterized by what some exploitation fans call the greatest force of rape all the time in the movie) and Jason X, one of the most reveeded Friday of all time 13 (the series was never the same when leaving Paramount). Everything I thought they had canceled was, "Damn, where else can I cut my head, blond jokes and the horror of horror every Saturday night? Does that mean I have to get life now?" Unfortunately, this is the case. But my horror hungry heart is always a place for "Monstervision". Long Live the Drive-In!
