I felt I needed to write a Space Cobra review because it got 7.3 stars, but only some of the comments made by me at that time were particularly positive. The weird situation and hopefully my positive review of people are referring to this old and mostly forgotten Anime movie. Spacecraft is a funky story of a smuggler and a traitor who participates with the three sisters and the evil forces of an ancient and dead planet who wants to use the power of the planets. This is an old movie and animation shows, but it is not a modern refinement, it is a lot of charm. Space Cobra is a highly targeted western audience and very easy to view. There is little to see and enjoy the references to a specific Japanese culture and excellent Anime beginners. Space Cobra itself is witty and pleasant. I can't tell you how much this is due to English or the creator's intention, but it is one of the few Japanese comedy characters that I find really funny. The style is very much the sixties Barbarellish with a fantastic Yello soundtrack. Style is colorful and imaginative and is a constant activity to move the story. The strangest aspect of this film is how it starts with comedy and ends with a very amazing dramatic note. I can't think of another Anime or general movie that has been able to do it so smoothly and convincingly. You hardly realize that this is happening, but it is done in such a subtle way and it seems completely natural. You really also know that the characters went on and they changed because of all the experience. Check if you can.
