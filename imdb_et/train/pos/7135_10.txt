It must be one of the most beautiful, moving, thought provoking films. It is a good family entertainment and at the same time makes you think about relevant issues. Every time I see "Zac's ghost that travels through the bicycle at the end, I can't help but shout out my eyes. John Thaw's performance is so moving and it's a shame that he's no longer with us. Great movie."
