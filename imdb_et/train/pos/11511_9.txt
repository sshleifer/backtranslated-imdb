Sometimes there are weak scripts? Yep! Sometimes the cheese has special effects? Yep! Tasty guilty pleasure of most of the time? Yep! More about Carl Kolchak and Darren McGavin? Yep! I always liked the science literature as a child, but I found so much Dracula / Frankenstein / Mommy / Horror things just as much. Abbott and Costello gave me a new perspective on classical universal monsters and Carl Kolchak won me the "dark side" of entertainment. The Duke was Rooster Cogburn, Eastwood had Dirty Harry, Garner had Maverick and Rockford, Selleck was Magnum and Darren McGavin was Carl Kolchak. All these weak scripts, cheesy special effects, supported by characters and actors and guest stars in the baroque group were Darren McGavin like Carl Kolchak. There was a risk, despite the fact that he was striving for the truth, and he was realistic when he had to accept the mandatory incompetence and possible overlap of government officials. Moreover, unlike 98% of us, Kolchak was ready to close his neck and do what he needed to do, even if it meant his death, the end of his journalistic career, or his prison time. Because of all his mistakes, including the lack of taste in clothes, Carl Kolchak was charming and wise, who drove a beautiful classic yellow Mustang (which was then an old used car) to save the day for humanity. As good as any other fictional hero, Carl Kolchak, was an eternal hero who brought one season to each week, thanks to Darren McGavin. Now that he has passed on and his show is on DVD, I hope he has such fun as watching me see how he plays Kolchak.
