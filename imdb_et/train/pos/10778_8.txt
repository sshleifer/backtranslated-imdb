Now, this exhibition looks like most other exhibitions of this type since the mid-90s, but the only thing is that it is different, they use a lot and perhaps a little drama in this comedy and action. I personally thought it was a good show, I don't understand why they would cancel it. It is good that the fan base of this exhibition is still alive since 1997. <br /> <br /> My hopes are that the World Bank will bring back an exhibition or even a movie, which I know is impossible to do, but hey, it's not hurt to dream, isn't it? <br /> <br /> Anyway, I would recommend if you didn't see it to find all 13 episode DVDs because the characters are great, the story is good, comedy is good and the whole performance is great.
