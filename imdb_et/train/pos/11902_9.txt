These films crown the life and times of William Castle. 1950 - 1960. In the years, he produced tricks with a low budget for selling tricks. "13 ghost" you need viewers to see ghosts (they were colored, the movie was b & w). "The Tingler" was theater seats equipped with a buzzer that jolted the audience as the monster escapes from the cinema. "Marabre" gave all members a life insurance policy when they were scared of death! The films themselves were pretty bad, but the tricks were people to see them. In this document, interviews with city-inspired directors, actors in his films and his daughter. It also goes into his home life and what he was (he was a great man on all accounts). The documentary is affectionate, very funny and completely riveting. It's very short (less than 90 minutes) and never a dull moment. Must See Castle For Fans And Fans Of Horror Movies. One of my complaints - very few sequences of his pictures. This aside is just great.
