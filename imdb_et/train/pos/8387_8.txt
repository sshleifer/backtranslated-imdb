The first half of the BRD trilogy has more passion and plot density than Lola, but less of Veronica Voss's magic. They have a political way of thinking: after the war, we see a lack of control of black marks as much as everyday life (a delicious moment when Fassbinder plays a player, trying to sell a complete set) to Kleist Schygull, who notes that burning books does not offer much heat: he really wants firewood). <br /> <br /> The first hour is clumsy. The style in Maria's room with a black soldier interrupted by Hermann's appearance should go faster. The train scene, when Maria meets Karl Oswald, falls when she insults the GI - I was hurt, it was so bad. But as the story evolves and the years go by, I increasingly pulled into this shiny and cold world.
