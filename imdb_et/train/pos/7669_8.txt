Doctor Mordrid is one of those rare films that is completely radar, but is completely worth it. This reminds me of the old series in the 30s and 40s. That's why I would have loved seeing movies ... but deciding whether all of the Full Moon production was out there was just not enough types to satisfy a typical audience. Unfortunately, thanks to a totally superfluous sacrifice place, the family has two too many, which is unfortunate because without em 'it could have been a Harry Potter-style magic that the kids would have eaten. Both Jeffrey Combs and Yvette Nipar are great - I wasn't sure if Mrs. Nipar had taken this film on the A-list, she was very credible. No, seriously! Anyway - it's a shame that they didn't have Dr Strange's license because I think it could have been a whole childhood phenomenon.
