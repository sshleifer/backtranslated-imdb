Monstervision was an exhibition that I grew up with. Late night hosting with Penn and Teller, the only one, Joe Bob Briggs. The exhibition keeps me back in my high school on Friday evening and gave me some of the best memories that came out of the car ride. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, the best late night television was ever. If you didn't get up, you were gone. <br /> <br /> I know John Bloom and Joe Bob live, but I want them back where they belong ... MONSTERVISION! Question ... Did anyone sit through the "The Swarm" for 4 hours? q :) <br /> <br /> Live in Monstervision!
