I'm glad someone has made a movie about how difficult it is to risk your heart for the second time. Or third. This movie is exactly what it promises to be - cute, fun and it gives you that good feeling in your heart when it ends. The plot may not be very inventive, but there are millions of ways to tell the story and have not yet been used. The cast is perfectly chosen, though Scott Wolf doesn't look like his father's eight-year-old father, even if he wears a suit. So sparks are in all the right places, support cast is lovingly supportive and though you could probably predict the whole movie you don't want to change the channel. It's just the right entertainment for Sunday night.
