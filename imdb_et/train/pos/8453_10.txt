I could write a big enough comment about any of the characters in Gundam Wing, they could control a series with their own internal conflicts. Instead, we get 8 big clues that lead us through 49 golden episodes of Anime bliss. <br /> <br /> It includes a dialog that you can spend a few months ... years on your head and then go back and get a new meaning from the script writing masterpiece (though it has a typical Anime tag where subtitles and English dub are differences). It has numerous concepts and philosophies that make you think about your views. <br /> <br /> The relationship between cold unknown men and loving female characters is an independent aspect of this series. It is a pleasure to look at the relationship between Heero and Relena and Milliardo and Noin. Man's obvious rejection is based on internal instability, which changes the love of the women (a word never mentioned in the series) in their harsh soldier environment. Women are robbing men of what we rarely see, if any, that makes leading men even more mysterious. Heero takes all 49 episodes to show some care, but he gets there, and if he does, it's a big reward. <br /> <br /> And then there is a giant robot in battle. Have fun watching fantastic sequences as good as any Hollywood epic struggle. The less stunned person would see the giant robot as a funny multifunctional child, as it turns out when I try to recommend this series to my friends, but they're wrong. Many of Gundam Wing's robot struggles include hefty sins, usually associated with young rebels who fight for what they believe against an oppressive society that makes their beliefs obsolete. Through every episode, Gundam Wing is boring, it is an exciting, thought-provoking study of human mind and body potential.
