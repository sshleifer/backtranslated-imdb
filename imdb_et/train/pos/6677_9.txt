A movie about wannabee, never and less than heroes, making it against all odds. Where have we heard it before? But if Shoveller, Blue Raja and Mr.Furious are unfortunate, you know that this is not your usual rags of wealth. executives and Geoffrey Rush as Arch Villain show real thinking cast. <br /> <br /> Even Greg Kinnear, at first glance, shows a terrible choice of captain's amazing role. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you are the stereotype of movies that have become a comic. Why couldn't anger be a superpower?
