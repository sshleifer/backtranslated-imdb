David Beckham is a British football star and Victoria Beckham's (Spice Girls' Posh Spice) spouse. His trademark is a goal that curves over the pitch and grid. Football equivalent of inconspicuous curve ball for baseball. "It's like Beckham" means this type of remarkable shot. Apart from that, and the tiny shrine in her main bedroom and the end of the faux-cameo, the film has nothing to do with her. <br /> <br /> The film is full of little soccer-jockeys, such as the fact that one of the characters' parents gives her number 9 (the great Mia Hamm, the ones you know), references to "Posh 'n' Becks ", For WUSA, one video tag is played by an incredible friend (" They * is * "), lesbian gags, sports bras and so on. <br /> <br /> The story is about a teenage girl in England who idolizes Beckham and wants to be a football star. She has a real gift, but the two seemingly insurmountable obstacles she has to overcome are the lack of a professional women's league in the UK (hence their charm with our WUSA) and her parents who are old fashioned immigrants in India. which does not allow the girls to interact with the sport. Girls' family is depicted as an indicator of ironic fun, but with great affection - think of My Big Fat Greek Wedding. The girl loves and respects them enough to go through the sitcom hell to hide their growing football game.
