I watched it for the first time in a long time - I had forgotten both the imagination of the picture and the movie. However, I did not forget the opening scenes that (with the Waterloo Bridge candlelight club scene) are among the most romantic films. <br /> <br /> Anyone interested in politics or history loves the recommended references to the movie. everyone who is interested in romance is moving by Hunter-Niven, and anyone who loves visual imagery will enjoy after the world. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie remains "Odd Man Out", which has been done almost at the same time - but it's great. <br /> <br />
