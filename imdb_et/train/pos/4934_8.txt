"Panic on the Streets" is a fairly unknown little film directed by Elia Kazan, and was made before his classic masterpieces such as "Streetcar Desire", "Waterfront" and "Eden East". Kazan won the Oscar already in 1947, before that movie, so he wasn't completely unknown at that time. Still "Panic on the Streets" is mostly a movie that went under the radar. <br /> <br /> The big thing about this movie is the Oscar winning script. It has a very good concept and a great tense thriller with elements of crime / film noir. This film's dialogue is also absolutely excellent and gives the film a sense of reality and credibility. <br /> <br /> Cast is quite unknown (especially at the time it was released), but it still has Zero Mostel and Jack Palance in one of his first film roles. Especially Palance is impressive as a harsh gangster with a very strong sight. <br /> <br /> Still, the movie is somewhat pulling at some points. The film starts very well, but after the beginning the film slows down and it doesn't always make the right decisions at the pace and point of view. <br /> <br /> "Panic in the Streets" is still a fully observable movie, mainly due to its strong scripts and powerful dialogue that makes the movie credible. For fans of thriller genre, this is a great movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 8/10
