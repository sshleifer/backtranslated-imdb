I went to see Antone Fisher wondering what to expect and what was most pleasantly surprised. Derek Luke was outstanding and the story was great. Of course, Denzel Washington did his usual good work in management and management. It makes you realize that people with mental problems can be helped and this film is the perfect example. Don't miss it.
