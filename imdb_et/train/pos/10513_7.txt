If you have any idea about Jane Austen's production, now that she repeats the same in her novels: marriage, marriage and marriage! In my opinion, all the films made of his novels are a bit boring, but I like Austen's characters because they all have a certain personality and typical speeches they want to repeat, as does Emma. The thing that makes Emma is Gwyneth Paltrow, she's very good in her lead. Also, the fact that the characters in each movie do not seem to be able to think, but how to get a good partner and soon get married makes the movie fun.
