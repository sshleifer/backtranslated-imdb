My mother took me to watch this movie as a child and I see it every year when I make all my other Christmas favorites. What I mostly remember was the silly Devil and Santa who watched my telescope. Waiting and looking through T.V. guide every year after seeing when it will be shown. I usually find it on Saturday afternoon. I found the movie only in English, which took a special look at the movie and has longed to find it in Spanish. I keep this movie on my heart and never suffered from nightmares, as others suggested. Yes, this is a different movie from Santa Claus and it makes it special and unique. I can't wait to get a copy of this movie and watch it with my kids when I explain to them my favorite songs and memories!
