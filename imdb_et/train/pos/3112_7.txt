I looked at both the Bourne identity and the Bourne Supremacy DVD before I saw it in the theater. I had waited for it before they started filming. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Small spoilers below- <br /> <br /> Overall, it was good, but also lacking the first two consistency. Identity and supremacy both flowed to the rapid action of adrenaline in the introspective drama. This film occasionally felt at times. The construction time of the plot was slightly overstretched. This caused the following actions that felt too crazy. <br /> <br /> Camera: Talking about the frenetic trademark Greengrass shaky cam. I know it has been spoken / faded for nausea on the bulletin board, but that does not mean it is not appropriate. All martial arts training that participants passed through was completely wasted. The ridiculous camera trimming and wiggling camera destroyed most of the film's struggle. It's a cheap, student director's trick to make the film look calm. I expect these methods to be used in some of the horror attacks that have been made on high school children, but not in this stylish series of adult activities. Too many extreme close-ups. Have some frames. Get some interesting pictures. A constant lover feels like a lazy routing to me. <br /> <br /> Story: The story was very confusing at first. They draw a new name and face from you. I gave you the feeling that you get when you come to the movie late and you know you missed some important data. Felt hurried or pushed for time. After you catch up, this story is pretty good. It's fun to follow with Bourne. HOW TO DO NOT take care that the last scene of supremacy (Landy / Bourne phone) is in the midst of an ultimatum. In principle, it makes the film a semi-printer. I thought it was uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> Cast / Characters: A movie star is an action. Obviously, there are only two originals. Bourne and Nicky Parsons. They were strange to me. I think they just wanted to give someone to Bourne who would protect and trust. When I leave nothing, they never say why they're together. The other assassins in the movie were pretty quiet. It looked like Gilroy / Greengrass / who wants not to leave open ends. Understandable, but disappointing. Seriously, Damon with Clive Owen in Identity and Marton Csokas takes precedence. These scenes were phenomenal. These assassins are as interesting as Castel (the first Bourne fight in Identity). In general, the cast series has worsened as the series continues. Clive Owen was practically an afterthought. It is a measure of strength for this first pain. Secondly, they trade basically with Chris Cooper for Joan Allen. It trades Brian Cox and Franka Potente to three participants, who are later called. Nothing is against David Strathairn, Scott Glen or Albert Finney, but they are not memorable for such series. After a couple of breaks that seemed long, the actor was right. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was a success. It seemed like they wanted to get over the series. If they had cut down or rearranged slower parts, Scott Glenn's part was completely eliminated, extended and taken away from the victim's seizure, it would have been perfect. <br /> <br /> TERMINATION OF SPOILER <br /> <br /> I don't see why they finally leave Bourne in life. It was my understanding that it was a conclusion. They clearly referred to the beginning of the series when his silhouette floated motionless. I thought it was going to be. Full circle end type. I liked Nicky, who responded to the news report. <br /> <br /> SPOILER SPECIFICATION WARNING - QUOTE MOVIE BASED - <br /> <br /> Bourne's Last Line at the End "Look at it. Look what they're giving you." citing the first assassin, he loved that. The last scene was great. (Except that it was Vosen's {Strathairn} who shot at Bourne. Why should he do that? Just revenge? If he were enough angry to murder, why not shoot Pamela Landy after he secreted his fax file sent? is logical.)
