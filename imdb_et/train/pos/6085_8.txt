Critics are stupid. This movie is funny and smart. I loved this movie a lot. Why all hate this movie so much. I want people to love this movie more than they do. Ben Stiller and Jack Black are real comedians and they did a lot of work to make this movie. I don't see you in making movies there. So people should just look at it and not comment on it. I like this movie. It's all over. There are parts where it is stupid, but at least they did it. Jerry Stiller would love it because this film works like the King Of Queens. But that's better. I can't believe it was so low.
