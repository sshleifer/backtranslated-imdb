I saw this movie for the first time several years ago - and it was put together for a moment. This is great and much better than J.F. K. because you always have to think, "Can that happen to me?" Can I become a murderer? You can't turn the TV or VCR back if you don't think about the plot and the end you shouldn't leave.
