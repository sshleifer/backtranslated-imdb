One of the more enjoyable aspects of Asian cinema (or indeed most of what has been done outside of the United States) is permutations that grow up. After the Second World War, for example, the Japanese manga (comics) must find a variety of real infinite subjects, many of which are uniquely engaged in imagination. The same goes for making genre films; again, I refer to films made outside U. $. (where we are just "complicated" in our close sense to understand something the US is not). For example, an American company would not return any film with a hidden professional wrestler (El Santo) or werewolf (Paul Naschy) or a real martial artist (Bruce Lee) ...? As for television: forget about it. Although I still love the KUNG FU series that played David Carradine later, I have always felt that the American version of the martial arts in Asia was how to kindly put it. To date, there have been no paid channels to play Asian military artists in Asia. (For entertainment shows, there is a lot of soft core porn, but the Action Channel has yet to be imported or produced by True Martial Arts teleseries.) Before Brother Cadf was murdered in the BBC, at least one of all things was a Kung Fu movie that included a group of martial artists. who were more or less involved with the mystery of murder: THE 5 DEADLY VENOMS. This martial arts masterpiece is in itself as exciting as any other genre-based whodun (Western, police, etc.), which is a really good job. It is now available from Dragon Dynasty and the print is beautiful, and Bey Logan's DVD commentary is just such an intelligent, thoughtful analysis that these gems deserve. If you are a fan of the martial arts movie, rejoice: one of the greatest genres of film ever since (especially the 1970s and early 1980s martial arts) will be on the DVD for a long time (and a very welcome second look).
