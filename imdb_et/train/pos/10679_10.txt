A man on a house is a real comedy in every sense. Comedy is a sign called Robin Tripp (played by big Richard O 'Sullivan) who finds himself after a natural party, reaching two women named Jo and Chrissy. Ironically, the party had to say goodbye to his old companion. Obviously, it comes as it moves. <br /> <br /> For man's house, Cooke and Mortimer spin off-show George and Mildred, showing 2 who were Jo, Chrissy and Robin. These two characters would actually be a human pattern with Mildred (late and missed Joothce), getting the best lines in the series. The semi-regular character was Larry (Doug Fisher) a useless person who was always on his knees and only ever came around when he wanted to borrow (and never send it back). <br /> <br /> A version of an American maker called three companies, but it's not an option compared to the far more fun original. Thames threatened to compose a comedy with about 2 women in an apartment at a very conservative time, but they should worry, as their estimates show that about 20 million people just want to look at the old-fashioned comedy-inspired casting and sharp script. The unfortunate modern comedy cannot achieve this high level. <br /> <br /> This program is available on a network DVD
