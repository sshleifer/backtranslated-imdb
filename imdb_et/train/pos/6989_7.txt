This movie was in the very early episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000, but when I see this movie, I don't think about this wonderful TV series. I believe it was a surprisingly good early 40s horror shot, with a very amazing sound and picture with a 67-year-old public horror movie. I really liked Bela Lugos and his bizarre staff, including his wife, who needs fluid from young young brides, an old action and his two strange shops, one giant idiot, another comic dwarf (Angelo Rossitto since the 1932 Freaks). I also liked a happy young female reporter who is a kind of stereotype but still fun to watch. My only problem with this otherwise decent film is the plot, even ridiculous and incredible for the film. I don't want to spoil this movie, so go out and rent it, or better, buy it for a few bucks.
