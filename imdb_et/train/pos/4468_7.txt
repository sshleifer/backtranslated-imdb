Two sailors on vacation - ladies man Joseph Brady (Gene Kelly) and shy innocent Clarence Doolittle (Frank Sinatra). They meet beautiful Susan Abbott (Kathryn Grayson) and both love her. There's more, but you've probably guessed it. <br /> <br /> The story (even for the music of the 1940s) is ridiculous and everything is so nice and healthy - it gets quite annoying quickly. This movie is also too long. It's 140 minutes and it's so stupid about too much. Jose Iturb and his orchestra are also some boring numbers. Nevertheless, it is worth to catch. <br /> <br /> When Kelly dances or Sinatra or Grayson sings, it becomes magical. No song is particularly memorable, but Sinatra was such a beautiful voice you didn't care for. It is a hit at the rich Technicolor, with all the glossy MGM. The actress is OK - Kelly is good (although she is seen as a female man) and Sinatra is just great (although she sees her as a shy guy, she also rejected it!). Grayson is not allowed to do anything, but he is very nice to look at. Some pictures of her literally took my breath away! Here's a lot of attention: Sinatra and Kelly's great dance and song number; Sinatra sings something; Grayson's Two Songs and the Well-Known Animated Sequence where Kelly Dances with Jerry - Animated Mouse! Tom also makes a funny head. There's also a little Dean Stockwell who steals every scene. It was a big hit this day.
