The opportunity between the seller and the hit person meets his life. This is a strange film that works, an impressive effort for the writer-director Shepard. Brosnan is surprisingly effective as a lonely hit man who is going to put his work under stress, but he cannot emotionally connect anyone to help him. Kinnear is as good as a salesman, a person who is insignificant in his life. Davis is fine because Kinnear is a flirtatious woman. In principle, the film is a characteristic research, because it seems fresh and unpredictable, extremely dark comedy.
