William Castle is known for fear fans as the 1950s and 60s' B-class leader. Her tricks, cost-cutting methods and unique vision are legendary. So it is no surprise that someone (Jeffrey Schwarz, who has made countless documentaries) eventually takes the time to devote a documentary to his glory. This is "Spine Tingler: William Castle Story". <br /> <br /> I had a general understanding of who the castle was, having seen some of his films over the years. I knew nothing about my personal life, his goals and ambitions. This film was really a perfect man and gave me a better appreciation of the commitment he had made to the craft of filmmaking and his contribution to the horror film. The film depicts Castle as a rival to Alfred Hitchcock, where Hitch is an artist who wins praise, while Castle is a carnival that gets the fame of culture, but much less respect. He is an icon for all second-tier managers, so it's no surprise that John Waters has been highlighted here. (Joe Dante and Stuart Gordon also have great roles.) <br /> <br /> His tricks were what helped his fame, and the documentary takes great effort to explain them, which is crucial for those who are too young to remember . "13 spirit" rudimentary 3-D (see separate review), "The Tingler" (see separate review) on-site buzzer, "Returns" collateral guarantees ... watching these movies now outside the theater, we can rate them in their content (which personally enjoys ), but we cannot fully understand which audiences ever felt. <br /> <br /> The culmination of the movie is when Castle goes from a cult leader to a Hollywood producer. Having purchased the rights to Rosemary's Baby, she is placed in a very special place to negotiate the release of her film. Hoping to be in charge, he will be left aside to become a new director, Roman Polanski. Although it is disappointed first, it turns out to be one of the best ways of life - a very successful film and work that it stands out. Who better to control the wallet of a natural artist Polanski as a pennant? It was supposed to be his crowning achievement, although unfortunately, this film is more often associated with Polanski than a castle. <br /> <br /> The rest of his years will be played out and his daughter and niece will give us personal thoughts. Everyone seems to have nothing but praise. Somewhere along the way, he definitely bothered one or two people, but you never know about this movie. And I find it to be - it's Bill Castle's life celebration, not "E! True Hollywood Story". Genre fans would make a copy of this work. <br /> <br /> I'd like to personally recommend a collection of William Castle that has not only this but eight castle films. peculiarities. Even this documentary is equipped with an audio commentary, so you can hear how the fortress personally influenced Schwarz, and let the daughter Terry give her experience of different films and transformations. This is an almost new film.
