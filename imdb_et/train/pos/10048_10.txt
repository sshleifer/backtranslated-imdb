Each time the conversation turns to a "favorite movie". I mention Titanic and at least a few people are hitting. I don't pay anything for them because I know that five years ago, the same people were tearing up with this very movie. And now they are too embarrassed to admit it. <br /> <br /> I was just Titanic for the first time in a long time. Waiting just to read the story again, I was surprised that the film hadn't lost its power in those five years. I called again ... in all the same places. It brought me back to 1997 when I remember how a movie that no one thought would even become a popular movie all the time. A film that penetrated the public consciousness like no other movie I remember (yes, even more than Star Wars). And today, many people don't even feel they enjoyed it. People, let's have something straight - you don't see this movie frowning. You look like cynical. <br /> <br /> No movie is perfect and has some bugs. Some of the dialogue falls flat and some two lovers of the surrounding plot are a little too properly. But none of this is so annoying that it destroys the film. <br /> <br /> Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful. Leo is one of the generation's finest actors. Wait for you to see him in the New York gangs before you call him more than a beautiful boy. Kate Winslet was so strong in this film. The film was really her, and she kept it beautifully together. <br /> <br /> James Cameron was able to do what many believed to be impossible with the creation of a completely credible Titanic. Swimming scenes were terrible, just as they were that night. How can anyone say that the consequences were bad is over me. I was completely relocated. <br /> <br /> This movie is one memorable scene after another. Titanic leaves the port of Southampton. Rose and Jack at the fly "flying". "Iceberg, right ahead!" The screws hang out incredibly out of the ocean. The condemned was condemned after he went down. And the end that even brought tears to the thinnest man in the theater. The result of James Horner was just perfect. And the theme of love was beautiful and tragic. Too bad Celine Dion's pop music version had to destroy this great music for so many. <br /> <br /> I admit I am a Titanic buff. As such, I was delighted to see the ship when we never saw it - all its beautiful. Maybe I'll see that this sinking affected me more than a few, because I have a lifetime for a ship. But I doubt many of the people I saw were Titanic buffs. I commend Cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that has never reduced the tragedy. The film was made with this kind of humanity. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer said it was better than ever: open your hearts to Titanic and you won't be disappointed.
