This exhibition is funny fun! jokes are original, God and I love Eric and Kelso! Yes, I know what they say, after the 8th season it's no longer funny because Eric and Kelso are no longer in the show and Randy is a real dumbass. Randy is compared to Eric and Kelso. <br /> <br /> You can't take the most funny characters and turn off the "I'm cool guy" guy (Randy). it's not his fault anyway, but the writers are trying to keep the 8th season funny, it's still, not as much as the earlier seasons, but it's right. <br /> <br /> The 360s are fantastic, ring, red is the true father of mental abuse :) and kitty is always half high. Hyde is always trying to be cool, he has his moments. least favrioutes are Jackie and Donna. they are cool but not without Kelso and Eric. <br /> <br /> Great show. Buggy!
