I found this movie really funny because you have a youthful black comedian (Chris Rock) who dies and is sent back to the body of a white man in the mid-50s. He does not understand that his behavior should change and continue to act as he used to be. He listens to rap music, sings together and plays the stereotypical part of the black man from the city. The real humor of this film was looking at the trouble that this behavior connects him to black.
