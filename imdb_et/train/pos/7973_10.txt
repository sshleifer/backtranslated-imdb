Maybe I'm fruity, but that's the cutest movie! I saw it for the first time when I was about 4 or 5 years old, and I shouted out. From then until now (embarrassing at the age of 15) I have seen it more than 25 times and I have been bothering each one of them. Don't worry that they are tears of happiness! And that's not all! There's also a lot of humor and comedy in it. Usually, the whole thing that can be said about it can be a huge drag, but this movie is not the case. My only advice: Even if you love it - don't see consistent ... thinness! I recommend that everyone checks it ... you are no harm, no matter how old or young you are!
