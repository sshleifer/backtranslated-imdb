I really liked this movie and went back twice more this week. <br /> <br /> ms. Detmers created a play - he was like a hungry cat who played with his prey. She lashes out of rage and lust, taking a "too young" mistress and crashes on the floor hundreds of fine Chinese of her terrorist fianc√©e. <br /> <br /> The film was full of beautiful touches. Maserati, wonderful wardrobe, flower boxes on roofs. I especially liked the ancient Greek class and "Antigone" presentation. <br /> <br /> It was a feeling of "O-story" - that is, people who are benefiting will get an unacceptable sexual adventure. When he walks around the fantastic apartment surrounding him, he is happy - and why not, what is the limit to the "devil muscle"? <br /> <br /> The whole movie is a real dinner!
