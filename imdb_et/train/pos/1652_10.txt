This series got me to Deighton's writing and genre when I was younger and I love that story. However, I do not agree with the remark above. Reading the past is not that Holm has come to Deighton's refusal to release the series, but that all three books have been translated to the screen. A good example of this is the rewriting of Samson's completed border crossing point. The scene is not in this book, where a man who died in a mine field was never in any book, and the crossing in Sinker was from East Germany to West Germany, not to the Polish border. This whole story is cloth. The changes made in the set also damage the integrity of the story. From my point of view of Holm's presentation, he depicted Samson's disorientation at the time of his wife's attack, and I believe that he brought himself well into depicting an aging field worker who was desperately trying to break the class partition. Samson pays for his father for idealism and suffers from his influence on his life. As Clevemore commented, he would have received training in education if he had learned it himself. I think the actual loss of performance comes from physical appearance more than anything. Holm is a small, physically impressive man who can use his size to establish presence, compared to Samson.
