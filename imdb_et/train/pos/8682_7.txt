I'm sorry to say I disagree with other Columbo episode people. Death Lends Hand is frankly dull to Columbo. A few times I missed and changed the channel. I still love Robert Culpi and Patricia Crowley and Ray Milland in their role, but this story was weaker in this episode than in others. First of all, Robert Culp plays Ray Milland's character researcher. She hires her to explore her young beautiful woman, played by Patricia Crowley, to see if she has a thing. In return, Culp's character is cheating on a spouse who plans to expose her husband who has destroyed her career. Because of anger, Culp kills her, hitting her face and putting her body elsewhere. I do not know. Maybe I just don't care about it at all. Of course, Columbo gets it finally. It's just a question of how.
