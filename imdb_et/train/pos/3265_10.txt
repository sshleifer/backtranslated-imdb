I've always been a big fan of Cybill Shepperd because I saw her series a few years ago !! This movie definitely shows her best light !! The film was so wonderfully cast and played! Every time and again he drops little fun to make this movie one of the best I've ever seen! Everyone really does it for themselves! Especially Robert Downey Jr and Cybill Shepperd really made a movie! I also loved it a little where Mavis loses a wig and he almost dies when he falls on the floor! This is the film at its best!
