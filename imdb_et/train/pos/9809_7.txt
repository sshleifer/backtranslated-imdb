Randolph Scott goes to Albuquerque to work for his uncle. However, there is a way that the stage is closed - although they do not carry a stand. But a nice lady on board hides her and her brother's business for $ 10,000 ... and robbers seem to know it. <br /> <br /> If it is in town, Scott will go to Seto. However, he soon learns that this uncle is a jerk - a typical bad boy from the West. You know, a rich boy who wants to get richer when he deceives and steals and threatens until he has everything. And so it just happens that this jerk was behind the robbery. Scott insists that his uncle returns the money and then Scott enters the business with a nice lady and his brother. <br /> <br /> It's no surprise that it's not the end of the problems - it's just the beginning. Again and again, the Seto opposition is trying to break the intrigues of different types. One trick is to bring a beautiful lady to win Scott and her partners. He is crack-cracked and it looks bad for Scott until he thinks he has come to town. <br /> <br /> Unlike most of the later Randolph Scott movies, this shows Scott a bit more solid. Too often, in his films, the latter is desirable for violence, but in this film he wants to quickly say lynching (defeat the law, let it down on his own), and then quickly threaten his uncle. What a surprise he should have seen so hot - though in most other ways, he's the same old Scott you expect. <br /> <br /> There's nothing unusual about this movie. that. Gabby Hayes plays a normal character, Scott is a hero, mischief cannot be justified and eventually destroyed and Scott gets a girl. Despite this very typical plot, it's all very well processed and its result is worth your time. By the way, the movie has two strange scenes. First of all, the movie's late fight is between Scott and Uncle # 1, Lon Chaney, Jr. In this, Chaney mixes when she struggles - something I never saw before and I admire how she can when she got her ass. Second, get a load from this runaway cart with whip - now that was one of the impossible feat!
