I could watch this movie as a whole and moved it deeply. I wasn't sure if it was really comedy or drama - it had both elements. Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper both looked great - the image of our 60-year-old women has definitely changed from Aunt Bee! They are lively, beautiful, sexy! The only drawback of this film was that in the 1970s, MTM and Rhoda did not show any other signs at the shows. I would have thought that since it was in New York (where "Rhoda" was appointed), at least his reputation for Brenda would have been mentioned or Julie Kavner would have appeared, assuming she was still in Big Apple. <br /> <br /> This is my hope that ABC will do this in a series and bring back guest performances to all of the old casts of these exhibitions. By the way, what was wrong when CBS did this meeting, or a possible series? Wasn't the network "MTM" and "Rhoda" showing?
