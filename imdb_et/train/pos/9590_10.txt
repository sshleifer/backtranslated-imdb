The documentary begins in 1986 at NYC, where black and Spaniards drag "balls". Then they dress up, but they want their things to be presented to the audience and vote. We know many members and see how they all stand together and support each other. As one person says to another - "You have three strokes against you - you are a black, gay and comforting queen". These are people who (unfortunately) are not accepted in society - only in balls. There they can be whoever and whatever they want and are accepted. Then the movie will be cut three years later (1989) and you will see how things have changed (tragically for some). <br /> <br /> Sounds frustrating, but it's not. Most of the people surveyed are really funny and get a lot of humor about their situation. They are well aware of their position in society and accept this humor - just as they should. We know that they all live in "homes" run by different "mothers" and all of them help each other. The feeling of community in this movie is exciting. <br /> <br /> When this movie came out in 1990, it was controversial - and a big hit. It won the best documentary awards at several festivals - but it was never mentioned in the Academy Award. The reason for this was "Black and Spaniards" is not the material of the Academy. "It's not fascinating? The NY show that they no longer exist, but the balls are still there, but not in the spirit we see here, as well as being "more accepted" (better or worse) in society, and I've heard that the houses are gone too. I would like to know where these characters are now - I know two died of AIDS, but I have no idea about others and what did DID do with its 13-year-old and 15-year-olds, however, this unique documentary is exciting, funny and riveting You have to see the whole way!
