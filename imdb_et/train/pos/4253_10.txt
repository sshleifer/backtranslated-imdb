really great movie, one of the best i saw. Anesthetic and simple - like life, sometimes the cries sometimes laugh and it's just beautiful. not too much, just as it should be. Really loved the idea of ​​the movie, nobody is bad or good, everyone or just people, sometimes errors mostly due to the pressure of society, everyone is trying to stay strong and some are more successful than others, and most importantly, you don't do it is a reason to anger - you You can do it, but eventually the anger goes away and then you have to let the love come back, though it's hard, there is real happiness. <br /> <br /> Great actors and cast, the movie can really make a movie feel. <br /> <br /> Nice nice one. <br /> <br /> I suggest you see it, especially if you want to see the lives of Italians. .
