First of all, let me say that the director has excellent titles for his creative shots. I really enjoyed them. I really enjoyed this movie, but I could say with Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinear is rather weak. Brosnan melts this character so well that it is really hard to remember that it is the same guy who played the bond. It also shows his scope and depth as an actor. This is a sure indie flick and it was really nice to see all the mainstream movies that flooded the movies at this time. I found the characters well designed. The twisting in the middle was particularly good. I also liked how the characters come realistically. So many times we have the cartoons of people who are not really characters, but walking stereotypes ... I like the different movies that this film takes. I think this movie is sideways, but I think it's a more observable and better movie in general ...
