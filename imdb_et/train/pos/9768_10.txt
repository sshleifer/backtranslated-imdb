This is the best movie ever created. His master, who brought my eyes to tears. I will never forget my experience in viewing it. I do not understand why people do not believe as I do. The dinosaur changes in a performance reminiscent of De Nirot Raging Bull, Pacinos Scarface and Crowe Gladiator. It should be published on a DVD in Superbit format so I can enjoy it as it was meant to enjoy and film. Whoppi Goldberg pulls a genuinely lifetime appearance as a harsh, harsh policeman who is against him when his partner is a hot dinosaur. By the way, I say that what is true is the opposite.
