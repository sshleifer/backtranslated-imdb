I was always a big fan of this movie, first of all you have seen it, the actor is great and helps to make this movie go well. Cybill Shepherd got great comments about her role and they were well deserved. The beginning of this film begins in the past when Corinne Jeffries (Cybill) whose picture-perfect marriage breaks down when his wife Louie dies suddenly. Fortunately, Louse can hit another life by agreeing to "reuse" the earth as a newborn Alex Finch (Robert Downey, JR). Alex continues his new life, forgetting his past life, while Corinne is trying to go with him. But the fate goes beyond Alex's way 23 years later when he meets Corinne's daughter Miranda (Mary Stuart Masterson) and is suddenly flooded with rich unwanted memories (this is where the fun begins and the embarrassing situation begins.) The music is great and the scenes are heart feel and very cute. You don't have to be disappointed if you give him the opportunity, whether you like it. Very funny and cute!
