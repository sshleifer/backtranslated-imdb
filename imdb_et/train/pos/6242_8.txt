I agree with the previous comment to call the content of the film a "daily madness", but I would like to point out that "Dog Days" means how women (men) are treated in society. The episodes shown here show that there are some differences in the daily discrimination of women, which are mostly categorized by age groups. There's an older man who makes his new partner look and behave the way his late husband was, treating him like a doll that is wearing a former dress. There is a middle-aged couple in whose relationship he is almost a slave and he is a violent captain. Next, we find a somewhat younger man who does not communicate with his friend / husband and instead of really jealous of his affairs, even makes friendship with his competitor (s). A young adult man explains to his friend - a girl he really suffers from, that he must be next to him and adhere to his narrow rules on the label. Finally, at the end of the fifties, a man who calculates his advantage by giving a fierce client a simple-minded woman who - taking his guilt at scratching his car - hits him naturally. To complete the examples, we find a man's "master-slave" - ​​after collective abuse - threatening and humiliating himself "for him" because he is freed from his partner and takes himself as a new "master". During this time, the neighbors of the neighborhood, where the action is taking place, have recently been built under the burning summer sun - absolutely immobile (sic!). Unfortunately, I have not seen this shocking and authentic image of archaic structures that still dominate the relationship between women and men, but what I have seen convincingly in the repertoire of discrimination. Probably a useful tool for teaching even a less sensitive viewer that goes wrong - because of good visualization.
