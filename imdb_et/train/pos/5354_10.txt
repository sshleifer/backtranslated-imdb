Why Wasn't Dynamo Pants?! Where did they go ?? It was never explained. That's why this movie was so awesome. Plus Starsky gave her children AIDS !!!! Great operation. Richard Dawson deserves the best supporting actor! A I D S My favorite line of the film was "It hit the spot" A I D S. This movie was for "birds". I tried to give this film "stinkeye" but it continued. What am I doing wrong ??? !!!! I thought "HATEBOAT" was funnnny lol;) I would like to show it. Why didn't Dynamo wear pants. I know his hand was skewed, but ... What about these crazy futures. Why didn't this family make Ray Combs get net? He could have used it. AIDSSSSS
