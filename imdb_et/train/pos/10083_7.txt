The fact that this movie was put on a DVD that was still formatted with a TV and a fuzzy picture irritated a lot of the movie sails ...... and rightly so. It deserves much better treatment. <br /> <br /> The story speaks of a street player who needs a son to carry his craft (rules of the day), and instead winds up with a little girl (not the usual way) and the following problems. The old man bought a boy at a slave auction and soon discovered that the boy was not the boy he probably thought was. <br /> <br /> The old man "Bianlian Wang (Xu Zhu) is such a funny look that has a lack of anterior tooth and an infectious stack. The little girl" Doggie "(Zhou Renying) is a cutie, the rest of the story is how do these two lead after that, a little past 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> All in all, this story includes drama, temporary, humor, and sadness - just don't wait for a high quality picture of the money you spend on a DVD until it appears on the widescreen , rent it.
