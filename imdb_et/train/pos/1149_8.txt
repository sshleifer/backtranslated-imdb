Fast paced and funny satire about this original "reality TV", soap opera. Writer Writer Robert Harling is packed with one lining and a ridiculous situation. The best of them is the climax, a live broadcast that quickly worsens for poor healing and brain transplantation. Keven Kline murdering his lines because he didn't wear his glasses is fun. "His brain examines laterally in the next couple of houses." Brilliant cast is on the same page as Kline. Sally Field, Elizabeth Shue, Cathy Moriarty, Robert Downey Jr, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher, Garry Marshall and Kathy Najimy are all perfect. It's a hell to see this movie like a click. This is a classic that has somehow split through the cracks. <br /> <br /> P.S. Alan Silvester's score is an extra bonus. It is suitable for a soap opera with thin and melodramatic air.
