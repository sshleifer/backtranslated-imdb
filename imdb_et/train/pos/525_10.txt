Immediately after the end of World War II, Powell & Pressburger was asked to come up with something to improve the gap between the UK and the US. At that time, there were a lot of remarks about "Overprotection, Overdue, and Here". Somehow, they came to this masterpiece. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie of all time. That is all. Romance, poetry, emotion, religion, drama and very peculiar. <br /> <br /> I can never explain exactly why, but it hits all the better buttons, and although I have seen it hundreds of times (yes, really) I am still at many points behind the tears. <br /> <br /> Was it a great actor, a great set, an inspired script? Who knows. But * Don't look at it and see what I mean.
