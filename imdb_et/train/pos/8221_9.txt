The sudden effect is the fourth dirty Harry movie and one of the best features of these films is that they don't reduce quality from one movie to another. So Sudden Impact gives another excitement to the life of Dirty Harry Callahan. This time Harry tries to solve some murders while on holiday. Harry is always on the job. Clint Eastwood plays Harry when he plays all his actions, slow, deliberate and fearful. Since the first Dirty Harry movie to be made in the 80's, Sudden Impact does not have the 70s that characterize the first three films. This does not mean that its quality is less. Bottom Line: Adapting to intensity and action is another dramatic impact on the Dirty Harry series.
