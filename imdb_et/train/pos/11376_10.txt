It must be one of the best movies about the serial numbers I've ever seen, and it comes from someone who loved the silence of lambs completely. HBO has hit the jackpot. This movie is convincing from the first moment to the last moment. <br /> <br /> This movie has so many topics that are hard to say exactly. It crowns a decade-long search for Russian seraphic killer Andrea Chikatilo. Stephen Rea provides an exceptionally well-respected result as an inexperienced forensic expert responsible for the investigation, and Donald Sutherland gives even more prominence to his cynical superior and the only person willing to help him in the Russian government. Both performances are fine masterpieces --- The line starts naive and does not want compromises, while Sutherland starts to get rid of the situation and almost entertain. After all, Rea becomes more tired and beaten by the system, while Sutherland finds himself passionate and idealistic. In every other film, I would have said that Sutherland's performance seems to be the rest, but here even Jeffrey DuMann, as a serial breaker, rivals. DuMann perfectly creates this character that inspires empathy rather than hatred, which we think we find --- he is a monster, but he does not want to be and we get the idea that he is the same nasty he does as we are. He is tortured, ashamed, but also cruel. <br /> <br /> If you can take a very dark subject (and it is * very * disruptive), you should see this movie.
