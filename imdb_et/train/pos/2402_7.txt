The main reason for this movie is Warren William, who is a top-shyster campaign manager. He is electric, constantly looking for ways to fool the public and defeat the opposing party in the midst of major disasters. William is a great actor - I feel like he never got him. Bette Davis as her girlfriend also appears in the subtitle role. Personally, I found that Guy Kibbee is not quite right as a flat-braided candidate who William and others are trying to publicize. He looked like a blank canvas rather than a human. I would have preferred to see the real character, not the non-character. The story itself is unlikely, silly and clich√©s. But Warren William and Bette Davis are worth seeing.
