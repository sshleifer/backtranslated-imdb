Hi .. I think it's just one of my favorite Sean Connery movies, this is a tight psychological thriller with great exhibitions, especially Connery has one of the best features I've seen in movies, so the dialogue is pretty good at it . It's also one of the best scenes movies ever when Sean's interview with Ed Harris's character in prison is just awesome .. I enjoyed it a lot and I can't recommend it, really don't miss it! Don't pay attention to the negative reviews that show that the last 30 minutes are sucking, it was as intense as the rest of the movie, I really find Just Cause's very entertaining movie.
