The black woman is fantastic in all aspects. It's scary, embarrassing and so realistic that you actually see it in real life. I saw it for the first time on television in 1989 and all the lights are off and the volume was probably the most horrible experience of my life. I managed to get a copy, and now I definitely bring it out for every Halloween and show it too to unsuspecting family members who have no idea what they are and all I can do is laugh. As for the film: <br /> <br /> It starts with a young lawyer, Arthur Kipps, whom his company assigns to Crythin Gifford's marketplace to solve the recently deceased customer papers - Mrs Alice Drablow. <br /> <br /> This movie begins with a relatively solid and interesting ghost story. But then, Arthur is taking part in the funeral and from this scene we don't feel safe. We are constantly on our nails and bites, which will last for the next hour until the end of the final, exciting finale. <br /> <br /> Warning for all new viewers: don't look at it alone. ..
