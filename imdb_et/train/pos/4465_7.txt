ANCHORS AWEIGH is an entertaining MGM music that fans of the genre enjoy, but I wouldn't appreciate it with a classic like SINGIN RAINIS or BAND WAGON. It was the first of three music that Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra appeared together. Kelly and Sinatra are playing with Joe Brady and Clarence Doolittle, two sailors who are leaving Hollywood to interact with a young boy (Dean Stockwell) who introduces them to his attractive young aunt (Kathryn Grayson) in the fight for an actor working in MGM extra. Although both men have initially attracted Grayson, he finally sets Joe's preference, but Clarence later sets up with a speaker (Pamela Britton) who is studying from his home town of Brooklyn. The paper green plot leaves room for a number of great musical numbers, including "We Hate to Leave", Joe and Clarence's colleagues sailing off the ship; Transfer of Grayson's "Jalousie" torrid; Sinatra's Dreamy Call of Love "I Fall in Love Too Easily" (a number that has unfortunately been deleted from some of this film) and "The Worry Song", a fantasy dance that Kelly is animating with Jerry Mouse about Tom and Jerry fame. Kelly is also doing some Kissing Bandit fantasy ballet that competes with her Pirate ballet later in PIRATE. Kelly is here for a top-notch, energetic and energetic performance that earned her the only Oscar nomination for the best actor and Sinatra's extremely shy character is undoubtedly sexy here. Entertaining entertainment for MGM music factory fans.
