Have you ever wished you could escape your boring and stressful life at school or at work and go on your magical adventure, one of your close friends next to you, facing all kinds of dangers and bad guys, and breaking the lost civilization of mystery, waiting for anyone to discover it Secrets? Even if you are not so big a fantasy lover, have you ever wished you could just experience what it is to be a boy again, and not in a few hours to be groomed in the world? <br /> <br /> This is exactly what Miyazaki's "Castle in Heaven" is. A young but very brave and ambitious engineer, Pazu, lives in the mining industry in rustic life for up to one day, a girl named Sheeta falls from the sky like an angel and takes her journey far beyond the clouds, while all the time they are pirates and military units hot on their trail. Simply put, it's just an incredible adventure that every child dreams of one or the other, and I can't help but feel my troubles melt every time I see it. <br /> <br /> Because it is one of Miyazaki's older works and a lot of everyday life, the film is neither visually noticeable nor deep as its spiritual evolution, hero movement, or even Princess Mononoke. However, I find it difficult to say that none of these films are higher than others because all three of these films are mysterious at some point, being mysterious, if not puzzled, especially for the younger ones. viewers. <br /> <br /> "Castle in Heaven", on the other hand, does not try to be any allegory, and it is not an age story; it is rather one of the best images of the inside of the child's mind I've ever seen. Art is not only beautiful, but the use of the perspective of children is simply amazing; is it a "camera" uplifting to see huge trees or a cloud up, or an incredible height of feeling on the ground or the ocean, when hundreds of feet in the air, I just can't help but like I am with Pazu and Sheeta, just with a baby in another in the world, far from reality. <br /> <br /> Even children have no complicated relationships that point to the need for hope like Ashitaka / San or Chihiro / Search; Sheeta is an angel of Pazu, literally falling into heaven in her life, a perfectly perfect person from the beginning. As the film progresses, their true adventurous childhood is increasingly emerging through its kind words and beautifully realistic facial expressions. Not only are they a divine reminder of who I used to be, but their loving friendship will never let the whole film grow, but grow stronger until the last frame. For this reason, I am in love with these two more than any other Miyazaki pair. <br /> <br /> At the same time, "The Castle in Heaven" is such an easy-to-access movie because no matter what casual filmmaker you can find, you will definitely find a fix here. Mystery, action, drama, comedy, intercourse, sci-fi, romance, even some westerns ... it's all here, almost all people go to the movies (except maybe horror). That's why I can just recommend it as Miyazaki's first movie; it is perfect for those who have no expectation that they have already seen some of the incredible other worlds of his latest works. <br /> <br /> Even the final song of the movie, when translated into English, will be passed on to the longing for the discovery of a lost civilization and a soul mate that was not found in our daily lives. "Because of the many lights that you are there in one of them ... The Earth spins, carries you, carrying both of us who will definitely meet." Miyazaki has always given poetic words to end Joe Hiasashi's great results, but that's the only thing I've seen, which is both a love song and an inspiring dream. I've found myself near tears, just listening to it. <br /> <br /> "The Castle of the Sky" may not be the most advanced, remarkable or meaningful work of Miyazaki, but it is perfectly perfect for what it really was: a true vision of childhood fantasy and a wonderful escape from the reality for all adults who want them to have the same wonderful imagination if they were just a carefree toddler. Sit down, relax and love it for what it is.
