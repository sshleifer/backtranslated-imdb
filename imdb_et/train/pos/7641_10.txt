Everyone plays their part in this "little expensive movie" pretty well. Belush gets the chance to live a part of his life differently, but in the end he realizes that what he had was just as good or even better. The film shows that we should take advantage of the opportunities we offer, not the ones we can't or cannot. If U gets $ 10 on this movie, it would be an investment!
