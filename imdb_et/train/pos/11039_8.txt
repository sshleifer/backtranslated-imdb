Now that's what I would call a good horror. With hidden / supernatural subtypes, this nice low budget French film brought attention to my first scene. This proves that you do not need wild FX or much gore to make a fear film. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around 4 cellmates in prison and each of them (and their motives) is gradually becoming more interesting as the film collects the final tension. Most of the activities we see in Carrere, who have just entered the prison and have to get used to living with these three other prisoners. <br /> <br /> I don't say much, because this film deserves more. However, there are some bugs: FX is not so good, but they are used effectively; the plot leaves some secrets open; and things will end up very confusing, but Malefique redeems himself until it is over. <br /> <br /> I thought he was a very good movie, 8/10
