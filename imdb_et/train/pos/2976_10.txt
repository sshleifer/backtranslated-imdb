For comedy this is a decent and inventive plot and the comic timing of Trey Parker and Matt Stone is perfect. There are dozens of funny moments in this fantastic movie. I like a lot of colors and how they come across in the sports arena. The outstanding mysteries of Robert Stacks are also very amusing.
