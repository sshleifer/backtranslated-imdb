I looked at this series when it first came out in the 70s. 14 years old and I was looking at it in my best friends house because my dad didn't want to see it. tell you that two fourteen-year-olds are watching a documentary in an almost reverent silence, which means that it was something special. <br /> <br /> The wide scale of World War II events makes the document difficult. The makers broke it into the most important major events and devoted every episode to every episode, such as the "wolf package", which covered almost every six years of the Atlantic battle. Stalingrad had one episode. <br /> <br /> This documentary just couldn't be done today because most of the respondents are dead. The list of important players provides an amazing overview of this time thinking. Anthony Eden, Foreign Minister Carl donnitz, h-boats, Albert Speer, pet architects, and Hitler's later army ministries, is one of the more recent episodes we see in a trawl junge, Hitler's secretary who was with him in the bunker and it was his last will and testament to him. left the bunker after Hitler's suicide and fled through Russian routes. these and many others play an important role in the reality of the events depicted. <br /> <br /> If I have any criticism of the series, the bletchly park code shredders do not belong, but their share in the war only occurred after the series was done, so I can't blame the program makers. <br /> <br /> Opening titles and music are great, and Lawrence Oliver's narration gives the script a natural gravity. <br /> <br /> The best set of documents ever made? without any doubt
