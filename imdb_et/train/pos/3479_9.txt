This exhibition started with big puzzles of mystery. I think everything is in the first 15 or 16 episodes. After that, the play began to play short episodes with Shaggy, Scooby doo and Scrappy doo. <br /> <br /> I think Hanna Barbera Productions had to turn 20-minute episodes into short episodes. Some of the voices became inaccessible. After 15 or 16 episodes, Frank Welker (who played Fred) was inaccessible. I think Velma's voice will change after the first 12 episodes, because the first actress who played Velma was not available. The network commissioned Hanna Barbera's studio with Shaggyi, Scooby doo and Shaggy. Scrappy doo because the ratings were high. So they had to do more short. I wish they were mysteries like 15 episodes. However, this is a good show.
