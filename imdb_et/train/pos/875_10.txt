Well, what can I say, just looking at this fantastic movie when my nerves are still kidding! The director of Jacques Audiard must have a completely fair name in France. Vince Cassel does not have Tom Cruise and Emmanuelle Devos is not Penelope Cruz, but these two are fantastic actors and it is a tense and convincing thriller that starts slowly with the creation of some smart characters and then begins to exert a tense climax. Others have written about the plot, so I will not say more if everyone in this movie plays their role in perfection, director, actors, directly to the operator and everything seems so real, no stupid weapon to play, fight if it happens, is so plausible, expressions, emotions, it's almost like you as a viewer. Benefit yourself, get a DVD, a bottle of wine, turn the lights low, take your phone hook and don't put it on the Hitchcockian thriller :)
