First of all, it was strange that the main character of the TV show could bring back dead life, but then I thought I'd give it away. Guess? I love "Expanding Daisies" and look forward to Wednesday night just to watch it, but next week I will watch it several times on my DVR. Colorful characters, witty fraud, fast paced dialogue, and new unique situations pull me from beginning to end. The relationship between Ned and Chuck Charles is interesting to see because they work with their romance because they have no physical contact. Even the character of the detective Emerson Codi has continued to become more complex. And the olive cake! Jiminy Crispies! She breaks me! The narrator's voice is fun to listen to and cinematography gives me the impression that I'm watching a TV show instead of a movie. I've suggested that my family and friends turn on "Pushing Daisies" and they're hooked! The exhibition has been waiting for the new episode for a week, and if you have not seen "P.D", I suggest you watch it!
