Between Monday and midnight and at 1.00 am, the President of California will send a message from Victor Rovner from Kuala Lumpur to the US. Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, federal agent Jack Bauer has returned to his family and has problems at home with his teenage daughter Kimberly, who accuses his mother of Teri Jack leaving the house. Teri and Jack decide to seriously talk to Kim and they discover that the girl has gone home. In an attempt to solve his internal problem, Jack is invited to his counter-terrorism unit by his colleague Nina Myers to meet their leader Richard Walsh, who threatens the life of Senator David Palmer, working for the President, and they have to find a shooter. Later, Walsh has a conversation with Jack and says there is a conspiracy in the office against David Palmer and gives Jack a conspiracy. If the plane explodes in the Mojave Desert, Jack has another problem. <br /> <br /> The first episode "24" is the start of a successful series that introduces Jack Bauer. This is the first time I have watched this example and admit that I liked what I have seen: a complex and dramatic story with several realistic characters. Kiefer Sutherland is the perfect family member and trusted representative who is responsible for three difficult tasks at the same time: finding a murderer to protect an important politician; find a fraudster in your office; and find your teenage daughter who goes in trouble trying to save her marriage. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "12:00"
