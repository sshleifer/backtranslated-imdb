I saw it for the first time in the early 90s on British television, I liked it, but I missed the opportunity to record, how many years passed, but the film was always with me and I lost hope to see the TV again, the main thing was what was stuck with me, was at the end, part of the hole really touched me, its easy to see, the story is great, good music, the list goes on and on, its ok for me how good it is, but everyone takes the best bits if they have it seen, yes, animation is the upper limit and beautiful look, it shows its age in very few parts, but it has now become part of this beauty, I'm so glad to have come out on DVD because it's one of my ten best films . Buy or rent it just to see it, the best viewing is alone in the evening with a drink and in force, so you don't have to stop the movie. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
