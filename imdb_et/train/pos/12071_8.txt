The projects of Nicolas Roeg are insignificant but never less interesting. "Insignificance" is clearly the first customized stageplay: it is literally quite a lot of space involved. BUT, it is worth looking at this movie more than once: the underlying themes are not publicly presented and, in addition, it takes four time to adapt to the four main characters: Einstein, McCarthy, Munroe and DiMaggio, and role changes. <br /> <br /> Einstein is guilty of Hiroshima's innocence but is still intimidated by the ease of sexual communication with Munro; Munro is sick that he is being looked at bimbo and desires intellectual faith; Senator McCarthy is at the height of his witchcraft power, but is an impotent sleazebag; DiMaggio is insecure about his fame, his obsession, and his violence. Each contains seeds for its destruction. Every character is concerned, abused / abusive past and questionable future. Gradually we see that obsession itself is a central issue. America's obsession with post-war cultural icons and mores; obsession with the main fighters against something that cannot be: peace of mind and / or happiness. <br /> <br /> Compared to the theory of relativity, the proposed theory of unified field science, and indeed space, all the aspirations and interactions of the main characters of Roeg seem insignificant. But those aspects of the physical universe (all of this is quantum, trust me!) Affect us when they are applied to develop tools that destroy us. Mentioning a monroe from the principle behind the neutron bomb (without mentioning it) is not anachronism per se, but can only be understood by a modern audience. Indeed, all references within the script are only available to the conscious viewer: one au fait with '50 years of events / personality cultures and how they affect us in the 21st century. <br /> <br /> This film and its scenario are either very, very clever or extremely opaque and pretentious. Ultimately, probably irrelevant. <br /> <br /> You live long and bloom :) <br /> <br />
