I have joined IMDb to let people know what this great movie is! Often you will not get to a movie that is moving and visually kinematic but humble. You have read the plot so that all I want to say is not looking at it because you want to see a clash of cultural religious identity, because it is a typical misconception that people read, but appreciate and understand that it is a father. and the son of a traveler who is getting to know each other through his struggles. Buy it and pass it on before movie4 goes into it. It was one of the few films that applied to BAFTA as an independent and alien. Its beauty is that it manages to turn to someone, even if you never look at a subtitle or just get used to the Hollywood formula, but it's a great story that makes you deal. The only thing I want is that it will be longer and see what happens
