Doghi is a great movie and Renuka Daftardar is great. So is Uttara Baokar, who is usually great in his roles. With Kairee this is the best example of Marathi Cinema. In both films, there are certain parts that tend to be didactic - it would probably have increased the film so that there would be few scenes in which the social message is hidden. These scenes are likely to emerge from the filmmaker's political problems, but the film is realistic and moves enough to not be needed. But with the exception of such small quizzes, the film that deserves to be seen more and I recommend it. Sumitra Bhave's concern and humanism is out.
