Ah, Domino is actually a breath of fresh air, something new in the world of cinema. I liked the movie because of a very complicated schedule, varied characters and intense camera effects. I've seen some complaints about the camera's work, and in fact the creators themselves create nice and natural shots to culminate with the mistakes made over time. All you see was the desired effect. Maybe some complain, because something like that has never been done before, although it's separate. The deeper you see, what you see is how Domino sees things through his eyes, think about it. <br /> <br /> When it comes to the story, I don't see anything bad about it. Despite being a "dirty" nature, some say it is just a quick form of storytelling. The plot is really not that difficult to follow if you really focus on what's going on. Maybe it's just me, because I see movies from many different aspects, such as acting, rehearsal, etc. I'm not an "interpreter" or something who chooses to distribute movies, it just comes to me. In saying this, I believe that this is a really good film, even though it is a classic, blocking or any kind of cult. <br /> <br /> And the characters, too, have no doubt about the size of the cast. I believe the cast is great because they are doing great jobs that effectively depict their characters, that's what the ladies and gentlemen of the film are doing. The characters are all very unique and the plus is that you can witness a small part of your life by setting them even further. Basically I loved myself and symbols personally. <br /> <br /> All those who burn and burn this movie just don't see it like I do, or just don't like them. No matter it's a great movie in your law, no, it's a great movie period.
