An amazingly interesting Western leader from a director who had little peers in the genre. Like other Anthony Mann pictures, Far Country combines a potent pot of boiling story and admiration that knows how it affects the landscape. Both play Mann's peccadillos like honor, honesty, betrayal and of course death. Lucky hunting dogs Jeff Webster {James Stewart} and Ben Tatum {Walter Brennan} travel to Oregon territory with cattle herds. Knowing about the blooming amount of gold, they are going to make a clean profit that sells cattle in the town of Klondike. When they arrive at Skagways, they will find a judge named Gannon {John McIntire}, who is ready to meet Webster for justice, because Webster is in breach of the law, for good reasons. In the punishment, Gannon takes their partners' flocks, but they steal them back and divert the Canadian border to Dawson with Gannon and his men. The beautiful women here and the buggy and lawless city will fulfill the destiny of all. <br /> <br /> Interesting from start to finish, Far Country benefits a lot from James Stewart's bubbling heroes waiting to be portrayed, and Mann's tight Borden Chase script's smooth direction. William H. Daniels's cinematic art is supreme, there are no advantages to the current DVD prints, and the film has some surprises and "does he intend to do it?" To pay dividends for re-viewing fans of the genre paid, it still remains an important watch for the first timers who penetrate the marvelous but dark western world of Anthony Mann and James Stewart. 8/10
