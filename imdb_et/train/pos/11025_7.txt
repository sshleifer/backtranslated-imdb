Cliffhanger is a decent activity crime adventure with some drawbacks from director Renny Harlin, whose admiration is to make a movie of professional climbing, who finds himself hostage by a companion friend from dangerous criminals in search of stolen cash bags in the Rocky Mountain. Sylvester Stallone is impressive when Gabe Walker is a climber of experts, especially in action / combat, but some of them will definitely limit the unrealistic line. For the sake of the movie, though I'm ready to stop my unbelief. The rest, including John Lithgow, Michael Rooker, Janine Turner, Rex City, Caroline Goodall and Leon, are the characters supporting the film. Action / combat sequences are well executed, but as mentioned earlier, some are not very realistic no matter how harsh you are. The climbing sequences, however, are very well done, because instead of making the whole movie in the studio somewhere, they felt they were very real and Ariel's views of mountainous areas are wonderful, adding reality to the film. Deaths are inventive, while others are predictable. Roisto is sure, but it would have been better for them to focus more on the center, not on many of them. The movie activation was a bit slow, but the good thing about it is bad. If you are a great fan of Harlins or Stallone, this is also an option. In general, Cliffhanger's characteristic development is that there are enough activities, drama, some tension, excitement, excitement and good productions that make it worth watching while watching the movie.
