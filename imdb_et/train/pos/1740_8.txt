This movie has not been so much advertised in Greece, although it became a good actor, a big script and a pretty good photo was not a "blocking" movie in my country. The film itself is very powerful, it's about a hard time that the newcomer had to go through when he returned to his home village after he was released from 5yo imprisonment (drugs) The end is quite sad .... Mourikis is trying to keep his part and he's doing it quite well ... Lambropoulou is great and very sexy in a strange way and, of course, Hatzisavva is once again close to an excellent competition ... out of 10, because very few Greek movies can make that impression!
