Too many sources tend to base this thoughtful periodic drama, in part, on a historical fact with superficially similar nunsploitation, which was trapped in the 70s Euro trash, looking at the righteous anger that drives the whole endeavor. Perhaps it was a coincidence that Gianfranco Mingozzi's unique experiment for narrative filmmaking outside many well-received documentaries. <br /> <br /> FLAVIA safely maps the growing rebellion of the Italian nun in the early 15th century in a historical context. (Florinda Bolkan's career prospects, even surpassing her wife's work in Lucio Fulci's devastating DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING), which was not in her monastic father's monastery, in a desperate attempt to limit the girl's desperate sensual nature. Wondering why women are in the best life for secondary roles in the sacred scripture, he faces ways in which men's domination can break a woman's life by inspiring a rebellion promoted by the semi-elder sister Agatha (depicted indefinitely by a veteran actor) Maria Casarès Marcel Carné's LES ENFANTS DU PARADIS ) and - more constructively - a Muslim invasion. Combining with the oppressors and possibly inadvertently manipulating their offerings, Flavia gets truly beyond what it already felt with the tragic results expected. <br /> <br /> With its breathtaking wide-screen compositions by Alfio Contin, who shot Michelangelo Antonion's ZABRISKIE POINT, this is an uncompromising and vigorous understanding of one woman's harsh but ultimately meaningless struggle against a patriarchal society that did not give her rights outside child care or fornication, like sister Agatha nervously notices. The long-term drug-induced fantasy sequence, clearly modeled on Ken Russell's otherwise much more amazing DEVILS, appears relatively weak in the film's skin department, making something of a semi-reputation. It is a serious job that deserves to be rediscovered and restored to its unfairly ashed.
