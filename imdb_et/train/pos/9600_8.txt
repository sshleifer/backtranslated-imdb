This movie is a story about the 15-year-old Darius Weems adventure. Darius has Duchenne muscular dystrophy, still an incurable disease that took his brother's life at the age of 19 and is the most infant killer in the United States. He and some close friends all over the country travel to Los Angeles to get their wheelchair for MTVs, Pimp My Ride, one of his favorite shows. The journey begins in Georgia, where Darius grew up and never left. Christmas is the west for a trip that all its participants will never forget. For the first time in Darius, Darius can fly a balloon, swim in the ocean and visit the sights he always wanted to see in Grand Canyon and New Orleans. Here the filmmakers are clearly emotionally connected to the material. They don't make money from selling $ 20 DVDs. $ 17 goes to study the disease and $ 3 goes to make more copies. The film has won over 25 prizes at festivals and I accept the Variety, "Be sure to mix hearts" quote.
