11 Oscar nominees and zero wins !!! I have not yet understood why - it doesn't like filmmakers after you can do it, giving them prizes for trivial roles, as was done by Halle Berry and Denzel Washington - Whoop, Oprah, Margaret Avery, Danny Glover, etc. - were all amazing - I'm curious to get scripts through Oscar discussions ...... it should go to the judges category "Black-Maya-Maya". <br /> <br This is an amazing book - but in a way that Alice Walker's writing style has, he has a vision of how he exaggerates his signs - so I'm so glad that customizing their screen took a few things out. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was amazing - African scenes live a lot of desire - Africa's book in the book should be set in Liberia - somewhere in West Africa - IF oh no! Steven Spielberg thinks the world is so stupid that they can't think of Africa outside Safari - so yes, there was a free Zebra and wildlife scene if we all know there is no West Africa ---- and most of all why to get people to speak Swahili --- Who in West Africa talks about Swahili? I just had to get it out ....... <br /> <br /> But if the story - amazing, cinema - out of this world - CLASSIC yes !! <br /> <br /> I own it and I look at it when my soul needs rejuvenation.
