Everyone has to pay bills and it includes Christopher Walken. In Vietnam, a group of soldiers discover that war is over and return home when they see a lot of victories, including Christopher Walken. After Mad Max 3 (!) Thunderdome fight and short massacre later. Walken and some Colombian boys shared a dollar bill that promised something or something. <br /> <br /> Cut to the present (1991) and Colombian boy lead the revolution against El Presidente. First of all, he is successful, but after El Presidente threatens to crush people with a tank, he is forced to surrender and live on television. This is shown in full detail as an American order newsletter that leads Walken to an old team (although he was not part of that team) to penetrate Colombia and thousands of weapons. people. <br /> <br /> McBain is a monumentally stupid movie, but it is also a good laugh and packed action. This is one of those films where the logic is given a wide place - how else could Walken shoot a pilot from another plane without suffering decompression or even a window break? It also seems that these guys can arm arms dealers in New York without disturbing the police. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of b-movie madness, Michael Ironside's hellish action in Vietnam, a hero's heroic, but totally pointless death, a half that contradicts Walken and El Presidente and don't forget the rebel sister a shameful speech that is viewed on television in America (almost to bring) a brown tear to my eye, a bit). <br /> <br /> It's out there. Buy if you have a sense of humor. See how many times you can mark the camera in the team.
