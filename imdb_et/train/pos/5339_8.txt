I just saw "Behind Bedroom Doors," and it was the first cushion behind a certain story I've seen for a while. Let's start with two neighbors - Vivian and James Fenway (Julia Kruis and Eric Carrington) and Lillian and Gabe Harris (Nicole Sheridan and Chris Gustafson). Vivian seems to be a housewife, James is a lawyer who works as a district commissioner, Lillian works in real estate and Gabe is a successful plastic surgeon. Do I have it all? Now, get in there. <br /> <br /> Enter Abby played by Chelsea Blue. He leases a house across the street from Fenways and lives by himself. At the beginning of the movie, James looks out of his window and sees Abby playing with his girlfriend Gigi (playing fruitful pornstress Monique Alexander) and wondering what it would be like to be with her. The next day, Abby gets to know all four and seems to be a nice woman just living an alternative lifestyle. He makes a bypass for Vivian, who seems surprised and tells him, "Oh ... I'm ... not so." Everything seems to be okay ... until the plan changes. First, Abby appears in Gabe's office, naked, asking Gabel if she should get a job. This is where we get a movie quote: <br /> <br /> "Tell me about Gabest." "What do you want to know?" "Is Gabe Married?" "I am married." "There's trouble ..... let me guess. Your wife will stay at home and do whatever you ask. But she's a good girl." "Yes." "He's not a bad girl?" "No". "Does this door have a lock?" <br /> <br /> You know what's going on .... Abby gets this Gabe right in the exam room. After that, he puts a small exhibition in his window for James, who goes over and doesn't waste time having sex with him. What James doesn't know is that the blinking red eye on the piano is really a camera that captures all the festive events (that's so obvious). Abby has later sex with Gabe and this time Gigi joins to make it triple. Now that Abbyl has something for both men, she's asking for $ 100,000 of each sum to buy her silence. Not only was he able to destroy James's term, but he could destroy Gabe's practice. <br /> <br /> While Gabe and James quarrel with their guilt, Abby finds time to lure Lillian - who "experimented" with college women. It was a long time ago, but you don't know you saw him in Abby's action - he looked like an old pro. <br /> <br /> While Gigi goes along with the plan, she feels like all the sexes of her sex girlfriend. "It's just a business," says Abby. Confessions and excuses will surely follow, as well as some amazing data about Abby's true identity - it seems that he has done the same thing with different men in many different places. Gabe and James are using this information to fight Abby's blackmail. <br /> <br /> Now, sex. Sexual scenes were pretty good and given all the women in the movie, except Julia Kruis, I have a long porn background, I wouldn't have expected anything less. Nicole Sheridan's four scenes were the best in the movie, three-way came close to each other. Monique Alexander only got naked, but she was relatively small. Julia Kruis was a big figure and got naked as many times. I think that because she is surrounded by experienced hardcore pros, she didn't have to have so many sexual scenes. <br /> <br /> To switch over, "Behind Bedroom Doors" was a great style that increased all-class movies. I think it's worth it. <br /> <br /> Women: A- (Nicole Sheridan was good at this movie - better than her later offers in Fred I Ray's comedies. At least she can do some drama. Chelsea Blue was a scene reporter - she wasn't as bad as an antagonist I would give him A himself, Julia Kruis was his usual, but I want Monique Alexander to have more face time in the movie.) <br /> <br /> Sex: B (solid, very strong family. Nicole Sheridan's performances Chelsea Blue also saw her scenes well. Two girls were not scorching but they warmed up <br /> <br /> Story: B + (I liked the dialogue and the main story. Chelsea Blue's performance was good for the genre and I was impressed by Nicole Sheridan's turn.) <br /> <br /> Overall: B (It was a nice soft porn movie. I'm glad I was able to watch it because I was pleasantly surprised. When Chelsea Blue wanted to do more, he would be welcome to ee also for Nicole Sheridan - though she is likely it was better to do comedy. I don't mind hardcore girls who can make soft movies.)
