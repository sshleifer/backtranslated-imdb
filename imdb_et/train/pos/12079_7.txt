For those who think that Dame May Witty is a kind, slightly evil, old lady of Hitchcock's The Lady Vanish, this film requires correction. Here he is nothing but kind or gentle. Instead, his son, George Macready, loony. Just do not give him a knife, otherwise his eyes will light up and the house will not be safe for the furniture. Now we know what he has trapped for Nina Fochi when she can just get out of her mother's dominant hand. <br /> <br /> A really tight little woman-threatened movie that keeps tension high. The script will never fall into Fochi's dilemma. He is imprisoned in a large old Gothic house by the angry sea. They kill him, but why. His contradiction doesn't make sense. The tension attaches when he tries one of the escape victims after another, but even strangers seem against him. We begin to feel his helplessness and paranoia when the world goes alongside him. <br /> <br /> Directed by Joseph H. Lewis, this film and, of course, a great step towards the cult status. Even when Foch looks through emotions, it never goes up. Witty too shines like a really scary matriarch who knows what she wants and how to get it when she can keep her wacko son. My one reservation is the climax that seems too complicated given the timing of events. Nevertheless, it is a good, anti-nervous way to spend just over an hour, courtesy of Columbia studios.
