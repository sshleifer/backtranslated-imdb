I am a pretty old guy, old enough to remember the taste of Oreos and Coke because they were 50-55 years old when every child's taste was fresh. I wish I had somehow set aside a magic suspended closet so I could taste these things today. This magical closet can even customize the fabric of food to take into account how I have moved physically and otherwise due to the dynamic chemistry of my expectations. For half a century, they would have had to adapt a bit because you see that I knew I would put them aside. Today's eating would be a celebration of the self and of the past and the story and the mind that would almost change the anticipated reward for the intermediate years. <br /> <br /> I didn't have enough idea to do it with the original coke. And I couldn't invent one of these magical mental cabinets? not then. But I did something almost as good. In the seventies, I really tuned Roman Polanski. He was a strange and exotic joy? you know, the movies are smuggling from the Soviet bloc. Movies that are so sensitive to beauty that you will cry for weeks. Movies that want to live with Polish women, one and then decide to be the last to get it. <br /> <br /> Here's what I did. I took what I knew would be my favorite Polanski movie and put it aside. I didn't look at it. I pushed it forward until I thought I was big enough to earn it. Over the years I would have tried myself, my ability to surround beauty and describe it without occupying it. Probably the few Poles who have worked on it have practiced that they deserve Chopin. Working to earn a womanness when I see it. Trying to get the inner edges. <br /> <br /> Recently, I gained some confirmation that it was time to pull it out. I already knew that I had already passed since it worked optimally because I had already seen and understood the "9th Gate". <br /> <br /> If you don't know, it's a person who is innocently letting a room where the previous tenant (for whom the story is given) jumped out of the window and died later after that man (played by Polanski) visits. What happens is that time is folds and she gets from this woman. We are deceived to believe that he is just crazy. But how we follow him is not. He just flashes that the world is normal, and that the surrounding people are not part of their reality cone. <br /> <br /> The story is very important. What matters is how Polanksi shapes this thing as he lives in the eyes, which only makes edges and lives in a body that consists only of confused flesh. These two will never judge. There is a discrepancy that can haunt me in the next 30 years. With this idea inside and outside without the edges ?? except for the redhead wig. <br /> <br /> I don't know anyone else who could do it, the scheme that remains the sketch, the horror that remains natural. <br /> <br /> With this genius, you need to know one of the greatest films ever made; "Rear window." The genius of this movie is the post-noir understanding that the camera is shaping the world; that viewer creates a story. What Roman does, take this film and turn it out. The back door had the idea that the screen reader (Jimmy Stewart) was an anchor and everything else was fictitious, woven as we looked. Here is the filmmaker of the apartment owner of the screen. We know that. We know that everything we see is true because he is a narrator. We know that it is true that the body changes identity, which is a shift in the causal relationship between plastic. We know the narrator kills us. We know that the narrator leaves us in an eternal horror at the edge he portrays, but never shows us and lets us imagine. <br /> <br /> Tedi Assessment - 4/3: Everyone should experience it.
