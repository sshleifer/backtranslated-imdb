I watched a movie with a homophobic friend, my wife and a female friend. So I had views of all directions. Basically, the film was laughing, sexual tension didn't really exist and the only noticeable actors were Tudor Chirila and Maria Popistasu. Yes, I think he played his role well, even if the script was not relevant. There were good Romanian actors, they just had no complicated roles. I appreciate Puya's entry into the movie. I don't know why, but I think he's a good man, I hope he's a good actor. <br /> <br /> The woman loved this movie, and I think maybe the chords I played and which I had no ear. When the film attempted to present rare Romanian sexual behavior and its consequences, it was unhappy. There were no consequences. Imagine that girls are really a boy and a girl, and the same story is just a boring, uninteresting plot. <br /> <br /> I have no idea why he got all these BAFTA awards. In my book I should have received the "Better luck next time" award. (bafta = happiness in romanian).
