Of what I read, many people are disappointed with this movie compared to Part 1. Initially, I understood it, but after a bit of thinking, I think they are wrong. Soderbergh continues his factual talk about Che's life he started in Part 1. Part 1 talked about the story of a revolution that began without hope from start to finish to a successful end. Part 2 tells the story of a revolution that moves from a hopeless start to a completely unsuccessful end. It is not Soderbergh's fault that these two Che's lives were completely different. He decides boldly to say both in a rather simple way. The viewer may feel better at the cinema after Part 1 than Part 2, but this is the reality of Che's life and not the director's guilt. The film is far from perfect. This is probably too long. In at least part one, we saw different aspects of war when the Gaelic had success. In part 2, they cannot break the break and we see a steady reduction in their number due to death and capture. Chei catching and dying is well solved. The film is greatly enhanced by the Spanish-language dialogue. Benicio Del Toro is once again great as a charismatic Argentine. So if you've seen Part 1, you'll see a very similar story from the second part.
