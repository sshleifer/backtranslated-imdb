I was watching this movie 11 years ago with my best female friend. I got my teeth out, so I didn't feel very good. <br /> <br /> I liked this great time. It is hard to see if you consider that it concerns friendship, unwanted betrayal, power, money, drug traffic and the extreme difficult situation of living in a foreign prison. <br /> <br /> Action is its main level. Two women I want the most stars and that's good. Claire Danes is as cute and charming as ever, while Kate Beckinsale is very hot and provides excellent performance. Bill Pullman is also great and shows his hysterical qualities. <br /> <br /> There are many plot twists to appeal and make an interesting visual experience. In addition, it shows complicated times in Thailand. <br /> <br /> This is an underrated movie. Not many films like this have recently appeared. It should reflex you for many things ...
