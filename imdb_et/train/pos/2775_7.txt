Old film fans know why I would call it "Man Hall Flannel Robe". Most Bible-based movies are basically scripts that can name smiles and strangles here, as Peck seeks to raise awareness of various psychological and social issues when he has neanderthals in his hand. As a great novel, he falls as unleavened bread. But there's something thrilling about this movie. Of all the great images of the Hollywood Bible, it is the most remarkable of the medium American attitude towards the Bible in the faith of God. Billy's Sunday dissertation brings it through H.L. Mencken's antithesis through the entire script. Whoever gets better with the guaranteed synthesis of the heavenly choir depends on your point of view. In addition, D & B has a good Peck performance (especially in the endless repentance scene) and the lively, moody atmosphere of Jayne Meadows, his bitter first wife Michol (a good idea to set most of the activities at dawn or at night), and the bitterly passing of the twenty-third psalm at the end.
