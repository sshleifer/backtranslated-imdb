In the classic sense of the four humor (which is not a funny or even entertaining concept) is Altman's "H.E.A.L.T.H." treats all humor and actually very fun entertainment. There's Phlegm, like Lauren Bacall's very slow, guarded and defensive character Esther Brill, whose mission in life seems to be an appearance, protecting his secrets of age and beauty more than his well-being. There's a Paul Dooley cholera, Dr. Gil Gainey, who loves to flop out of water (maybe rather a seal) floping around, barking and encouraging the crowd to notice his waterproofness. Glenda Jackson's Isabella Garnell's melancholy smells of Shakespeare's alarming and in itself fair Hamlet - even if she's buggy or two. Let's not forget Henry Gibson's Bile character, Bobby Hammer ("The Breastfeeding Baby Rules for the World"). Then the characters Harry Wolff and Gloria Burbank (James Garner and Carol Burnett, respectively) are relatively reasonable characters who try to find some balance among all the companions and extreme humor who have called H.E.A.L.T.H. - a world trade organization specializing in H.E.A.L.T.H., which means something other than health. This is Altman's classic best.
