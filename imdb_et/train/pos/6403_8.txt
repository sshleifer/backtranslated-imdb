For HONOR MEN, Gooding Jr. is Cuba, which is probably his best results. He plays Carl Brashear, who is bold and heroic. He is a southern farmer of dirt that wants to become a naval diver but has problems with his race. The diving school leader, played by Robert DeNiro, is a racist red man who still grows to respect Brashear. The film shows how Brashear has to accept almost insurmountable coefficients, not once, but twice. Performances are what makes this movie special. Gooding is great, and DeNiro, the best actor in film history, delivers spectacular performance - his best dramatic work over the years. Charlize Theron gives DeNiro a much younger wife. The film is somewhat too heavily patriotistic (though not where it was in PATRIOT), and some characters are only one-dimensional bad (Hal Holbrook's Mr. Pappy is just as bad), but the film is a rarity in today's movies. It is ascending and inconsistent. Great movie.
