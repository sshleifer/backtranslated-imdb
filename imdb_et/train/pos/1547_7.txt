Like almost everyone who has commented on this movie, I can only wonder why this video has never appeared. <br /> <br /> I remember it at the age of 12 at The Late Show, circa 1972. I also remember the poison gas attack and the strangely looted horses. (I still don't remember the terrible bits I've seen here; they were probably cut off for televisions.) But the scenes I really liked were those associated with Lord Kitchener's death in HMS Hampshire, almost exactly 90 years ago. The frightening cruiser, approaching the storm mine field, was really cooling down. <br /> <br /> Don't remember the musical score, but the comments of others are curious for me now. Get it via video!
