I enjoyed this movie. I thought it was a great political thriller that has never happened before - the secret service agent is going bad and taking part in the murder plot. Unfortunately, Michael Douglas's character for "Pete Garrison" is that they think HE is a mole, but he is not. <br /> <br /> He is only a morally faulty agent who interacts with the first lady! Since he does this, he is unable to give an acceptable polygraph exam, and he suspects that this is the number one when it is known that the president will kill the plot. <br /> <br /> Garrison is forced to go but at the same time he is still trying to do the right thing, defending the president. Douglas does a good job in this role. I don't always care about people playing, but he's a great actor. Keifer Sutherland ("David Breckinridge") is equally as good (at least here) as the SS SS boss who hunts Douglas until he is convinced that he has spoken the truth. If they both work together in the finals, they discover and finish, if they can, a plot. Undoubtedly, scammers are interesting. I also never - and never - see the first woman who looks as good as Kim Basinger. <br /> <br /> This is just a sliding action that attracts the beginning to the end. Are there any holes in it? Of course; probably some of them and the reason why you see so many critical comments. But it has been unfairly started here. This is not smart enough for genius on this website. My advice: chill, go along the ride and enjoy all the activities and intrigue. Yes, it will end with a little bit of Rambo-ish, but otherwise it's going to get high marks for entertainment ..... what are movies.
