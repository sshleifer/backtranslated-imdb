OK, so the soldier is not deep and meaningful like Blade Runner or the same budget as Terminator 2, but overall I found it quite enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The fact that Kurt Russell was by nature unspoken and virtually emotional made moments when his humanity went even more enjoyable. I found her portrayal of limited emotional development more touching than Arnie's T films (and before I get comments yes I know Arnie was a cyber and Kurt was a human, but the premise of both films was the same). <Br>> <br /> So for the film itself, sensible US / Britons can read it a little. Not sure whether Gary Busey and his two deputies were bad or good, so he couldn't decide if I liked them or not. The colony was somewhat more realistic, not a false peace loving / worshiping / coward, who got out of hand, nor an attacking group of aggressive terrorists who were paranoid about offworlers and each other. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell is good and, unlike other comments, does not feel that it has a negative impact on his career (unlike maybe escape from LA - queues are such terrible creatures!). Sean Pertwee has really made his late father proud of continuing the noble Sci-Fi line of families. And the remainder illuminated the pathetic ensemble of those who gave this pathetic situation and didn't do it too bad. <br /> <br /> If you see it on your TV show, I would recommend giving it a chance. I don't think you're disappointed.
