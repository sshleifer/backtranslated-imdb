MISSOUR GIRL arrives in New York, knowing exactly what he wants: getting something solid for a millionaire without losing his innocence. With his good looking looks, he quickly tries to see the grandmother's playboy's eye, but when he sticks to his virtue, does he discover true love? <br /> <br /> Jean Harlow sizzles in this great little comedy. He's a dazzler with his platinum hair and gorgeous batteries. But her beauty should not hide the fact that she was also a very good actor. He has rightly served his place at the top of the Hollywood pantheon. <br /> <br /> Great silver gives Harlow a good support: Lionel Barrymore as an old grandmaster, wise Harlow; beautiful Franchot Tone as his son, loved love; dirty Patsy Kelly, stealing her scenes like Harlow Sidekick; debonair Alan Mowbray, as a well-educated English Lord; parents Clara Blandick as Barrymore hostile secretary; cheerful Hale Hamilton as a rich man whose eyes are women; muscular Nat Pendleton as a lifesaver who catches Kelly's flirtic eye; and Lewis Stone, a businessman who has gone bankrupt due to an unforgettable role. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that this movie was introduced immediately after the Hollywood product code. Comparison with RED-HEADED WOMAN, made two years earlier, would be exciting - where Harlow's character pursues the same goals, but uses a wide variety of tools.
