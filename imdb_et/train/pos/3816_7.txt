"Secret Sunshine" reminded me of "The Rapture" (1991), Mimi Rogers and David Duchovny, but this Korean production is a better film. It represents the super-religious Korean Christians in the province of Korea and the experiences of the main characters associated with them following a terrible personal tragedy. Shin-ae is a widow single mother who moves from Seoul with her little son Milyang city (Chinese secret sunshine). He has chosen Milyang because he was born with his late husband (killed in a car accident) and he feels he needs to start a new life. He does not respond well to the discoveries of local Christian zealots, one of his members trying to convince him to assemble his church and prayer topics. Shin-ae is essentially unreliable and brushing these people as courteously as possible. In fact, he is just brushing in Milyang first, but some of them have tried to penetrate their world and the consequences are often fun. In other words, it would be a movie, but it should be noted that the leading role (Jeon Do-yeon) woman's result is amazing. After reading that he won the Best Actress Award in Cannes in 2007, I waited for him to do a decent job. But Mrs. Jeon is enchanting and it is impossible to take her eyes off when she is on the screen. The film is a kind of harrowing work by Evelyn Waugh-esquire, showing how fate may seem crazy so strange inevitable.
