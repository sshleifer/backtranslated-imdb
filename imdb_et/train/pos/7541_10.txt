This Showtime movie really deserves a much better viewer rating than 4.5; I gave it to 10, based on the story and action of two stars. After reading the viewer's comments, I was surprised how many people thought this film was comedy. Yes, I see IMDb listing it under comedy / drama under the genre. It's definitely misleading, isn't it? Luckily I saw the movie before logging in to this website, so I didn't have that expectation. Actually, I thought I just heard I was just a drama. I don't know if disappointment is not a funny movie that caused so many low voices. <br /> <br /> Another factor that may have caused low voices is that this movie is very characteristic. "Driving Miss Daisy" is an example of another character driven movie that comes to mind. Some previous comment complained of boredom. The scenes of Tom's work (Danny Glover) seemed to deviate from the actual plot of the film. This means how he planned to rise up his family - or his personal troops. However, they made credibility and legitimacy when its right to move to Greenwich and move "up" in the world. <br /> <br /> Tom's obsession was forced. He proved that he couldn't do anything in the white neighborhood. His fun, when another black person moved next to his neighbor, wasn't due to the skin color. This was all because of the interloper; all that Tom had left behind. In essence, Tom had become Oreo's cookie: black from the outside, but white inside. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes of this movie have been one of the most powerfully written, staged and acted by Whoopi Goldberg. I've ever had the pleasure of witnessing. I realized that the climax of the film was not an obvious event that happened by the side (does not want to give it away). The vertex is verbal and Whoopi gives it. I'm still not clear if this is a conversation when he tells Tom what college Tom-Two is going to do, or when he releases it, all at night and Tom wakes up. Nevertheless, the uprising is great. You know that life on this street is never the same. <br /> <br /> My favorite character-driven flick: people go through problems, pain, make their dance, grow, change, and life go on. As a member of the audience, I can learn something or be inspired.
