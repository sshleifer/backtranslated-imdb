Something happens to Sondra Pransk when he enters the band's box at the London Theater. Little is known to Sondra that the newly-left journalist Joe Strombel is realizing that he is asking him to investigate the man whom someone has told him, his journey to another dimension is the infamous Tarot killer who has been a criminal in London. The only problem is that the accused is a respectable upper class man for all appearances. <br /> <br /> When Sondra gives his experience to the great Splendin, known as Sid Waterman, the wizard is stunned, but decides to go. These two would be P.I., who call the club where Peter Lyman goes swimming. Sondra, who is fooling her drowning, is catching the attention of this groin who wants to see her more. appears at the end of the movie. The actual Tarot killer does not think he can fool a certain Sondra, who proves to be more inventive than he gave his credit. <br /> <br /> The result is a perfect summer movie that has a lot of laughter, just what you need to get out of the heat in the perfect time in a cool theater. Woody Allen has done better results, but this sunny comedy confirms his past failures. In "Scoop", Mr. Allen has taken himself as a romantic leader pawing his proud leading lady. His funny trademark is something that this funny person will never release because it seems to be his trademark. The film has some funny liners that go over the head of the audience, who may not pay attention. <br /> <br /> Scarlett Johansson, the "Scoop" beautiful star, seems to be an ideal foil for Woody. Allen. He plays the straight part, while Mr Allen makes his shticki, the perfect combination. Both of them are excellent in their movie all over the film. Ms. Johansson has lost her beauty in her red swimwear, although they have dressed her in most of the costumes she's wearing on the screen. Hugh Jackman is considered to be Peter Lyman's complicated person with the right genealogy. He looks good in the movie like a man who continues to Mrs. Johansson. Ian McShane plays the dead Fleet Street journalist on the road to eternity. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is a light film for a warm and damp summer thanks to Woody Allen.
