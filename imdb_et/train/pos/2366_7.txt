This film (also known as "Martial Law 3") introduced me to Jeff Wincott for the first time. And that was a great introduction. Although I haven't heard of her before, she seemed to be a great fighter. The activities of this movie are great! By the way, there are many of them. The fight against the recruitment of peacekeepers' headquarters is particularly good. There's just something about a guy who beats a crap. And the rest: Brigitte Nielsen was a good choice for a villain. Such roles fit with him (but not others). Matthias Hues did a good job, as always. He is a great fighter and macho-like character and was a good competitor to Winkott in this film.
