How can the film be controversial and gentle? It does this with an almost perfect structure. Nobody wants their daughters to be athletes. Probably most cultures do not want their daughters to be small. Here we see a number of great actors we've never heard before to portray the different cultures that live quite badly until their female children want and have the potential to become a professional footballer. The parallelism of the two cultures is excellent. There is no pressure. Both cultures are considered modern and valid. (And yes, both are stupid). One Mistake: The Hindu wedding ceremony seemed to be involved with hundreds of relatives but not one child.
