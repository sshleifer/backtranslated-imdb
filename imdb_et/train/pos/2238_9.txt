Since this film is completely Swiss, most German-speaking people probably find it difficult to watch the movie. I am not from Switzerland, but I worked there for a few years, so I had the opportunity to understand this great liar of the Lord of Rings. I've seen many such movies (such as Scary Movie, Scifi Spoofs, etc.), but that's the best I've ever seen. I'll give 9 out of 10. The only reason I can't give 10 is some small details that could have been done better and because they didn't provide any subtitles on the DVD, so there is almost no way to understand non-Switzerland.
