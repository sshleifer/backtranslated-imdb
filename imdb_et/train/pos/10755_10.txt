A great documentary about the life of NY's firefighters all the time during the worst terrorist attack. This alone is the reason why it should be a visionary element. What shocked me was not only the attacks, but the "high-fat diet" and the physical appearance of these firefighters. I think many doctors would agree with me that, in their physical form, some of these firefighters would not have been on the 79th floor, which was over 60 pounds. Having said that, I now have more respect for firefighters and I understand that a firefighter is a life-changing job. French documentaries have made great documentaries and this is the big documentary .....
