I'm 60 years old, guitarist (driver / rhythm) and for the last forty years I've been in four ensembles, it's all there, fighting, cheating, rotting food, worse accommodation always traveling, little or no, and everyone was drunk or high . But clubs, fans and music did it all worth it! Just like Strange Fruit! I'm too old for that, and the arthritis of hands and hips doesn't mean swinging, but for the length of this video it all came back and it was all there! Birds, punches and bullocks! And I was young again! It's like Billy Connolly's voice, God likes this 70's! Rock On Forever!
