There's no point in the story, because enough reviewers have done it. Here are some of these "religious nuts", as one big reviewer puts it so tolerant. <br /> <br /> 1) "Baby Face" (1933) is perhaps a classic example that has ever been put on a film about how women manipulate men with sex. It is the truth that Barbara Stanwyck in this film shows: look cute, string your lashes, offer your body for free ..... and men fall on themselves to help you out whatever you want. > <br /> In this case, it was a progression of work with the ultimate goal of money ..... a lot. At least four men in this movie are offering this, even if it destroys their lives in the process. <br /> <br /> 2) The end - as many of the observers here hated - gives another great message: all the money and material goods in the world do not make people feel filled. It is a sad remark that so many of the critics here would have immoral messages, preferring to break the substance. Not surprisingly, I think. <br /> <br /> Anything you look at, the movie is fun from start to finish and Stanwyck has great features, especially at the beginning when he talks to his raw father and his unarmed bar customers. Just over 70 minutes, this movie is moving fast and is known for it.
