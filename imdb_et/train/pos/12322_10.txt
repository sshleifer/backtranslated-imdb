This movie is one of my favorites. It is a mix of genres with Action / Horror / Romantic / Comedygenre ingredients. Some special effects may seem obsolete compared to modern standards. This little mistake is simply ignored. There is so much to discover in this story. The romantic relationship between the two main characters is so beautiful that it is painful. Visuals are also beautiful. It is an excellent activity that is not surprising, it comes from the birthplace of the world's best films in Hong Kong. Humor sometimes seems a little stupid, but good. Somehow, this film is capable of balancing different moods and keeping itself well. Absolutely recommended.
