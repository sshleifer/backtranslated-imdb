Looking back over the past 28 years (after the first exposure to the exhibition), I can say that if it is received, it will remain forever. I remember that my initial reaction was: 1) tedious, 2) produced 3) unlikely characters <br /> <br /> Two years later I looked at some episodes and found it almost as annoying. A year later, I was able to catch the whole series from the start and quickly began to experience the bittersweet story of human error and happiness. Yes, the exhibition has a style that is not for everyone, and I'm sure the value of the production now produced would be difficult. But I'm still thinking about the show at least once a month because of longing for the tearful eyes that seemed easier ... <br /> <br /> BTW I am a married man ... (to anyone who thinks this is a show of women)
