I am the importer of such films. Movies that take you back and let you live in your childhood. I've grown up now and I have many adult responsibilities like mortgage, kids, dogs, wife and others. I enjoy my life, but it's not as innocent and careless as it was when I was twelve. Mike Binder's Indian summer knows it and looks at it as he was twelve years old. This will bring you back to the point where life was easier and more fun. It brings you back to the time you were worried about your first kiss and wondered if you could stop camping, were important questions. The Indian summer is a fantastic movie and that's what you should look at at least once a year so you can sit and laugh ... and remember. <br /> <br /> The movie stars Kevin Pollak, Bill Paxton, Diane Lane and Matt Craven (known as some) are childhood friends who are called back by their former head camp adviser, Uncle Lou. Uncle Lou plays perfectly Alan Arkin. He is a man who is a group patriarch. He is also all aware and includes the true spirit of the father's character and someone who understands the simple things in life. She has a hard time with today's children who need to walk by the ear when they are in a huge beauty spot like Tamakwa. This is a camp that escapes from the camp through the moose, leaving the unaltered colors God has given them, and water as much as the eye can see. Uncle Lou is waiting for the old days and asks his former campers to return to the camp to see one of them take over the camp. When they all come together again, we see their trials and misery, and maybe new love may arise between them. <br /> <br /> As adults return to the camp, it won't be long before the kids again, when typical camp fears are played again. They take toilet paper out of kiosks, toothpaste in sleeping bags, and so on. All this is happening and actors like Pollak and Paxton are all very funny things. In one of my favorite scenes, Kevin Pollak and Elizabeth Perkins look at the bay where they were worshiping as children. Pollak doesn't get over how small it all looks and Perkins finally tells him that the Gulf didn't get smaller, they just got bigger. It doesn't relax at home, but does it fine. We all grow up, we all move on and we can't all live unfortunately 20 years ago. The more things change, the more they will remain the same. <br /> <br /> The Indian summer is a distinctive film and is written by Mike Binder, who actually participated in Camp Camp Tamakwas (like Sam Raimi, who played in the Stick movie) and his beloved and vivid memories of his experiences that film the film. There are lots of touching scenes and lots of fun. Both are ideal. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. I love it all and it's a real hidden gem. <br /> <br /> 10/10
