I was deeply moved by this film in many aspects. First of all, I want to say that Clara Lago was the most valuable little thing! Such a pretty little girl. His actions were also excellent. True to life and very human. Although I don't like the part he had to smoke; I hope this was just a fake proposal. In both cases, he was absolutely wonderful and the story was so touching. I found myself surrounded by a story and his character. <br /> <br /> It's quite interesting how I came to discover this movie. I walked bursting and I happened to notice that his beautiful smile on the cover was when I was walking. Fortunately, I watched it under the movie! I thought to myself, "Awe, look at him!" So I picked it up and saw that the movie was described as wonderful things like "Little Pearl". I read on the back of the plot and then thought well, maybe I'll look at it from the IMDb first and then come back and rent it later. I'm glad I didn't do it because I would definitely be lost. After searching for a movie, my friend, I knew I would finish renting this movie because I went back to where I first found it and I started it up. <br /> <br /> It was a weekend in my garbage because the school started for me this week and I had no time to watch it, but today it was a great opportunity. I put it in and glued it to beautiful cinematography, a pleasant score, and moving the plot from start to finish. I was so fascinated and I have to say that some parts pulled me almost to tears. <br /> <br /> I would especially like to mention this film, Juan Jose Ballestat. He was remarkable. Also an actor who played Carol's father, unfortunately not listed locally. His voice was just so loving and gentle that I felt my love for Carol. Although his appearance is not remarkable, I really felt his character. <br /> <br /> It's a really great movie. If you are a person moving in white but emotional movies, it is definitely for you.
