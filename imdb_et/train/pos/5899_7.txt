The lovely idea ... salesgirl Linda Smith (Yolande Donlan) suppresses a small small Lampidor province. This country, which was not even in North America, was made into the 49th country ... (of course, there were only 48 countries at that time, because it was made in 1952 ...) Linda travels to the country where she is inherited and we follow her, when he tries to find out what to do with this strange country and its even quirkier people. At one point, he sings the song he claims to have for his people, Navajo, and it is getting quieter from there ... though Yolande Donlan's heavy lipstick and omni-present smile can never be kidnapped or caught. There are other songs that are scattered out when citizens sing their new princess to greet. The film's award-winning British version, technicolor, or some similar name, is the only big name here, Dirk Bogarde, as the British theme Tony Craig, the seller of cheese. Bogarde made a big splash in the UK film industry after the war and even the QE II bike. Craig and the "new princess" get into each other and their adventures become more intertwined when Lampidorra's financial problems worsen ... Funny little farce .... Marx Brothers movie. Also note that Donlan was later married to Val Guest, our small project writer and director, and was married for 50 years! The guest was better known for writing and managing their sci-fi flaps both in the UK and in the US.
