In 1993, in the first season of Batman: Animated Series, a Warner Brothers team was commissioned to take the hit by producing a full-length film that was originally intended for direct video. status. It would become known as Batman's Phantasm mask. Ten years after Phantasm, we have had three more feature films released from the boys on the return of WB, Sub-Zero, Joker, and now have joined Batster's mystery family. <br /> <br /> The plot is basic and in many ways similar to the Phantasm mask: the new female vigilants, modeling themselves after Batman's start, have begun to direct operations led by Gotham mob boss Rupert Thorne and Oswald Cobblepot AKA Penguin. Now Batman must try to break Batwoman's secret before he crosses the line. <br /> <br /> Animation is a sleek and futuristic style used by Batman for the 5th and 6th years of the Animated Series (AKA's New Batman Adventures). , it's pretty nicely done and just as sleek as returning Joker's animation. There are also some CGIs, but it is small compared to its excessive use in Sub-Zero. The music was fine. Different and exotic and similar to the Justice League scores, though scores for the old animated Batman theme, will definitely send nostalgia waves through rodent-shaped hearts of older fans. <br /> <br /> Kevin Conroy, as always, does wonderful work like Bruce Wayne and Batman. It's also nice that the old Batman: Animated Series alumni back; it includes Bob Hastings (Commissioner Gordon), Robert Costanzot (Detective Bullock), Tara Strong (Barbara Gordon / Batgirl; she shot hints of her and Bruce's romantic relationship mentioned in Batman Beyond) and Efrem Zimbalist Jr. Alfred. <br /> <br /> The companions were great - especially given that Rupert Thorne, the old series of the original series, will be released for the first time since the fourth season. <br /> <br /> Generally Although ten years ago the motif was not a standard set by the Phantasm mask, MOTB carries the torch quite nicely for Batman films. And if you have a DVD and you are a hardcore fan, you will love this five minute short Chase Me.
