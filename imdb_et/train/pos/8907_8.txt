I saw this movie the second night at midnight On Demand, not knowing what to expect. I had heard about this movie, but never had any opinion about it. <br /> <br /> I have to say I had what I saw. I was really broke somewhat and I'll definitely remember to jump a few times. <br /> <br /> Blob was scary. Now I look at the jelly in the jelly and wonder if it locks my hand. <br /> <br /> Steve McQueen was really good at Steve Andrews, the film's main character. I also liked the old man in the beginning. <br /> <br /> For 50's horror movies, it was very well done even in today's standards. <br /> <br /> 8/10
