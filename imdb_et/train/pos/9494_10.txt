WHITE FIRE was recommended by a man who owns it on two separate DVD editions and VHS. He said it was one of the funniest and coolest low budget contestants ever made. I generally don't watch movies knowing they are bad, but I made an exception for that ... and I was very glad I did. <br /> <br /> It is full of brim activity (a big part of surprisingly, graphically great), slipping (female character of a key isolated to nudity, but there are so many scenes that it becomes fun) and a terribly uncomfortable dialogue that all adds a laughing film inducing tone. <br /> <br /> GATE, EXTERMINATOR's unusual looking (and countless other low-budget activities) are leading fun, giving the best results that it can accumulate. Williamson is better than usual, obviously grabbing it unevenly (and he doesn't come down). The rest of the majority is fun to watch, especially the villains, one of whom is a sadistic boy who talks with an accent that seems to be mish-mash, which is Spanish and Italian. He's invaluable. <br /> <br /> Again, I can't stress enough how it was. It is not so bloody that it is nausea, but it is rarely violent in parts where some of the carnivores are shot down by squibse shooting and has a grueling torture that no person will soon forget. Even when Ginty is surrounded by a pack of bad boys, he can comfortably get a chainsaw and the following squirting moments can all and all action fans rejoice and pour beer. <br /> <br /> Don Don't leave a white fire. It's rolling - as sensibly stupid - action classic.
