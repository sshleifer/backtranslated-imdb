Gymnasium friends Andre Kriegman and Cal Gabriel declare war with their classmates and plan a terrible attack on their high school. Since they start a deadly census of their final revenge action, two video diaries begin to explain their feelings and chronicles to accomplish their tasks. Why do I bring it? Of course, comparing two movies. I have to say, although I liked the "elephant", it's a much better film. What is the difference? Well, starters, it's shot differently, much along the lines of "Cloverfield", "Blair Witch Project" and "Dead of the Dead." This makes the film even better because it is much more realistic. <br /> <br /> But what won me was how the movie was about to show "the other side". Unlike "Elephant" you can find out these two shooters. I actually took care of one shooter and understood my actions and why they did what they did. This film makes you feel comfortable with these people and it is good because it is not always black and white. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I was almost shouting at this movie. Characters are real people whose logic and reasons are behind their actions. You can understand them. It's not like they want to kill people. In general, this film is emotionally engaging and very haunting and much better than "Elephant".
