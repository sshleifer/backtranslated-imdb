Riding Giants is an amazing movie. It really shows how these people just lived at that time. Their lives were mainly surfing, living, breathing and having fun. They didn't care about money, jobs, girls or anything else. Their girls had waves to them. I've never been on a surfboard and it seems so hard, I don't understand how they will stay on them, it doesn't make sense. This is a fantastic movie and if you love surfing, you should really see this movie. If you are a surffer and you want to find out who started surfing, how it came to life, who's really famous for it or whatever, then you should really see it. It can be a documentary, but it's really good. -Tara F.-
