I can't add so much to the very positive comments so far - great action, balanced writing, multifaceted signs, a great anti-hero in Tony, a great comment on a thousand-year-old American life. Comprehensive use of psychiatry with Tony's mother's problems is particularly fresh and humorous. Several other characters add a lot of depth - Hesh 's interesting history as an external muscle tumor, Ralphie' s complete irretrievable resentment, Chris' double desires in life, and so on. <br /> <br /> I have to dig some criticism, especially "it respects the violence / lets the Italian-Americans out." Most writers and actors are Italian-Americans, would they attack themselves? There are a number of positive Italian-American symbols - Artie Bucco, chef, Dr. Melfi and his family, and Cusamanos Sopranos in the neighborhood. Indeed, the former spouse of Dr Melf notes in the 1st season that only a small proportion of Italian-Americans have ever been mobile (certainly less than the proportion of African-Americans involved in the crime, I dare say. In both cases, poverty and deprivation) are the biggest reasons). <br /> <br /> Most signs don't really choose the life they have; family background or circumstances that are largely in the corner. Aliens (even Italian stocks) who are trying to integrate with it usually fill an irritating end - like Matthew and his friend in the 2nd season. If you criticize this exhibition, I assume that Frasier made you a psychiatrist or Will & Grace made you homosexual? Supposedly, you don't listen to rap music that speaks of gangs or r'n'b that speaks of indifference or rock music discussing drugs (or some other combination)? People are not as stupid as some of you. <br /> <br /> Not everything is perfect. Many characters have only appeared once if they should have logically seen or at least mentioned in previous episodes - Tracee dancer, Meadow's friend Ally, Uncle Junior's girlfriend (supposedly 20 years until they split in season 1).
