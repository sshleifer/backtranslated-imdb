A well-summarized summary of the actual event! Actually, I wasn't there, but I think that's the case. I think there are two typical American views in the film: "Communistophobia" and Parallels with Adolf Hitl. They should be obvious to most independent observers. Anyway, Boothe has excellent performance and so many other famous actors. The last twenty minutes of the movie are intolerable - and I mean it! Anyone who sleeps well after that is abnormal. (That's why it's so terrible - everything happened, and it probably seemed like that). But actually this last scene took place in the airspace?
