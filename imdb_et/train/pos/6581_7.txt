When I searched for Quo Vad in my local video store, I found this version of 1985, which seemed interesting. Wow! It was amazing! Ken Russell has a lot of filmmaking, stylized, very artistic and of course "different". Nero was presented not as an evil incarnation, but as a mad, unfulfilled emperor who would have been a circus career. He probably wondered why he was put on the "leading" empire - it was not fun and fun he wanted. Claude Maria Banda had a huge time with this role and it played all that was worth. Yes, Nero persecuted Christians with revenge; one of the many who did it. At one point, one of his henchmen will break: "No one will ever realize that we are just defending ourselves." He got that right.
