This series was like what you would expect from Mr.Spielberg. It's really one of those scary, funny and childish examples that you won't forget. Just like the outer borders (another big exhibition), this little series does what's not much. It was great and served longer. It was a great show for even the kids to see, although some exhibitions were a little scary when they wanted to, but they all had a moral (like the Twilight Zone), which made you realize what the situation you didn't want, or those what did you do. I remember looking at one of these Sci-fi when I was 10 years old, and even now, when I can, I still see them. A really fun, imaginative show. I loved it and still do it.
