I can't believe how many people hate Hal Sparks! He was my favorite musician, hands down. I hate celebrity rumors and generally dislike conversation, but when Hal Sparks hosted Talk Soup, it was for me a television. During my exercise, I rarely missed the episode and was sad when guest hosts started to cast (although most of the guests were still working hard). <br /> <br /> Anyway, for all people who don't like Hal Sparks, I imagine they never saw a weekend special offer. They were episodes of Talk Soup in the class that included the best clips of the week and were padded with comedy bits. The original bits that Hal Sparks did were fun. In one he was possessed by a bad comedy demon and in an exorcist scene he turned to head when he talked about dated jokes about airline food. One episode was dedicated to the entertainment of diversity, because the number of cloned Hal Sparks had to multiply through the episode, the studio ran over. <br /> <br /> OK, maybe they don't sound as funny as I describe them, but I know that, apart from Talk Soup, the only two examples I've been following through these years were Simpsons and Late Night Conan O'Brian. So if you like the comedy styles of these shows, you probably want to talk to Talk Soup during the Spalk years. <br /> <br /> Henson and Tyler were both big hosts. All three hosts brought something different on the table, but I think they were all beautiful comedians. Of course, throughout the years of Tyler and visibility, my interest in this exhibition began to drop, but every time and then I try The Soup, the spiritual successor of the show, and certainly enough that the new host may occasionally bring some pretty unexpected laughs Time, I'm long enough wasted to talk on television, which is no longer in the air and on the channel, which I generally disdain. Look at something else!
