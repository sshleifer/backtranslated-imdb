The film wasn't that big. The book is better. But the film wasn't that bad. At least it was interesting to say. There was enough tension on the plot to keep me looking, though I wouldn't say that the film itself interests me. Janine Turner and Antonio Sabato Jr are both proud to keep watching you :) They have a couple of cute scenes that should turn to a romantic party. In general, I'd give movie 7 or 8. It wasn't bad, just a little bit missing.
