It must be a unique double vision that has never been seen before. Huge monster movie genre with live mummy movie genre. This unique blend makes a unique and convincing story. Castings are outstanding, including TOM BOSLEY, who never knows before, ever. Impacts are impressive and the idea of ​​a small mummy from a giant mummy is cooler. My one complaint, I just wish we saw more giant mummy, but then I think they did a great job. Dialogue, characters, and story were perfect. Action was wonderful. This must be the best movie to get out of sci-fi. You heard me, the best movie to get out of sci-fi. I'll give FALLEN ONES 9 out of 10.
