Although this film is the best, it has been pulled out completely. This film must undoubtedly be considered a modern classic. Basically, there are two types of movies for me - depth movies (chicks flicks when you need to - I blame my wife for that) and frantic comedies where I can sit and relax. This movie is the last mentioned example. <br /> <br /> One of my friends turned to this movie right after it was released. Considering me a bit low, he said to me, "You have to see this movie. It's just your movie type." Without predicting the insult, I began to look. I know they mentioned Ramones a million times, but when you see them, I said, "Hey, it's Ramones." My friend replied, "I don't know they were a real band." I had a moment of my glory. <br /> <br /> This movie, although now somewhat dated, is for Ramones fans - or for someone else.
