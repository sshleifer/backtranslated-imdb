Critics are critical and financial flops when critics have come out for the first time and have announced that this film is the best director. La Ronde, like the film's feeling in the movie, is developing rapidly as the detective bureau boys (Ben Gazzara, John Ritter and Blaine Novak) live, fall in and love some of the most strange and beautiful films (Audrey Hepburn) Colleen Camp, Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hansen. A large part of the script was ad-libbed or rewritten on the day of shooting, giving the film a breeze. Ben Gazzara is great when the head detective persuades Audrey Hepburn after dropping the singer Colleen Camp and the cab driver Patti Hansen. John Ritter is following Dorothy Stratten wrong and loves him right away. Blaine Novak has a few girls with whom she rides (including Joyce Hyser and Elizabeth Pena). This movie has some great productions that have been cast. Standouts is Audrey Hepburn (she has no line in the first half of the movie). Ben Gazzara has never been better (and an inspiring choice for romantic leadership) and Colleen Campil is one of the best roles of mania country singer Christy Miller. She is happy to see her hit off during the delivery of her line-a-tat-tat. Highly recommended! ********* stars!
