I saw this video 15 years ago. I thought it was great and I still do. I am a former English teacher (high school and college) and an English romantic poet lover, so Coleridge appreciates me very much. Anything that can damage the poem or the power of the story will not get my top vote. In this case, everything works well to engage the viewer, especially high school students. The story is well illustrated for the generation that has grown on television. In addition, Michael Redgrave's voice adds authenticity and authority to it. Okay, so there was no big budget for the project. So it wasn't Star Wars and there is no CGI. But who can reject Gustave Dor√©'s illustrations in the presentation? The above comment, which on only four lines leaves the video as a trash, is extremely unfair and unlikely. I'm a manufacturer's friend, but that's not my comment. Rather, I defend the artistic work that I think is worth at all levels. It fits well to bring Coleridge's poem to students in a way that awakens their appreciation and awakens their sympathy for the lesson of the ancient sailor.
