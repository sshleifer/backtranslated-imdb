I was about 12 years old when I saw this classic "Casper friendly spirit". I thought it was early because Casper didn't see * right *, just like Porky Pig did not see the old 1930s caricature * better *. But I'll land it ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, this episode of a friendly phantom episode is friendly to her by the young fox she calls Ferdie. I remember being glad to see Casper have a friend because those who have been watching cartoons do not know that most people are driving away, shouting "Ghost!" <br /> <br /> Casper and Ferdie have fun together until someone else appears ... I don't want to leave you with a poop, but it's just seven minutes so you can't really be too vague. Moreover, anyone reading the IMDb summary of the comic can conclude what will happen next ... <br /> <br /> Finale is a bit heartbreaking. Actually, it's probably the saddest I've ever drawn. But that only means that he took me, which probably explains why I decided to comment on this particular copy and not very many others. Or heck, the fact that the GAME GAME SIGN this comic is due to his emotional influence on me - I haven't seen it. But the cartoon ends with an amazing comment and I was happy to see Casper and Ferdie happy. <br /> <br /> I would give this copy to 8 out of 10 stars. Secondly, the only Warner Bros. comic book "Peace on Earth" is the most that animated short has ever moved.
