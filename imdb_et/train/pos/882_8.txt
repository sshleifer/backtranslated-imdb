I chose this library and was very pleasantly surprised. Lots of intense, expressionist camera work, equally tight scripts and two great actors who put together to make a very fine movie. Not reptile for multiple brains, but rather a true admirer of cinema. If Hollywood ever has his clumsy hands, I'm sure it will destroy it. The choice heals the whole way. Other posters have sung more than a lot of praise, so I don't have to repeat my rides; just take your advice and go and don't miss this jewel. Call what you want; I call this two hours of entertainment well spent. Read my lips: don't miss it.
