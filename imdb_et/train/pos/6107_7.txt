After that I watched the movies ... I thought "why the hell was this movie so successful in the Korean Box Office?" Even thought that the film had a wise / unusal scenario, it didn't work so good and the characters were not very interesting. For the Korean movie ... I liked the fighting scenes. If you want to watch a movie without thinking, it's your movie. But I have to admit that ... the film was such childish ... 6/10
