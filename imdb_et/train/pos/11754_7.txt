Robin Williams is doing his best to combine comedy and stamens, but he gets a little bit. Donald Moffat is too much of a sign than his father. Jeff Bridges is a great, though four-legged, and Holly Palance and Pamela Reed are wonderful by carrying the movie through most of their harsh spots. It fills the time nicely but is a little more.
