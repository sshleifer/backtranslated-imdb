The old man who lives in the mountains wakes up one morning and loses his cat. He is witnessing a murder in the forest, but did he see the murder or lose his mind? Is he just getting older? The film is so big that the viewer is thinking about what's going on. There's very little dialogue in this movie, but it doesn't need words, the whole movie speaks for itself. You knew what was going on and I liked it. <br /> <br /> The second part I liked was the forests long in the autumn and winter. They were pretty, but the only thing I didn't like was the old man's view of his underwear. He could have tied the kitchen a little narrower, but not that, it was a pretty deep film.
