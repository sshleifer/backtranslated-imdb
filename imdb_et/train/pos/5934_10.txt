I'm sorry to say that I have no idea what Hollywood is doing. Of course give us movies like Batman Begins. Oh, by the way, Hollywood thinks they might include the Batman movie story, but please don't care what we would like to see with Batman and Superman. I really hated this trailer because it was more for me. I looked around to see when it came out. It was like a terrible practical joke. The graphics where the story was good seemed solid and had all the tricks of the great movie. Unfortunately, this is not happening now. Manufacturers, directors and all participants have a good job, but I hate you to do it to me. You left me more.
