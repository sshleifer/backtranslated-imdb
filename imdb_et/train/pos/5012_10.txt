In April 1965, CBS broadcasted the first monumental TV shows by Barbra Streisand. The exhibition was not only a success for current ratings, but also a 5 Emmy award. It is one of the most memorable moments of television in the 1960s and (unfortunately) the kind of television that they no longer produce. This special is a great view and Barbra's outstanding performance, which is of interest to every Streisand fan and everyone from early television.
