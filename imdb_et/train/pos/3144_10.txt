This is one of the best comedies ever on television. Season one was fun like most of the following seasons. The only reason I show this example is 9/10 due to a failed last season. The only good part of the final season was the final. My favorite part of this show was scenes that cut people's imagination, often featuring famous TV shows or 70's movies. It is a rare show that I liked every character (except for the last season ... too late to try to develop a new character and fez wasn't nearly as funny). The red mouth in his ass's comments never got old or Kelso's stupidity. For the Bravo Fox to keep it so good, for too long, even a good example.
