It's been one of my favorite films for a long time. Recently, I was pleased to see this DVD, which is a relief to old VHS versions. <br /> <br /> I hadn't seen it for years and looked at it today to find myself surprised at how well the movie is timed. This is one of those rare, perfect comedy storms, where great writing (a really funny line after a really funny line) is combined with great direction and great performances at the same time. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore received Oscar nomination for "Arthur" but lost (though John Gielgud won the best supporting actor). When Moore's performance "Arthur" does not win the best actor Oscar proof that no comic actor could ever win the title (another example is Gene Wilder "Young Frankenstein"). <br /> <br /> Steve Gordon looks at the film beautifully, keeping every character and story warm. Just, IMHO film is a rare gem. It is only sad that Steve Gordon died only a year after the release of Arthur. <br /> <br /> With the DVD available since 2007, this is the case. Although video quality is a leap over old VHS copies, there is not yet a widescreen version available. <br /> <br /> The DVD has some extras that are nice, but it's not enough. One example is the comment of the director, in which he stated how he wanted certain deleted keys and scenes to be included (because they were hysterical), but that he had to make difficult choices for final editing. A DVD that is the perfect form of adding such material would certainly have had to offer it. <br /> <br /> This original "Arthur" is a classic comedy that is one of the books.
