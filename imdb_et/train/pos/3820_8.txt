This is the story of Shin-ae, who moves from Seoul to Milyang with his little son Jun to start after his husband's accidental death. Her husband was born here and opens a piano school, but there are also ambitions to have some land with the insurance money she's got from death. If this is the film, it would probably have been like a Hollywood film where he fell against a local boy and would be happy with his son in his new home. But that's not Hollywood. His son is abducted and murdered seemingly because he is known to have money in the billing. The sad process, the attempts to move forward, the attempts to make your consciousness unclear are all admirable and the leading actor is great. The only warning to note is that it is a depressing film. You need to know that it goes in. You want Shin-ae to go through his grief and find some luck. Again, it's not Hollywood, it's Korean and Korean cinema, especially drama, they don't pull the strokes. Life has happened to you. Great actors, but sometimes also a tough movie that needs to be seen. If you stay, you will get a reward. Do it.
