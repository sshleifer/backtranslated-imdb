"Bend It Like Beckham" is a film that has had little contact with the United States. This was probably due to the fact that the film was strongly in British dialogue and terminology and dealt with a lot of football (here football), some of which may have problems in the US. This is unfortunate because this film is absolutely fantastic and deserves much more coverage here. I think the story is based on (dream) what many people can associate with and finally, "Bend It Like Beckham" is a happy movie with a source of inspiration and a really good actor. I was not too excited about the initial vision of this movie, but now I do not lose sight of it. I highly recommend this movie!
