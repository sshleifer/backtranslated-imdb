All the people who watch this movie and probably many professional filmmakers just don't get it. This film was made with matting sequences and art techniques similar to those of the great Czech filmmaker Karel Zeman. If you want to know what I'm talking about, I suggest you get any Zeman movie, such as Jules Verne Fabulous World, Baron Munchausen, Journey to the Beginning, or On Comet. If you can't find a movie, read AMG comments. They explain the processes used. If someone looked at Zeman's work and attempted to compare it with some other sci / fi fantasy film of that time, the viewers would probably not have received it either. It is unfair to compare either of these filmmakers' styles with the standard technologies of the day, as both Zemen and Hines do not "count". They have a unique style for them, which should only be evaluated for their creativity. If you look at this film from the point where you know that it has deliberately tried to create a collage of matt mixed with living activities, you can easily come to the conclusion that it did a masterful job. It's not easy to do a lot of computer shutdowns. I thought the creatures were pretty good, also considering the way they were created. The Chinese took a big game of luck and I think his film is not fairly understood for years. Anyone who promotes the movie should have hanged out on what they would see instead of letting them go in the dark theater, waiting for the usual CG work. As for the actors, I think Hines also took the page from Zemeni's book, as many of Zemeni's actors were somewhat expressive in the beginning, but became much more involved as the film and action continued. This is a completely refreshing film for me in my library. I look at it for years, all three great hours.
