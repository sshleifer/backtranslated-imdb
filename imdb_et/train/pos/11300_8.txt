Ossessione <br /> <br /> The debut feature of Luchino Visconti, this Italian noir, has usually been the start of a neo-realistic movement - well, it says so directly on the back of the box - and is sometimes a penetrating, sometimes brilliant portrait of the moral flow of individuals. The Fascist choice in Italy with supportive characters, including the Communist virtues, is a distant desperation for the country seeking its own identity without having to breathe. Although Visconti's compassion for the injustices and his ability to express his lying conditions was already well developed, the spider's net is frail - although the staff of the young man is to put a fate and manipulated femme fatale, Gino is so persistent that you are deserving it - cosmic irony too didactic, illegal relationship with stiff baths. At the same time, it is sharp and important, although its actual impact on film history is certainly debatable.
