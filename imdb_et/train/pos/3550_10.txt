It was this musical genre. Humor, talent, romance and action all rolled into one. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra was wonderful. There is nothing else to say. Although Marlon Brando is not a singer, she did a great job of winning many hearts with her Sky Masterson. The fact that he was unable to sing added his character. The women in the movie were all right, but the men in the movie stole the show for sure. <br /> <br /> This is a real classic that can be rated at any age. It connects all audiences and smiles and smiles. <br /> <br /> Be sure to watch and enjoy the movie!
