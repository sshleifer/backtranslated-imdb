Everything was shown on television before it disappeared. You could predict who dies or who finds something, but in Lost, you could predict something. Every thing was so surprisingly stunning and it was really a secret not because it had so many secrets, but because there was nothing like that before everything was so big. I was literally addicted. LOST is a classic work of art. It gives you something to expect every week. It's a genius. The area is great, it's calm and warm on the beach and so scary in the jungle. The characters are the genius that each of them is especially on the island. They are so dramatic, but we can never predict their death because they have so much to do and to say much more, and they have secrets that affect the other dead.
