I have to throw my two cents away. Relax, it's comedy. Yes, in most cases, the characters are widely written and acted. I don't think of the many comedies they're not. It's not a new edition, it's on video and cable almost every week. Can I see it in the theater? Of course, I did when he first came out. It's funny ... it should be enough. <br /> <br /> Even if I didn't like it at all, I would still look at Michael Keaton's cable. He is an undervalued and undervalued actor. I can't think of someone who is so capable in every genre. Nor can I think of who is as successful. Comedic actress who is also an action star (short but still) who is also a romantic leader who is also a dramatic actor; villain and hero. I can't think, at least not in Hollywood. There is certainly no one who has been successful in all these genres. I mean there is Tom Cruise, but for me it is better for Tom Cruise than being. But this is not between Michael Keaton and Tom Cruise, so I'm going ahead. <br /> <br /> Gung Ho is worth renting. Wal-Mart. It's worth looking at the cable (if you have a cable or satellite). It's one of the fun to watch movies. You can pause your brain and just relax and break. <br /> <br /> Asking more, in my honest opinion, is asking too much.
