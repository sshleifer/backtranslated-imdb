I hate redundant French movies, but my favorite movie is the longest and most fruitful French film of all time. I saw it twice in the mid-1970s and then disappeared. But finally I could see again in 1999 and fell in love again. The most remarkable thing is that it looks as fresh today as 25 years ago. If you haven't seen it, don't miss your chance!
