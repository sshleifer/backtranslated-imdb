Good movie and one that I watch several times. Rich (previous commentator) is right: there is much more to this than is clear from the title, and I have to think about how much the translation has suffered. Was there more in the original? Or was it expected that the native audience would hear more? Or - since the script is written by the author of the novel on which it is based - was it a popular story at the moment, which the audience was already familiar with? In short, it is worth looking at, but apparently it needs more work from contemporary viewers than the original 1913 audience. <br /> <br /> The Alpha Video Edition brings a new organ, but music is in no way suited to the story progress. Of course, it starts promising, but degenerates into a repetitive Phillip-Glass-like monotony that does not reflect anything on the screen. After some time listening, I turned off the sound and just watched: much better!
