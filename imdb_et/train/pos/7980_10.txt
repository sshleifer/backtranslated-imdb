Man On Fire tells a story of a former Special Forces man who has a drink problem and who accepts work as a personal bodyguard of a small girl in Mexico during a wave of ransom resurrection. At first he is not friendly, but then they communicate with each other, he decides to stop drinking, and so on. Etc. One day he gets robbed ... and killed ... <br /> <br /> And He doesn't stop for revenge. <br /> <br /> This is basically the story of Man On Fire, but is waiting for some big twists at least a few times, including the end that is beautiful and obviously it is because Harry-Gregson Williams is with music, composed of Lisa Gerrard (Gladiator). <br /> <br /> But the strongest part of the movie ... wait ... the thing is that everything here is perfect. <br /> <br /> First action. Denzel Washington is her best, Mickey Rourke and Christopher Walken always good, great Radtha Mitchell and AMAZING young Dakota Fanning. And this is not the end of the list ... <br /> <br /> Then the dazzling cinematic art comes on, and with excellent editing, be sure to Oscar. <br /> <br /> The story is ... not just a revenge movie. The story is smart, the story makes you think ... and is beautiful. Really. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies you must see at least once in your life!
