Robert Wuhl at the University of New York teaches a class of film students at New York University. <br /> <br /> It covers history and truth that are no longer well known. I would like to see much more about this exhibition. It's a lot of fun. Mr. Wuhl uses examples and "show and say" to get his points over. He explained that Paul Revere's midnight passenger was not Paul Revere! Henry Wadsworth Longfellow used Revere's name because it sounded better. <br /> <br /> I've been watching Robert Wuhl for years, since he made a stand-up comedy and all the time at Arli $$ HBO. She is a good actor and a good stand-up comedian but she is a great teacher! I suggest you watch the episode of this exhibition. It's worth your time.
