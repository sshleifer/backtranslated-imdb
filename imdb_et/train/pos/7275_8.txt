No Strings Carlos Mencia is added to make a stand-up that makes us laugh and think. Not only does he abduct racial issues (like many hate speeches), he also talks about how to get illegal immigrants out of the country ... what women think when they say they want equal treatment ... why Americans are sharper with Arab terrorists. .. why no one has to pray for the pope - and what he hopes his sky will do ... the theory of how Easter (aka Big Ups for Jesus Day) began ... watching his movie "Passionate Christ" - and his sub- another argument with a woman about whether Jesus is influencing her ... how society should treat physically disabled people ... and even if you have the right to say no or not. <br /> <br /> He never needs to remind us that we all have a voice. So we should use it to tell the truth, say what we mean, and not be afraid when others are offended. <br /> <br /> Carlos is a bomb.
