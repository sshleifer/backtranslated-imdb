I saw this movie for the first time about ten years ago and I thought it was really funny. It was not as bad as some critics did. The fact that it is usually written by a trusted John Hughes shows that you can at least wait for a funny dialogue. (By the way, I also think that Weird Science is quite good at what Hughes did with flash speed). etc. - which makes it quite unique. The cast is also quite good. Dirty Bunny Packard and the Delores Salk in Devil's eyes are outstanding.
