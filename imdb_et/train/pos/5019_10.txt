Hi <br /> <br /> My name is Jessica, I'm Italian! <br /> <br /> Some time ago I've seen this movie: "First Time", with Corin Corky Nemec. It was a story about Micheal and Mary Margaret. I need to know the title of the most important love scene song in Michelle's bedroom. <br /> <br /> In Italy, this movie hasn't been programmed for years and I don't know how to find this song. Many thanks for who can help me! I love this movie! It is very romantic! The soundtrack is beautiful! I love Cheryl Pollack! Jessica
