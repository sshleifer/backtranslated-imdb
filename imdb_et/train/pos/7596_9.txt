The first episode gave an immediate impression of what to expect from the series! Mysteries that are waiting for resolution and lots of good drama! I love the fact that they are gradually revealing character stories! Just explain to stay exciting! Of course, this exhibition has some drawbacks! In the first two series, there are some characters that for some reason did not appear in the third season! Many characters have good sending, but some of them aren't just there! Like Rose and her husband! Where the hell are they? What happened to them? Maybe they will return later! But it's a bit controversial! This means that "lost" will succeed in every episode (especially the first two seasons)! It's a very difficult thing! I note that the third season focuses more on character development than on the secrets of the show! It's not bad! It even saves some episodes of boredom! One of the elements that can be considered the strength of this exhibition is the wonderful characters! You grow to love these characters! Good or bad! But finally I want to see some mysteries that need to be solved and closed! Reducing the risk of "lost" danger is close! And it would be devastating!
