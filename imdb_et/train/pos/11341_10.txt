It may be the most nostalgic time back and over time, when childhood begins the journey back and forth, back and forth, up and down & all around. Boy Jimmy, H.R. Puffinstuff, Dr.Blinky, Cling & Clang, a glossy lion and even evil Witchie Poo too over and over. The last day inspires Lidsville, "The Brady Kids Saturday morning preview" Sigmund & Sea Monsters and Land lost as new and old as what it shows, and the gap to both Donny & Marie, Brady Bunch Varour Hour or Brady Bunch Hour and even Paul Lynde's Halloween special offer. Perhaps even other things between & Beyond Buck will just move on & on & even beyond expectations and unexpected limits. Now as we update in March '06 we know that Jack Wild has gone and so now it makes it even more symbolic that we really do we get nostalgic. From August '06, when Jack Wild's visitor celebrates himself in Sigmund and Sea Monsters, and when the last episode makes HRPuffinstuff and resembles all the nostalgic tours of all Syd & Marty Kroft characters, including The HRPuffinstuff Goodtime Club, The Donny and Marie Show, Brady Bunch Variety Hour or Brady Bunch Hour etc. Indeed, Stephen "Steve" G. Baer is "Ste" of Framingham, Ma.USA.
