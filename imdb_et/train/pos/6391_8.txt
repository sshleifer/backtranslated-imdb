Caught this movie at the Arizona International Film Festival. I didn't expect much (although the festival director told me it was one of the best films presented). Five minutes to sell it. This movie is a fun and buggy budget. The action is certain, the writing is sure and the film's appearance is strong. The actor is probably the greatest revelation because most of the low budget films tend to be amateur or stage productions. Not that. It has one of the most convincing, pleasurable and funniest images featuring the Tourette syndrome I've ever seen. The plot is twisted without being confusing and dirty without being free. If you have a chance, check out this movie. Filmmakers like Majkowski (I hope I got this right) deserve the opportunity to raise their affairs to a wider audience.
