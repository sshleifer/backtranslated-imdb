Jon Voight is great at midnight in Cowboy, but Hoffman's performance, though reminiscent of his later move in Rainman, is one that keeps me watching movies. As a feature of New York, only Daniel Day Lewis's image of Bill Butcher is similar to New York's gangs, and the day does not give its character the emotional depth that Hoffman gives to Ratso. <br /> <br /> This is typical of Hoffman's behavior, which the actor we most often identify with Midnight Cowboy is Voight. I think Hoffman is one of the four or five best actors in the history of the film, playing the people around him so that he dramatically raises his performances beyond normal levels. <br /> <br /> Voight's Buck is so naive for him to swim out of the movie, except that Ratso pulls him down - pulls him down, but also teaches him how to survive and more importantly how to live . Midnight Cowboy is a film that talks about the escape that turns into finding the film itself. I think, like this is a sharp film, this is a very beautiful message that no matter how much loser you are (Ratso clearly defines "loser"), if you find yourself doing the right thing you have the secret of life and you may it may even be possible to share this understanding with others. <br /> <br /> I can't compare Midnight Cowboy with Klut, since a few years later, which I think is a film about myself that turns out to be a movie.
