I would like to know why John Amos left the show and how did he die again from the show? I could not associate everything, but sometimes they encountered the problems they were facing. By the way, did they make it out of the ghetto? I think the black episode of Jesus was my favorite. We have to see them for a couple of good times. something they didn't have very often. I wish they would bring the exhibition back. People can actually watch during the day. I don't think a movie or a new show would work. Especially without the original cast. They are actually the ones that made Good Times GoodTimes. These are my questions and comments. Thanks !!
