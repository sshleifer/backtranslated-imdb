Like Ishtar and the comedy king, the other big, misunderstood comedies, Envyl has two big, mostly acting actors, losers (may be too harsh words, I invite them to suburban minors). This movie was a pearl of dark comedy and I'm not sure what people expect. I know a great studio comedy that is obviously not full of humor, and I believe that the little moments of this movie make it worth it. Seeing Stiller's face when he sees the dog doo for the first time, disappears from the moment most people should be able to recognize themselves. Yes, it was a fairly simple story, but studied the root of envy in a really interesting way. There were many great scenes (J-Man's abandoning "salon by the lake", Corky's burial, the role of Weit's wife and Jenny's Walken - all great things. <br /> <br /> t stand for people who get to IMDb and ruthlessly trash if they have absolutely no idea what it needs.I take Envy for almost the top ten comedies of almost every year (except Napoleon Dynamite) and a fun, enjoyable pearl. <br /> <br /> Remember this people, most of the times, popular is not equal to Good.
