Unexpected pleasure because I didn't hear anything about this movie. <br /> <br /> Disgraceful because it requires a wider audience. <br /> <br /> An excellent humane story with a social message gently, though predictable in the resolution. Basically acted. Beautifully captured with gray-toned colors that remain in the film's nostalgic tone. <br /> <br /> My last invasion of Chinese film (shower, home, no less) has been fascinating, which I hope to continue exploring. China and its people are an amazing canvas for filmmakers. The "mask king" can be a highly recommended starting point for anyone interested in recent Chinese film. <br /> <br />
