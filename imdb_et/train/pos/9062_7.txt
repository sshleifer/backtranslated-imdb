it's a weekend I've been watching this funny movie. and I like it. All the children are cute, reminding me of their childhood with these stupid thoughts. This is a real fun movie for family members over the weekend that can make a lot of memories and laughs. Child's humor always works. nice to act. a simple story, but cool shooting. a beautiful job for a director to find a child's way. when it comes to a child's movie, I think it's "12 and possession". one more this year, but different from the world of the child, which is real and cruel. awesome work. H2EFW focuses on the happy side of childhood that every child and family needs. ps.s. I think Twitch is Nemo's voice on "Finding Nemo".
