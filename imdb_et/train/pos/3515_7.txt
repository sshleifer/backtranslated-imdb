A pretty good picture that a man is at the wrong time at the wrong time. If the murderer wanted to worship, why not just let him down and let the police try to figure it out? Including all of these characters in the plot is dangerous, not to mention all the mouths you should worry about to stick with. Why did a depressed lady go to the bar when she barely sat in a chair or say a word? Are there really police officers who are clever crackers, gums opening, stacking monkeys approaching the suspect in this way? It probably did well back before the wheel was invented, but it is so terrible and unbelievable today. Try the Elisha Cook Mania Drum Break; his outrageous hammering never responded to the recording. His crazy facial expressions made for synchronization.
