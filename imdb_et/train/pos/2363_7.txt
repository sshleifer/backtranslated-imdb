This story of MR James on the "Hill of the Hill" was first released in 2005 on British television for the first time on the BBC's digital channel 4. I saw that it was repeated in BBC 4 and decided to give it a go, remembering the BBC's successful adjustments of the 1970s to others MR James's stories, including "Whistle and I Will Get You My Wife" and "Signal Commander". Although this masterpiece is not in the same class, the "Mountain View" is a pleasant and sometimes stopping drama. <br /> <br /> The historian arrives in a small rural area to watch all of the recently dead antique furniture. While on the terrain, he sees a monastery that has been in ruins for hundreds of years. But what about this pair of old binoculars and a terrifying legend of Gallows Hill? And what brusque country squire and his servant will know about this situation? Although I wasn't scary in any way, I enjoyed this little production, and if the driving time was over 40 minutes, it would have become a really big adaptation. As everything is, it seems that everyone is a bit hurried and a little more exposure to set the mood would have been appreciated. <br /> <br /> I'll give him 7 out of 10.
