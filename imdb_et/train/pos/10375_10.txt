Country Boy Aussie Rules Player (Mat) goes to the city at night before an important AFL trial where his cousin has to take him. And then things go wrong. <br /> <br /> His non-hobby cousin has been mixed into a drug store that includes local loan-shark / drug dealer Tinyi (who looks like all gangsters but is ultimately Australian). Needless to say, Mat gets into a chaos and it won't be long before the thoughts of tomorrow's game are attacked, because at night the frenzied events will unravel. <br /> <br /> Toby Malone, a professional western Australian professional Shakespearean, puts a woman's female female Mati on a ridiculous play and plays a role that is well below her age. The best support comes from John Batchelor as an entertaining role for Tiny and David Ngoombujar as one of the policemen who follow the events. Role is fast paced, often funny and profitable.
