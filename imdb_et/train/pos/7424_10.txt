I was 16 when I first saw the movie, and it has always been my favorite. Of course, you can't deny that Kristofferson's complaint in the movie - HOW IS ATTENTION WE ???????????? Sheesh. He's still there. He's a bad guy, every woman secretly wants. His behavior is flawless. He only drunk in drunken / narcotics how somebody who really went through could - and he had finally completed a wagon in 76, so it was very real. <br /> <br /> Music is LARGE and although in later years I thought Streisand wasn't the right person for him in terms of physical beauty, I think it's more for men than for woman. We're just looking at Kris - and of course the boys are looking at the woman's interest - my husband can't watch his movie b / c - he doesn't like his appearance. But until the end of the session I just made a red Ferrari scene so she saw how well it was done - the camera's work was so perfect and you were in the car with her blasting - you should have seen it in my 50-inch plasma WOW! !!! Finally, the transmission quality was GREAT - anamorphic widescreen and really clear, high color and very low noise, except for dark areas that are normal for all movies. <br /> <br /> Back some great memories from my mother and I love this movie together, I bought her a copy for Christmas. Would I have wanted to see it together last night. <br /> <br /> I have tried to sit with Judy Garland, but I think I can see it for the first time, I can't get into an earlier era. In the '76 version, watching the concert material was as much as I lived in time. <br /> <br /> I work in my Streisant commentary, but it looks like she's just talking about her and so far she has hardly even mentioned the details of Kris or movie scenes. His voice sounds exactly the same as then. <br /> <br /> Check if you grew up in the same era as me (born in 1960) then love it. <br /> <br /> Wendy
