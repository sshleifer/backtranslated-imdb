This is a movie in Antonion's mid-term, which most critics are quick to release, as it is a "faulty" look at the 60's American youth culture / politics. What's worth, I found it more touching and memorable than his recognized films like L'AVVENTURA, perhaps because he shows more emotions and empathy here than anywhere else. The story is simple, but it is used as a framework for Antonion's brilliant observations and the American consumer culture, student life, counterculture and the all-important anti-war, anti-war rebound. <br /> <br /> Even from a purely technical point of view, this is a remarkably made film; from the opening of the credit sequence to the odd desert "love-in" to use the billboards, and down to the jaw-fall, katartic finale, which used 17 camera settings (this is its own way, as powerful as the climax)). Antonion also chose one hell with Daria Halperin, who was one of the most beautiful ever to enjoy the screen. There is not much "acting" because it seems to be rather a docu-drama, as well as the use of non-professionals, because the lead pair works in this context quite effectively. And the soundtrack is not only full of wonderful music, but its use is impressive (the beginning of the movie cannot be forgotten, mainly thanks to the choice of music - Pink Floyd, who carries the visuals so well). br /> <br /> Contrary to popular belief, it is a very good achievement in the cinema, and I would like to recommend someone who has a taste or tolerance. It is worth looking for, and one of the 60's main films that requires DVD recovery / release.
