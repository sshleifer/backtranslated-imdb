John Thaw, Inspector Morse's celebrity, plays in this movie with old Tom Oakley. Tom lives in 1939 at the beginning of a small English village and World War II. Somewhat extraordinary, Tom has not yet recovered from the death of his wife and son when he served during the First World War. If you can imagine Morse, an inspector, old and retired, twice as big as a policeman, you have a Tom Oakley character. <br /> <br /> But this heart of the slate begins to melt. London children are evacuated in advance. Young William (Willie) Beech is protesting with Tom. Willie plays well with Nick Robinson. <br /> <br /> This boy needs care in the capital C. Behind the school, still wetting and reading the bed is the smallest problem. He comes from a terrifying background in London, where a mother who can't cope can easily say. <br /> <br /> Slowly but steadily, man and boy warm up each other. Tom finds his ability to love and care again. And the boy learns to accept that love and care. See Tom and Willie at the end of their garden with a bombshell. See Willie's joy over what Tom's probably his first birthday party has been throwing away. <br /> <br /> Ending the End, but Tom has adopted Tom after a great fight, and the couple will start a new life much richer for their movie, followed by long movies where a person meets a boy and develops mutual love. See "Spanish gardener" by Dirk Bogarde and Jon Whiteley. Or Clark Gable and Carlo Angeletti "Started in Naples". Or Robert Ulrich and Kenny Vadas "Captain's Bravery". Or Mel Gibson and Nick Stahl "Man Without Face". <br /> <br /> Two Points of Interest. This is Thaw's only look I know where he sings. Only verse from the anthem, New Jerusalem, but he sings. <br /> <br /> Secondly, young Robinson also played in another movie, "Tom" titled "Tom's Midnight Garden," based on the classic children's novel.
