The film looked like "Immoral Study". I probably never participated in the burning need of a female artist to make her dead and so all the noise "Now, who pulled this penis?" sounded a little free. The dialogues of this movie are quite terrible, although visually, this movie is in its moments. I almost dig it when Tassi got a mental picture, but then filmed again in the penis. Highly recommended for those who haven't seen it for a while.
