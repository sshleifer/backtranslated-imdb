Nicholas Cage's strong, quiet hero, Dennis Hopper as a maniac of killing, Lara Flynn Boyle as a vampire / trampoline and late, pained J.T. Walsh as hard. These are the types of roles that these four can sleep, and they have done so often to see that they are playing on the border again. With the relief that John Dahl, the master who got a little mood, drew this nuanced noirish thriller. Hopper manages to keep up, Cage shows a little deeper than his usual superficial heroes, Boyle is a strange, innocent and bright, and one gets a sense of soul hard iron that is central to his character, Wayne. The Dahl direction gives the feeling of the nonsense of the Big Sky country, where the story takes place, while being intimate enough to show how the wrinkled frost can show the plot's radical change in stock. The plot twists are top-notch and one of the other major changes in this film is that some supportive characters actually work as if they had a brain. Often, small characters, such as sheriff deputies, do not have more brain than their main organizers. But if the director is as smart as Dahl, you shouldn't surprise me about this movie. Great movie.
