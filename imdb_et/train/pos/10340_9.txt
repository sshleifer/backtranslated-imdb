Even though this movie appeared a year before the birth, it is definitely one of my favorite comedies. He marks Redd Foxx as a father who tries to understand his son's homosexuality. Like most parents, he does not know what it means to be gay and has all those stereotypical thoughts about gay people. His son Norman has now grown and lived independently. When his father Ben discovers that his son is gay, he pays for his son the hope of a visit. The title comes from one of the most funny lines in the film - when Ben gets into Norman's apartments, he gets into a prostitute and thinks his son is dragged ("Norman ... is that you?"). The film was directed from start to finish. Redd Foxx is great. Although a lot of content is stereotypical, I didn't find anything offensive about the way the material is handled and even has a good ending. Highly recommended.
