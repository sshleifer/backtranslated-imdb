This is a pearl, a real piece of Americana that means. If you are programmed to stand up to "viable" stories, just leave away and delight the rest of the people who still believe. And what makes the frosting of the cake really delightful is that it is based on real gaps in wealth, without having to choose what details to make a compact story. Chris Cooper is one of the biggest living actors, and the complicated, contradictory, lower line he imagined can be successfully drawn by someone with his skills and knowledge. Simple minded comments that refuse to accept a father who tries to set the law all the time, signaling that he may be on the track, revealing a commentator, not a restriction on writers or actors. It's not cynical or simple thinking.
