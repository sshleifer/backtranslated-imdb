Think again of those who think that anime is almost giant reptiles who rape schoolgirls. Japanese animation is completely different. Yakitate! Japan is one of them. This is a sweet-natural story of a young shop with a gift for making delicious bread. His universe is all about creating Japanese bread that fits the famous European breads. The show is as good as they come and I'm sure non-Japanese viewers will miss a lot of fun. But it is still very nice to see, because the exhibition is completely innocent. <br /> <br /> Yakitate in the world! it is not unusual for people to look like they have had an orgasm when eating bread. Bread is hallucination and can give the consumer a wide range of super powers, ranging from travel as fish. This strange aspect makes it one of the least predictable and funny examples I've been watching for some time.
