I saw this movie for the first time in 25 years ago on British television and just got back on the DVD copy of the DVD purchased last week with eBay. I had remembered musical sequences, colors and gorgeous fashion discs and clothes, but the plot is weaker than before Anna Neagle / Michael Wilding's film in Spring Park Lane and Maytime doesn't look so good that over the years. But Michael Wilding is the joy of the movie, charming, funny, puzzling, seems to be very fun and on top of his form. It's worth looking at her alone. Anna Neagle seems to be a little mattressed next to her and a little too old for the part she plays, but by the end of the 1940s their film partnership had become public. Spring Lane Spring was a great hit and a big money maker in 1947. In his autobiography, Wilding for a long time wrote his great respect for Herbert Wilcox as director and initiator of this London film series.
