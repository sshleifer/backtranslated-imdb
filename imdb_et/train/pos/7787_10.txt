This film records the nature of young girls growing in the small town of America. The reality and subtle nuances offered by Ruby, the character of Ashley Judd, are only captured by what can be described as a real life device in Florida. From the closing of the screen to the absence of the work, the "red neck rival" gives what life really likes. Paradise was not easy. But he slowly overcomes obstacles and deception and learns to be his wife with the power that flows from within. Ashley Judd's winning smile and infectious diseases are the source of warmth and admiration and admiration. The cautious pace of the development of the characters is similar to that of "Ulee Gold" in 1997, starring Peter Fonda, and also director Victor Nunez.
