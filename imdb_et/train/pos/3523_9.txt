A strange and brilliant combination of talent between the director, Robert Siodmak and Ella Raines, the secretary, who is trying to save his boss from electric chairs by observing the mysterious "phantom" woman and Franchot Tone as a mad and murder sculptor. There are also some interesting smaller parts that are played by Elisha Cook Jr as a drumming drum, as well as other characters forming part of the conspiracy. If you are used to seeing Raines' healthier parts, then he is allowed to go overboard here, especially in Cook's scenes. Franchot Tone also plays very differently, and although it is not a convincing part, he acts phenomenally. Although the conspiracy is too exhausted, the film has a real atmosphere and is very interesting.
