I just went back a couple of hours ago for screening and I was very pleased with the movie's departure. It is very intense and the closest I have come to cry for a while. This is a credit for Adam Sandler, who offers great results at many levels and is likely to deserve an Oscar nomination if it doesn't come out early this year. Don Cheadle gives his usual excellent performance, playing the Adam's disturbed straight man. Don is trying to help her. Adam plays two levels very well ... if he is spiritually stable, he is funny and pleasant, but when he is, he is more stable, powerful and dark. spiritual dramas of heavy friendship and loss.
