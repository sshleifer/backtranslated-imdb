Tweedy professors-types thought they had all understood it. Today's peoples, living in Polynesia, originate from migratory Asians, moving far from the Far East, from the island to the island, east of Tahiti and all other exotic tropical islands in the South Pacific for thousands of years. But mature thinking just didn't sit well with the young Norwegian ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl. If this explanation were true, how do people born and raised on these islands have traditions, works of art and physical qualities that are not similar to those of Asia, but of South America? How can Ecuadorian, Peruvian and Chilean flora look as much as you can on the island for several thousand miles? Is it just a coincidence that the islanders point to the sea towards South America and say that their ancestors, led by Tiki, came from them to Adam? In the meantime, the Norwegians speak of their Scandinavian predecessors, who were colonized from the South American continent, and together with some of the local people they were friendly with, they went over to the Sea Headquarters WEST? It's too much to be a coincidence with Heyerdahl. With an amazing array of moxie, a handful of crew members and local know-how to build a traditional ferry, an expedition begins. It is as much a journey to the imagination of the human being as it is a pseudo-scientific demonstration that such a trip is only possible with the tools and the fundamentals of the sea. The Oscar winning documentary can come from its tone and Anglo-Ethnocentric approach, but it rises with an adventure spirit that brings even a decade of launching a space program because men are willing to take the risk of testing the theory they think is true. Wonderful. Do yourself a favor and read the book for the first time. It is an amazing page racing and the perfect setting for a newsletter-style movie.
