so in the middle of the season I got to school and my activities I didn't know was that the show was half-canceled, which is nonsense. <br /> <br /> I think the followers of this show should write a fox and ask them at least to stop filming so that the season can later be released on DVD. Suddenly they see how many people were disappointed that the show didn't live during their first season. <br /> <br /> I loved this example and waited for it every Thursday after the OC. can you imagine your frustration when I came back to show you a sample to find that it was gone? Needless to say, I'm not very happy with the fox now. even more, after discovering that NO ENDING WAS FILMED was. I mean, if you work on a project, at least stop it to see what happens. The side-filmed exhibition is like a semi-car, it's pretty much useless. Fox, film the end of the fuck and give some fans of the show peace.
