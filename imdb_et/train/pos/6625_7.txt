If you've ever seen the movie "The Recruit" with Colin Farrell and Al Pacino, you never have to see this movie. Unfortunately, Renaissance has had similar trailer trailers. <br /> <br /> The Renaissance story is about a detective exploring the kidnapping of a young woman and a medical scientist. The device is a futuristic Paris and all the elements of fiction. But the special thing about Renaissance is its visual style, not the story. Renaissance is a 3D computer animation, like Final Fantasy, but is stylized in very black and ultra sharp contrast. The result seems to be stunning (though 3D animation problems are still noticeable: lightly robotic movements, slightly wooden facials, etc.). visually. However, the story and writing are not exactly the same as visual. It's not a bad story (and probably, if you haven't seen a trailer, it's much more exciting than for me). But this is a story that is not very original, and the edges of the corridor. A few lines of dialogue were painfully funny, making the sound of writing the first effort of the beginner. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend to Renaissance friends. This is, unlike what I have seen, visually, and I believe that its originality alone makes it a worthwhile experience. It's also a traceable story, even if it's not perfect.
