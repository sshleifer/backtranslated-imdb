it's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. it was this raw moment, but they were full of charm. this is the Altmanesque scenario, brilliant physical humor and relaxed friendships were a joy to watch, and most of us will be part of this life. and I can honestly say I was afraid of Steve Carelli's nipple ... I was really. Surprisingly, it is a good-natured, uncashed comedy that is essentially about love and the many relationships we may have. Catherine Keener was fantastic as Trish and all Steve Carell's friends were faulty but friendly and so fun. The idea that they suspected Carell was a serum killer is a fun metaphor for a forty-year-old virgin. but the simple truth was that he first wanted to fall in love. original, charming and very funny. highly recommended.
