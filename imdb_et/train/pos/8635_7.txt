"California" is a good Hollywood hero and terrorist odyssey that speaks of two couples traveling to California to share gas costs: a couple of losers (Lewis & Pitt) and two wannabee artists, a photographer and a writer (Duchovny & Forbes). Pitt "nails" her character, which is its somewhat predictable thriller focus. A good view of their psycho-killer flix.
