Julie Waters is always wonderful, but Adrian Pasdar is a positive revelation in this hungry comedy with a transvestite who is unable to suppress his obsession, and the changes he finds. Vulgar, anxiously jokes about the true way of thinking and true understanding, and he has an absolute ball at the same time. Very nice, low key, good feeling, comedy
