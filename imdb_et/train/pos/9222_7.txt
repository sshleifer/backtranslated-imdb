There have been too few mainstream films in post-colonial Africa, and those that have been combined have been mixed. The altruistic claims of slavery in the 1970s show Africa's best and worst values, which are not too different from the values ​​of mankind as a whole. It also has some drawbacks, given the unjustified effects of the western perceptions of the Africans and especially the Arabs. <br /> <br /> Dr. Anansa Linderby, an English doctor David Linderby, a beautiful African-American woman, has been captured by Arab slave traders with teenage girls in Sanufu and a young boy. The leading slave trader, Suleiman, is at every stage an Arabic, his floral and sometimes humorous rhetoric, and gestures that fit - what wouldn't be "Carry On Follow the Camel" but no standard film deserves. Of course, Peter Ustinov had more than enough skills to handle some of the script's shortcomings, and he saved what would otherwise have been a strange one-dimensional nature. Suleiman's Arabic workers are inexpedient and one is paedophilic tendencies towards a boy who, fortunately, is not displayed on the screen. bureaucrat. David then meets two stereotyped white exams, English (Walker, Rex Harrison) and American (Sandell, William Holden). Sandell is a mercenary who has "normal" views of the various racial relationships that initially refuse to assist when David does not pay the advance. He won David's love for Anan and knowing his inability to find love, he agrees to take David to his helicopter to help find Ansa. They find that Suleiman and his prisoners cross the border and are unable to reach the neighboring area - due to Sandell's hesitation and the lack of David's firearms, his helicopter strikes, but David survives. > Then we see that David introduced Malik (Kabir Bedi), an African who has lost his family to Suleiman and is now being driven by revenge. They find a Sanufu girl with a Tuareg group and know they're on the right track to find Suleiman. <br /> <br /> In a heart-shaped scene, they kill a slave-dealer party to find that it was not a Suleyman group and has no choice but to send their prisoners to the Tuaregs they met earlier. <br /> <br /> Later, we discover that a rape young boy is a wizard and a superb scene with supernatural record, he uses his knowledge to kill one of Suleiman's handbags. Anansa, for his part - and despite the boy's skepticism - succeeds in constructing the death of two other workers in Suleiman. <br /> <br /> By this time Suleiman and his slaves have reached the slave market in a few days. /> <br /> Suleiman, now there is no doubt that Anansa is "in trouble", trying to sell her to the rich Arab prince (Omar Sharif) who is corrupt but intelligent. Discovering that Anansa is an American working in the United States, the Prince decides to consistently pursue negotiations without considering the consequences. A scene where two men's suits have one of the best films. <br /> <br /> In the slave market, the young boy sells to a medieval German pedophile, and we're left wondering if the boy is still considered a "wunderbar" when his owner is on his doctoral degree in witchcraft. <br /> <br /> David and Malik will end up against Suleiman and be a bitter sweet ending from Malik's point of view. Ultimately, David and Anansa are reunited, and Malik, whose life is in ruins, can himself accept his mission. <br /> <br /> The movie's overall plaque is excellent, but loses its markings on the stereotypical portrayal of almost all leading characters. The credit must go to all the leading players to address the shortcomings of many scripts.
