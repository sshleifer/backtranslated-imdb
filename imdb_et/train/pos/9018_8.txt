Despite the fact that there are very few techniques in this country, and its obvious neglect in other countries (the "R" rating cannot be helped - honestly, just because HBC uses the C-word!), It's actually a fine job. The sentimentality threatens to stifle it from time to time, but it goes beyond playing two lines. <br /> <br /> Plaudit is easy to beat just because you are physically or mentally scratched (Daniel Day-Lewis, Geoffrey Rush, Dustin Hoffman, etc.) and Helena Bonham-Carter may not be able to capture the physical degradation of MND, but she vocal stretching and ruthless emotional drive fully compensate. In fact, almost all of his performance takes place through his eyes (and what eyes!). This is an intelligent appeal to an actor who quickly captures his English reputation for Rose and has become an indicator of some reputation. The prizes must certainly follow, though not, unfortunately for this fine result. <br /> <br /> Branagh, who feels, has never given the film the best (except for the "Hamlet" option, where he was playing. Great cast). Here, however, he has his other performances, playing on the fabric a self-conscious, unstable, ultimately loving man with a fineness that he has not always shown and exhibited both intelligence and depth. In short, we believe him, as much as we could not believe him as Frankenstein as the "The Proposition" as a lawyer "gingerbread man", even as Andrew 'Peter' s Friends'. This is definitely his best results - so why couldn't he prepare the item much earlier? <br /> <br /> As a film, it looks more like a television offer, and it would probably not be very much without the stars. But it has been a joy to see this couple fill their socks like this and I look forward to them more (though not "lost in the work of love" ...). 8 out of 10, but Branagh and HBC get from 10 to 10.
