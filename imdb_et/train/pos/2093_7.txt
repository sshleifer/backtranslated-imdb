It's a bit long (2 hours, 20 minutes), but it had a lot of famous Pearl Buck novels. In other words, cover a lot of the ground. <br /> <br /> Sometimes there was a soap operation, but also some visually dramatic moments that stuck at the end of the movie. It was a surprising look. Considering that this film is about 70 years old, this film's special effects team did a great job. <br /> <br /> Paul Muni and Luise Rainer were award-winning actors of their day, and they don't disappoint here, both of them performing great performances. The only problem is reliability, because all the Asians play Caucasians and some of them, like Walter Connolly, just don't see the real thing. I would like to see this movie again with all Asian actors, not for PC reasons, but just to make the story look and sound more reliable.
