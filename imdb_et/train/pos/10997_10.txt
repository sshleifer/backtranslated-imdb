WOW. One of the biggest films I've ever seen on EVER - ever seen. <br /> <br /> Absolutely loved it! Before I made the opening results, I joined the screen. <br /> <br /> This is a Sci-Fi thriller - AND your seat edge Whodunn. Unbelievable. <br /> <br /> I'd like it never to end. <br /> <br /> Lucy Liu is the hit role. Everyone could have played it. Leading actor Jeremy Northram was the perfect geeky man. <br /> <br /> This movie invites me to love war games, tennis and traces. <br /> <br /> Unbelievable! <br /> <br /> 8-22-06. Walt D LV
