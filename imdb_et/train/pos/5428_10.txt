My favorite "Imperialism" movie and one of the best action-adventure cuts all the time. Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks dominate the screen with bold and clever cracks to attract everyone except the most "PC" movie visitors. The memorable scenes are abundant - 3 sergeants and their 20 smiths are fighting against hundreds of Thugs; MacChesney & Cutter, which gives Bobby Coote a spiked punch ("save some elephant"); Cut to MacChesney - "I'm an Expedition"; Cut the Cutter out of prison, with a fork ("what do you think I'm trying to break?") And the incredible temple scene with Cutter singing and then annoucing, brave like brass - "Okay, you're all arrested!" <br /> <br /> I could go ahead, but it is enough to say that I try to catch this movie when it's turned on, better 2 hours.
