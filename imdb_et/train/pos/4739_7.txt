A very good martial arts film and Jet Li is the best because the captain himself is Bruce Lee .Li is a great librarian / policeman who saves time and time again. He has the presence and appearance that is riveting and believable as the kung fu king. You don't mess. Allure all at the same time that I found unforgettable. The villain, the man with sunglasses and the long hair were also very good, but I can't find my name in the credits, can anyone help me with that? Thank you! Enjoy Hak hap or black mask in any language for good entertainment!
