This is the best of the three new adjustments made by W. Somerset's Maughan novel, not particularly because John Cromwell brought the film. The film is worth a look, because Bette Davis, who, like Mildred Rogers, showed the film industry, was his full-length feature film. Eventually, his battle for Jack Warner and his studio was royal. <br /> <br /> The film is dominated by Mildred from the beginning. We understand from the beginning that Mildred doesn't care about Philip and never gets it. He does not hide his contempt for a soul that is in love with the wrong woman. Mildred will bring him down again and again, as he does not make any bones that he actually has. <br /> <br /> Poor Philip Carey is a disabled person who is weak. When he tries to hold on to Mildred, he rejects him. Just when Mildred returns when he is weak and defeated, he rises to the event, crossing his addiction to the terrible woman who has stolen his will and masculinity. <br /> <br /> Bette Davis gives a fantastic Mildred imagination. It was one of his best roles and he ran away with it. His reluctance to make such Philips is clear from the beginning of their relationship. When he tells him to wash his mouth after kissing him, this is one of the most powerful moments of the film. Leslie Howard played Philip down and makes her look even weaker than she is. Frances Dee, Reginald Denny, Alan Hale and Reginald Owen are in small roles. <br /> <br /> It's Bette Davis, and don't forget it!
