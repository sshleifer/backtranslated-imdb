Like many Americans, I was first introduced to Hayao Miyazaki's works when I saw "Breath Away". I fell in love with the movie and saw it several times. Now I'm looking for every Miyazaki movie. One of his earlier works is "Loss in Heaven". Although it is still enjoyable, it is not as good as "delighted" (although comparing this or some movie with his 2002 masterpiece is perhaps unfair). <br /> <br /> A young boy named Pazu (James Van Der Beek) is working late in the night when he sees the girl slowly falling from the sky. When he wakes up the next morning, he will introduce himself to Sheeta (Anna Paquin). But Sheetal has a secret, and before he knows it, Pazu is pulled into an adventure that puts him at risk of being a victim of pirates, an army, and a lost floating city. <br /> <br /> Going to the Hayao Miyazaki movie means you can wait for one thing: miracle and magic. Many filmmakers have tried, but no one can create a magic and honor like Miyazaki. Watching a Miyazaki movie is like a fantastic dream from your childhood. <br /> <br /> Since the film is animated, movie duplication does not pose a major problem, as it is impossible to determine whether the lips movements correspond to words. It also helps to translate the dialogue by well-written and talented participants. Voting is different. James Van Der Beek's prices are the best. It reveals irresistible enthusiasm and excitement for the Pazu, which is perfect in character. Anna Paquin is almost as good as Sheeta. He is afraid of events around him, but he knows what he has to do. Mark Hamill is recognizable as bad Muska. He is dangerous and wants something from Sheet and does something to get it. Other voices are bad. Cloris Leachman is terrible as Dola. Leachman can win the Oscar "Last Picture Show", but he is annoying as a pirate leader. Leachman gives a character an unpleasant woman who is almost always monotonous. It's so bad that almost a movie is destroyed! Jim Cummings is an effective voice commander, but he is ubiquitous. <br /> <br /> I would definitely suggest "Loss in Heaven". Probably I buy it myself. But while it's not as good as "Breathed Away", it's still pretty good.
