In the old commercial use of blank cassettes, the label line was "is it real or is it Memorex?" The same can be said about the events of this episode - "The Cage", compilation and remix of the first Trek pilot. Mr. Spock has ordered the ship to bring it to the banned planet Talos IV to allow Captain Christopher Pike, his first captain, who is burnt and paralyzed, to return there. Why Finagling? As he contacted Talos IV at all, he calls a death sentence. Why it is, has never been explained - it disturbed me enormously - but if anything else, it adds a story. After he has taken the ship to Talos to drive IV, Mr. Spock himself turns to Dr. McCoy (the oldest officer, Captain Kirk was under the ship) for arrest and says, "The charge is negligible, Dr. I never got a takeover order. "Here is a judgment where - thanks to the Talosans - we learn why it was so important (in addition to the obvious paralysis) also to Kapit Pike in Talos IV, even if Mr Spock was at risk of death. The illusions that the Talos are creating, the background music and the whole storyline are fantastic. And Meg Wyllie as Keeper (head man Talosian) is wonderful. Call me sexist, but I never had a woman in that role, but she was perfect! Talos, who have abandoned almost all physical activities and almost completely dependent on the power of illusion, are also unisex; you can't really tell if they are men or women, and that is not really important. This episode, which is more than just about any other series, makes me hope and pray that there are other worlds and that there are civilizations that have been developed so far! What a clean thing, if it were! This is one of my favorite episodes, and no matter how many times I've seen it (I even have it on video), it's never impressive. Meg Wyllie LOOKS like an alien and I don't mean it uncomfortable.
