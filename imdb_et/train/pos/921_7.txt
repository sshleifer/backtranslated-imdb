PERHAPS tries to find another "Hot Property" for adaptation, the brothers Fleischer thought back to the world of their very successful invasion of comic books, where they produce the 1933 POPEYE THE SAILOR (Fleischer Studios / Paramount). Although it was part of the BETTY BOOP series, Miss B made a brief look short; leaving the rest of the pilot episode for a possible inflated series. Fleischer and their studio are long lasting and literally lively, which lasts until today. BOOP Outing; The aim is to look for another series. The justification seemed to sound. HENRY was the most popular feature in Hearst Papers; appear every day as well as a Sunday comic book supplement, PUCK, THE COMPETITION WEEK. You know, "What the fools are these mortals!" Remember this, Schultz? Looking chubby, small, bald boy Comic Strip 'Hero' and his screen antics, both solo and Betty; we were pleasantly surprised to see how well this character went. The story and director Dave Fleischer gave so many comic-like situations and visions that seemed most suitable for the character of a small Henry. These mostly silent vignettes were very important for the animated film in maintaining the faithfulness of the printed page; The HENRY feature was mostly made with a mime of 4 colors. <br /> <br /> In a competition titled BETTY BOOP HENRY: FUNNIEST LIVING American (Fleischer Studios / Paramount Pictures Corporation, 1935), we see what is; it is basically one situation; Dave Fleischer's usual fire with the usual line of machine gun-like gags. In short, Henry marks a puppy in a Betty Boop pet store window. This is a kind of love at first glance when Henry tries to buy a little boy with money only to pocket his coins. He's been formed by Miss Boop to make $ 2.00 in depression money to make a purchase. Tears appear as a little guy when they leave. <br /> <br /> HOW BRUSSELS ARE Soon On The Line When Betty asks the store to shop when she leaves for urgent business. In return for her services, Miss Betty promises her a small dog. Of course, they have a lot of goods and Betty leaves. <br /> <br /> To clean the cages and feed the cattle, Fleischer Crew will be able to burn a whole range of gags. this time with bird seeds, Henry bald animal and puss. (Of course not all at once, Schultz!) Henry's enthusiasm for massively feeding the bird population of a shop first by literally sowing his head leads to a massive defect in the birds; from a shop open to the street in a mass prison. <br /> <br /> BETTY returns to this view and expresses his frustration and anger with Henry's temporary custody. All bets were off, no dogs for Henry. He's going to leave; abandoned; but soon convinces the owner to give him another picture of the affirmation. His head is covered with bird seeds, he succeeds in correcting all small enclosed creatures; returning them to the pet store. Fortunately, there are little sons; but this time he has his affectionate, small, licking puppy. <br /> <br /> He was the winning combination of the high. We have the boy's carefree, energy-saving, free wheel, Betty's goodness and emotions of the situation, and the dubious result of the "boy and his dog" situation. Max and Dave Fleischer had given us a sort of almost mini-masterpiece that was a short surreal comedy. <br /> <br /> We were quite surprised that the HENRY series was not followed. Judging by the fairly faithful treatment of the character, it would certainly have been for some time. In any case, this connection was in many ways the best picture of Betty Boop in the sample. Although the first, POPEYE THE SAILOR (Fleischer / Paramount, 1933), was the most successful (and had almost no Betty Boops except the carnival hula dancer). HENRY Short was much better than two of King's features: "tryouts", BETTY BOOP and LITTLE KING and BETTY BOOP AND LITTLE JIMMY, both 1936. <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
