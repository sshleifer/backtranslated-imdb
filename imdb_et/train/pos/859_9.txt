It's so rare to find a movie that offers a plot that can't be thought out every step of the way. Surprisingly the whole delightful whole. <br /> <br /> A couple of things I could not quite understand is that there is a leading female character who plays "good girl, hard worker" and finally ends up being the recipient of antisocial risk. It wasn't enough that I didn't like it, but it gave me a break. <br /> <br /> Another thing I didn't get was an old man pulled by the police at the end of this year. film. I never got who he was or what his problems were. If anyone has any ideas, I'd like to hear what they might be. <br /> <br /> The film was exciting and fun all the time and always kept me in mind. Very valuable.
