Incredibly intriguing and exciting, I found it impossible when I look. I'm usually one of the toughest critics, but for me this movie was just great, strange, because it may seem like I could feel the air and feel the texture of the locations. According to cinematic art, I thought that there was a lot of use of light and texture. From the orange glow of summer light to the plastic wrapped sofa, I had a special air of reality for me. <br /> <br /> From the point of view of characters, I thought Victor Vargas was almost an adhesive that united the story was quite inspired; <br /> <br /> In addition, having felt like a grandmother and having been in the end of such a situation, I can say that the situation seemed particularly realistic. Embarrassment, accent, cooking, and even commenting on comments made me so authentic. <br /> <br /> I think this movie worked for me because I started watching it unexpectedly and found that it was completely absorbent and brought back memories of teenage emotions worth watching.
