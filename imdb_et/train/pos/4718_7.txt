This film was made in Hungary. anyway, the scenery is proud, the people who play the farmers were totally exciting. their riding is fantastic. I got more from the local people, the farm life and how the heroes tried to hide Brady from the evil Nazis who were looking for these paratroopers. They even sacrificed their lives on several occasions. The young orphan who Brady makes friends with was a sweet boy. You marvel at the riding I think and the Nazi avoidance endeavor. It is fun and comical in some places and very tragic in others. Ladies are comfortable because they are finally destroyed. own it and I've watched it several times. in other words, not just at one time around the flick. his possessor.
