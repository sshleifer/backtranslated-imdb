Sentinel has a sort of mill and cliched distance / mystery, but it is lifted with some good functioning and a tight pace. These stories have mostly gone through as many permutations as we can, so what we leave is how good the actor is, how smart are the settings and the bad guys, how well the main plot is designed, and so on. ..... so Sentinel does a solid job based on its content. Michael Douglass and Kiefer Sutherland keep such a good screen and attitude. Eva Longoria (the first time I saw her on the screen) brings a satisfactory support. The story of the whole thing is completely unlikely when it knocks a bit, but it deserves to be disconnected. Worth viewing if you like the genre.
