A long time ago, I watched it in the middle of the movie cable. Then I was on Mary Moronov. I saw her again in Raoul. I was convinced that she was the hottest woman on the screen. <br /> <br /> I can tilt this with the movie. 9 out of 10 <br /> <br /> This is the only movie I have on the original strip.
