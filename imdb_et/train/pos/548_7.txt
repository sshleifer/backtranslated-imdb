This movie was as good as some other West Anthony Mann and James Stewart, like Winchester '73 and The Naked Spur, and much better than Thunder Bay and Bend Of The River. This film begins as a western mill, but becomes more complicated. It starts with Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan arrives in Seattle and Stewart is accused of murder. He is found innocent, but is a corrupt judge stolen. Then Stewart agrees to lead something, but I forget what it is, but Stewart only cares about getting his herd back. As the movie goes by, it's like Stewart, despite his character, Naked Spuris. It will be much better after Alaska arrives. This is one of Stewart's best.
