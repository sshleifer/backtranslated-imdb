Deanna Durbin saved Universal from bankruptcy and allowed her to stay in the studio. By the mid-1930s, most of Universal's leaders were Milestone, Browning and Wyler. Only James Whale was left, but his prestigious horror films were behind him. Deanna and Judy Garland appeared in a short "every Sunday" and originally offered Garland's role as "Penny" in "Three Smart Girls". When Garland was not available, he turned to Universal Durbin. Initially, he was definitely a supportive player, but his potential was so lively that the script was written in his letters. Director Henry Koster's film had a European touch. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a beautiful panorama of "Switzerland". The title "Three Smart Girls" - three sisters, Joan (Nan Gray), Kay (Barbara Read) and Penny (Deanna Durbin) drive with Penny, giving her famous voice "My Heart Sings". Not everyone is at home - their father plans to return to a younger wife (Binnie Barnes) so that three girls, with the help of their loyalty (Lucille Watson), decide to go to New York and reunite with their mother. Lucille Watson is remembered for his role as Robert Taylor's stern "Waterloo Bridge" (1941). <br /> <br /> Donna is a gold digger who, together with her harsh mother (Alice Brady), is destined to marry Judson Craig (Charles Winninger). Someone who has no film experience is Deanna great as a penny, a typical irritating, enthusiastic boyfriend and she's as beautiful as a picture. When he sings "to care for someone" for his father, you just melt - what a brilliant voice he had. He also has one of the most fun features. If his father consolidates him "I'll take you to the zoo tomorrow", he answers "Oh, I see here enough monkeys" !!! <br /> <br /> With the help of Bill Evans (John King), they decide to hire a novel "Donna" ("Mischa Auer"). They arrange meetings at the nightclub, but confuse that Lord Michael Stuart (Ray Milland) is wrong because Donna falls against him (he thinks he has half of Australia !!!) Plans back when he falls Kay and Donna want to speed up his marriage to Judson. <br /> <br /> Penny decides to pick things up and run away. She will be taken to the local police station, where she screams with the transfer of the police "Il Bacio" (she tries to convince her that she is a young opera singer.) Everything ends happily with her mother (Nella Walker) who travels across the patch with her father and in the meantime Donna makes her unread (Mischa Auer) and rides with him to Australia. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
