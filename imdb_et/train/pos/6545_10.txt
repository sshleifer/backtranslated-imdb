I really enjoyed this movie. Most comments have been bad, but most critics think the film should be like an idea for drama. This movie is a bit of a drama, but the rest is just fun and very fun. Forget that Julia Roberts is a pretty woman, Emma Roberts is a pretty young lady and she's more than just that. Emma was so much in the role of Nancy Drew. It's good to see a new face. I believe he is going far. <br /> <br /> Nancy Drew may not be based on books, but the story is still good. It is also a good mix of other character designers and supporters such as Pat Carroll, Barry Bostwick, Rachel Leigh Cook and Chris Kattan. I'm surprised that Disney didn't release this movie. Some people may not like this movie because it doesn't include sex, violence, and church. This is a good family film that is rare on this day. So take your family, watch this movie and decide for yourself how good it is. I can't wait for a sequel.
