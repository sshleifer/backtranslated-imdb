* SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> This is just another pay-per-view that has given a perfect 10, the first is the 1991 Royal Rumble. It was full of exciting matches that were not memorable, but disposable fun. That's why I love it. <br /> <br /> The only low points were between Razor and DiBiase and Ludwig Borga and Marty Jannetty. They were OK matches, but DiBiase earned a better result for their final fee. These days, such a game would be like Razor's first big button press. And Jannetty, which was a freshly infinite Intercontinental headline, could have better matched Borga. But I don't think anyone really cares. They just needed Borga's pay TV for a fee. The IRS and Kid were great, as did Michaels and Perfect. I wish Perfect could have won, but Michaels won't let anyone. Note how she left WWF right after that so she wouldn't have to go to work for Razor. Bret Hart had two big strokes with Doink (indicate how everyone's best match is against Hit man) and then Lawler. Their competition was classic; because this year's generation was not the brain. How often do you see two legends winning their year's career in the later years of Feudi? <br /> <br /> The Steiners-Heavenly Bodies game was one of the best years. Who knew that the authorities could ever keep one of the best teams ever? Many say that the Undertaker-Giant Gonzalez game was a waste of time. But I loved it. Remember that what made the old WWF (like before WWE) was a mix of sporty and weird shows. Is there a soul who did not like the Achema? <br /> <br /> The main event was not bad, though not nearly a year ago. They put Lex Luger well, but made a wise choice to keep Yokozuna in the belt. He was the first concentrator because Superstar Graham held the belt for more than two months. Nowadays heels are masters all the time. But from the beginning of the WWWF through the 90's WWF, when you blinked, they stood at the top. <br /> <br /> Like the old school wrestling fan, this and SummerSlam '88 are my favorites.
