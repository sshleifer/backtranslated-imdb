I recently acquired it on a DVD that is one of my favorite films of all time, and as usual, the whole thing just looked at me. the soundtrack of this movie is just tears, especially "Will You". It's a pure nostalgia trip to my youth. This rate is the second best for Quadrophenia (which is also labeled Phil Daniels). The end is so sad, during the hours after the end of the film I am a childhood. boring, just for the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Hazel, sorry to hear from your dad. God bless you all. xx
