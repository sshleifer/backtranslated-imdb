****** WARNING: May contain spoilers ************** <br /> <br /> Who are these "Mystery Men?" Simply put, the Mystery Men are subgroups of the group who are desperately trying to live their youth's fantasy life, keeping their real identities as well as their super-identities. Shoveller (Bill Macy) builds buildings during the day and night leaves his wife and children home when he rides on the street, looking for crimes to fight his extraordinary and unique anti-shovel style. The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) sells silver at night to young couples a day and at dinner the cutlery breaks when her mother does not keep her busy last. Mr. Furious works in the junkyard to earn his salary, then he gets frustrated at night with his friends, beating the same kind of lining on both a friend and an enemy and threatening to be really angry (leaving everyone wondered, so everyone?). Ben Stiller breathes such a life into this character, you can't help him, but you love him. <br /> <br /> These three spend their nights trying to capture the "moment of glory" they have dreamed of ... becoming real Super Heroes. Obviously this may happen. Champion City has ... Captain amazing, flying, fighting super-policeman with enough company logos to stop extra or two. Greg Kinnear turns to an adult middle-aged salesman who tries to focus his career in the dark of his career. <br /> <br /> To reopen this "extra magic" that can win re-representations, C.A. frees Casanova Frankenstein, WAAAAAY, from the overwhelming danger of chilling the perfection of Goeffrey Rush. This crazy genius has created a "psycho-wrecker" to integrate Champion City into a reflection of its own madness ... and reaches C.A. within hours of release. It only leaves Mystery to stop Frankenstein's evil plan, but for those of the Disco Boys who defend Frankenstein, the trio needs some help. <br /> <br /> Recruitment begins and after a painful recruitment party, the team lives with The Bowler (Janeane Garofolo), who at first has the only real talent in the team, his mystical ball as a seemingly animated spirit in the spirit of his father's revenge; Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell), who claims he doesn't see the invisible when he looks at him; spleen (Paul Reubens), who became an angry gypsy of mysteriously strong flatulence; and a lot of untapped Sphinx (Wes Studi), who has been able to cut arms halfway through his mind, spends much of the rest of the movie, pointing out meaningless puzzles and acting too smart. <br /> <br /> This movie is indeed a cross game. Anyone who wants to open a movie into small categories fights a losing battle. This is a superhero genre of fraud / parody - from pseudo-Burton kits that have been recycled indefinitely (and occasionally decorated with more junk material) to ridiculous costumes, the comic book genre sends a pretty good broadcast. But at the same time it is also a serious superhero. Both at once. Although this is not a unique idea in itself (for example, this film is somewhat reflective of D.C.'s short-term Inferior Five work), it is quite innovative for the big screen. It offers a comic book world that needs anyway to accept disbelief, then throws it into inevitability - and we all know whether superheroes were real, so these guys would be real. If Big Guy and S were flying around New York City, you would see half a dozen news reports on underwear idiots to get their bouts on a regular basis. Of course, Shoveller fights pretty well and the blue Raja casts forks with great precision - all parts of the super-hero world. But does this make them real heroes? Only in their minds. <br /> <br /> This movie is also comedy, though in the dark. Inevitable in the quest for the inevitable ridiculous super-heroic character. One-liner comic geniuses throw a lot of bits onto the stage. Janeane Garofalo's dialogue with her bowling ball / dad is especially admirable. Yet this is not a comedy in the sense of a laughing corner or an eternally memorable joke. It mixes with the dose of drama, discovery, and romance, but it can never be fully involved in any way. <br /> <br /> What really makes Mystery Men a good movie is that it's very engaging. The weak / flat good guys are finally legitimate and for one glittering moment they really become super heroes; justice; and the film ends with a scene that ruptures realism (as much realism as possible in a world where bowling balls fly and glasses make perfect hiding). If the viewer stops the film, the film may be a big romp. <br /> <br /> Of course, no movie is perfect. Claire Forlani comes as boring and indecent as the interest of Mr Furious's love, despite having his own conscience. Tom Waits seems to be confused in his own way, like Dr. Heller, the inventor of madness, although his opening scenes that take retirement to women into a nursing home are worth it alone. And the villains are never more than the lack of weapons (the point of which is made in the film). Cinematic art is unpleasant and divorced (as happens in the middle comic, so it is excusable), music sometimes goes beyond the landscape and special effects are never very well integrated with the rest. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is amazing. Probably you need to be a comic fan and superhero genre to really appreciate this movie, but it's a fun romp and a good chance to kill for a few hours and let your brain rest. <br /> <br /> 8/10 in my opinion.
