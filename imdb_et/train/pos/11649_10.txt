With an absolutely stunning movie, if you have 2.5 hours to kill it, watch it, you won't regret it, it's too much fun! Rajnikanth wears a movie on his shoulders and though nothing else, he still liked it. A.Rehman's music takes time to grow up for you, but after you have heard it a few times, you really like it.
