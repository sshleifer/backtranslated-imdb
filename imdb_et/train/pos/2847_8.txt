As is well known, anthology films do not fit well with the American audience (I think they prefer one standard line). New York, I love you, is the second stage of anthology films that deal with cities and the people who live and love them. The first was "Paris, J'Taime", which I really enjoyed. The film consisted of several segments, each of which was written and / or staged by another director (most of them French, but Joel & Ethan Coen is a very funny segment). Like "Paris", it is also an anthology led by several different directors (Fatih Akin, Mira Nair, Natalie Portman, Shakher Kapur, etc.) as well as "Paris vessels in New York" and why they love the city they live in. Cast, featuring Natalie Portman, Shia LaBeouf, Christina Ricci, Orlando Bloom, Ethan Hawk, and also experienced veterans such as James Caan, Cloris Leachman, Eli Wallach and Julie Christie. Some of the stories really fly and others don't (although I think it depends on individual tastes --- I won't destroy it for anyone else, revealing what they worked for me and what didn't). The word is that the next entry in the series is Shanghai, China (is Rome, Italy, Berlin, Germany or Athens, Greece out?). They are mainly spoken in English but have English subtitles with Yiddish and Russian. Strong language and sexual content are rated MPAA
