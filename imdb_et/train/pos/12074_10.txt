Joseph H. Lewis was one of the best directors of the film noir. This is definitely his best. <br /> <br /> It does not have some standard features that we now call noir film. Although it is done in the US, it is entirely in England. There are no gangsters. It has no femme fatale. There is no crime. <br /> <br /> The title character corresponds to the ad. He's glad he's making money as a secretary. Instead, he wakes up days later as a pawn of a terrifying plot. Only a very strong person could have such a terribly undisturbed endeavor to survive. And Nina Foch gives Julia a strong woman's feeling. <br /> <br /> Some of the excitement comes from casting a type: Mrs Foch has an elegant way. He is not a screaming, sacrificial victim. In fact, he is a bit icy and patriotic, though uncomfortable. This makes his character even more difficult. <br /> <br /> Certainly the most exciting element is casting Dame May Witty. He was (and is) probably the most famous "The Lady Vanishes". She has a sweet way and a harmless, lightly dimming way. But here he is far from heroin. The whole cast is really great. <br /> <br /> This famous and brilliant film seems to have been made almost randomly. Undoubtedly, the director knew exactly what he was doing. But he did it with a small budget. It's a movie noir, a real movie noir: it's a small, convincingly low life and in that case unforgettable.
