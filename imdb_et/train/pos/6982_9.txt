Good show. <br /> <br /> The main point is that humanity is at a crossroads. There are moral dilemmas that face. Humanity has made a number of technological breakthroughs, but is humanity mature enough to deal with its new toys? In the virtual world there is moral decadence. There are religious fanatics who want to pay attention. I predict (in the background of BSG) that there is a problem with Cylons and slavery. In addition, all the other problems we bring to the people. <br /> <br /> This show is not a BSG - at least not so far as humankind is experiencing a ruthless problem that was ultimately their own. There are not many firing or space-based special effects - at least not during the first episodes. <br /> <br /> What he has very good stories, characters and themes. It also has good actors. They can create a culture similar to today's society, but at the same time the alien is completely credible. Like BSG, this is an exhibition of humanity - our strengths, weaknesses, potentials and weaknesses. It may seem a bit strange that human societies have ties, antique cars and chicken on different worlds. However, these things are indeed more familiar with creating a background than anything else. Anyone who sticks to these details is really incomplete. Whether you are a Mafia-style culture or a prosperous and high-tech culture, people and human nature do not differ 150,000 years ago from the high-tech past that we see in the world today. Wonder whether writers are trying to tell us something.
