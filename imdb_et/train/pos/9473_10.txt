I was fortunate enough to see it yesterday (October 20) and I was amazed at the wonderful plot and the real heart feeling. <br /> <br /> Although the plot is not very complex or extraordinarily new, the story is so fresh that it is unique and clearly stylish. It is not something that can be easily compared to past films, it is a unique story of classic middle-aged depressed love. <br /> <br /> I was particularly struck by casting a film. For the last extra of each family, it was beautiful and talented. Three daughters did a great job, the talent was evenly distributed between them, and none of them "seemed" to the other two. <br /> <br /> It was a really pleasant movie that fit all ages and smiled loudly at the same time, being really touching and warming up from the heart. It was a wonderful break from the sex movies and nudity of the latest films.
