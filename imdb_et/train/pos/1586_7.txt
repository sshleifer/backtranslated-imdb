Rosenstrasse is a more intimate film than an epic proportion that could have been captured by many film lovers looking for a similar piano. Fortunately, the good screenwriter Von Trotta chooses a feminist smile for an era that is too much illustrated by his colorful outdoor environment, but too little from an Jewish point of view of intimacy and ordinary Aryan. Rosentrasse finds its strong power in those people who are trapped in the historical conditions that they are the victim of. The pace of the film is introspective, slow, meditative. Moreover, the characters are so bright, but intergenerational transitions and passage of time are skilfully designed. Rosenstrasse is not a masterpiece, and some narrative mistakes are well understood. The second mistake is trivial cinematography, which cannot capture the intensity of the inner drama of symbols. Nevertheless, this film is worth it. Finally, Rosenstrasse is part of the latest trends in German films dealing with horrible ghosts in the past, featuring such great films as Nowhere in Africa and recently controversial Downfall. I recommend this movie to those who know how to read pictures further.
