McConaughey in horror / thriller? I had to see it. I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Land is spoken in rebound mode and it concerns otherwise normal and happy three families that are going through a very strange situation. I can't say much more without breaking the whole movie, sorry. Just know that if you decide to watch it, you are at least surprised. <br /> <br /> All major players are very good. Bill Paxton did a great job of drawing these kids and his actor was fantastic. McConaughey's action is solid and fits perfectly into the bill. <br /> <br /> This movie makes you think. Is Dad Crazy? Is there a God? Are there demons? How far you get wrong. And what is still right? I still mean. So I recommend "Frailty". 7/10 and this is one of those films that deserves a second or even third look.
