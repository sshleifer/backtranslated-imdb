This movie is about development. People are growing and people are fading, people are surprising and people are disappointing. It's all and more. There is hope, disappointment, injustice, justice, love and hatred. It's a truly classic drama that has a fantastic play of all the pain, but especially Whoopi Goldberg's debut role. Be obligatory every Saturday in all prisons in the world - it concerns your compassion. Rating: 10 of 10. <br /> <br /> PS: I testify: I finished the tear in the last scene.
