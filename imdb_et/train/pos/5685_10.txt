Kudos for the director and for his realistic film. Blurry, the lack of glamor and despair pulled me to the film and kept me there. I was really impressed with how the dates and information were transmitted during the film; That is, newspapers, letters, etc. It kept the movie at such a fast pace that I didn't feel like moving forward. Personally, I thought that all the principles worked enormously ... it was nice to see Bosworth and Kudrow in such difficult roles. It made me cry from time to time. Val Kilmer didn't surprise me ... his productions usually leave me in fear. In general, this is a brilliant film that should not be missed!
