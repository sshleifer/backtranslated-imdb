Every time and then, this movie appears, which nobody has ever heard and received very little money and resources in a very short time, but it all goes crazy and surprisingly great. It also happened in the 1950s, where there are few small films many people have never heard of. In the 50's, there are indeed some unknown big surprising jewels that are worth appealing to. "Panic on the Streets" is another film that is attracted to the mind. Both are movies that do not like the usual genre of their time and are also made with limited resources. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised how much I liked this movie. It was really a movie that improved and better. Like all "old" movies, it tends to start slowly, but when you get the story and its characters, you are the real treat for this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie really has a great story, it includes espionage, even though the film won't be like that. It starts with a typical criminal thriller with a movie noir touched on it. But "Pickup on South Street" just doesn't really have movie numbers so it will take its direction quite soon. This ensures that the film remains surprising, but above all it is really refreshing. None of them are really good guys and all of their shortcomings and weaknesses. Really humane. It is also particularly marked by the excellent achievements of Thelma Ritter, who even received a well-earned Oscar nomination. It has indeed become one of the greatest female roles I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Even despite its somewhat obvious low budget, it's just one big, original, special little movie that's worth seeing more! <br /> <br /> 10/10
