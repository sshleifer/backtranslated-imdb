I'm a big fan of the movie, but not for normal reasons. I think Travolta and Winger were above average, I think the kits represent the location and the era, I liked the soundtrack and the Charlie Daniels band. But I think photography was amazing! As the interior scenes were filmed in the real club and Gilley's low ceilings - maybe 10-12 feet high and smoke that had to simulate a "smoke-filled bar", hanged 2-4 feet down. The camera was able to capture images through the smoke and focus on the actors, the bull, the bar, the women, the dance, the low level of light that was actually in the bar! What a feat! Of course, there was extra light, but to keep the bar atmosphere, it needed to be low light. Ray Villalobos (camera operator) was outstanding! He got some shots he had no hope of achieving, and their influence brought the film a sense of reality. Thank you, Ray - Great job!
