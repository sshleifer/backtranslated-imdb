We are talking about a low budget movie and it is understandable that there are some weaknesses (no spoilers: one sudden explosive expert and one pointless alcoholic); But the story keeps you interesting, most of the characters are pleasant and there are some initial situations. <br /> <br /> I really like movies that will surprise you with some people who don't want you to believe and twist and twist the plot ... I praise it. <br /> <br /> If you know what I mean, try seeing the Nine Queens movie from Argentina.
