Compiled by French brothers Jules and Giddeon Naudet and spoken by Robert De Niro and James Hanlon fireman, this is a delightful and heartbreaking story of how New York's best shone during this darkest day. I saw it for the first time when I was a young man who was na√Øve, and at that age it still touched me. Knowing how serious 9/11 really saw it, it extended the whole effect of September 11. We found out who the heroes were, how they were in everyday life, and how they were in the line of their lives, where most people just run and save their selves. These brave men put their lives on the line and see that it just increases their admiration. See if possible, this is the best documentary I've ever seen personally.
