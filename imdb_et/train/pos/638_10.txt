For anyone who thinks this exhibition isn't for them, please try it. Network television is degenerate into examples of clones of clones or of reality-based exhibitions, with some often unrealistic people. This exhibition is a return to family-oriented television, with an emphasis on learning some lessons, learning about real friends and family members, and perhaps even learning a bit about our national time. Today, Jeremy Sumpter is one of the most attractive young actor actors and is perfect as a young, slightly naive new funny fictional New York empire (big name!). Dean Cain, Christopher Lloyd, Mare Winningham and Kirsten Storms round off their headaches and they are all exceptional. This exhibition deserves the opportunity to catch and see. Hopefully it will be a couple of seasons and we can look at the learning and growth of Pete Young (Sumpter's character).
