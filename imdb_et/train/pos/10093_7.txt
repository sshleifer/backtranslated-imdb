Millionaire Road Plantation owner invades London's beautiful boys' shoes and will soon live with him in a British Ceylon villa. Although it is based on Robert Standish's book, this primary structure is very reminiscent of Hitchock's Rebecca, where the leading lady Elizabeth Taylor collides with the manor's staff commander and (almost immediately) her husband, who is still under the thumb of her dead but dominant father. Taylor, the last-minute substitute for heavy Vivien Leighi, sees her high-fashioned wardrobe cream-smooth and her performance is quite strong; but when Peter Finch begins to drink and command orders, one might think that his commitment to him is rather masochistic (it also stops the end). However, the film offers a lot of money for soap cleaners: a romantic drama, a little travel letter, an interpretive dance, an elephant badge, and a completely timed cholera outbreak! *** from ****
