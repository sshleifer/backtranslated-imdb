I've seen this movie when I was young, and I remembered it as one of the first movies I really liked, that wasn't a feature film or comedy. So in my later years I decided to see it again and see if it was just nostalgia or something in this movie. To my surprise, the film was considered to be my expectations. This is a great movie. Emotional in the right amount, some jokes, nice songs (not big, and what really explains why I didn't remember it was musical) and everything is very useful to me. I was surprised that the latest films from my childhood, which I've reviewed, did not even go through my minimal demand for a decent film, and the film I first saw in the second class made me cry today as it made me cry. Perhaps this is because my dog ​​died recently and maybe not, but the important thing is that it made me feel and that is why filmmakers make movies (of course, money too). Yes, there are consistency failures. Yes, the script has holes, but it doesn't matter. The film itself is fun and smart. So don't be fooled by cynical people who are always looking for bad things in life because nothing is perfect, and this movie is not 10 because it is perfect. It's just 10 just because it made me feel.
