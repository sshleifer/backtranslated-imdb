This is one of the best films since 2002. Perhaps this is not the best film, but it looks best, has a great deal of action and is superbly staged by Sam Mendes, who debuted with American Beauty. <br /> <br /> This is a gangster named Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks), whom his son (Tyler Hoechlin) sees in his workplace. Michael's boss John Rooney (Paul Newman) thinks things are fine, but his jealous son, Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig), sets up both his father and Michael, resulting in the death of Michael's wife (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and her second son. Michael thinks Rooney is responsible and Rooney must choose and send Harlen Maguire (Jude Law) to finish his job. Since Michael is a respected person in the organization, he tries to win friends who can help him, including the boss Frank Nitti (Stanley Tucci). <br /> <br /> Obviously, the "road to the road" is a normal gangster movie, but it has done so well that you almost can't see it. This film is good for its production, direction of art, sound, music and especially cinematography. All these elements can surprise and create tension, although the result is pretty certain. This Hoechlin is not a tedious child and Hanks, Law and Newman know how to act helps, of course. <br /> <br /> Based on the comic, this movie is so much better than you would expect and even though it has some bugs in the better movies of the genre. Sometimes there are events where you realize you've seen it so many times before, but for some reason it seems fresh at the same time. Scenes between adult Hanks and Hoechlin's child help in this area. Watch this movie, which from time to time seems familiar, but it is brand new in many areas.
