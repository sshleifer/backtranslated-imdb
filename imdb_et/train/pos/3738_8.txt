TIGERLAND / (2000) *** 1/2 (out of four) <br /> <br /> Blake in French: <br /> <br /> Throughout the years, viewers have seen and understood warfare wherever possible, but Manufacturers and writers always find new and innovative ways to depict various soldiers on the battlefield. Joel Schumacher ("8MM", "A Time to Kill"), currently one of the most risky directors, has found a similarity to "The Thin Red Line" when his new drama "Tigerland" enters the shoes of individual soldiers. This film, written by Ross Klavan and Michael McGuther, has more courage and irony than "The Thin Red Line" or even "Saving Private Ryan". Although the dramatic impact of the film has somewhat decreased due to the perversion of existing material, it makes it clear to us that young men are training new words. <br /> <br /> I would like to know Joel Schumacher's experience with the army. Are men really such and cruel? I'm sure some of them are, but the film looks at its uncompromising world through a young man named Roland Bozz (Colin Farrell), who is rebellious against the ideas of war. His personality immediately contradicts many other characters who will become his best friend Paxton (Matthew Davis) and the other, Wilson (Russell Richardson), whose flaming temper often goes to war with Bozzi's tension. The war formed in this production is not on the battlefield, but on the Louisiana-based training camp training between soldiers concepts and fears. This film is about war preparation, nothing more. It ends when the soldiers end up fighting, frustrating because the witnesses of the characters would have acted for the resurrection. <br /> <br /> Positioning the picture for about 28 days using a 16mm margin and a low budget shows Joel Schumacher a precise, perverse, cruel and unknown atmosphere using hand-held cinematography, unique lighting technology and direct sound. Schumacher's sharp and blown images make the film documentary. This unusual film-making style only helps the film's realistic realism, which is quite graphic when using harsh languages, perhaps a little too disturbing. In a four-letter word, the pub waves, some shocking about what they hear. Even extreme vulgarism does not keep the dialogue dominant as heartbreaking, truly, and emotional. <br /> <br /> If anything, "Tigerland" gives us little recognition of how much our soldiers are going through for us. in the early stages of the fight. Such bravery must be taken by the military during the war, knowing the difficulties and the risks that are being taken. Such thought-provoking ideas can be made in the heartbreaking performances of young aspiring actors who represent different trainees. This movie is not meant for all audiences, but for what young men should look at before they engage in the military ... and the adult audience should be monitored so that they appreciate the courage they need. <br /> <br />
