Bette Midler introduces her talents and beauty to Diva Las Vegas. I'm glad I recorded it and I can see if I want to. He has what he needs to keep the audience in captivity. His voice is as beautiful as ever and it gives you a real impression. The highlight of the exhibition was his song "Stay With Me" from his 1979 movie "The Rose". You can feel the emotion in the song and you reach the goose bumps. The show leaves you the chance to go out and rent a Bette Midler movie or go to the nearest music store and buy one of Bette Midler's albums.
