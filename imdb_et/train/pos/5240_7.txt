Some of the actions were a bit suspicious. I remember that the asswipe Alexander Walker (the evening standard critic, yes OK, he is now dead) launched this film telling that it was a disgrace that depicts NI protestants as murderers. Now, for all NI Protestants, this film is loosely based on Shankill Butchers (who were loyalists) and who was viewed by Belfast in the 1970s. Believe me, they were not called butchers. my main thing about this movie is that it doesn't show the speed of light or hope, it's all the destruction and the darkness, I mean, whether a little girl at the end must die. Maybe it sounds funny, but it could have been the impression that all the prods are not bad or good.
