Phantom Lady (1944) Dir: Robert Siodmak <br /> <br /> Production: Universal Images <br /> <br /> Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis), after a nasty fight and division with his wife, is waiting to sink at a local soldering pot . There she screams a woman in the same emotional state and asks some companion to ask her to show in the club that they both think about their problems. He agrees, but only on condition that they retain their own names. Certainly, when Scott comes home, he finds the police there, waiting for him to question. His wife has been murdered. Where were you tonight at 8 pm, Inspector Burgess (Thomas Gomez)? But Scott has an alibi, right? Only he doesn't know the name of the woman. And the barman remembers Scott, but not the woman. Nor is the cab driver. Not even a drummer (Elisha Cook Jr.) in the club. Even a club dancer, Scott who was clearly trying to get a woman (both wearing the same hat) does not admit that he was with someone. Something is happening, but no matter what Scott is helpless to defend himself in the trial and to die of his wife's murder (the most serious evidence of Hollywood trial). It has remained with his loyal secretary, Kansas (Ella Raines), who later joined the sympathetic inspector of Burgess to find the real killer before Scott's death. <br /> <br /> Phantom Lady is built on themes that are almost repressive in Woolrich's work. For example, the schizophrenic antagonist is also seen in Black Angelis and Leopard Man. In addition, there is a character who becomes spiritually relaxed by the death of a sweetheart or husband, as found in Rendezvous in Black and Bride Wore Black. This may leave the viewer feeling that he runs on a well worn surface. The right hand has fever, an unfortunate dialogue, narrative contradictions, but all along. Fortunately, Phantom Lady was guided by the sound. <br /> <br /> This is Siodmaki's first noir. He would distinguish himself as an individual of style, if not the most advanced (The Killers, Criss Cross). Here he is randomly involved with Woody Bredell (they are reunited on Christmas Day and killers). There are some great stories in the camera. A single shot shows the deteriorating mental state of a character when sitting in front of a triple mirror, which refers to several persons. An artist of the same nature, Van Gogh is an independent portrait with an ear hanging on the wall of his apartment. But what Siodmak and Bredell actually do in the Phantom Lady are virtually a look. It was published very early in 1944. wet sidewalk, atmospheric and fear bags, sharply contrasting b & w, wildly expressionistic versions of reality (when Kansas visits Scott), contradictory shafts, and so on. This is a great picture. <br /> <br /> The franchise tone, director, director's theme and relative inexperience (and expected budget) show the ambition of the B-film. I thought Tone was a little hammy. Alan Curtis (High Sierra) is not quite a lot and a few scenes are really weak. Ella Raines is usually good (and quite beautiful). His "sex element" with Elisha Cook Jr is so delicate that it must be believed. Another standout scene is when Kansas is going to question her after the bartender. It's a chase when he relentlessly rides dogs through the streets, stopping at a subway station. Here's some real good tension. <br /> <br /> *** 4 of them
