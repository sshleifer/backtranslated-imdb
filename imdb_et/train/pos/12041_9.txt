This is a common old spooky ghost story. I showed it to some of my friends in my movie club and kept them fascinated until the end! Blood or gore-just a good old-fashioned relationship. It starts right from the start and builds and builds. The end result is a real twist that hit me unawares. Well managed and well-functioning. It is also a "periodic piece" set in the atmosphere of the 1920s. <br /> <br /> I was so impressed when I got Susan Hill's book from the Amazon. The film follows the book quite closely. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that it's not readily available on a DVD. My copy is VHS. This, along with "Haunted", is probably the two best Ghost Stories I've ever had. What just shows that little creativity exceeds "your face" every day!
