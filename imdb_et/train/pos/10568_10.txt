I loved the movie I saw on the big screen tonight! The audience laughed at very interesting things and the fast pace was the most enjoyable. "The key was modulated and he suddenly sang with a much lower, very soft voice, which does not resemble a little tin-type higher twitter voice he used in all other vowels. It was another singer burnt? It sounds to me. I would like to know." > <br /> Thank you so much.
