I loved this masterpiece and frankly I found Mary Poppins (though I love Julie Andrews and Dick VanDyke) to be silly and sacred. Angela Lansbury plays her character perfectly, and I don't know why people think this movie distorted. It was magical and was nice to watch. Every scene had a certain charm when it felt better. You will really see how this little family, together with each other, learns to relate to each other, regardless of their age and differences. I thought the characters were well developed, especially Charles, who was "The Incredible Age". Mary Poppins can be more popular and cherished by others, but this little pearl is what I always love and love.
