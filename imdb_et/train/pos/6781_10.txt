When an actor has to play an actor, fancy or factual role, this task becomes much more difficult than playing a role. The double life of the year exceeded Ronald Coleman himself as Anthony John, a tortured double personality. He put all that talent and sincerity on that character. Facial expressions, manners, walking and stance obviously spoke of what Anthony John Otello was playing on stage. Coleman also did very well as Shakespeare's actor in these short scenes, such as Othello, which was part of filmmaking. The closure of Coleman's face, when Othello tortured his doubts about Desdemona's fidelity, was worthy of himself. Add your character to despair and only someone with a sense of Coleman's depth of action. It was like watching Spenser Tracy dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, apart from this double role, were much deeper and more horrible. At the same time, Shelly Winters seemed so sweet, vulnerable and proud and added a film to her film. It is believed that Ronald Coleman liked his role in this film, especially when playing with others, and won in 1947 for the best actress in the Oscar. I'd see this movie repeatedly and never feel bored.
