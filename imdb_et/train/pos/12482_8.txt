I read something good about this movie, but finally I had the chance to watch it late yesterday and that's all I expected it to be and more. That's the right horror movie. I think the reason was so frightening that it was so realistic. The Spooky sounding score was ideal for dark mood setting. I liked the dramatic opening plan and enjoyed the rest of the movie playing. It was very easy to track and understand differently from some movies, which is too complicated. very good. I would love to see more horror movies like this one. It's just one of my favorite's. Realistic thunder and lightning storm would have set a nice atmosphere for this movie. Other then, he had all the elements of a good horror movie needs. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates a good scary movie that won't hit any strokes. I'll add it to my collection. The DVD has some interesting features.
