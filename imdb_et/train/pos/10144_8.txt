But fun is on the way. Yes, it's predictable and yes, it's a romantic comedy for a clich√©. But the idea is that it is a sweet story, the message of finding one true love also speaks in many ways. on a comic effect. The Bulgarian scene is worth the gold, this actor deserves a respected reputation! For those who made it predictable - If you want a movie with twists that will keep you ... you want a thriller. It is a romantic comedy ... it touched my heart and made me realize that I was lucky enough to find my true love in life and that it was a great effort. <br /> <br /> A great movie, a great movie for a happy cry ...
