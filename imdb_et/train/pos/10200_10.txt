All I hear is how bad the animation is. It may not be equal to what everyone is waiting for, but look at it that way. Would you expect perfection in hell? I believe the animation was made dry and sharp. It was nice to see the transformation of his character in this film, given that it is probably as close to living as we can ever get. I hope very soon. If we want a lively activity, I think we are better off with Chastity or Purgator. I don't think Lady Death is doing well on film. But be it as it is, this is my personal conviction that all the film naysayers are wrong with DEAD. Not intended.
