Sure Star Wars (a movie I've seen at least fifty times) wins all the other special effects, but this movie has everything else! <br /> <br /> He has horror (not graphical), romance, robots, witty repertoire, intelligence, (surprisingly good) special effects and drama. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie a few years ago with a recent hit on revival, and I was surprised how well it is today. I thought the old 40's style electronics would look hokey, but they saw some futuristic and modern ones. <br /> <br /> Ann Francis here (mostly) short skirts and bare feet, whose innocent innocence is a heavy attack of Krell's monster still scaring me. <br /> <br /> We all know, of course, that Galaxy has probably modeled a lot of this "Star Trek" movie. <br /> <br /> No one has ever been Robbit, Robot, personality <br /> <br /> (sorry, R2D2 and C3PO). <br /> <br /> This movie is generally the standard that all other Science Fiction movies have to measure up to! <br /> <br /> Honored reputation for haunted electronic scores that kept us all the needles and needles.
