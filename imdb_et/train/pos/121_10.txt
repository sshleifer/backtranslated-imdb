Critics have to look at what they watch as a quality film of the class. I think critics have seen too many animated films and have gone to the matrix style of films. Europa is a breath of fresh air, with so many layers of film that one viewing is not enough to understand or appreciate this outstanding film. Lars von Trier shows that old filming styles can create great cinema and create drama and tension. The retrospective effect used during the film creates and improves the characters and the focus of their conversation. Other effects he uses as color and black and white in one scene, such as Hitchcock and a red-haired girl, attract attention and increase the drama and meaning of the scene. The comment is excellent and has a hypnotic effect, retaining the focus on the average characters in the scene and the operations there. movie into your category and really movie drama. The movie to buy if you don't already have one, and one to see if you haven't done that.
