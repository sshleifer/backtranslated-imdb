When I hear a movie that is being talked about because it has no gender, violence, bad language, special effects, etc., my b.s. the detector goes out. Usually, such a film is a sentimental hogwash that is put on people who do not want to surprise them, but to affirm how high they are about us. So when David Lynch's STRAIGHT STORY began to receive such comments, I was afraid, especially since I was not his second "uprising" story, ELEPHANT MAN. For all the stunning images and the good deeds of this film, we seemed more interested than telling us than preaching. <br /> <br /> I don't have to worry. STRAIGHT STORY is an honest film rather than saccharin. Most of this is due to the fact that Lynch and writers John Roach and Mary Sweeney say that in most cases it is simple and simple. Straight has a couple of homilias that I could have done without, and the harvested fruit shots are repeating too much, but they are only capable. There is no hard hand, no sentimental string that jerked our emotions, and we do not turn our characters and its characters. Instead, they depend on creating their own power, and that is what the final scene we really are doing. <br /> <br /> Of course, adding Richard Farnsworth adds to reality. She is really someone who looks like she lived through a lot, but still perseveres, and except for those homilies, she doesn't seem to have to go back with her brother, too sensitive, because there is someone here who is also lived long and seen too much to drive this anger for a long time. And he knows that his time has run out so he wants to make peace, not just his brother, but his life. Sissy Spacek also makes a fine, unmanned job as a Straight daughter. And while I am a city and a suburban boy, Iowa and Wisconsin are beautifully shot, so I want to visit at least one day.
