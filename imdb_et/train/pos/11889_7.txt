Pialat, a well-written but principally harsh, low-life melodrama that, according to the accompanying interview with Isabelle Huppert, was infused by many autobiographical details; Considering mostly atypical signs, he does not make any compliments to him - and he seems to have been a troubled man because Huppert also says that Piala often disappears during the days of shooting! <br /> <br /> Operation is still great; Huppert and co-star Gerard Depardieu (as the character of the title!) Were at the forefront of modern French stars, despite their relatively young age - a status that achieved different successes both still remain. <br /> <br /> I have 3 more Pialati movies in my "VHS View" view, although all in French without English subtitles; thanks to this, but also to LOULOU's oppressive realism - despite its unquestionable artistic value - I can't say I'm particularly quick to check them now ...
