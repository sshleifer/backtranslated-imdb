Japan 1918. The story of a 16-year-old Ryu begins with the death of his father. As it turns out later, both of her parents are dead due to tuberculosis. In this desperate situation, Ryus's aunt has been marrying a Hawaiian husband who they only know about her picture. When he arrives in Hawaii, ryu discovers that his new husband is much older than a photograph and that he lives next to a sugar cane plant under very humble conditions when he is working. Ryu, who is not used to planting hard work and desperation in his own situation in his new home, thinks he is fleeing. He will soon discover that he has nothing to go to. Friendship Chicken, her female worker, gives her new hope and strength. This picture is based on the actual events of the years 1907-1920, when thousands of Asian women were married to American men whom they knew only about their picture. This very well-known image has been well written and worked. The location is breathtaking. In this film, Mifune Toshiro also looks like the last screen of Benshi (silent film narrator). This film gives some insight into Japanese culture here and across the ocean. Must See!
