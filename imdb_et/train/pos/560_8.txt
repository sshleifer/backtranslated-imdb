Another very good Mann is thanks to the combination of Walter Brennan and Jimmy Stewart's father / son. Brennan (Ben Tatum) is often a comic conscience of either Stewart or Wayne (Red River / Rio Bravo). He is there to see that the younger man takes a fork or bend. "You're wrong, Mr Dunston." Jeff Webster (Stewart) gives the impression that he only cares for himself, but it is clear that he cannot burn Brennan. John McIntire is an excellent Skagway law, respecting the record of justice for this reality. Another important topic is to help people and in turn help people. An individual cannot do it or suffer it. <br /> <br /> The title above is about Tatum's claim that he can't live without his coffee. This nicotine addiction is deadly. Probably the first and last time on the screen. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie and now have a DVD.
