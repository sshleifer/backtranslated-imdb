Men can go to Lollo if they want (or his fools - he gave his name to the French slang), but the ladies in the divine Gerard Philipe have a delicious tasty who is not only beautiful but also acting. Do not be discouraged if your version does not have subtitles, because in this simple, striking story of love and war, where everything is fair, they are not needed. All you need to know is that at the beginning of the movie, Lollobrigida reads Philipe's palm and tells him to marry the king's daughter. Then the story is quite common with Gaul's gestures and running, jumping and sword play. <br /> <br /> On the negative side, the story is obvious and the harsh vision of the tone is somewhat tiring. and it is annoying that the French seem to be too good than Hollywood to bother with even exciting tricks. And, of course, the non-French speaker leaves a random bit of ooh-la-la, for example: Virtuous girl: I have to tell you that my heart belongs to Fanfan. Seducer: My dear, what did you think I'm interested in this bagatelle?
