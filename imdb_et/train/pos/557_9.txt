When I traveled a few years ago from Skagway, Alaska Dawson City, Yukon and impressed landscapes, I can't help but I want this movie to be in a beautiful color and a picturesque view would come in the real place. Jasper in Rockies, Canada, is a great place, but still not the real place where the film takes place. When the story goes to Dawson, if I feel that Anthony Mann, who used the field conditions so well, could have done the best if he was in the actual place. James Stewart is here again a man who fights inside, one side does not want to intervene and help people who stand in his hand by earning money, and the other side is unable to look away from the murdered people. Ruth Roman is an ambitious woman who does not care about who she is, Corinne Calvet is a nice girl. Mann manages the shootouts perfectly, but the highest point of the movie is how well he is outdoors. He uses the outdoors as much as possible, and he was helped by the winter landscape, the dominant white, like The Naked Spur and The Man From Laramie. Like all Mann-Stewarts, this is a traditional western, where Stewart's character is more complicated.
