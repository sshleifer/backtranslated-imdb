Some of my favorite Laurel and Hardy films are very few. Instead, they give them a rather daily situation and let them have fun! Movies like HELP MATES and BUSY BODIES are more fun when you see a boys' work or cleaning house. Here at DIRTY WORK, most of the movies are similar to these two other films - Stan and Ollie are chimney sweeping and spend most of the movie trying to (rather unsuccessfully) crazy the professor's chimney. Seeing Ollie fall through the chimney, the boys make the house perfect, and Stanley's crazy behaviors work together to make a very pleasant movie. <br /> <br /> The strange twist also has a really strange sub-block that starts and ends the movie. The professor seems to be a really crazy scientist and he works with the formula to make things younger. At the end of the movie, you see him making a duck duck and even a duck bird! Given that he leaves boys alone in the room, is it a surprise what happens next? Although this sub-block was not necessary, it worked well. What worked exceptionally well was the middle part. Let the boys do something exciting and surprise you with fun results. One of the team's better movies and it earns almost 9.
