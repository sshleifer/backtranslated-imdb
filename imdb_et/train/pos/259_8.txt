In the case of the Danish film, I have to say that this is a very good film. <br /> <br /> It is in its class, but it has international potential. <br /> <br /> The film has a big budget and is one of the main famous Danish actors and some newcomers who play very well. It can be followed by anyone who likes adventures, and a little "ghost" movie. <br /> <br /> Don't be afraid, be excited!
