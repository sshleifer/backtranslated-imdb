I loved this movie from the age of 7 and I saw it on the opening day. It was so touching and beautiful. I strongly encourage everyone to see. It's far from watching your movie with your family. <br /> <br /> My MPAA rating: PG-13 for thematic elements, longer disasters, nudity / sexuality, and some language.
