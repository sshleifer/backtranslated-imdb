I saw a movie at Nashville Film Festival. It was beautifully done from cinematography to an actor. This is the story of the father and the son and how they value each other during the family crisis. The beautifully written dialogue, which never speaks wrong, shows actors Paul Reiser and Peter Falk, including in this outstanding story. The film begins with an aging father (Peter Falk) who is trying to find out why his wife (Olympia Dukakis) has left. Father presents himself without notice to his son and brother. Father and son will drive off the next day to look at some property and end the classic journey. They fish, play in the pool, watch baseball, get drunk, participate in baroque and dance with strange women. More importantly, they face unpublished tensions that can affect any family. This is a film that touches the heart and makes one one the closest to them.
