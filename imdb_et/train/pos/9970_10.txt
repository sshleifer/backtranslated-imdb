The superb use of overwhelming technical color illustrates the optimistic extreme features of today's Christmas ceremonies. The voyeuristic element of the images (Santa & Pedro collects the behavior of the society through the telescope) is unique (and probably seized by Jean-Luc Godard, although he was subtle, stole this topic in his film "Pierrot le-fou"). Highly recommended!
