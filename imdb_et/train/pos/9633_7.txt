In many ways, DIRTY WORK is a predictable L&H short, where boys are going to wipe someone up. Guess what happens next? This is the right hit with its most successful consequences. <br /> <br /> But there are one or two things that seem atypical. For example, Ollie is very unlikely, she is arrogant, she is rude and not just Stan to see how she addresses her "HEY YOU" and takes a childish huff very easily if she "has nothing to say". In short, Ollie is very unlikely to play the temptation and I would prefer to see her lofty coward, where she is always the funniest of her. <br /> <br /> DIRTY WORK has no other L&H shorts like Finlayson, Long, Busch and Housman it means that if we use the plotline of a mad scientist, then a somewhat creepy atmosphere that will wipe out with the rest of the movie <br /> <br /> Having said that it is still a good short mainly for Stan. Also watch the fish scene. Many L&H jokes / plots have fish and this is another one
