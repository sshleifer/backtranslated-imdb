Reda is a young Frenchman of Moroccan origin. Despite his Muslim heritage, he is very much in French in attitudes and values. Announcing the blue, Dad announces that Reda will drive him to Hajjisse (pilgrimage) to Mecca - something Reda is not interested in, but only agrees with the duty. As a result, Reda is angry from the start, but is a traditional Muslim person, her father is difficult to talk to or discuss his doubts. Both the father and the son seem very rigid and rigid - and it is very ironic when the father tells his son that he should not be so stubborn. <br /> <br /> As he reads the summary, he talks about how many characters grew and became familiar with each other. But I really don't think they did it and this is an exciting and sad aspect of the movie. Of course there were times of understanding, but so often there was hostility and repression. I liked it and appreciated that it hadn't been completely resolved - as if it had seemed fake. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film has worked well and is exciting - giving the West an unusual insight into Islam and Hajj. It also gives the fascinating side of traditional Islam and the secular younger generation. Although the whole movie's relationship is slow and unclear, it can be a bit irritating, I think it gave the film an intense realism and made it look like a movie - not in any form. Nice and unusual movie.
