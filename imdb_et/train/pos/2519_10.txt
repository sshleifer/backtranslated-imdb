This movie is really special. This is a very beautiful movie. Starting from three orphans, Sho, his brother Shinji and their friend Toshi, they are poor children who live on the street, but one day they managed to steal a bag full of money and then their ability to live, buy a house and their life seems to be much better. They make a new friend, friends of life. But something went wrong and they become enemies, and they all kill each other with them. Malice Mizer, Hyde-Solo, singer L'Arc ~ en ~ Cielis, so famous in Japan as well as Wang Lee-Hom - Taiwanese singer who is trying to become an actor, but it's not like other singers-actors -movies. They do a great job and have no previous experience with films (except Lee-Hom, who had been two films before). <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite movies. Maybe it's little because I'm a very big fan of Hyde, but it was the movie that made me discover him. <br /> <br /> Well, Gackt (the main character - the orphaned Sho) was part of a group who wrote the script, and it was he who asked Hyde to play Sho's friend Vampire Kei. At that time they didn't know each other, at least they didn't like their friends. But after the movie they became a really good friend, and it also shows us that they really did work on this movie and that they have good cooperation. , Hate, sadness, pain, loneliness, happiness and so on. I think the first hour is the best, it's so beautiful. After that, people die, Kei leaves and everything changes so much. But still it's a great movie, it's the only movie I've ever cried, it's so sad, but still beautiful. Because it's wonderful, but sad. You won't regret it. ^ ^
