I remember that movie as a child's sight in 1977 or 1978. HBO showed it back in the late evening when they were the only pay-per-view channel. Then it was UNRATED and it was the only kind of movie ever shown on pay TV ... especially at that time. I would like to see it as an adult, where I would be better at understanding the subject of adults. This was probably the closest thing I've ever seen in pornography at the age of 7-8. Fortunately, I had stupid babysitters and party parents on weekends. Most of the memory of this film was the totally uneven sexual behavior of these two boys. Breaking the underwear into the houses, feeding the alien's milk in a public bus, and abandoning one of the female booths were just some of those men pulled. Very proud movie in the early 70s. As long as I checked IMDb, I had no idea that this movie had the following. Most of the people I speak have never heard of it.
