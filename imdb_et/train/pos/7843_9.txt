I can't believe they took it out of the air. Especially if they had a few more episodes. My daughter, sister and some of my friends loved watching this example. We were so upset when they stopped showing it because of so-called ratings. It is not fair to people who look at this example from the beginning. We were right to see the end. I wish they would normally vote for all people who vote 3 times a year. They could post letters and we, as viewers, can give a general vote on all the programs we watch or hear. It can also help to promote the new exhibition. People would see it and don't know what it is. You have not only seen what viewers are watching, but you can also use it as a tool to advertise free television and cable TV. We want to see other episodes. Bring it back!
