A sober, reflexive piece, a small miniature that blossoms into a great human image that goes beyond the dramatization of the screen. This quiet little story keeps you amazing - if you don't have too many problems with various Spanish accents ranging from Mexico to Peru, and Marisa Paredes' most authentic Iberian peninsula! Garcíadiego is perfectly adapted to the novel: even the great maestro García Márquez should be proud of her excellent work. And hats for Arturo Ripstein, who has so painfully co-ordinated the entire pearl of the effort, ruby ​​and so refined, so elegant, so sensitive, so touching ..... <br /> <br /> El Coronel - Fernando Luján - Waiting for His Retirement while still living in his Colombian jungle deep into the ramshack wooden dwelling (but filmed elsewhere, EI in Colombia) with his fighting cousin and his wife (in that order?). And that's all for that. <br /> <br /> But, much more .... This movie is a rhodody. <br /> <br /> I have to see this poetic little piece again as soon as possible. It is worth 8 of the 10 high sides, which is very high on my scale. <br /> <br /> This is not a light commercial Hollywood stuff.
