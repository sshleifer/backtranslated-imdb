Great idea: 11 stories on September 11th. Directors with different outcomes from 11 different countries. Ken Loach talks about an immigrant (as usual) is just great (as usual). The Frenchman is also doing a great job, while the Burkina Faso film was a nice surprise. The Israeli film, however, was a bit boring, and the Mexican boy, he should direct and work in a Mexican restaurant. 8/10
