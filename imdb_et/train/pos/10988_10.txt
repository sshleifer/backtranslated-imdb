Don't read anything about this movie (especially something that could include a spoiler). Just watch this awesome movie, without knowing anything about it - and you really have a great experience. If you want to see an intelligent, twisted story: Go, go to the DVD and you're not really disappointed. "Cypher" is not really a sci-fi movie, a more psychological thriller based on a more globalized business environment. It concerns business secrets, how big companies spies on each other's research departments and the methods they use. The actors make excellent performance and the overall visual style of the film gives the perfect frost. Cypher is much deeper, more complicated, and - which belongs to the story and the end - also much, much more satisfying than Vincenzo Natali's other films "Cube" and "Nothing". In fact, this is one of the best films I've ever seen (and that's something I'm not really talking about for every five well-made flick). Unfortunately, you can't talk more about this movie without risking your own experience. Give her a chance. ;-)
