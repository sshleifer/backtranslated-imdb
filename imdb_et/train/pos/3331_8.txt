Of course I don't know anything about baseball, I'm not even a fan of sport, but it didn't stop me from enjoying the last movie of Farrelly's brothers, Fever Pitch, a charmingly failed romantic comedy. The film is not really baseball; rather, it is a relationship and an emotional divergence that can often occur. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Fallen ?? giving your best result? stars like Ben, dorky, a slightly naughty teacher. Ben is a guy-boy who has never really grown up and promotes almost fanatical addiction to the Red Sox baseball team. Ben has dedicated his life to Sox and does everything that makes pilgrimage to Florida for spring training to decorate every square in his apartment in teamwork. <br /> <br /> One day, Benin-Lindsey (excellent Drew Barrymore) meets Benin's meeting with his geometry class at Benin's office. Lindsey is an enterprising, career-oriented girl, but she has a sort of intelligibility that Ben finds completely loving. Initially, he didn't hesitate to ask him, he thought he was out of class, and Lindsey didn't see a potential partner right now in Ben. <br /> <br /> Their first date gets to a catastrophic start when Lindsey suffers from serious food poisoning? and his resonant retreat gives the first idea that we are actually watching Farrelly's brothers film. Instead of accepting Lindsey - rather an urgent - request to change the schedule, Ben remains around to play the sister, regular and caregiver. So Ben cleans the toilet and the dog's teeth while his love interest goes to the bed next to the bed. <br /> <br /> When Lindsey wakes up in the morning and finds that she sleeps on the couch, she begins the process of depriving her of a long and appropriate status and an ambitious web break that she has had to think of as standards. Soon they will fall in love, Lindsey accepts Ben's fanatic commitment to his sport. <br /> <br /> Having a legacy selection season tickets for your beloved uncle, has Ben arranged his life around the season? he has never left the game. But their relationship, which has not developed in the winter, hits the beginning of the season. <br /> <br /> Lindsey wants Ben to do other things like a vacation with her parents and with her friends. , but Ben has trouble changing his interests to reach Lindsey. Can Lindsey agree with her irrational commitment to summer boys to make their relationship work? Can he really attract Ben into sports? Can a hard and nervous Red Sox fan find true love? Of course, Lindsey and Ben come in a colorful assortment of friends. Lindsey's toughest, skinny, rich and blonde Robin (KaDee Strickland) insists that with whom she should be wrong if she is still alone at 30. However, chubby, curly Sarah (Marissa Jaret Winokur) and Molly (Ione Skye) offers a more optimistic and positive view to Ben. <br /> <br /> Ben's eccentricity can be applied to virtually any obsessive sports fan, while Lindsay's frustrations can be represented by any up-and-coming career-led woman. Fallon is terrible as Ben, which has a real big screen potential, overcoming the insignificant challenge of keeping Ben's insecure. Meanwhile, Barrymore is as charming as the workaholic Lindsey, especially when he tries to accept Ben, who doesn't lose sight of his needs. <br /> <br /> Fever Pitch really works and although there are many inspired comedic moments, the film is also dealing with a serious problem in sports addiction and how difficult it can be for couples to negotiate its fragile territory. <br /> <br /> A large part of the film was filmed at Boston Fenway Park, which adds a sense of fine authenticity to the proceedings, as well as the atmosphere of the games, although the assessment of the team's knowledge is likely to be limited to baseball enthusiasts. Even so, Fever Pitch is blessed with such a finely processed and intelligently funny script that even novice baseball fans will find a lot to connect with. Mike Leonard September 05.
