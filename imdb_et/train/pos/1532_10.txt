This, like Murder She Wrote, is one of those that shows that after a busy day I sit in front of the TV and watch. Why? Because I really enjoy it, and it's a shame that it's no longer in the air. Dick Van Dyke is amazing because Dr. Mark Sloan, a physician-turned detective, who solves his murders with his son. He has joined largely unaware but very competent support, namely his real son, Barry Van Dyke. Victoria Rowell is also good, but I noticed that every series becomes her hairstyle. I also liked Scott Baio and Charlie Schlatter, but I especially liked Michael Tucci Norman and was amazed at how he suddenly disappeared. This show is so entertaining, with great guest stars, it is sometimes somewhat obvious, like Colombo, but in every episode there is always something to hit. In conclusion, it is a great series with two thumbs and 10/10. Bethany Cox
