It was Eddie Robinson's 101st film and her last, and she died of cancer nine days after shooting. All this makes the film's most important scene even more sparse. <br /> <br /> Although some hair and clothing styles are dated (note the video game shown on the film), but the theme movie is pretty much timeless. Heston said he had wanted to make the film for a while because he actually believed in the dangers of overpopulation. <br /> <br /> Many things make this movie classic. This story is for sure. <br /> <br /> The exhibition is a top-notch interaction, especially between Heston and Robinson, also offered by Cotten and Peters. <br /> <br /> Music is absolutely perfect. The moods of Beethoven, Grieg and Tchaikovsky with pastoral visual elements make some truly moving scenes. It was a film on the shell of the film. <br /> <br /> The theme of a movie (or "point") is important. Yes, it is a movie with overcrowding, but for the more important remark, this is a deterrent story of what can go wrong with caring for the earth for humanity. In the subtext, you will find the real message of the movie. Pay attention to what Sol tells about the "old days" of the past (which is our present) and how Thorn cannot understand what Sol says. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of my top sci-fi movies ever.
