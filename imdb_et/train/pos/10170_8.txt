Contrary to opinions from another review, this film was really surprisingly good! I was reluctant to look at it and I assumed they were suffering from clich√©s, obvious jokes and an over-all impression, all of which were the promises of the trailer. acting. Only one "toilet belt" will actually overwhelm realistically funny scenarios on Over Her Dead Body and, with nothing too much to break, some animal moments will be fun. <br /> <br /> A good movie is all there is; Script, director and actors and comparing some other recent experiments with romantic comedy, this movie is high. <br /> <br /> Of course, you are not going to learn or wake up, but if you go with open minds, it's more than likely a good time!
