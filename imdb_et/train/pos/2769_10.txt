In this film, everything is big and big in the 1950s - 60s. But it is perhaps the first to actually humanize the biblical characters. The best thing is that it doesn't diminish them in the eyes of the viewer. It is a unique and convincing balance that helps us understand that even great people like David are the wrong people who find their faith and greatness before their mistakes. <br /> <br /> The actors are first of all Gilbert Barnett as Absolom, David's second son, through the excellent Susan Hayward as Bathsheba. Hayward is the best in this movie. His own real, but bigger than the lifestyle in which he operates is pretty home. He is never seductress, but he plays a role in making you sympathize with him. <br /> <br /> Raymond Massey does a great job like the prophet Nathan. As a child when I first saw the film, Massey seemed to be really talking to the Lord and was a fantastic sight. Undoubtedly, the great music produced by the amazing Alfred Newman, who also had great success in other biblical pieces, such as "The Robe" and "The Greatest Story Ever Told", along with another 100 films, also contributed to it. Leon Shamroy's film photography is well done and increases the size of the film as well as its closeness. The truly undervalued film director Henry King, who likes William Wyler, never pulls into a genre, pulls a bigger than biography that never loses the love story of David and Bathsheba and David's own deep struggle with their faith in God. The length of this movie's journey could have been very hilarious, but the king keeps it really and interesting. In addition, we never lose intelligence when we try to understand God's will, as David himself is. The first scene where a soldier dies trying to destroy the ship. David is not satisfied with Nathan's answer (paraphrase) that no one understands God's will. This is the journey we are going to start right at the powerful end where David has finally faced himself. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie belongs to Gregory Peck, who is wonderful as King David. His David is the person with whom you can believe that he would ruthlessly rule the country, but he was a loyal singer of the psalms. This is one of his best productions. <br /> <br /> I don't see this movie on television anymore, but if I don't, I never see it. I think it is very good today.
