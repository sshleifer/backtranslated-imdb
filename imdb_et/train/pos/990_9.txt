I liked this movie. Of course, the idea is pretty much there ... the federal government arranges for a small-time theft jaw to implant a tracking device to attract a more dangerous thief / computer hacker to hide. But Alvin Sanders, a man who has been implanted with the device by "feeders", is a very pleasant person and turns out to be getting some time off with him. Finally, Alvin proves himself to be much more than good humor, but a passive or one-dimensional character when he shows that he is not nearly as easy to manipulate as he may seem. Definitely worth a look.
