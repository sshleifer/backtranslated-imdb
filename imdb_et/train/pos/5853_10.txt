I really liked this Summerslam, because it is the look of the square, the curtains and just the look was for some reason interesting to me. Anyway, it could have been one of the best Summerslam ever, when the WWF didn't have Lex Luger in the main event against Yokozuna, now it's time to have a huge fat man and a strong man, but I'm happy to have changed. It was a terrible major event, like any game that Luger is terrible. Other games on the map were Razor Ramon vs Ted Dibiase, Steiner Brothers vs Heavenly Bodies, Shawn Michaels vs. Curt Hening, an event where Shawn named his great bodyguard Diesel, IRS vs 1-2-3 Kid, Bret. Hart first takes Doink and now takes Jerry Lawler, and Hart and Lawler things were always very interesting, then Ludwig Borga was destroyed by Marty Jannetty, Undertaker took Giant Gonzalez's second terrible game, Smoking Gunns and Tatanka took Bam Bam Bigelow and defeated and Yokozuna defeated the world title against Lex Luger. This game was boring and has a terrible ending. But it deserves 8/10
