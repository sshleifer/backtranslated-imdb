This wonderful little film has all the elements that made the spaghetti in the West so exciting and fun: great music (one of the few, if not the onlyâ€¦ female film that would work in the genre, Nora Orlandi), EXCITING sequences (and very cruel days!) And BEAUTIFUL scenery and sets (all in Almeria, of course in Spain). It also has a very good story with a great tragic edge of romance. Actors do great jobs - with real performances by Lawrence Dobkin and Rosalba Neri (the most important role of a woman in Spaghetti West ... outside of Cardinale's Leone "Once in a Time West"). Without posting spoilers, just let me say that this movie contains one of the best ends of any best movie.
