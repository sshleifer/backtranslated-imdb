I rented a movie (I don't think it got a theatrical release here), waiting for the worse. Previews made the movie terrible. I was really very surprised, it was worth watching; it was loosely written, almost like a piece of the band. There were some very funny moments in it, and the people in the exhibition and the show are bad satire without being too funny. This is flawed, mainly because of the terrible sound of the buggy "comedy" effects, but in general it is both fair and common in the form of an altmanesque or Larry Sanders. <br /> <br /> At this point, this fashion is critical to Jerry Springer, he is also a simple target. Springer could have made Citizen Kane and it would be declared "the worst movie". I recommend this movie for everyone. An error, but an innovative and interesting film.
