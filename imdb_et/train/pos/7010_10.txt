Before I see this movie, I can see a lot of comments that everyone has a good view of the film is good or bad ... <br /> <br /> What I really want to steer is the acting of Woody Harrelson. on behalf of, he may not be in many parts of the film, but when he appears or even in the introduction, I was surprised by the "message" of Will Smith and Woody Harrelson, which they tried to create and maybe slip to the end of the plot to really understand what was going on . <br /> <br /> I am not a very sentimental person, I believe that good deed should not be a pity. But there are not many movies to show redemption that I think could show. It's one of those who can. <br /> <br /> I agree with one person who commented on this movie that "suicide" is a fall, but I don't think it's a "message" that the movie is trying to send, but "sacrifice." A bit extreme, but it's a message in my opinion. <br /> <br /> This movie has the potential. It's worth every penny, the script is incredible. from a person who does not really like watching drama films ... if you like drama, then it has to go.
