Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger exchange the bad role they found "All brothers were brave". Taylor seems somewhat uncomfortable with his bad guy, but Granger plays his part completely. But the real hero story is bison and northwest. The film is perfectly made, perfectly with the atmosphere of those times. The direction is tense, and although the film is not frivolous entertainment, it is my way of thinking as a big film that cognoscent ignores unfairly.
