As a Pokémon fan, I enjoyed this movie very much. It introduces the new legendary Pokemon (as every movie does) and adds depth to the relationships between its characters. But I do not expect those who are not Pokémon fans to enjoy it (this also includes MOST adults). Some of the lines were dirty, but it may be somewhat inevitable if the movie is copied to English. The animation was beautiful though there were a couple of parts that didn't look good. And while the villain is a kind of rhinitis, I think the movies have done a good job of cycling through different types of villains and I guarantee you that they are not all such. Those who did not like it, I say to everyone, but the Pokémon fans love it.
