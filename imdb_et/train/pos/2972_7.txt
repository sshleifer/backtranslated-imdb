I have to admit that I am a big fan of South Park and waited for Basketball to be funny but not as good as it turns out! I think this happens when you mix up David Zucker, Matt Stone and Trey Parker. This movie has so many playback values, and at no point will it bother you seriously. Kivi and Parker mixed lipstick-type humor works just fine. The humor in the basketball was not popular during this release and had come out today. Don't try to be critical, just leave your brain at the door and wait for an endless laugh. Recommended for anyone with a good sense of humor.
