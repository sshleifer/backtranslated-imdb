I waited until July 4th to write it because. . . well. . . because it just knows the right to do that on that day. <br /> <br /> In 1924, D.W. Griffith needed a hit because he didn't have a bigger one because it was ORPHANS OF THE STORM (1921). He has been working ever since, but his films were smaller and could not reach the target audience. He planned for Patrick Henry when he contacted the American Revolution Girls (DAR) who asked if he could expand his ideas to include more of the American Revolution. This movie is the result. By the time he had finished, he had a 14-story history lesson and there was no trace of Patrick Henry. <br /> <br /> We all know the story of the revolutionary war, but Griffith threw a love story with Patriot farmer Nathan (Neil Hamilton), who loves Tory's aristocrat Nancy Montague (Carol Dempster, Griffith's leading woman). The difficult question is that Nancy's father hates Nathan. . . well not only Nathan, he hates all rebels. It does not matter if anyone on the Lexington streets is attacked by Nathan, causing his weapon to be emptied and accidentally wounded by Nancy's father. <br /> <br /> The Love Story Parallel is (mostly true but partially) decorated with the story of the resurrection of Captain Walter Butler (Lionel Barrymore) from a British officer who feels he is not indebted to anyone. Thousands of Indians form six nations on his side, hoping that the colonies will break and become the monarch of his own empire. <br /> <br /> Comparisons with National BIRTHS (1915) are inevitable. The Montague family can also be from the earlier movie Cameron, while Nathan could be part of the Stoneman family. The order of the Battle of Bunkerim√§e is staged very similarly to the scene that is located in the COUNTRY BRIEF with the attacking army, in this case Redcoats, which falls into the pit filled with patriots. The only thing missing is Henry Walthall, who downloaded No Man's Land to put a cannon on the cannon. Amazingly enough, the American battle scenes lack the energy of the scenes of the BIRTH battle and they don't pull the audience. Something's obviously gone. It's not the scope, G.W. The work of "Billy" Bitzer camera is pretty good. Maybe it's missing. . . I dare say that. . . sincerity? <br /> <br /> Capt. Butler's and his men's cruelty is well-emphasized, although much of it takes place long or off. Do not expect any head in the neighborhood to be hit, as we saw in INTOLERANCE (1916). In one scenario, Butler's second command, Captain Hare (Louis Wolhiem), captures the eyes of the imprisoned colonist. We only see the beginning of the act, the rest of the camera focuses on Hare's face, because obviously it has a good time. Lionel was already working with Griffith in 1912. The story goes to Griffith and D.W., listening to the reputation of his famous family, said, "I don't hire directors." Lionel replied, "And I'm not like that, sir!" He makes a very good and quite incredible villain. Louis Wolhiem appeared three times with John Lionel's older brother; SHERLOCK HOLMES and DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE (both 1920s) and later in TEMPEST (1927). Like Captain Hare's natural staring eyes and unpleasant hair, not only does he mean a cable but he thinks he's pretty crazy. <br /> <br /> Neil Hamilton later pointed out that America was his first time on horses and "I was afraid of death." He hides his dissatisfaction very well, and we can believe he was quite a cavalry when the shooting was over. Mr. Griffith was very in love with Carol Dempster and at one point he asked to marry. He refused and soon left his company, after which his status gradually deteriorated. <br /> <br /> Speaking of horses, Paul Revere came up with an occasionally amusing moment while driving, which was supposed to be a non-script. He drives his horse directly to the front of the family to report: "Hands! Regulars come!" but when he tries to leave the horse, the horse cannot step back and stumble down! I'm surprised that Griffith didn't do the other. <br /> <br /> So America is classic? YES! Don't wait until July 4 to see it, it's always enjoyable.
