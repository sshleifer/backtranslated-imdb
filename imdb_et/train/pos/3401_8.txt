Innovative Technicolor Cinematography (winner of special technical achievement Oscar) is truly enchanting. Add an endless variety of glamorous costumes and a romantic cinema dream team, like Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer, and you have a pretty nice picture. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, both the experienced plot and the superfluous blower will work a lot. However, there have been no breathtaking Technicolor films before (1936), and since then there have been very few films that can experience this amazing eye-catching color. Cinema fans who have enjoyed the famous color art of "Robin Hood" (1938), "Jesse James" (1939) and "Gone With The Wind" (1939) are not disappointed with the fantastic work done here. "Allah Allah" is always synonymous with brilliant color art.
