In 2006, AMPAS produced one of the most innovative documentaries that depict natural life at the coldest place on Earth, that the film was the March Penguins, which was awarded by award-winning academician Morgan Freeman. <br /> <br /> Walt Disney Studios has been a monopoly animated circle for decades. They have taken their storms while making their live films and have hit and missed the whole board. Disney then created Disneynature and released his first feature film "Earth". This is absolutely one of the most touching and informative documentaries I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I am not talking about the great James Earl Jones that Earth is not offering anything to anyone who has been following the Discovery Channel for the past five years, or is following the global warming crisis very closely. Earth is very deeply touched on this issue and is very liberal about the issue. <br /> <br /> This allows for an emotional bond with nature that I have never experienced before. It also shows not only the beauty and mystifying parts of our glorious planet, but also the often terrible and disturbing aspects that accompany it. One thing is to see how "Mufasa" falls from the rock to slipping or the Bambi's mother comes in the middle of the forest in the middle of the forest. It's all good because at the end of the movie we know it's just this movie. It shows penguins, polar bears, elephants, families of all kinds, from all walks of life who live and die in their natural habitats. These real things make for a true movie experience. <br /> <br /> Although the film is a bit harder (which many people disagree with), Earth is an inviolable experience. Here's an amazing camera team and George Fenton's amazing stunning cinematography. Compared to Penguins or Grizzly Man's March, this is not really a measure, but it is great. At the end of the day, you grow our planet's appreciation and a little bit of sadness, because many of us are unlikely to get to the places we know in the film. We are still living here, it's like we can never study the planet for one reason or another. Earth is beautiful. <br /> <br /> *** / ****
