Indian cinema is characterized by two broad categories of police: they are either honest or bad guys. Honest boys always shout at the top of their voice and fight with the system, while bad police officers mostly enjoy but end up suffering. <br /> <br /> This movie interrupts at least the usual formula and gives a refreshing view and life. The direction takes an inner look at the young ambitious policeman who. Music is interesting and editing is a trend that stretches towards Indian cinema. <br /> <br /> The time of the movie is slow and the dilemma Anbu sees in Maya has been played over at times. But I would give it another 9/10 just because he has a lot of credit.
