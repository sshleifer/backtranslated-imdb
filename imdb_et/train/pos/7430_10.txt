Personality I really loved this movie and it excelled me in particular. The two main actors give us such great performances that, at the end of the day, it really is a break of heart to know what happened to these characters in the end. The song is just great as they are. That's why I wasn't surprised when I found out that he had won 5 golden world awards (the most prized film of gold globes), Oscar and even Grammy. This movie is a classic that everyone deserves to see. A big movie that has often been criticized (perhaps because Streisand dared to get involved, certainly as a "co-director"). Her artwork is the greatest and you will definitely like it!
