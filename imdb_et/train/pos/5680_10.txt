The holy crap it's so hysterical! Why aren't American comedies written like that? For anyone who thinks comedy must be stupid, the six episodes of this series have more wisdom and intelligence than the novel. Hugh Laurie is a complete hoot. I couldn't believe it was the same man as the House! There are so many great features and gags in this series that you can watch every tens of times and still new things every time. Rowan Atkinson is cheerful and put on the butler Edmund. This is my Blackadder series favorite. And Tony Robinson is great than ever when a series of funny hearts, "oppressed mass" Baldrick. Some of my favorite lines: "If someone interferes with Wellington, he puts him on foot" and Baldrick explained how he got his name and cousin Macadder's "top kipper salesman" and a swordsman killing from Scotland.
