As a big fan of the original, I excluded a movie like a plague when bad reviews started eight years ago, but I ended up with this movie and saw that it was really a pleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> Okay, if you are looking for original protection, you're very disappointed, but if you're looking for something quite different, a bit sharp and political, it's your movie. <br /> <br /> Gregory is now thirty-four and works as a teacher at his old general school, where he acts as a fellow citizen and has sexual dreams about one of his students. When a student asks for a meeting with Gregory, there are a number of failures that involve torture, breakage and entry, and all kinds of unexpected turns that I felt alive and moving. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something original, I recommend this movie. I just want more people to have seen it when it was released and saw it for what it really is.
