Although the word "megalmania" is used a lot to describe Gene Kelly and sometimes her dancing is too rigid, you have to admit that the man knows how to show. In America, in Paris, he is choreographing some outstanding numbers, some of which stop the plot but are still amazing. (Check out Gene Kelly's "Getting Started Routine" for "Startups") Hoary's story sure, but the musical number will save the show here! I really loved Georges Guitar's voice in it. His "staircase to the stairs" and his duet with Le Gene 's' wonderful' is wonderful. Oscar Levant and Leslie Caron, whom I can take or leave. All in all, it's a pretty good, but not a dynamic movie.
