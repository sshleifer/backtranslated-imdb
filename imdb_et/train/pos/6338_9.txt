I really liked the movie I saw a few times with the original classic, but it couldn't remember any details. I think this movie is much better than a comic, which is not as black and white as it is. I liked how they made such a complete character and gave the reason why he was, as he was, the villain of the movie was not the actual Grinch, but big, much different than the original comic. Jim Carrey was the perfect part of everything that was a great movie for both kids and adults.
