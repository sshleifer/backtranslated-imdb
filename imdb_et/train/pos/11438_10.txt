Ralph and Mumford, who have fallen out of their land, were hit by Synanomess Botch's involuntary pawns. Twice the time is their story, the characters they meet, and their struggle to get things right. With a surprisingly impressive sound and excellent voice that works for some of the best companies in the world, it strikes an amazing film mark. is much smoother and much more three dimensional. If I didn't know that the animation was that style, I swear it was a traditional pen and ink. If you can watch this movie in Dolby Surround or THX, please PLEASE! You won't miss anything if you don't, but if you do, you'll get a lot more experience!
