Robert Jannuci, Luca Venantini, Venantino Venantini, Alicia Moro (two stars from the city of residence (I mean what Luca is doing these days, probably a lawyer or something like Bela Lugosi Jr. or David Hennessey is there a dark shadow boy) who wants to forget the dark shadows .) In any case, Thorn EMI does not have a credit for opening a video, but music is great when it is inserted. music ... my favorite scene is with my son, whose robot is under his hand alone in the Alien desert, and says why you follow me, Tommy answers because I know it. says West, then Alien says well, I'm going east, so after walking for a while, Alien plays the background in the play and sees Tommy sitting on the rocks that put the pet hamster on ... tommy is waiting and tells Alien who took you so long ... I love this movie ... It touches my heart. A boy with a robot arm needs a dad and Alien has been made up for Tommy's father in the desert. . . oh yeah, they also need water. . . not MAD MAX 2 in any way but silly Western / post nuke with a robot card boy and Alien and Trash and some other good guys with an average chick with iron nail and CRAZY BULL who looks like Wez in a road war. . On Sunday afternoon on the 57th channel (Philadelphia, PA) I came home after the church and found it. . . often. . . too often. Love it. 10/10
