The Disney movie that dares to do something else should at least be tightened. The "holes" do not make the same mistakes as a Disney movie about teenagers in difficulty. For the first time, events are not explained in detail. Backward scenes are really a goal and provide a number of mature themes that can surprise the viewer. I have to admit that the seriousness of the film was first put down a bit. But soon I realized we had to endure these moments to see the story of beauty. In addition to this story, this film is also good at questioning some of the methods used in repair facilities. (One example where Caveman is forbidden to teach Zero to read because they have to build holes to create a character, as reading does not contribute). "Holes" is a smart and beautiful film. Must Look!
