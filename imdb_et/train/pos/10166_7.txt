I watched it on an 8-hour flight and (probably due to pressure and altitude) that I actually found in a fun way ("soft" pressure). <br /> <br /> The real idea of ​​the movie was great: the woman dies, her groom loves someone else, she decided to make sure they don't get together, but she finally lets her do it. Unfortunately, the actual movie wasn't that good. OK, there were some laughs and the participants worked well. But from the beginning, the plot was about as predictable as the plane's destination. I think the whole gay but non-gay friend who had the story of it could have worked much better. The parrot was a nice idea, but to be honest: it wasn't really funny. <br /> <br /> All in all, the movie was more interesting than watching a seat in front of me, but it was close to calling.
