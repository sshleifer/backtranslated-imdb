I saw a movie description in TCM and just let it run because I like both Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, so I was delighted to really like the movie and found it completely exceptional. Of course, this is a serious date, but as a period of time it is worth looking at just a little humor, which looks almost 40 years ago about life and lifestyle. Now the only problem is trying to find it on the DVD so I can watch it more often. I also did quite a bit with the performances of Smith and Ustinov, Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and Robert Morley and Cesar Romero.
