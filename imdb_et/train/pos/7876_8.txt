I didn't like the Chandin bar from the same director. <br /> <br /> I didn't watch his other movies. They came and went. <br /> <br /> But Page-3 is well done. It seems real. Just like Satya RGV, the so-called higher society mental illness was a movie summary. In the midst of all illnesses, it's hard to lead a normal life that the main character Konkana Sen does. Serious movie that you shouldn't watch with children or wait for women. Newspaper page 3 is a common place to report on the rich and elite group activities that give much more mess than has been reported. The film shows how this is also a business opportunity. Event organizing companies can pay to organize political parties and make rich but not famous people famous overnight by clicking on photos of celebrities invited to the party. <br /> <br /> Western culture has deeply penetrated into Mumbai society. The film shows it boldly, in some way. <br /> <br /> Madhur Bhandarkar is starting a new journey from here.
