Get started with Ed Furlong. You have to. God blesses this child. $ 5 dollars says that the movie he's playing in this movie is what he's actually living. He has one or two liners that almost hit me because the script has a subtle sense of humor. You know all the research that this man has gone through in recent years, and it doesn't even look like Furlong even works. Maybe his result was good. Same with Madsen. You're still thinking, "I bet this guy is really alive." Does Madsen even have to act? Just natural. Vosloo has apparently moved forward from the type of mummy he has chosen. I think the biggest surprise in this movie was the performance by Jordana Spiro. His reactions are in this movie spot. I fought when he was hot or not, but I realized I would like to see him more. <br /> <br /> Not a big fan of shoot / hostage-type movies. But what I am is movies with many turns to try and keep you away. It's not just your usual robbers over the bank, they kill hostages and good guys to win the final movie. The rear continues ... and coming. <br /> <br /> Coffee flights work best with handheld cameras to show you what it really is. Not glossed over a bit. Think like a Bourne Ultimatum "lite" style on some coffee scene. <br /> <br /> And for the Bo Bice fanatics that show it, the actor Curtis Wayne (who is playing Karl) makes double-take. These guys are twins. <br /> <br /> As I looked, I wondered why some of the participants had strangers accents and what they did in this small town. It was finally realized that these people smuggled things into other countries / countries to have these accents. What's more, bonus features show how some manufacturers wanted to make this movie to an international audience with some of the stars we didn't hear. And some of them are hot. Moncia Dean? I need to say more.
