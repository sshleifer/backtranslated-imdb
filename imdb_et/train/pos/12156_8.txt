Some details of this story are based very slowly on the actual events of that era in which it was placed. The story combines some of the details of the famous Leopold and Loeb case with Aimee Semple McPherson. <br /> <br /> The story begins with the hound of two mothers (Shelley Winters and Debbie Reynolds) when they leave the courtroom. It seems that the crowd is most deliberate to make a crowd because their sons were convicted of evil excitement. One crowd strike shows that Winters' hand is coming in the car. <br /> <br /> Soon after they get home, they start threatening phone calls, so Reynolds recommends that both go west along the coast and open dance school. The dance school is a success and they satisfy incredibly unpleasant parents who think their child is the next Shirley Temple. One of the parents of these spoiled children is multi-dimensional, who has been beaten with Reynolds and they are getting acquainted. Life seems very good. But when the threatening phone calls begin again, Winters responds when he approaches the psychotic breakthrough and goes back and forth to faith - listening to the radio almost "sister Alma". Again and again you see the edge of Winters and finally culminates in very bad things! I'm not saying more because it can spoil this interesting and interesting movie. Baby Jane? "," Straight-Jacket "and" Nanny ". Although none of them are exactly the intellectual price, they are extremely fun and fun at the kitsch level. great, because the fragile and demented lady and Reynolds play one of the sexiest 39-year-olds I've ever seen - and she can really dance. so, but when you meet sister Alma, she looks sincere and does not look so I took Winters' religious zeal as just a sign of madness - which I assume is all that was meant. Aunt Aunt's Aunt? ‚Äù- another Shelley Winters fear film from 1971. Both are very fun ... and quite assaults!
