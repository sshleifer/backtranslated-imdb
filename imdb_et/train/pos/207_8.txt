At first it seemed like a boring comedy, like The Odd Couple, but when I got into it, it really turned out to be a funny movie. Basically, former comedians Willy Clark (Golden Globe winner and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Walter Matthau) and Al Lewis (Oscar winner and Golden Glove named George Burns) were a great comedy duo that brought their hospital scheme to revive the TV show. Willy's nephew Ben Clark (Golden Globe wins Richard Benjamin) is sure they can get together again if they don't want to know each other how wrong he is. They can't go on all the time, they both forget, especially during the conversation, but they do it at last. Also starring Lee Meredith as a sketch sister (Miss McIntosh), Carol DeLuise, Mrs Doris Green, Al's daughter, Rosetta LeNoire in Odessa, Willy's sister and Muppets in space as F. Murray Abraham mechanic. I think the best line of the movie is Burns, noting that Matthau called him "the son of a bitch". It was named the best artistic structure and best writing, the Oscar for other materials adapted to the scenario, it was awarded the best scenario of BAFTA and it won the Golden Globe Best Motion Picture - musical / comedy, and it was nominated for Best Scenario. Very good!
