The first time I came to Delirious, I heard it only. I listened to the whole comic performance and I've never laughed so much in my life. Eddie's ability to paint fun pictures in the senses and make a great imitation is exciting. When I finally saw her, I had to do it. Eddie Murphy's presentation on Delirious shows her genius! Since it was a new millennium, his actions in 1983 are as funny as they were today. My parents loved it as teenagers and I (18 years old) love it too. From that moment on, I had to watch Murphy's other movies like Coming To America and Harlem Nights. The second comic like Eddie won't come.
