For me, this review may include a spoiler, but I like movies despite the NO idea of ​​what happens, so I think many other reviews of this movie include a spoiler! <br /> <br /> I just watched this movie again and I have to reaffirm that he has the best movie for any movie. Never. Never. Never. The real translation of "Butterfly Wings Beating" has not been translated as a strange title. I think they thought most Americans didn't know what chaos theory was (except for those who saw or read "Jurassic Park"). The film is based on chaos theory and how a small event can affect the results of seemingly independent events that all lead back to one event. The film is a wonderful cause and consequence because we follow the chaos chain because it intertwines between several characters (about 20?). In some ways, the ending nevertheless seems inevitable, but if you think it is the perfect end. Think for yourself, "What else do you need to say"? At the same time, this is a very bold end. It is too bad that we have to go to such pearls abroad, but such an end will never be out of Hollywood. <br /> <br />
