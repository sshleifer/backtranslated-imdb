Much has been said about "psychological western countries", but it is one of the few that really exists in this genre. It has big stars with stars that perform very well, but it's a good movie director. Stewart Granger loses his British safari hunter's stereotype to play a haggard pensioner who is honored in the West as one of the best. Robert Taylor plays upstream (unlike ordinary youngsters, Taylor's character is also middle-aged) who wants to kill the buffaloes and attracts Granger to his business. They hire two other big nameslots, Lloyd Nolan and Russ Tamblin, for their skins. The Granger worships the bull that he has killed, knowing that he can blame when they die, knowing that if they are extinct, they will suffer greatly from the way the American native lives. Taylor will soon open the sadistic side, but this is a realistic way of thinking, unlike the one-dimensional sadists of modern films created by nerds and dorks. He's insecure and needs a human companion. But he won't stop murder. The end result ends in two against each other. The psychological impact they do is well illustrated.
