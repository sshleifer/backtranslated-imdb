It was seen many times as a child 15 years ago, and now that I found it again, it still has a movie experience like some others. If it is risky, it is a great example of the moral and lifestyle that is recommended for a family with small children. Although it is still an adult, I was lucky to have learned it many years ago. Trying to find it today is hard enough. . . but believe me, it's worth whatever age. Above all, Anime fans find this great entry into Masami Hata's filmography. With an impressive work of art and unique design, Chirin No Suzu is a valuable experience. Although some lyrical songs are not so hot when recorded in English, the musical result is still exciting. But even dealing with the voice is much better than it was released today. Unfortunately, RCA went out of Columbia Home Video since the mid-1980s and has not become a new format for my knowledge, at least in the US. Look at this and you're quite happy! It is an artistic, intense, enjoyable and important landmark of Japanese animation.
