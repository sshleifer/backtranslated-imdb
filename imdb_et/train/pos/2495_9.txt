Weird, witty and wonderful imagination of family life! Writer Andrew Marshall has written something that is funny, predictive and sometimes scary! Yes, don't be fooled by 2 points4 children with cheerful tuning and effervescent stars; the show has a dark side and sometimes it can be quite chilling. And that's just as good about the show, it's not just a simplified sitcom, where every character is a 2D comic device (My Family). Instead, the characters are completely rounded, showing a complete roll of human emotions. Sometimes the dark moments, such as Bill, which is cursed by the curse, and Ben awakening in a strange village, are two examples of an exhibition that takes a surreal, blind turn, which adds a little bit of depth. Of course, this exhibition is also incredibly funny and will give you a smile. This is a real shame Eureka Video has ended its distribution of comic gold on DVD. Veoh.com is your last hope to get unsuccessful episodes in stores.
