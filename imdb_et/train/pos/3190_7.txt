This is your usual 30s musical comedy with a big plus that it has some well-known 30th-century actresses in small fun creeps. <br /> <br /> The story is not much and basically the movie is all its fun and the overall atmosphere is not concerned, typical Hal Roach comedy concerns it. Appereantly this is the "Cinderella story", but I certainly didn't think so when watching the movie. The story is very confusing to storytelling, which has many different characters and many small front panels as the main characters hit Hollywood studios. <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie is highlighted when Laurel & Hardy looks and shows some of her routines. It's like watching a movie and playing Laurel & Hardy for free. Laurel & Hardy's regular Walter Long also appears as a short-lived leader of the routine and James Finlayson (without a mustache this time). <br /> <br /> It is true that all the squirrels and sub-blocks interfere with the main area's character and character, but in this case it is not a problem, as its all the way is more fun and interesting to look than the main plot line and the low typical main character. <br /> <br /> The film is definitely not inferior to any other genre films of this time period, although the rating given here suggests otherwise. <br /> <br /> 7/10
