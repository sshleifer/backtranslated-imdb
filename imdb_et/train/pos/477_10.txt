Hi, I'm a male enthusiast from the age of 6. I thought I was very shocked, but hopefully not as much as the central character of this movie. <br /> <br /> The central feature of this movie is the real male player Curt von Bardeleben, who committed suicide in 1924. He is famous for the game he played with Steinitz, where the beautiful combination played Steinitz. Instead of leaving, he just went out of the tournament, never returned. <br /> <br /> The social failure of a central character is, unfortunately, the treatment of some of the more serious Grandmasters that you sometimes get in chess tournaments. I think chess is a very great sacrifice and you can sometimes lose balance in other areas of life. The main example of this is the male legend Bobby Fischer. Although it was a genius, he was disturbed in many ways. <br /> <br /> The film depicts the World Championship, such as the Italian Grand Master and Luzhin. The format is crowding, which in fact is the Fide's leading body sometimes used itself as a format - from 128 players to just 2 finalists. But it was a crowding out of the group, which also represents a realistic format where the winners of each group play against each other. <br /> <br /> The position before the interruption will make you a fascinating fever. In fact, I've made a youtube video about getting to know the winning combination in detail - enjoy! http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=XZPtdtPhwdM Best Wishes Tryfon
