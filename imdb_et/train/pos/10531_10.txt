I love this movie. My friend Marcus and I were browsing the local Hastings because we had the desire to rent something we had never seen before and that fine movie was overwhelmed. We had no idea what it should be, but it turned out to be remarkable. 2 thumbs up. I liked how they were filmed, and the actors were very funny. If you are looking for a funny movie that also makes you think that I recommend that you run your local video store quickly and find that movie. I'd tell you some of my favorite items, but it can spoil your movie so I won't. This movie is definitely on my top 10 movie listings. Do you really think nothing is hell?
