The surreal movie noir will appear shortly after the "real" genre "The Maltese Falcon", "Double Indemnity", and "Postman will always travel twice." Welles movies should not be judged against others. He played different rules. In fact he played. It starts where other femme fatale films leave, so the vaguely logical (but interesting) wolf art adorns Welles' scenes (typical fast-fire style), dialogue (many "hard-boiled" philosophy) and unusual action (Good Hayworth apparently deliberately one-dimensional). Welles' "genre" may have meant "formula", but he seemed to be using "mysteries" as a background for his "entertainment".
