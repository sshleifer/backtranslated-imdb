Blade Runner (Deckard is a replicator!), <br /> <br /> The City of Missing Children (extended senses or any used and abused and mostly well, just giving us much less than we dream) and <br /> <br /> /> Dark City: <br /> <br /> They really should be added. <br /> <br /> For some time now I've been waiting for an animated film that can affect me as much as Miyazaki's stuff. This is the first. <br /> <br /> Hmm, scratch this "animated" part. <br /> <br /> I have an intense love-hate relationship with a movie noir and, hey, if you don't leave, this must be mostly love, right? But there are so many sci-fi and noir themes in this movie that it's just a miracle to watch. <br /> <br /> These people did an incredible job!
