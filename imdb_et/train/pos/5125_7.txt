I stepped towards the bar, waiting for it to be a hot beer on the fasting Texas day, but was pleasantly surprised. After suffering through "Saturday night stupidity" I had no desire to see some of the southern Texas barnyard. And I didn't. John Revolta was good when the jealous red shirt, Scott Glenn, was well-established as an ex-con, and Debra Winger was as always a joy. * Love this woman * Plus, the soundtrack was a dynamite [and it comes from a man who can't tolerate the sound of music]. Fun movie all the time.
