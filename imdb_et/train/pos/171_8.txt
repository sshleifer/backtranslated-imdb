I strongly disagree with anyone who can leave this movie "just" for entertainment. In the early days of great depression, dance, fools, dances, immediately after worry, swelling in the 20th century, dance is a very cordial deterrent, with a clear message of how to best endure these difficult times. However, this fast paced and tightly drawn film is far from an unpleasant moral story. In the 1930s, Hollywood was able to discourage an entertaining * and * enlightening audience. all without wasting the frame frame. Dance, Fools, Dance - One of the four movies Harry Beaumont was leading in 1931 - is barely 80 minutes long, but its characters are well developed, its story never seems to be rushing, and despite the audience being much twisted. has never been left behind. <br /> <br /> A single exception from Lester Vail, who loves interesting love for Bob Townsend, is a supportive cast of even strength. It is worth noting that William Bakewell is Crawford's brother, Cliff Edwards (known as Jiminy Cricket's voice) reporter, Bert Scranton and Clark Gable as early supporter of gangster Jake Luvana. <br /> <br /> But this is Joan Crawford's film and she's absolutely shining in it. If it was just 27 years old, this lesser-known version of Crawford is probably unknown to those familiar with their later work. But here's the proof that, long before he arrived at Mildred Pierce's Oscar home, Crawford's star was in the true sense, a terrible actor with charisma to take the picture to himself. <br /> <br /> Score: eight out of TEN
