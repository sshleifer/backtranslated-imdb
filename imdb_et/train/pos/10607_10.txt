Henry Thomas was "big". His character was my attention. I was so "story" that I did not forget that it was not real. I wanted him to hold the baby and see what a special person he was. Other people in the story were indispensable in shaping their character. The way they helped each other was really awesome. I love movies that show the real side of people's emotions without having to hit you, because you're not smart enough to count things on yourself.
