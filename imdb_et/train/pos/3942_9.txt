1939 is the most widely recognized year of Hollywood history, released more classic films than any other, and John Ford drew the top three, "Stagecoach", "Drums Along the Mohawk", and this beautiful tribute to the Border Days and a young backwoods lawyer to save the European Union , "Young Mr. Lincoln." <br /> <br /> The world ran into a war that America was afraid of, but knew it was being taken, Abraham Lincoln was in the minds of many people, in 1939, as someone who had faced the same dilemma in his life and won. Broadway played Robert E. Sherwood's award-winning "Abe Lincoln in Illinois", where Raymond Massey physically died of packed houses (filmed in 1940). Carl Sandburg continued his epic biography "Abraham Lincoln: War Year" and quickly became the best seller. President Roosevelt often referred to Lincoln's speeches, and in Washington DC, the Lincoln Memorial became the city's most popular attraction (the fact that Frank Capra used it, "Mr. Smith goes to Washington"). All this did not disappear from Darryl F. Zanuck's 20th century Fox; as soon as he read Lamar Trot's attorney at Lincoln's early days scenario, he set it prestigious and assigned John Ford direct and Henry Fonda star. <br /> <br /> Fonda does NOT want to play Lincoln; he felt that he was not able to do the "great Emancipator" fairly and was afraid that bad power would harm his career. Even a filmed make-up test in which he stunned how much he liked Lincoln would not change his mind. According to Fonda, John Ford, with whom he never worked, addressed his royal meeting at his first meeting and explained that he was not a Lincoln of Legend but a young "jackanape" lawyer who was facing his first murder search. Scared the role of Fonda. (John Ford offered a different scenario for the events, but the result was the same!) Obviously, they found the chemistry that worked because almost all of their couples produce classics. <br /> <br /> Unlike "Abe Lincoln in Illinois", an introverted, melancholic racked Lincoln, Ford's vision was a shy but pleasant young lawyer who made it easy with his friends and missed his missing mother (resulting in a bond with a pioneer mother). it becomes an important part of the story). Injustice robs him and talks of "common sense" to abolish violence embedded with humor doses. Both productions play in Lincoln's (undocumented) relationship with Ann Rutledge; In the Ford version, the couple is truly in love and committed to each other. After his death, Lincoln often visited his grave to share his life with his "spirit" (the theme of Ford would continue to be "He Wore a Yellow Ribbon"). <br /> <br /> The murder problem is central to the movie and shows the great talents of the stars and the director. The fund depicts skillfully Lincoln's inexperience, but seriously believes in the justice that is merciful, and Ford emphasizes the "intellectuals" of the cool big cities (represented by pompous DA Donald Meek and his slick "adviser", Stephen Douglas, young people). Milburn Stone) and Lincoln Unofficial Bending. As a major witness to Ford's standard Ward Bond, the trial is both unusual and riveting. <br /> <br /> When the film closes when Lincoln moves into a hurricane distance, and his fate (leaves the view of the Lincoln monument shape), the viewers could comfort the film's message that if the cause was fair, it would be a good triumph. <br /> <br /> "Young Mr. Lincoln" is a truly remarkable movie, from an amazing year!
