I saw it even after it was released in 56, and has since hit its final scene. If this is the answer to "High Noon" then this is the right answer. The notion that because this string is called "The City Comes together" is a much stronger message than the "High Evening" lonely personal heroism. In this topic, "Concho" is one of the forerunners of all of my all time favorites, "Great Seven". Both Sinatra and Conrad give impressive and convincing performances, especially the transformation of Sinatra into the savior of a city that is getting rid of bullying. I can only hope that at some point, all my friends and families who have been publishing this film over the years will be able to experience it myself.
