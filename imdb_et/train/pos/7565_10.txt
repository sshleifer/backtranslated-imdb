As a low budget company, where filmmakers produce and distribute DVDs themselves, we may not expect too much of Broken in disc. And what is most remarkable about this achievement is that this release contains enough opportunities to shame James Cameron's DVD and decisively good presentation. <br /> <br /> The only big mistake in the latter is the big mistake. jw.org en Broken is equipped with a non-anamorphic transmission. Otherwise, we will get the movie with its original ratio of 1.85: 1, which does not show any technical flaws and does not see much. Indeed, when Ferrari's hands approach the placement of this disc together, you can pretty much guarantee that. <br /> <br /> The same applies to the soundtrack. Here, mixes of DD2.0 and DD5.1 ​​are offered, and while I'm sure what should be considered "original", the fact that Ferrari was involved in both tools should also be worse. Indeed, although DD5.1 ​​can provide more atmospheric viewing experience because it uses a score, both are equally fine and free from technical errors. <br /> <br /> For extras, the disc is positively overloaded by them. Take a look at the sidebar on the right side of the screen and you will notice numerous comments, loads and different galleries. Indeed, considering how everything is divided into minutes, not a long documentary, there is really little to discuss. For example, "anatomy of stunts" is exactly what it claims to be, and the same applies to the rest of the pieces. As such, we get coverage after Broken's production, production and production. And while it may be advisable to find them in a more easily digestible general "making", we can easily access any special function we want to look at. <br /> <br /> Pieces, maybe there are only comments that need some discussion. Then there is the predicted air for each chat room. Involving the participants is too funny and doesn't take the movie too seriously. Ferrari pieces are very enthusiastic about the whole thing. And the technical is well technical. Of course, we also get a clover on what is covered elsewhere on the plates, but only 19 minutes are not expected from any of these pieces. Indeed, everything is a fine extra package.
