It has been almost 5 years since this stylish activity. I've been watching this movie almost ten times and Gautham has done a lot of trouble. In my opinion, this film is virtually flawless. Surya as AKB Anbuchelvan-no doubt .. classic.Yyothika played his role in Maya very well.Mark fits him very well.Mark that hit the movie visitors attention was Pandia.Jeevan played the role of Pandia very well.Brutal and terrifying. s the most worthy of the best freak. Daniel Balaji, Devadharshini and others supporting the cast were fine. <br /> <br /> Racy scenario, fully timed dialogs and brilliant narrative of Gauthamis. Harris Jeyaraj has all the cards, while BGM fits the film very well. RD Rajasekhar is very rich.Peter Hein choreographed tricks well.Enthony editing is accurate. even some Hollywood film fabrics compete with Kaakha Kaaka ... no doubt.
