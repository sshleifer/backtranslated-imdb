Since this movie has never been heard until I saw the rent a DVD with a bit of skepticism, there have been many films in the past with good bands that can't record a bad script and in some cases don't seem to care. <br /> <br /> Well, just looking at it, there was no reason to give this movie to release the theater, that's fine. The most similar story of such a genre may seem to be somewhat coercive at times, but here also seems to be a good reality that will allow a boost. I was pleasantly surprised by the good work that Justin Timberlake is doing here with such a big role, OK, he's not an Oscar yet, but he's learning every role and he's showing a lot of the promise of the future. Also, Dylan McDermott was surprisingly good in his unexpectedly disgusting role and is definitely the cream of this movie. <br /> <br /> Ultimately let it go. you do not have to be disappointed, you are not bored, really think you are happy with the end result.
