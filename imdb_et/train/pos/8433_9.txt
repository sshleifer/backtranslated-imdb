The performance of this film was great, but confused with the number of truths about the situation of many South African Africans made it heart. It was good that the writer separated Boesman and Lena from others who run from their homes, so that we could fully share our triumphs and wins; the conflicts they shared when they grew up and left together. It is worth noting when you put the movie in the right context.
