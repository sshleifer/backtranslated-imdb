Planning episodes were a bit boring, but when they reached the desert, it was a lot of fun to watch. The reason I call it the most realistic reality is that, to my surprise, Charley fell out of the race quite early. When his hands were painful, I waited for the usual stress and then the fixation of the miracle, but he ended the race. The most worrying moment of the show was to have Max in the desert almost without water or food! The end was great and I was very happy that at least one team did it. Generally not as big as the Long Way Round, but definitely interesting to watch because one gets a glimpse of the world's most challenging competition.
