I'll never forget when I saw this video shop back. I was always a big Weird Al fan and when I saw this video, I rented it and watched it. I was too young to understand all Ali's subtle humor and satire, but I remember it much later when I was old enough to understand what I was looking at. If you are an "Al" fan, especially for his previous work, you will enjoy this movie thoroughly. This is done in MTV-esque "Rockumentary" style and tells a true (but sometimes exaggerated) story of how Al could have been in 1985. his music.
