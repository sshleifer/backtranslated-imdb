When I slid through the TV guide and found the movie in the "Twisted Desire" section, I read its description. Three words heard in my eye "Melissa Joan Hart" ... I find that her role is "Sabrina: Teenage Witch" completely insecure, I hate such programs, so I just thought it will be boring old, love story in her starring ... Little I know. <br /> <br /> Finally, television started, I had my bucket ready when I beat over this cheesiness or soppiness, you know what I mean. At first you think he is just a nice, ordinary girl who is in love but has parents. Then, if you find that he manipulated his boyfriend by killing his parents, he might be in true love, you're like "Whoa." You just don't expect such a role for such an actor. He played his role very well, in my opinion, I never expected him to be able to operate such a mother and voil√†, he did it great! Congratulations to him, the movie was very good, I would look at it again and recommend it to others.
