Sidney Franklin's "The Good Earth" has achieved a classic status thanks to timeless story and great action, especially from Luis Ranier, who won the Oscar for portraying O-Lan. Rainer's performance is so complete, he is almost unknown. Very little dialogue in the film (and it's a long one), Rainer relies instead on face and body language. She looks and acts in Chinese so that anyone who does not know her work can easily be injured as such. <br /> <br /> The film remains relevant today as it explores the wealth of clothes and the universal themes that accompany it. When Lung and the woman O-Lan finally achieve financial success after the years of hunger and poverty, they find a life full of property but meaningless. It is only when they return to the earth when they fight with the laptops of roses (the special effects that are used to create them are still incredible and beautiful) will find them again. The unique formula of the Chinese family's unique perspective (especially 1937) makes the film classic. Money is worth nothing without friends and family members, the point that the film leads to an emotionally fulfilling conclusion within 10 minutes.
