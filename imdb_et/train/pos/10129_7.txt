There are extraordinary situations out of six men who never leave our hearts: Suppose a great thank you to Rachel, Ross, Monica, Joe, Chandler and Phoebe !!! At our first meeting, we see how Rachel casts a dude (in the church, how ... (understand), Monica look for a "perfect man" (no perfect man, why all your women have become obsessed with it?)? And how can your marriage be destroyed, if your life partner discovers that she is a lesbian until we meet Joey, Phoebe and Chandler in the following episodes ... ENJOY FRIENDS!
