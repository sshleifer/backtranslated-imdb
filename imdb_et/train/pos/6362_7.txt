I was allowed to have seen a "Speed ​​Racer" but I never saw it and I also saw other exhibitions, some of which characterize the birds carrying the birds flying on a Phoenix-named ship and the other around a spacecraft that looked As a giant ocean ship flew for some reason from time to time and was really dark and hard to understand someone who might have been five. This, though I looked at almost every episode and was amazing for me, was that this exhibition had some resolution for it. It really ended, bad guys doing differently from almost every American comedian, where nothing really happens, like the last-generation Transformer episode that ended with Galvatron and the new bad that won the autobot, Dungeons and Dragons with the kids. home where GI Joe with Cobra is still ready to try again and so on and so on. It ended with a rather cool robot that got a new weapon when the performance progressed, it was a little fun to start because it couldn't fly and had only some really cool weapons. As he went, he got a cool shooting fist, like one of the Android 16, which was used against Celli in Dragonball Z, then this weapon evolved to include razors. Then the big robot even got wings so he could fly and even more weapons were placed in the wings. He also got a few allies in a female robot and quite funny, called Bobo in America. Roisto was not only dr. Hell, but a really strange man who was half a man half a woman and a guy with a flying head. An interesting show and it was such a nice to see a summary.
