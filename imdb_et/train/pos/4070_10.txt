I know Anime. I've been around long before it became a national phenomenon; I loved Ranma before most people knew what Dragonball Z was. And so you know I'm not talking about me, let me tell you: Of all my vision, the fortress in heaven is the best. It is obvious that people say the best thing is, but I really disagree. Most people know this movie just because it is one Acedmy award; it is not an exaggeration - I have shown Princess Mononoket and the castle in the sky to people who were once enthusiastic, and they agree that the last two are their three bosses. Personally, I didn't think anything could be compared to Princess Mononok until I finally saw the sky from heaven. I still think that the former is better than the two, but the fortress in heaven is equally comparable to it; In many ways, the castle has the basic elements that Mononoke lacked. Either way, if you've only seen the excitement and think it's the best movie for Miyazaki, be prepared to shake your land.
