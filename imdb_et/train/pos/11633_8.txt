The Red Eye is not a movie that wins Palme D'or, but Wes Craven has never been such a director, and her branding is a good sign of what a filmmaker can expect. The fact that the Red Eye is a tiny, demanding package within 94 minutes is part of its charm and reference to Craven's handicraft at lightweight but generally enjoyable ticket offices. In fact, this perfect film, which is shown as entertainment for entertainment, keeps the attention of the viewer without presenting intellectual or emotional challenges. motivation and supportive characters, and the main thing is the feeling of a TV movie. However, Hitchcock's mid-term review has certain elements and the Schumacher telephone booths, which are ultimately more sophisticated (and more pretentious) on the same idea that the emotional crisis is being played down publicly. <br /> <br /> For a movie that mainly focuses on two people sitting on airplane seats, this character and script will live or die. Cillian's icy but beautiful Jackson Jackson Rippner and Rachel MacAdams are creating Lisa, which are the main reasons why the film goes off. Not only is it a dialogue, but also giving an Adam's rib type dimension to its "male logic" battle against a feminine "sensitivity". <br /> <br /> In the last part of the movie, Craven gives her a little cry of style as a human-girl-girl-knife. The most surprising revelation here is what Brian Cox looks like after "Just for Men" treatment, his ubiqutous appearance in such diverse films as Super Troopers, Ring and it makes him a Jude Law sexual version. <br /> <br /> Short fun.
