I saw this movie at its worst. I went for 15 minutes when I woke up on an international flight between Sydney and Seoul. I didn't know what I was looking at, I thought it was a movie of the week, but quickly became a riveting actor who played a young woman who had been kidnapped. The premise began because of the twists and turns that I did not see, and according to the final credits, I was out of the flight crew guide to find out what I was just looking at. It turns out that I recently discovered Do-yeon Jeon, who won the best actor for Cannesis in this role. I don't know if Secret Sunshine is typical for Korean cinema, but I can't find out more about the DVD store.
