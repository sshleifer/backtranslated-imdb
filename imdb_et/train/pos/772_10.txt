Love is overwhelming ... In all its manifestations ... Gorgeous, absolutely proud ... Tudor Chirila, Maria Popistasu and Ioana Barbu, one truly dramatic story of love in all its shapes, the story of the incomprehensible ways of young hearts, life and lost innocence led by Tudor Giurgiu's skillful eye. With the excellent soundtrack of Faultline & Chris Martin and Vama Veche, it surprises in every sense, ignoring the sour taste of love ... Really remarkable ... Is it me or is Romania's cinematography slowly but surely forward and respecting? It's a brilliant movie ... Two mirrors for all involved people.
