The crossbow is a very original and funny movie. I think Adam Jones brings a refreshing new eye to the comedy piano and really recycles it. This movie is smart, short and consistently fun and funny. As a writer / director, Jones exhibits his characters who are both absurd and loved. The story is definitely something you have never seen before, which is good. It is unique and fun and can work visually in fantastic elements and long lost lost genre to create a cheerful comedy.
