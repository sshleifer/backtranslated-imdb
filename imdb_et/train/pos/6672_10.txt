I've seen a Mystery Meni winner in the press and a little bit of publicity (for example, take an imdb vote), but my general feeling is that Mystery Men is more fun than most movies, definitely wittier than most so-called comedy movies and very nearly "smart". <br /> <br /> Cast is great; Greg Kinnear is great, as do Geoffrey Rush and Tom Waits. Kinnear's limousine with Ricky Jay is the perfect "spoiled film star" and sucks its character in the balance of comic book quality and realism to work for her. <br /> <br /> I admit that the pace is a bit behind in places, and visual images are definitely very flashy, probably to the detriment of further characterization, but at the end of the day it is a big conception of making movies - it's about small moments "What is Tiger Lily? " - And this movie has so many great things that it would be worth repeating.
