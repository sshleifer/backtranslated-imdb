I would not be surprised if Soderbergh were pressed to prevent Cuban in a corrupt form before the revolution. Submitting only a few statistics doesn't do it with the younger crowd. The first part, which has been photographed almost entirely in the jungle, does not allow it to be felt, especially in the mountainous areas of Cuba. I liked Del Toro's interpretation of Che Guevara's personality. And the actor who plays Castro, Bichir also did an excellent job against all odds. It is clear that Soderbergh does not see these people down, but it is clear that he is not going to claim his case to the "yanquis", far from the past. Some of the most important historical aspects contradict reading. To my knowledge, Castro was not in the Soviet Union until all attempts to gain approval from the United States. But he has the right to other aspects, especially with regard to the looting of emigrants, as the island went to another rebel control. The state treasury remained empty.
