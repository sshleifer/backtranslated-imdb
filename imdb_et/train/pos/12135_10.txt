Every movie that Bette Davis celebrates is worth experiencing. Before Davis and Leslie Howard celebrated "Of Human Bondage", he was over the film. The legend has said that Davis was "abducted" from the 1935 Oscar to act as a cocktail waitress, an unwanted mother, and a manipulative boyfriend, Mildred Rogers. The story goes that AFI consoled Davis by giving his 1st Oscar to play Joyce Heath in "Dangerous". I imagine that Davis fans of "Of Human Bondage" who agree with the Oscar robbing legend are my criticisms of the 1934 film for which AFI did not play and the 1936 film "Dangerous" for which he 1937 In 2008, he received his first Oscar. <br /> <br /> I've been trying to watch all Bette Davis movie campaigns, TV interviews, videos, World War II announcements, and popular series. In hindsight, it's easy to see why this movie "Of Human Bondage" gave Davis the chance to name it. He was only 25yo when the movie was ready and almost reached the Hollywood red carpet. The public began to notice Bette Davis as a star because he was "In Human Bondage". It makes it legendary. But RKO saw his greatness "Man who played God" and borrowed him from Warners to play Rogers. <br /> <br /> I go back with AFI, about 41 years after their decisive decision to give Davis the first best actress Oscar "dangerous", 2 years later. In doing so, AFI has been able to contribute to the best display of Hollywood's most talented 20th-century actors. Since Davis knew of "Human Bond" firmly, he must go deep into himself in order to find the performances of the golden form. Undoubtedly he deserves more than 2 Oscars; Maybe as much as 6. <br /> <br /> "Dangerous" gives an exemplary contrast to Davis' behavioral characterization. Because it is "Dangerous" (1936) that he will become the greatest actor of the 20th century. Davis is as good as Joyce Heath, he's dead in the middle of a red carpet. When "From Man's Bondage" is on the right side of Davis, on the sidewalk and ready to take the rest of his 60-year-old acting career. <br /> <br /> Maybe not giving him the legendary Oscars In 1935, instead of being born, the actor gave the actor an incentive to go further into his soul than the greatest work of the talented actors. <br /> <br /> It is well known that his modern adversary was Joan Crawford; a star whose performances are still not measured by Davis. Even Anna Nicole Smith was the "star". Howard Stern is also a radio-star. Many people on stage and the silver screen are stars. Few got great actors. Their main difference is something that Bette Davis might feel: the difference in the desire to do a great deal of action or to become a star. <br /> <br /> Try to compare these two movies as I have, watching it right after that. Perhaps you understand what AFI and I did. Davis was on the verge of becoming one of the biggest actresses of the 20th century in 25yo, reaching his goal at the age of 27. He spent his next 50 years and put the bar so high that it wasn't achieved. . . yet. <br /> <br /> When AFI sent him a message that he'd reached the "Human Bond", Davis' biography could be a big actor instead of a constellation.
