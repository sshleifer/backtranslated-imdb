I think this movie was one of Kurt Russels' good films. Kurt Russel is my favorite actor so I think he's a good actor in every role he plays. But this movie had a lot of things to do with it and I know there should be more than 5.6 of 10 on the computer, but many people didn't like it. Oh, I thought it was good, so I think everyone should see this movie. If you see this movie and like it, I think you should also see Back Draft with Kurt Russel. Annan Soldier *** 1/2 out *****
