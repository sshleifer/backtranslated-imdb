This movie was one of the best films I saw this year. I didn't see any box in the movie, but it's still pretty good. It's similar to the Anchorman humor department, but I think it's a better concise movie. This is actually the point. If you see a whole host of R&D, you're disappointed. Just a well-assembled film !!!! If you don't have anything to do for a day or if you need a lot of humor, it's really a good movie. I certainly think that Ebert and Roeper's review of this movie is right. I mean, I don't like Ebert on most movies, but it's a movie I agree with. The film contains a good enough story that it is actually believable that such people are there. There is definitely something to say about how they treat innocence in this movie. Yeah, sure you laugh when it's known, but it does suggest that you wait. Steve did a great job of portraying the person he made in this movie, and yet, it's still funny.
