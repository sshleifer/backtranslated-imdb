There is so much white light. Larry Bird is similar to Robert Ginty, who heads his fabulous hair and super-macho mustache, which rises above other low-budget makers. The charisma he has, makes Tom Selleck like a putz. With Ginty's all beating, the film only rises awesomeness when the story of diamond intrigue begins to play. Then add some front bushes, chainsaw attacks and some fantastic incidents to Fred Williamson .... this flick reaches all cylinders. If you are looking for some awesome B-Action, it is there. Now that I get my hands on this soundtrack.
