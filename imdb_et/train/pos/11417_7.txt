This movie hit me as a project with many correct ingredients, but somewhere along the way they didn't come together. I don't know who did it, but he has a little Disney-esque feeling. Although its parts are unlikely (for example, if a pre-public agency runs) and tends to prevent the story from being serious, the normal normal dose (regardless of) is to keep things balanced and perspective. Action is fine. Oddly enough, the relationship between Frankie and her grandmother is convincing, but the relationship between Hazel and Frankie is a bit ... off. It is interesting to see how he has to work hard to balance his best friend, grandmother and his two passions: ballet and baseball. Being a baseball player himself, it was quite painful to see Frankie trying to keep her boyfriend in the team, but it does a good job of showing the fight she is facing. I read somewhere that he is not really a ballerina, but editing this film did a great job of dancing not only natural but also beautiful. All in all, it was a good film of honesty and ambition, but his star Mischa Barton did not achieve the level of reality we saw in his performances "Lawn Dogs", "Lost and Delirious" and his small but shocking performance in Haley Joel Osment's "6th".
