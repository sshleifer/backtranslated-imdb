The Grand Canyon belongs to a very small category: it is a very clever film that has very clever dialogues and spaces of thought everywhere from beginning to end. I have the impression that it has never served in the rankings (and never) because of its simplicity. Such a flick needs sensitive observers. Pity thought that IMDb would make me write ten lines because it is by no means necessary. Anyway, to fulfill this request, I tell you that the weak spot of the film, if it is, works: not that it is bad, but it could have been done much better. The exception was Kevin Kline, who was perfect. Go ahead and see it.
