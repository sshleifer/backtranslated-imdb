It was actually my favorite series of Scooby Doo when I was younger. I thought every episode had more edge on it and the villains had a lot of creative thoughts for them (and even very scary and plausible). Some of the best episodes were "I left my neck in San Francisco", "Twenty thousand hard under the sea", "Ghoul, Bat and The Ugly" and "If you want a constellation". If you have never seen these episodes, do it. This series was a bit of a mixed bag, because there were other episodes that didn't look like an edge like "Rocky Mountain YIIII!" and "The Scomoby Chief". Like the series before it, it was very well assembled, an interesting story and a great drawing. As everyone says, Scrappy Doo would stay so much better. The character was tiring and disturbed the story that was said.
