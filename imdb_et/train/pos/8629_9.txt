In the early 1990s I read a small advertisement about Liebe des Totes (love of the dead) or something else. Of course it aroused my curiosity, so I ordered Nekromantik 1 & 2 and Der Todesking (The Death King). Nekromantik movies are ok, even one that is interesting and unique in nature to necrophilia (even though they are obviously horror opera entries, not intended to bring fear to viewers, they are actually quite funny.) <Br /> <br /> TODESING, on the other hand, is, in my opinion, one of the best films ever made. It consists of a series of scenes that depict many facets of death. Death as an enemy; Death as a Relief, Death as a Very Physical Decomposition of the Body. Film is the metaphor of life. It shows how fragile life is and how short our life is. It reduces the viewers with the children they really are. The main message of the film is that we cannot really understand the nature of death and thus the process of death. This is the most realistic film. Buttgerei never tries to hide death behind white roses. No matter what moral standards you set, death is unavoidable and not sooner or later fiction, but your reality. This applies to you, Dear Reader, as it is about movie viewers. Some juvenile reviewers do not see what is completely excusable because they naturally live forever ... <br /> <br /> This is not a movie of exploitation. Why? Because death doesn't use us with people. It picks us up. We grow for seven days, then we bring back the schopenhauer to the post-natal state, or death. Buttgereit gives us the version of our oldest songs. Whether you decide to consider it "optimistic" or "pessimistic," it is up to you to decide. At first glance it may seem very dark. However, think that in order to live something else, something else must die. "Who wants to live forever?" <br /> <br /> I believe that when Buttgereit shows the body consumed by the breeds, it shows not only the breakdown, but the beginning of a new life. Isn't it better to die and give life to chicks and then birds and finally become a soil when you stay alive to a dead zombie, one of the favorite pets in the genre? <br /> <br /> If you understand this, you will see Der Todesking in its right context. <br /> <br /> Sieben Tage hat dies in Woche, siebenmal letzte Stunden. Seven weeks (weak, mortal!), Seven times in the last hour. <br /> <br /> Don't be afraid of Reaper, Buttgere tells us because Reaper only takes what is mature. And the apples that are not fed for food are rotting! <br /> <br /> Live well, companions IMDB! <br /> <br /> (And look at this movie, which is comparable to Ingemar Bergmans only) The seventh seal of "depth and universality"
