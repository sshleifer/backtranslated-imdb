I enjoyed it. In general, I'm not a fan of comedies and comedians, but I like Whoop. I'm also a part of Sci / Fi fantasy. And the dinosaur craze. I read for joy, but when I feel I'm too stressed or enthusiastic, I look at the television and the movies. Theodore Rex allowed me to do that. That makes my eyes successful! I didn't even walk away to do anything other than it ran. Whether it was rated "good" or not, this is not important to me. And no, I'm not a minor. I'm not a moor either.
