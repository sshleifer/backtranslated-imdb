Farrelly's brothers, Bobby and Peter, are here again. With "Fever Pitch", the creators of other films who have dealt with many great topics, give up this tactic when they decided to bring Nick Hornby's film to a screen that would have been difficult to do. The novel of the same title dealt with a man's soccer football, because it is in England, where this sport consumes most of the British sports fans. It's a Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandell writing team credit that turns the book into a language that would attract most Americans when they make their hero, the Boston Red Sox fans. <br /> <br /> "Fever Pitch" is a film that includes obsessive fans, Ben Wrightly, whose life turns to the Red Sox season and is an eighth-grade teacher who has uncomfortable ways to engage his students in the subject. When Ben takes his four best students to visit a local company, he meets and falls hopelessly in the brain of Lindsey Meeks, a young woman who goes there but for thirty years doesn't have a life. br /> <br /> The story follows two lovers through the Red Sox Ritual ritual in home games at Fenway Park. This team fans are probably the most loyal people in the world who are stuck with a team that does wonderful things, but they never won the World Series until 2004. In fact, the end we had heard had to change because it was the year when they finally won the event that had left them for eighty-six years! Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon are perfect as a couple in the middle of the movie. Mrs Barrymore is a natural person who always surprises her performances in front of the camera. The popular television comedian Jimmy Fallon, who became an actor in the film, is here better off than his last appearance "Taxi" in our modest opinion. <br /> <br /> The Farrelly Brothers films also satisfy their fans of baseball fans in this baseball story.
