The film had many basic values ​​of family and love. It expressed human emotions and was an inspiring story. The script was clear (it was very easy to understand that it was ideal for children) and was sometimes fun and humorous. Some loaded symbols were searched. Cinematic art was acceptable. There was no shortage of experimentation that many operators have done today (which, to put it mildly, is a little warning). It was clearly filmed, but it had a nice soft quality. Although editing might have been better, I thought it was a great movie to enjoy the family. And the organization of the information was thrown to you, which I didn't like, but it was a good movie.
