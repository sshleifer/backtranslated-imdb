I've seen the last region DVD of this movie featuring the "horror" of the Oxford Street store, which is also advertised as a "classic thriller". In fact, it is almost exclusively Arthur Askey, one of the most popular names in British comedy and light entertainment for over four decades. as a bit of a cultural shock for many who are accustomed to the sour and cynical taste of many of the last twenty-five years of British comedy. However, there are still those who appreciate their living and joyful person and the complete avoidance of sin. Askey was a great Tommy Cooper idol who often borrowed the "suicide" that Arthur was trying to attract with passengers. <br /> <br /> Linden, rated below, is a very striking, rare appearance of Travers, which affects the mysterious Julie.
