I just saw "Valentine" and I have to say it was the best movie I've seen for years. Unlike recent fears of the 90's, this film is more of a concern than it is by blinking. For those who hated "Scream", there is no reference in this film to "horror rules" (although the old slaher movie rules apply here). <br /> <br /> It is the perfect blend of the horror of the 80s and 90s. You have 90's movie style, cinematography and good acting, and robbery of 80's couples. I think the year 2001 will finally give horror fans the kind of movies they want. This is definitely a move in the right direction. <br /> <br /> Denise Richards looks fun here. You can say that she liked her role and it makes her stand out. I loved her in this movie.
