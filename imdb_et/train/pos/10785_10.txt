I saw when I was little and it was great. Kelsey White like Lisa and Meecy Mice where cute. Susan Bonde as Doodle and Sandra Dee Heidecke as Snoodle, where Hilarius. Karen Boettcher-Tate as Profster was interesting. Burl Ross as a small bunny Foo Foo was funny. Gregory Donavon when Kaiso was great. With Hilarius to Snoodle and Doodle eat too much candy. What's sad is that Little Bunny Foo Foo, who drives Meecy's mice on the head and the fairy, gives little to Bunny Foo Foo, then becomes a goon. This story is about when Lisa, Snoodle, Doodle go to the Big Rock Candy Mountains. This show is great, kids like this show, new words, songs and watching them.
