... if this happens ;-) What would happen if Terry Gilliam and Douglas Adams had worked together on one movie? This movie starts with a touch of Brazil ... when the story moves directly to the twilight zone at some point, bringing out something new, but just something ... and nothing really fun! When Dave and Andrew start exploring their new environment, the movie really becomes enjoyable ... head across? well ... yes ;-) <br /> <br /> anyway ... this movie was the biggest surprise this year on FantasyFilmFest ... <br /> <br /> Like Cube and Cypher Natali gave it to a minimalist, weird, but a very special design that makes it difficult to find the story or its time ... timelessly ...
