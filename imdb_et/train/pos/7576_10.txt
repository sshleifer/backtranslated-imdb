The third and final part of "Hanzo Razor" is the most specific of them all. "Training" will even be completed in the first five minutes of the movie. Not for everyone, this film describes Hanzo's investigation into the loan's vanishing by the order of the dark monks. There is also a historical comment on the surprising refusal of the old Japanese to include Western technology. When the first Hanzo movie was just funny and a fun ride with little connection to the plot, Hanzo 3: who has got gold can all unite and eventually bring it home. This is definitely the perfect final. Yes, Hanzo still has a lot of sex and there is a lot of unnecessary blood and violence (it is a * Hanzo razor).
