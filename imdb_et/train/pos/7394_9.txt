This Chinese film made me feel so much like the members of culture I do not belong to and are far away. In almost a Buddhist approach, the film helps to associate each character and happiness with simple routine things. <br /> <br /> All actors are brilliant and Xu Hzu expresses goodness and wisdom, but also vulnerable and average. Er Min, the slowed brother, shows us that intelligence and wisdom are not equal and that wisdom comes to and from the most diverse individuals of this universe. Different from China, it is far from Chinese realism, but it has a lot of humanity and different realism. <br /> <br /> Get it. You don't have to be disappointed.
