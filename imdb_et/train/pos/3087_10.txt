Six degrees are a great show! I watched the whole season on the internet because I just found it and I was terribly disappointed that there is no season 2: '(and all down, ABC has now taken it off, so it can't be viewed online Why should ABC create such an excellent show, with a great story and great characters to pull it out of the air without ever ending the story, it seems our imagination is finding out what will happen to all of us honestly, though I feel that ABC could at least show the internet to viewers who enjoyed it, at the same time if they continue to overestimate reality TV shows.
