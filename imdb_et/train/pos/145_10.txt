The order of the "kingdom" is bloody and even more complicated. I only saw the spools (I was exhausted and could not sit all 5 1/2 hours), but I loved what I saw. Ghosts, blood, murder, poisoning, mutated children, voodoo ... that's all! If you have a strong stomach and like strange movies, then this is for you. <br /> <br /> You don't have to understand this part 1 ... you understand! <Br /> <br /> Does anyone know if Kingdom 1 and 2 are available on DVD? Sitting on these marathon films in the theater is tiring. Unfortunately, "Kingdom 3" may not appear - Ernst-Hugo Jaregard (Sig) died a year after filming. But you never know!
