I haven't really seen too many Columbo movies ... actually I think I'm just one or two except that. I've always liked Columbo, somehow, without having seen that much. Peter Falk is and has always been the ideal choice because of his character, his appearance, his voice and his charm. The perfect proof of this is that although the series began in 1968, the latest (and probably not the last) films were made in 2003. It's 35 years. And Falk was the first when he did the first. The series consists of 68 movies (except when my number is off), all made on the TV. Everyone knows this character, although no one has ever seen a movie that cinema. This is quite an achievement when you ask me. The plot is pretty good. The only problem I have is that the killer and the murder occur early on (although it may be the same for all Columbo films), leaving no secret, but how Columbo solves it, making it somewhat numb (because there is not much that wait at the end of the movie). Stimulation is good, there's hardly a scene where you're bored. The action is very good, especially Falk and Ruth Gordon. They have a very big exchange in the movie. The characters are well written and reliable. The dialogue and script are unusually good for a TV movie. All in all, the movie is yes, for a surprisingly good TV movie and definitely worth looking at all the Columbo and / or crime / mystery clips. 8/10
