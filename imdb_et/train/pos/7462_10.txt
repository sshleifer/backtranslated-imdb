Note: These comments are for people who have seen the movie. <br /> <br /> Vanilla Sky is a brilliant, sophisticated and exciting movie that exists exclusively on what the tagline says: LoveHateDreamsLifeWorkPlayFriends. Perhaps the film plan may focus on the visitors of the film that is confused when viewed from a different perspective. <br /> <br /> Given the following: <br /> <br /> Now I have not gone through the movie scene carefully, so I have to look into my claims further (and I welcome your thoughts), but try it out and see does the film fail: where exactly is the disputed "splice"? <br /> <br /> Now, I'm not talking about splitting, as explained by LE "technician", because this sequence can actually be interpreted as a rationalization of David Aames' mind / dream / coma status, but a real gap between reality and dream. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the reality of a car accident, how it is filmed (for example, without explosion) is a probable "cracking point", and that any particular sequence containing existential / dream / coma / non-reality is Whether it is shown on the screen before or after an accident - is actually part of Aames' personal journey toward self-consciousness within its mind. <br /> <br /> In this regard, we have two questions very much ended (if you know more, let me know): Is Aames actually scattered and where does he wake up? <br /> <br /> The plot, or at what particular point in time his dreams are scattered, will make this film a fascinating exploration of the journey on the way to find himself, and that is what today's pop culture means. <br /> <br />
