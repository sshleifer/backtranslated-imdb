Different directors from different countries have contributed a lot to the film through their thoughts. As a result, we have experienced various genres of media. Jafar Panahi, Unlike J.L. Godard or F. Truffault, believes in a simple story; Schematic narratives are one of the key features of his director's work. It trusts both the viewer's automatic and critical intelligence; he does not feel any need for alienation or access to viewers. It is equally effective, though it is normal. Offside (2006) is another schematic creation about him, where the Middle East Asian sex subordination becomes clear to everyone, because the film's simple, memorable story is progressing. Now that we all call on the rights of women, this film is calm in our minds and finally becomes a hunch of our critical intelligence, conveying the message that human egality is nothing but illusive good, utopia. Fathers never let women give their rights. An important football match with the people, a teenage girl who understands the game well, loves her people, has no right to enter the stadium to enter the country. He is only allowed to listen to a live comment. His alias couldn't work for him. As a result, he had to go through several degrading situations. From the beginning, his anxiety ran for his father's daughter. At the end of the day, the celebration came when the people won a game that the girl didn't see because she was being held at the playground outside the stadium. But celebration must not hinder the issue of women's rights, which are in different forms in every corner of the world. Jafar Panahi has most successfully demonstrated this problem of gender abuse in the context of traditional films and patriarchy. The global tragedy has been easy and sometimes humorous, which in turn keeps us constantly.
