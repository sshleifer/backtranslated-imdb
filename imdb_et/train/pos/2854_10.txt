There has been much talk about this film and I want to join those who praised it. This is a very unique film that uses elements of different genres: drama, comedy, gangster, without any confusion. At the points you just laugh out loud, at other points, you know the signs you look for in the mistakes and failures. Saba's genius can be shown in some sequences of the film. One is that where all three men behind each other have an erotic day dream of a young woman they just walked down the street. This sequence is beautifully made and illustrates the characters of all three runners very well. It is at the same time erotic and funny. Another example of Sabu's genius is the part of the film where runners get tired. First, one of them, a typical loser among the three boys, hallucinates that the woman who left her against someone else is back and you see them dancing with each other and next you shoot her dancing with her, which moves deeply. All runners get to the point where they think they have something they lost or pursuing again. And in one part of the movie, they stop running behind each other, run a row, just laugh. His characters can't (do they end up?), But he doesn't rob them of their dignity. "Monday" and "Postman Blues" that understand Sabu's claim that he is a genius. Look at them! <br /> <br />
