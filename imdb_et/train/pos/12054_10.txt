For the first time in the United States, I saw this movie in December 1989 when Central TV broadcast it. I still have a videotape, although it's worn (over the years, many friends and family have borrowed it and chilled it). Anyway, I remember I came home this evening, grabbing a Christmas hammer, turning off the lights and watching what was advertised in the "Christmas Hill Story". Even now I remember certain scenes that still get hair on the neck ... <br /> <br /> I've seen some comments about the movie that say it's not, and not that ... I think they are people frighten on Friday 13th and similar, with a stem and slash, which are ridiculous. This is a "traditional" ghost story; there is no big budget activity or special effects ... no oath, no blood, no free sex scenes, no chainsaw or weapons, etc. So how refreshing !!!! It's an atmosphere. If you like intimidation, well-written, well-behaved and truly frightening atmosphere, this is a movie for you. I like the original horrors; only last night I saw the original Haunting and this is a great movie. Again, it is very obvious - and so is the black woman. The end of the movie is different from the book, but still very good. I recommend it. Try it ... you like you like traditional ghost stories ... So ... turn the lights off, fire, lock the doors, grab the drink ... and enjoy ...:)
