Barman drove any wind blowing when he sang the dEUS song. Anarchy rules over a logical and common sense strain. The story of this movie is just what the wind is blowing. And it can really be refreshing when you're ready and ready. Viewers who claim that there is nothing to keep the story together are right. Who the hell is this Windman? Still, I really enjoyed this movie. Antwerp is beautiful, enchanting, what's going on and any way it grabs that feeling. It also includes stupidity, racism, bureaucracy, addictions and violence, which are apparently not discovered in a friendly city. The movie is fun, funny and small. The debut of Barman's screen does not have as much impact as his debut. In this light, some may be disappointed. But then again, the "worst case scenario" would be the winds for each track.
