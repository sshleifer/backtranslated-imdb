It must be one of the best, if not the best, films I've seen for a very long time. They did enough to satisfy the fan, and yet the plot was very good. I really enjoyed the movie and tried to get me from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Blood and gore have been added, but it has a real character on the front of the film, and even tear Jerker ends up for many people I should think about. <br /> <br /> It has to be seen by someone. Looking at many reviews, sliding the film but fair, most of the bad reviews are the best. it proves it again. <br /> <br /> Rent this movie, buy this movie, just go out and watch this movie. You don't have to be disappointed.
