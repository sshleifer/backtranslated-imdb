Good Earth is a great movie! Everyone has to see ... This is a tear-line and very warm-hearted. It provides for the formation of values ​​for consistency, humility, and family love ... The story can be related to our lives today, especially when poverty is at the threshold. How we respond to such a problem is very important and if a person is not strong enough to cope with such a problem, he may remain defenseless and useless. I am very pleased how the characters justify their young actors ... Their emotions have been fascinated by the audience. The film can be made in black and white, but the story is so exciting that you don't want to stop. That really makes it big! This very nice movie should be done again.
