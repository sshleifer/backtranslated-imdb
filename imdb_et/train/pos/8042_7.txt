**** SPOILERS **** "Sniper" is undoubtedly based on the use of the legendary US Marine sniper "Gunny" Hathcock. Uncomfortable soft-spoken Mister Rogers looks as many as 300 confirmed and unconfirmed Vietcong and North Vietnamese troops killing during his two "Nam" trips. What shows how deadly and effective trained sniper really is Tom <br /> <br /> <br /> Tom Berenger is a cool flipper and deadly than Sgt.Thomas Beckett, who is at the end of his career in US sea sales, but who later understands in the movie that in civil life life is meaningless. Because he has nothing outside his skills he learned from US Navy when he did not decide to become mobile. Backett reluctantly accepts his destiny as a lifelong professional killer in his country. <br /> <br /> "Sniper" is a story about Sgt.Beckett, a former sharp silver coin and US government spokesman Richard. Miller, Billy Zane, is sent deep into the Panama jungle. Two snipers will be hosted by General Miguel Alveraze, the Rebel, and Raul Ochoa, Carlos Alveraze, King of Colombia, who supports him in his planned military takeover. <br /> <br /> We see Sgt in the past. Beckett's scope and accept the rebel leader I know was the best sniper. Because it shows step by step how Sgt. Beckett with his seer Cpt. Papich, Aden Young, is doing his job. There is also a sub-block that was later interrupted in a movie about Rebel Sniper DeSilva, Eward Wiley, who was bouncing on Beckett and later killed Papichi, both of whom were expecting to withdraw from the jungle with a military helicopter. You would have guessed that the two who culminated in the end of the movie, but Sgt. Beckett had no problems with sending DeSilva at the beginning of the movie using malicious Miller as a feed. <br /> <br /> The film was most damaging for the last fifteen minutes when the story went from one shot to kill a sniper movie like Rambo, ending with Sgt. Beckett and Agent Miller, who are fighting for the whole battalion of rebels who are as thick as the London fog. <br /> <br /> The "sniper" is still worthy of telling a story about a person who until now is not really glamorized in warfare: a single killer who kills a perfect and skillful diamond cutter or a neurosurgeon and does it with complete secrecy.
