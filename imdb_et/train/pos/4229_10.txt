Don't waste time reading my review. Go out and watch this amazingly good episode that may be the best Columbo ever written! Ruth Gordon is perfectly cast as a charming but charming mysterious writer who murders his brother to apologize for his daughter's murder. Columbo is his usual rumpled, fixed, and far more hostile-than-seems to himself, and this particular installment includes fantastic chemistry between Gordon and Falki. Ironically, it is not written by the popular creators Levinson or Link, but is probably still the densest, most thoroughly original and twisted shell of the Columbo plot. Fully satisfying in almost every department and overflowing drill and clever dialogue and thinking. Really unexpected and resourceful peaks. 10/10 ... look for it in Netflix!
