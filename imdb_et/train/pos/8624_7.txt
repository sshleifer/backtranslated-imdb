What is the best way to start reviewing a movie like Der Todesking? Let me start by saying that I just came straight from watching this movie and the pictures are still burning deep into my brain - and I don't think they're moving soon. <br /> <br /> It's probably fair to say that if you are on this page, you have a good idea of ​​what a movie is, even if you haven't seen it. If not, allow me to warn you in advance that this is not a moderate budget pearl that has been lost for a few years in the song "Near Dark", nor is it a small budget, "fun" B movie. What it is is a small budget art presented in a simple but amazing way. The idea is simple - seven stories that emerge around and end with suicides that are mixed with the images of a decaying body. Seems simple, even boring? This is not. The words cannot really describe how strong this film is for the time you are halfway through; it will pull you practically to whether you want to go or not. it may be noted that the scenes are clearly captured with super-8 cameras and sometimes they are shaking. I can point out that some of the sound effects are not synchronized so that they compete with each Fulci movie, but at the end of the day it seems to be going to be void. <br /> <br /> When extreme movies go, I've seen them the hardest, and yet Der Todesking moved me so that few others have succeeded despite being not particularly spooky and having very few scenes that I " free 'guess. In fact, my most disturbing scene was the last story. I'm not destroying it, but to say that the character's emotional torment drips from the screen and puts you in sympathy if you don't want your end. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is not the best movie ever made, and in many places crude oil and perhaps a little bit amateurish, but despite these mistakes, Der Todesking is an experience I would recommend to anyone who likes challenging cinema . If you are someone who likes pleasant viewing or a "nice" movie, or just wants something brutal and meaningless, then that's not what you're looking for. <br /> <br /> Whether you enjoy it or not, this is the one you are in no hurry.
