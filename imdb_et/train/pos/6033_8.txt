I would just like to say that it can be biased because I am a film producer. However, I retain some dignity. <br /> <br /> The movie star Oscar Ovies gives a star performance as Jeff Grinderlin, a nebbish hypochondriac who spends more time worrying than living. He brings a certain character to his character, allowing the audience to communicate with him, often marking his mind and harsh comedy. His mother, played by Christine Haber, is a constant support wage that, without her, she would crumble. His friends also give Jeff a life in his life, often choosing him instead of choosing to allow him to use his free will ... which he has often neglected. <br /> <br /> Writing is great and conversations flow like Kevin Smith's movie scenes, half as much as Ben Affleck's boo-hoo fests. <br /> <br /> The camera's work is a little dirty at some points, and sound can also be used as a boost, but the small details are reflected in the performance. It is also supported by a beautiful soundtrack with local talent and exceptional composer. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was petting. A rare pearl among many jewels.
