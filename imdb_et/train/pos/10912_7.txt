"The Ex-Mrs. Bradford" (1936), starring Thin Man's post-Star William Powell (this movie was released in the same year as another Thin Man movie, "After The Thin Man", is very close to repeating fun and style) This wonderfully fun, very fun murderer while comic vein. <br /> <br /> Did Myrna Loy miss? I would like to mention a better substitute than Jean Arthur, and Arthur and co-star William Powell's chemistry is real and fun, romantic and inclusive. <br /> <br /> Story and Scenario Anthonyu Vieller and Partner of John Wyne Manufacturing Company, James Edward Grant ("The Angel and the Bad Person") are close to having Thin Man's effort, but he doesn't have a little right spirit and spunk. <br /> <br /> Although it is not in The Thin Man's stratosphere (which is yet to be?), "former Mrs. Bradford" is one of the most interesting dozens and dozens of mystery comedies of the 30s and 40s " who-made-your ".
