Bravo! Morgan Freeman is an actor who is investigating what he is playing before he takes on the commitment. Freeman is a "good fit" for this movie (as he was for "Driving Miss Daisy") and is not only credible, but has the ability to change his image to play characters with reserved dignity. Although there are no guarantees in life, it gives every actor an excellent opportunity to play different or unique characters to avoid stereotyping. And it has to be said that stereotyping has hindered or completely destroyed the career of a significant number of actors. <br /> <br /> This is a low budget movie that was amazingly done in just two weeks. This is a film that is well managed and written by Brad Silberling. The location manager chose Carson, CA to set up the movie, and the location helps determine the tone and timing of the movie. Editing is good, but a bit harsh. <br /> <br /> Silberling was a "subcontractor" to receive this movie from Freeman, while the actor was among the film programs. <br /> <br /> Freeman and Paz Vega, a Spanish actress, have a good chemistry that opens up an effective dialogue between every cast member who is diverse and from different cultures. The film also encourages understanding between people who speak not only two languages ​​(English and Spanish), but come from two different nationalities, races, gender, norms, mores, beliefs, popularities, principles and values. The film seeks some honesty and truth to preserve the integrity of the film. Part of the comedy is that Freeman plays an unemployed actor who has been working for four years. Indeed, Freeman is as demanding as the actor he is constantly working on. And the film's fiction gives the viewer some preview of things that an actor has to go through to perform. <br /> <br /> If necessary, tell your boss that you are taking a mental health day and watching this movie. If you're capable, take your remarkable other or your family. I'm making a movie out of 10 out of 10. It is enjoyable, interesting, informative, terrible and worthwhile.
