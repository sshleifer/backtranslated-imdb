I saw this movie last night in a special cinema in Nuremberg, which was great. I have to admit that the original music composition of the cello player and percussion / xylophone player influenced the film's mood, but the film also had the strength to portray its tragic Nibelungen saga. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in silent movies or Nibelungenlied, I highly recommend this movie. The costumes were fantastic and creative, the sets were rich and exotic, and the actor was dramatic and breathtaking (like the silent movie "tragedies"). Unfortunately, I haven't seen the first part of the movie duo about Siegfried. The story of this second film begins after Siegfried's death, when the Kremlin (in the Norwegian version of Gudrun's nature) begins to plan his revenge against his brothers. <br /> <br /> I also watched this movie in German; I am a native English speaker and a German master. It was always difficult to read the subtitles (what do you call it in silent movies?) Because of the old German scenario, so I suggest that if you look at it in German, make sure you can distinguish your "k", "f" and "s" old script. :)
