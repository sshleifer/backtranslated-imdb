Christy Brown doesn't have much over-cheap songs. Born in the 1930s with paralysis of the brain of Dublin, his parents thought his shortage was both spiritual and physical. Although finally diagnosed properly, Brown, who was in the lower working class family with nearly 20 children, had to press himself to be appreciated by his family. With his only fully functioning limb, his left leg, he taught himself to write and paint, both skills expertly developed. <br /> <br /> But what makes Brown's autobiography "My Left Foot" is such humility. Both director and writer Jim Sheridan and star Daniel Day-Lewis have managed to tell this story so that they do not dare to turn to the attention and melodrama. Cheesy's struggles and frustrating scenes, as well as the moments of a minute's victory, are a mild fun that is so wonderful, but "My left leg" remains real and inspired. <br /> <br /> Day-Lewis is the easiest to highlight. Playing such people with serious physical disabilities must be a demanding task. Day-Lewis not only gives us a very complete picture of Christy, but also succeeds in crowning the growth, healing, and inner change of character at different stages of his life. He plays with Christy 17 when he was limited in language skills and was emotionally volatile just as sharp as his intellectually learned Christy, who is fighting to cope with why he can't find non-platonic love. The final theme is the strongest film, and it would have been nice for Sheridan and Shane Connaughton to bring it out. Regardless of what day-Lewis can understand and understand all these elements, giving such an incredible performance that you often do not have time to think "wow, he is such a big actor." These are the most commendable performances. <br /> <br /> Equally important, but with more sophisticated tools, Sheridan's work is on film. This story is about everyday life and fighting. Although Christy has such a unique situation that hinders his life, his struggles, unlike ours, and Sheridan completely grasp this concept. Christy struggles with love, parenting, dignity, and ability. His struggles are simply physically expressed (literally and figuratively) than we are. <br /> <br /> Sheridan gives us moments that capture the spirit of the big brown family and Christy's unique place in it. Drama develops naturally when tensions are highest and humor is much the same. The dinner at which Christy learns that his doctor / teacher - the woman he loves - is marrying his brother Peter, is the best example of both Day-Lewis and Sheridan's efforts. Sheridan has built it so well that it comes out when we're done and Day-Lewis takes us out of her stunning job. <br /> <br /> Another strong part of the movie is Brenda Fricker, Mr Brown. I didn't know he won the Oscar, but in his performance there was something like Christy's loving and wise mother who just cried for Oscar. His love for Christ and his constant struggle against him seem so persuasive and affectionate, and he deserves much compassion because of his situation. <br /> <br /> The emotional hit of the movie, when the story is, is surprisingly minimal. Perhaps it was the part of the victim who was trying to create a film that seems organically humane. These two should be compatible, but I imagine that it is difficult to tell a story that is real to life, and that provides enough dramatic moments to take our emotions to a skater. The last choice was definitely "My Left Foot" wise. Brown's circumstances speak for themselves - they do not have to be pushed for a more severe dramatic effect. <br /> <br /> Steven C <br /> <br /> Visit my site at moviemusereviews.com
