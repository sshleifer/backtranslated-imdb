Masterpiece. <br /> <br /> So it's not for everyone. <br /> <br /> Camera work, operation, control and everything else is unique, original, excellent in every sense - and very different from the trash we're used to. <br /> <br /> Summer Phoenix creates a deep, credible and intriguing Esther Kahn. Like everything in this movie, his acting is unique - it is entirely his own - neither "British" nor "American" nor anything else I've ever seen. There is something frustrating about this. <br /> <br /> Long, uninterrupted, natural shots are wonderful, reminding us that we have become too used to some limited imaging and editing techniques.
