The story of the dropper, his sheep breeder and his superior daughter is not for every taste, but it is still very intriguing. This is happening in the beautiful country of New Zealand, among the landscapes we have known so well about other films in this region. <br /> <br /> This movie was the first time I saw this magnificent Mary Regan, and I've been her fan ever since. Bruno Lawrence, who is probably best remembered by the American audience in the movie "Smash Palace", is also cast. Terence Cooper is the owner of the ranch, who pays little attention to her daughter (Regan). Well done, unforgettably breaking all your wires. I first saw this movie in an extremely edited form on late-night television here in America, but believe me that the un-released version should not be missed.
