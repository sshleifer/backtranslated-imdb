Gung Ho is one of the films you want to see again and again. Michael Keaton is responsible for managing the Japanese car company to come to his city, creating jobs for the Hadleyville residents. What happens after that is one fun moment after another. These two cultures come into contact and Keaton is bound to keep things together. Look for great performances from Keaton, Gedde Watanaba, George Wendt, Mimi Rogers, John Turturo, Soh Yamamura and Sab Shimomo. Everything is completely cast. Don't be fooled by low numbers. This is 7.5 in my book. It is interesting to note that the name Hadleyville was also used in High Noon. Yes, there is real Hadleyville, but in Oregon.
