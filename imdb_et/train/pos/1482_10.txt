Best film about marriage and family. This is a very interesting reflection for couples coming to the dangerous and paradoxical world of marriage and family. This decision may be our life and the lives of our children better or worst. True invasion or help for "friends" or prisoner when we leave. The real role of families: they can help or destroy us. The crazy priest, perhaps not much mad, says what can happen to statistics and reality. A couple who thinks of a "special" marriage lives a painful story in their future history. <br /> <br /> Who likes marriage? Someone, after the priest tells his story? if they leave the other hand in the future if they do not know what marriage is. Problems are true that life requires every real action, guarantees. The real victims of divorce are children with the real name of Andrea in the film or name. That abortion is just a simple exit: after abortion there is sadness, regret and an accident. That the state and social security are less likely to think about the real problems of families every time. "Friends" rumor, infidelity because of Steffania's weakness and despair, because Tomasso lives his life as if he were alone. <br /> <br /> Maybe someone might think this movie is a pessimistic movie, but not. Steffania and Tomasso, in the depths of their hearts, love the beautiful marriage and family, if not why do they love marriage? True and beautiful marriage depends only on a couple: every decision, every action in their life. The family could be a place where everyone feels loved because he is his existence. The scenario is great. The performances are great: Steffania and Tomasso, a nearly cynical priest! Great direction and script. Camera colors and control are great.
