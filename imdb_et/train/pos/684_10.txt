I grew up watching this series. I was about seven / eight years old when it was. I still remember the first episode called "new house". It frightened me out! I can almost hear this shape, laughing badly. And the end, oh God! Whore's Spirit Comes to Child's Room: Yikes! It was a classic TV and it was a kind of series. I found a DVD collection for sale online: 2 actually. My question to readers: Has anyone bought this kit? It's bootleg. Both sellers claim to have a very good copy. I have a sketchy and poor DVD of the "The New House" episode and a few other better better episodes, but if anyone knows if they are much clearer, it would be useful for me to buy and share it with kids. Great series, smart and scary supernatural. Thanks in advance to all the fans who have any of it - I really want to discuss it. Chris Walker
