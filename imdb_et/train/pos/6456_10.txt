My expectations were quite high for this movie. Anyone I know who saw it in the movie cinema told me that everything was there by credit because they were so touched. My expectations would not have been greater, something strange would be disappointed to me. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed with this movie. I loved how it dealt with heavy issues without the usual steps that the Hollywood movie tends to contain. In this film, the characters worked for decades, working through prejudices, learning to open. But it did not come easily and not only by singing or singing. It was painful, took the arguments, took the confrontation. It seemed like a real life. <br /> <br /> One scene that really stuck to me was where Gabriella sings her song. Helen Sj√∂holm is one of my favorite singers, her voice is lovely, and you could say she was not just recording the previous recording (which I often found in other films), but sang with her whole body and soul. You could feel what Gabriella felt in this scene. If that film had been made in Hollywood, its song would probably have ended, and it would have made her husband's eyes open and see her road mistake and made other people in the village understand the thing. or two. Instead, it came halfway through and it didn't bring solutions. Her husband did not get confused and realized what he was doing, and it didn't seem like this village was more open to anyone else. It was beautiful, clean and touched but didn't solve all of her problems. It seemed to me real, that is probably what would have happened in real life. The whole film was a real life for me, nothing was properly wrapped, but all the joy and happiness. You will rarely find a movie that looks so realistic. <br /> <br /> There were some things that disturbed me, but hey, no movie is perfect. If you have not already done so, you should go see "As heaven is" and be filled with the joy of life, the feeling of hope and the feeling that you are rarely in the level of touched movies. You're sad, painful, happy and a dozen other emotions. <br /> <br /> Someone said that if every person in the world sang in a choir, there would be no more wars. Having seen this movie, I should agree.
