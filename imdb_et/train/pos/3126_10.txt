I'm not just giving out the ten star rating. The film really has to impress me and The Bourne Ultimatum is far from it. What's more, this trilogy has come together so nicely that I believe it is one of the greatest trilogys of our time. Although all three films no longer differed from Ludlum's novels, they are still a powerful landmark for cinematographic achievements. Bourne's ultimatum made me want to cry that the series was complete, but I couldn't even smile for hours. <br /> <br /> Since the opening title came out, I knew we were driving. Paul Greengrass has done it again. Everything we love about previous Bourne movies is here again: action, dialogue, and of course the shaky camera. But for me, the last one was never a problem. I think it adds tension. <br /> <br /> I see this movie many times before it appears on the DVD, just because it is a genius. This is a completely satisfactory conclusion and should over time try out as a fantastic movie and an absolutely unforgettable trilogy.
