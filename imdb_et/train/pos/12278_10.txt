Well, I said this in a nutshell, i simpley adore the movie and cast it ... i would give every actor an Oscar ... a great, great movie ... i'm 25 now and i watched it 4 times in different periods and i always think i dont cry and i always do about 2 or 3 times ...;) meryl s. was totally brilliant, jeremy irons too .. just brilliant ... i want the movie got more prizes ... i really don't know anyone who watched it and didn't love it ... well, glenn close was fantastic. .. the story was beautiful and sad at the same time ... i loved it, that despite all the clara and esteban loved each other so much and how blanca was near their parents ...
