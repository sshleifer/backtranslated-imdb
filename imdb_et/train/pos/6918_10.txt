A very enjoyable movie with signs that do bad things and cast a bubble on emotions like anger and revenge. The cast is very good, there are a lot of actions, and Stewart finally gets the girl and his revenge (twists). I've seen this movie many times and have always watched it on AMC or cable. Highly recommended ...
