I love this movie / short thing. Jason Steele is amazing! My favorite stuff is the French song and the opening song, when you spat the soldier "SPOONS!" I break every time. I recommend this movie to Knox Klaymation fans and people who enjoy other movies by Jason Steele. His animation is very original. Note a detailed view to see the background. His humor is also fun and there is definitely nothing you heard before. Like Max, there is a deformed Spatula with a head and sound system that carries colorful light and happy music when it speaks of its unhappy life. It's a great animation to watch at any time.
