SPECIAL DAY (Ettore Scola - Italy / Canada 1977). <br /> <br /> Every time you come in contact with a movie that really touches the nerve. It offers a very simple assumption that is virtually flawless in almost every respect and at the same time incredibly moving. It's surprising Ettore Scola "Una giornate particulare" is relatively unheard, even hated by some critics. Time Out calls it "garbage" and Leonard Maltin, somewhat softer, "pleasant but empty". I not only agree that this film is moving deeply, but for this simple story it shows us more information about everyday life in Fascist Italy than most people have seen in movies. Cinematic art is clearly inconvenient, even a bit happier and understandable, which can explain the relative unpopularity of the film. At the end of the 1970s, the audience was not spoiled by major Italian films, it is even strange that it did not really hit the critics. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a 10-minute collection of archival material from Hitler's visit to Italy on May 8, 1938. Based on this background, we first meet with Antonietta (Loren), a lonely loved military housewife with six children in a Rome apartment house. One day, when his Beo flees, he will meet his neighbor Gabriele (Mastroianni), who seems to be only one in a building that does not attend ceremonies. He is good-natured, cultured and will soon be tempted by him. Throughout the film we hear the fascist rally through the concierge radio, which is through the courtyard. Scola uses the camera to make us part of the procedure. After the opening stage, the camera moves around the courtyard of a modernist (hypermodern) apartment building, seemingly looking for our main characters we haven't met yet. <br /> <br /> Marcello Mastrionan and Sophia Loren are unforgettable in two leading roles, the more amazing they are against the type. Canadian born John Vernon plays Loren's wife, but he's only on the screen in the first and last scene. I think her voice must be duplicated because she is not of Italian origin and has never lived there, so I can't imagine she speaks Italian. If his voice was dubbed, I didn't notice at all. On the contrary, it is completely believable in Italian, even more than the rest. The story is simple, but extremely effective, the performances are outstanding, the end is just perfect, and framing doesn't come as surprising, but works perfectly. Don't miss it. <br /> <br /> Obscura Camera 9/10
