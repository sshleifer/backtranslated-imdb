I was particularly glad that Othello had a dark skin in this film, and Desdemonal had no fair hair as almost always. I also played very well, and I liked the script so faithfully after the original Shakespeare text. But I have to say that some scenes were too erotic for a character like Desdemona. I've always thought she was very modest and that's why it's not right to show her in bed with Cassio - though it was only in Othello's imagination. First of all, I was a little surprised that the love scene between Othello and Desdemona was so open. But as a whole, I liked the film and especially Desdemona, who was crying to die.
