MacArthur is a great movie with a great story about a big man? General Douglas MacArthur. This is, of course, one of America's great soldiers and a familiar figure from the earliest moment of my memory. Although there is a question of consistency (there may be others), eg. In the MacArthur speech he described in his film as the address of the US Military Academy at the reception of the Thayer Prize in 1962, the phrase "old soldiers never die; they just disappear." (It was in his speech to Congress after his dismissal by President Truman) in 1951 for his alleged contradiction (these two did not see the eye!) Gregory Peck is im-peck-capable because of the general who promised he returned to the Philippines in World War II. The film moves quickly and easily with the General, his family and employees from the beginning of World War II to the end of his career. This film would be much more important in knowing both World War II and the Korean War. Nevertheless, Pecki is a depiction of the great man who fought against the double evils of Fascism and Communism and who hated war because only a soldier can be memorable. "The war is not a substitute for victory."
