The Rupert Friend will be given a presentation, like Prince Albert, which raises "Young Victoria" to an unexpected level. He's great. As we know, Queen Victoria fell into the dark, deep depression of Prince Albert's death and looking at Ruper's friend's eyes, which I understood. The film does not lead us to death, but to an incident that can pay very much for our lives. The act of love. I believed it or I should tell him. I believed what he felt was real. Nothing or anyone goes close to the delicacy and depth of a friend's testimony. Emily Blunt is good, but I didn't think she was Victoria. There is no real feeling. It may not be his fault, but his prince deserves a crown.
