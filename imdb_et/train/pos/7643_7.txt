Spoiler !!! This movie is based on What If? Of course, Mr Destiny can answer that question. The main character goes through a bad day, like many of us, and asks this question. Chaos Theory argues that a Chinese butterfly can affect someone here from a chain reaction. The focus of this film is based on one event during baseball. This event triggers your destiny; Just like Ashton's The Butterfly Effect, except Mr. Destiny uses comedy over drama. The results give a fresh, somewhat original film. If philosophy is in line with the "Butterfly Effect," probably Destiny enjoys. I'll give him 10 out of 10. Amazingly, I have seen this movie for the first time 3 times and finally looked at the end of TBS.
