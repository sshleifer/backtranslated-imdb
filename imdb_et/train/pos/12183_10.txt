One reviewer notes that it doesn't seem important what Welles actually says or does, he moves you. I agree. He was and remains a unique force in the film. More than a triple threat that could act, write, and steer, he had a genius that was unique to film. One might consider whether he would have been a painter at an earlier age. This film will certainly strengthen this impression. Musician, theater actor, Shakespeare's heir? hard to say, but I am very grateful that his class with film and he has filmed it. I like the accent. I like face, size, style, mind and games. I love all his movies and I want more. I especially love the way other participants interacted with him in the film. Many were never better with him or at least somehow different because he was there. Even to the end when his beauty was destroyed, perhaps because of his own will, he was unable to ignore and he did every scene he had. goes to Welles and one more minute, another movie, one more hour in his company. That's why we all want us to be able to get the leftovers from our movies, because we know we all know its part isn't worth our time. Look at it and be grateful for the opportunity.
