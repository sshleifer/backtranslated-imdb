I have zero interest in rape and ghetto culture, I'm white and classic rock, but it didn't stop me from evaluating this fantastic comedy. It is pretty much the successor of this spinal bucket in the sense that it is the same film, but of rapeseed or stone. But it's fun. There are many funny jokes, but not a couple of jokes that just fall. The characters are all very funny and plausible. I just looked at it because it made me laugh at 3.00 and every movie that could do it, which must ensure at least a test screening. One of the reasons why this movie was so funny was that it makes the shake different. Rap is worried today about the wrong things and studio noise and little talent. This film comes from a time when rappers deserved more credit. In general, this is a funny film that has many jokes about racism, gender and music culture among the more obvious humor. It is highly recommended for any fan that is Spinal Tap. They are essentially the same movie from almost different worlds, and yes, the same jokes work in both movies.
