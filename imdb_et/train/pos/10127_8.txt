It was the beginning of it! In this case it is not the best friends, but it was the pilot of the show, don't forget, not bad. We introduce the gang and Central Perki where our story begins. Even from this first episode, we get signs of Ross-Rachel coming over the next ten years, when Ross says, "I want to get married again" and Rachel rushes with a wedding dress ... apparently not deliberate because while writers were in Monica-Joey's relationship, but it fits well now. Something else ... in this episode, Rachel Chandler will be introduced if these two had never met before, but in later episodes, called "flashbacks", which is in conflict because the two have met three times. However, the idea is that it is a great start for a big show. This episode may not be their usual friends when we are used to them, but most are experienced, but during the next few episodes we see why the exhibition was what it was! Follow, the first season is a blast!
