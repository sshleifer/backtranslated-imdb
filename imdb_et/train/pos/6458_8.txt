A beautiful film that thoroughly touches the simple but divine aspects of mankind. <br /> <br /> This movie was almost perfect and seeing that nothing in this world can be truly perfect is pretty good. The only small thing I am subjectively challenging is the exchange of some points in the middle of the story. Action is also very good, and all participants are easily on top of the movies. The actual management seems to be thoughtful and the script must be amazing. There are some truly amazing moments of birthday and pretty proud constant story with a circular composition. a truly brilliant yarn.
