Like the characters in this exhibition, I was a teenager in the 70s. Indeed, in the 1970s, the producers pulled the entire zeitgeist, being a suburban teenager. 70's fashion, cars, home furniture, food and fashion fashions are very authentic in this show. <br /> <br /> The show has a very talented majority of the band, all of whom connect the camera very well. I like a truly unique, psychedelic style. No other show does such camera tricks. Indeed, these top-notch movie sequences help to convey the characteristic campy hypnosis of the 70s. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a very funny sitcom. One thing that disturbs me at this show is that it is an excessive dependence on cruel humor, to laugh. In this way, I think this exhibition is trying to be too much married with children. Although married to children is an excellent sitcom independently, it is sticky that the creators of the 70s are trying to replicate it again. <br /> <br /> I recommend showing this 70s, mainly because of your nostalgia factor. However, it may be even better to show when writers rely on spiritual dialogue rather than foolish, delicious jokes and horrors.
