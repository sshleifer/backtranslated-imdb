This movie is incredible. In large letters, especially with the old swordsman who can fly in the form of a fireball and jump over trees, this film tells the classic story of the forces of good and evil. The final showdown is specifically breathtaking and the music score is kind and cool. <br /> <br /> Very, very recommended. Not for the smallest children. This one deserves 10.
