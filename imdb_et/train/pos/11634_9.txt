I also returned to Redeye's advanced screening and I have to say I haven't had so much time in the movie. WES CRAVEN is her best. He brings us an amazing end to the summer thriller, which was so desperate. It's a thriller of the year. <br /> <br /> All the participants are amazing and the action is realistic and fun. F / X were great. It constantly built up tension. I was on the edge of most of the movie. It has been a while since I heard the audience's joy and cling and the excitement in the theater. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for excitement, action and a good plot this summer, REDEYE. Look at this!
