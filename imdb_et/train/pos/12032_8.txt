The film I watch is a small television film made in 1996 and where Melissa Joan Harti and Daniel Baldwin played. <br /> <br /> The main protagonist / antagonist Jennifer Stanton (Hart) is a typical American teenager who knows the pressure of such a controlling father (Baldwin). But when he meets the former name of Nick Ryan ("ever kissed" by Jeremy Jordan), they immediately fall against each other, but Jennifer has a different idea of ​​where to get his relationship. he manipulates him to kill his parents, protect his "love", but he just used him to get rid of his parents so he could be with Brad (David Lascher's future "Sabrina" to Mr Hart). Melissa Joan Hart really surprised me with her role as an evil manipulator, and she carries the movie well using her friends and Nick so she can literally be killed by murder. The remaining supporting cast works well and everyone has their time when they have the time on the screen. I also found it interesting that this movie was made and appeared in the same year, Hart, began to portray Sabrina, a teenage witch, and it shows she can act in her film and television genres. <br /> <br /> Although the film is somewhat outdated as it faces some of his best work, which involves drama or thriller, and I am waiting for "Nine Deaths" in November, as it shows that he sees other people not named "Clarissa Darling". or Sabrina Spellman "<br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Melissa Joan Harti or Sabrina. You can watch it online so I suggest you check it out.
