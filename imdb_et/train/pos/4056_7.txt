I saw it on SBS TV here in Australia in the second week, where it was headed "Laputa: heaven in heaven". I had promised subtitles and I think SBS gave it to itself, which, as usual, was of very good quality. <br /> <br /> Just looking at "Laputa" in Wikipedia and confirming what I suspected ... this story floating island has been taken from the classic Jonathan Swift's novel "Gulliver's Trips" that appeared in the early 1700s to mid-century. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is an interesting Japanese fairy tale that speaks English. I think it is suitable for small children, but it will take a little over two hours, so it can be too long for some, though not for me an adult. <br /> <br /> The story is about two kids trying to find a legendary floating island with its castle. Children are not the only ones looking for this island. They also have pirates, armies and spies who are looking for the island, and want to capture the children (Sheeta, girl, Anna Paquin and Pazu, James Van Der Beek) to help them find the graphics are great ... sort of photorealistic, especially rock ball Illuminated stone scenes or beautiful scenes of beautiful, sunny days with white clouds, or fog. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
