Yes, it's up, yes, it's a little cliché and yes, Constance Marie is the whole child and deserves to be seen again and again! Jokes and gags can become old and repetitive after a while, but the show is still fun to watch. Because it is a family show, humor is toned and writers have added family values ​​and ideals between gags. <br /> <br /> George Lopez is funny. Don't take her seriously and the winner of the show. I'm sure he didn't want his character to be serious or virtuous. His outbursts and intimidation are fun ... <br /> <br /> I have to say that one big, dark, bitter place is Benny. I hate this character ... so much that whenever he's over 30 seconds, I just mute the TV so I don't have to hear him. There is nothing funny about his dialogue or jokes. As a mother she must be the worst out there and I'm just shocked and surprised that George, like a character, is standing by such an unfortunate person for so long. <br /> <br /> Even so I still get it. I see Bsee seeing himself: his vision is much better than watching Bill Engvall Show. Now there's a bad sitcom ...
