LOVE TOP THE - The totally wrong American title with the excellent French film "Le Mouton Enrage" (which means I think The Rabid Sheep) - is such an original film, the fact that it dates back to 1974. the more amazing it is. This movie was far from its time; even according to today's highest standards, it achieves things that seem rich and new. Filmed by a very underrated director Michel Deville, it rather restricts the description so that it combines social criticism, comedy, mystery, love, sex, and satire into a completely original mix, ultimately leaving a big but subtle surprise that makes it all gone suddenly sad and understandable. The cast is excellent, written and theme. But this is Deville's delicious tone that keeps you steady but strikes, which really pushes this "lost" movie to a very high level. (An interview with a director in the "Special Features" section of a DVD is definitely worth it if you have time.)
