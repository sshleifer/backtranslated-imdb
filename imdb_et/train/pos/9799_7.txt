Funny Batman Animated Film. Not parallel to "Joker Return" or "Fantasy Mask" but still strong. I liked how you thought the movie was Batwoman. It was a nice twist. Nice sequence of activities. I've always believed that Batman's cartoons are better than any other sad Batman live movie sequel. The trend continues here. <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10
