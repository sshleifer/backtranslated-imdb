Two weeks ago I bought the Dark Angel season 1 and 2 after catching the first episode of the season on Channel 5. Nothing made me how this show is great. I haven't had anything as much as Firefly (also and the amazing show). I admit that Season 2 is not quite as good, but there are still some amazing episodes (see Set it, Bag, Mother, Berrisford Action Plan, Port Lights, Freak Nation etc.) and Alec is great. I've heard some plans for 3 seasons, and I have to say I can't believe it was canceled - I won't break it for you - but it would have shaken! I also think it has a lot of potential as a film (although it seems very unlikely at the moment). As proof of its obsessive nature, Maxi's barcode number is 332960073452, and in the two weeks I have had it, I've been watching 3 episodes twice in both seasons. It's just too good.
