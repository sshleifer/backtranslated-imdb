The "Gangster" genre is now a worn item that is too often under parody. Looking back, the culmination of the previous clichés of the series used in this genre, fortunately, writers have created this mistake by creating realism applied to it. Sopranos is an epic criminal saga that illustrates its content with a psychological depth characterized by subtle nuance, humor and incessant violence. The main protagonist, Tony Soprano, perceives the dangerous general injury of the fear and moral values ​​of his team, but Tony is the best person, while the other is guilty and contradictory. Because of any obstacles or contradictions, I certainly believe that Sopranos has the best ensemble of recent memories. All the things I thought I could do with a detailed statement about this series, but I don't. Once there is a visual glossary of global consumption, look for these definitions very important, ambiguous, uneven, epic, uncompromising, and the sophisticated visage of the soprano smiles right back.
