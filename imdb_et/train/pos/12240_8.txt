If you are a person looking for a realistic movie or a movie with a strong and incredible plot, this movie is NOT for you. No, you hate it. But for those who like sweet, slightly screwed comedies, you have a nice time watching this little movie. <br /> <br /> Tony Randall is working for the IRS and is exploring a very nice farmer who has never understood filing a tax return. But hard to try to convince them of the seriousness of their visit, all family members are excited to have a company. They put her and treat her like a family, and they have plans to hook her up with her daughter Debbie Reynolds. It's really all about the plot. But the movie gets fun scripts and proper action. A really nice little curio from the late 1950s.
