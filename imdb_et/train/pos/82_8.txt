Fortunately, we have fans of Real McCoy (probably all generations of baby boomers in the late 50s and 60s), three adult actresses / actresses appeared when they did during the reunion show, both died short afterwards. As enjoyable as Luke, Sugar-Babe and Pepino meet again, was it so mysterious that Lydia Reed's and Michael Winkleman's image was not fully displayed? My understanding is that Little Luke was dead in 1999, but I'm not sure how. There is no information on the Internet about Hassie, which I find. Very curious, why not even mention them? It was so striking that their absence from Réunion indicates that I suspect that Michael and Lydia's family (if alive), 1) asked them to stay out of the debate, and so they were asked, or 2) TNN found no trace Michael or Lydia (like our rest) seemed to have disappeared. Therefore, the safest policy would be to exclude them from the conversation together. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, Walter Brennen's review was great. They didn't make any bones of it ... it was a grandfather who made the show so successful. I remember when a child mimicking grandfather's gimp walking and my parents laughing (as I am sure a million other children did back then). One of the annoyances that bothered me a little was the dominance of Richard Crenna in the debate ... sometimes in the interruption of Tony and Kathleen. Tony, although Tony Martinez seemed to be able to contribute to the conversation, could not speak and say too much during the Réunion exhibition. Unfortunately, because I wanted to hear from all three equally. All in all, Réunion's exhibition was a real treat for me. I watched this DVD several times and enjoyed it every time. <br /> <br /> Dodgerdude
