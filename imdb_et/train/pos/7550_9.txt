Wow. A truly fantastic "movie" with tons of super-surreal images, dark intent and a black, rather strange thought about how cartoon animals see the world. It is populated by a very cute exterior with a number of characters that bend and flow with a twisted background. Like all cool fantasies, the migrating plot is secondary to instant visual images, and we follow a small cat and its zombie when they come across death, pope, water elephants, samurai swords, and fish. I would never have heard of it, but now I love it - probably because it reminded me of the surreal pencil work of American cartoonists; Bill Plympton. It is a demented joy for strange, real fans and I was glued to the screen because I'm afraid of something amazing. Simply put, it's "Hello Kitty" without "o".
