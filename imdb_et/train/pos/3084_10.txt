Oh man, why? "Six Degrees" is an example of this so-called theory that we are all connected to by someone. How to focus on the life of a group of people and the consequences of their activities. <br /> <br /> When I first heard about this performance, it wasn't paying attention at all. In fact, it seemed too common. Then I saw some episodes ... and loved it! First, the characters. They are all well written and different from each other. There's an alcohol addict, a woman whose fianc√© is on her, a woman who just lost her husband, a driver with a difficult brother, and so on. accidents like our daily lives. Great! My favorite is Mae, Carlos and Whitney. <br /> <br /> Then cast. They are all great. Jay Hernandez, "Hostel", shows her ability to act here in more than three symbols than her previous job as Paxton. Others also give great performances, especially Campbell Scott, who plays Steven and Bridget Moynahan, who plays Whitney. canceled. Seriously, I don't understand low ratings. <br /> <br /> It's too bad for him to have no more than one season. This would really be a good performance to follow!
