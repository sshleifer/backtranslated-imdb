Full House came to me when I was about 9. I remember seeing America's Most Video Games with Bob Saget, and one day my mother said she was at Full House. One day I was happy to catch an episode when visiting the family. It didn't seem too interesting at first glance, but when I looked more and more at 9 am, I would just have stayed that way. <br /> <br /> This show really wants you to be there, dance with girls, go with them and maybe even join your little family to "sing together". <br /> <br /> What I like most is that it is a great show for kids and adults of all ages. There are some parts that are more for adults, parts for kids, so the whole family enjoys it. Regardless of how it may be hairy, it's still a great show and I would definitely recommend it to someone. <br /> <br /> 10/10
