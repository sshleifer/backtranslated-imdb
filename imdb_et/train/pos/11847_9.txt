A horse is really a good animal. The scenic images of wild horses and their grace would never have been more majestic in the animation. <br /> <br /> Animation is just amazing. Fine animation forms the backbone of the beauty that the horses rub. What's more, when a slave crosses a diverse landscape, jumps over rocks and brave waters. The soundtrack is also very impressive. Wonderful instrumental music attracts you to appreciate the movie. "They say the western story is written from a horse saddle." Well, the story of a fine horse was written from the western saddle. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is probably where it's best. This is one of the best animations I have been watching. It would be a very good choice for a lonely evening. Easy 9/10.
