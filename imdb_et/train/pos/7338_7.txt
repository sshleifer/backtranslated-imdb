Fire and ice is a fantasy movie animated in the world. In the film there is a village that destroys the giant glacier, which is the home of the Necrotic Evil Body. The only survivor of the village is a young man named Larn, who is trying to release those killed by the glacier. The ice glacier moves through the fire land and the Teegra-named land princess kidnaps evil creatures. Larn tries to find her and tries to find and kill Necron. Fire and ice is led by Ralph Bakshi, one of my favorite adult animators. He has brought us animated masterpieces such as Fritz's cat film and some of the films he himself has written, such as the big movie Heavy Traffic. I didn't like the fire and almost as much as I have Ralph Baksh's second job, but I still found the film enjoyable. Partly it was a very nice animation and the story was fun enough. The only basic complaint I have is that I want to have a more story for the film because the story he uses is very thin and there is not much to it. I also want the film to be a little longer because it is under 80 minutes of working time. It is still an entertaining adventure film that, unlike Fritz, is suitable for children aged 8 years and older for cat or heavy traffic. I just want there to be a more advanced story and it went a little longer than he did.
