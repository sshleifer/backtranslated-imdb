DEVIL'S ACTION is my second attempt to produce Joseph Sarno - and while I say it is much more enjoyable than painfully dull and unerotic Swedish WILDCATS, it's still a bit slow and unclear to my taste. <br /> <br /> This one focuses on a group of vampire girls living in a castle who want to raise their previously murdered "leader". To do this, girls need to dance naked and kiss each other and sing strange things - and of course also drink blood. When a doctor and his brother's car break down and they have to stay in a castle to stay in, they offer horny vampires the ideal bleeding ... but they may not be as helpless as they seem ... <br /> <OUTDOOR is a pretty good example of the 70s from the beginning. Lots of nudity, including some full-featured, some beats - including incest and, of course, lesbian bleeding ... but these scenes are still quite annoying by today's standards. Some pretty hot women in this would have got some explicit sex, but I think it can't. It would also have benefited from some of the more serious violence / gore, being a vampire movie, but I think that DEVIL'S PLAYTHING's goal was more skin than blood. Still a little slow - and most of the action is completely wood - but it's expected from that time and from that budget. It is worth looking at the fans - others may find it somewhat dull. 7/10
