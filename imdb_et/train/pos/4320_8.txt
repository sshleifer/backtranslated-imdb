This very underrated movie is (for me) what good movie writing should be. Kasdan takes a search for meaning in our lives and makes it look and wonder for everyone. The film tells us what sections people create to isolate themselves from the violence and hatred of everyday life. <br /> <br /> Along the way questions are asked after life. Davis (Steve Martin, with a big beard) asks himself, "Does my violent film (and our enjoyment) cause violence in society?" Claire asks, "What kind of world throws something so valuable as human life?" Mack is not immune when he asks: "Is it possible to overcome the limits of funding and (even more difficult) funding? Of course, they are not quoted from the movie, but general. Others also ask questions and be honest it will rise more than it answers. <br /> <br /> But this is the essence of life. We try to find answers to all the questions we never answer, and in some cases we have to respond as people we bloom with questions that we cannot answer, some answers are real, Claire and Mack understand that although they could easily drive and let the state take the child, finding them accountable Some answers are not. Davis sees the light and decides not to make violent films, but the next day he turns around and leaves his epiphany under his art. <br /> <br /> All of our movies don't match them, it just reminds you to look for answers. <br /> <br />
