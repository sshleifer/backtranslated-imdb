Denzel Washington takes a real story of his director's debut, which is also a very difficult story, and brings it honestly to what we have been waiting for Washington to do, but now we see this touch as a leader. Recently, we have seen some catastrophic results that have come for children who have fallen through the public protection gap. This story speaks of a nightmare that leaves horrible scars but ultimately suggests a triumph of human mind. <br /> <br /> We cannot choose from too many close and not the best efforts on the first effort problems. editing these scenes, but the simplicity of other scenes of such power cannot be underestimated. <br /> <br /> If the Academy looks out of this movie, it's travesty. This film does not pull the strokes and goes the story of cold hard facts, purity that usually does not exceed the novel's screen. This is, of course, a tribute to the Director. <br /> <br /> It's dandy, so look at it and tell your friends to see it!
