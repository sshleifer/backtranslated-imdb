Contrary to popular belief, this title is at least as bad for me. Actually. I always consider it a preferred film. Welding songs was not too well structured when you consider the differences between the series, but you can still look at it happily. For the day's feature film, the scenes are well proportional and the characters remain consistently plausible. <br /> <br /> Audio / Sound is my personal favorite. Almost everyone has the right sound effect and many voices are much better suited to the characters than the current, poorly cast US duplicates. Sync is perfect in every key. I had some trouble casting aliens' votes (please forgive the tongue name, it's been a while since I've seen it). Otherwise, the majority seemed balanced. I feel and believe the characters of this movie. Duplies are often a topic that I agree with so long ago. I loved the OSD at that time, but the castings often allowed the series to go down. <br /> <br /> Here I would like to add that it was one of the first anime I saw in my life. It has a historic value for me, but even after seeing the original Megazone 23, it stayed stronger and better in my collection. <br /> <br /> To my knowledge, the title was only in the United States in Texas. Personally, I think it's a shame. If it were subordinated to the right audience, I think the film would have been accepted by Robotech and not faded over the years. I am tied to anime every day in my life and all I have shown about this movie thought it was a nicely put together title. <br /> <br /> Watching a movie after its separate components allows the viewer to notice the visible plot times between exhibitions. However, the viewer does not see the originals without seeing. Since the animation is stylistically identical, there was no reason to ask back for that day. The United Kingdom had very limited access to the anime. Laser discs were the most productive media. Personally, I like the way Carl had balls to at least push the genre. I mean, Harmony wasn't going to put money for the series to be public. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that people have a couple of wrong mistakes in this movie, the eighties feel it loves me. If you look at Megazone 23 now, for your original Japanese sound or new dub, I believe you are very disappointed with OSD. Create your thoughts back into the original Bubblegum Crisis Dub soundtrack and imagine that E.V.E.'s new eighties sound. <br /> <br /> All in all. The popularity of this movie today is most likely its rarity in the open market. Personally, it created a collection for me. I have to clean the world now for goods from three components and if I ever meet Carl Macek, I shake my hand for effort and buy a pint or box to get an anime.
