First of all, I was completely guarded about the original lyricism of the film, and then I was completely fascinated by the stage story and brilliant leadership. The characters were all fully developed, not life-larger, but like the people we live wherever we are in the world, in Sweden, Turkey, or the Americas, all the very believers with foibles and nobles. Hollywood learned so much about this beautiful film. This shows that there is no need to go to every little detail behind each action to bring out the whole subject clear and bright, and it shows the director's shine. Famous thanks to Kay Pollak and the great pain of this great care !!
