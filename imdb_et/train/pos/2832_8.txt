I saw this movie in 1969 when it first appeared in Cameo Theater in South Beach, now in the famous Crowbar Night Club. It was a wild last year of the 60s and this movie really hit home. That is all; a generation gap, a sexual revolution, a success story, and a conflict between following the "traditions" of the family and those seeking their way through life. <br /> <br /> It was a fast paced, very enjoyable movie. Vegas was at the top of that hippie, Sin City in all its glory. Beautiful women, famous fiery, laughs, conflict, romance and even a happy ending. Very enjoyable time for all. <br /> <br /> The poster of this film rests on the wall of my bedroom. I look at it and I go back in time; the time of my youth and my time with my father, a great time in my life.
