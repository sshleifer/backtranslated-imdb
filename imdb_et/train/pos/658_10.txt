It's not easy to watch a movie - it's over three and a half hours long and consists entirely of conversations. But it is so incredibly convincing and ruthlessly observing a person's character that it is one of the greatest films in history in my humble opinion. <br /> <br /> The film is frustrating, cynical and cruel. (If you want something extraordinary, look at Jacques Rivette's fantastic CÃ©line and Julie Go Boating, which was done at the same time). It shows the ideal of the late 1960s that it is no different from the society it was trying to change. Marie (Bernadette Lafont) and Veronika (Francoise Lebrun). However, Alexandre has proved to be as chauvinistic and jealous as any other person. Women are arbitrarily exposed and define their femininity through the eyes of men. <br /> <br /> The film is a very revolutionary new wave in France. This movement was one of the most important movements in film history and had a profound effect on the film as we know it. Jean-Pierre Leaud was one of New Wave's main players, being Francois Truffaut's rebel teen (among other films) influential Les Quatres Cent Coups (1959). Director Jean Eustache is not as well-known as other New Wave directors, but he should be. real-life conversations. The film is resonant with Eustache's personal experiences. For example, Francoise Lebrun was a former Eustache lover. Eustache himself committed suicide in 1981, and the real person whose character Marie was also relied on. Anger and bitterness culminating with Veronika's harassing monologue, delivered directly to the audience, breaking down the cold objectivity of the rest of the film. This mesmerizing, personal and honest film statement is one of the most revealing films of human nature.
