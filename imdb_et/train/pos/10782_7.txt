Michael Stearns is a sexually disillusioned person, Mike, who is sexually disillusioned. She has no problems with naked dancers, but if women start to have sex with men, she loses it. He believes that if women actually have sex, they will lose all "innocence" and / or "beauty". So he walks through the hills of Hollywood, alternating with pairs of love couples. Finally, dead men are photographed with a high-power rifle. <br /> <br /> The primary reason for the existence of this movie is sexual activity over and over again. The "story" comes more than an afterthought. This makes many happy heterosexual men very happy because we treat enough long-lasting nudity scenes (ladies here look awfully good clothes) and sex to be a great dose. Of course, if you see that it extends over a wide range, it will produce serious credibility and illustrate coercion for voyeurism. (First, Mike reminds couples of a couple of minutes of length before the trigger finally pulls out.) All this is accentuated by the terribly intrusive soundtrack of somewhat atmospheric music. <br /> <br /> Those with a hero trash are definitely one or the other degree. It even includes one lesbian trial that interferes with Mike and makes him insecure * how to react. It opens very slowly but surrounds the most fun ironic twists. It's a kinky and twisted rarity that if something is not going to be glued to certain viewers on the screen. <br /> <br /> 7/10
