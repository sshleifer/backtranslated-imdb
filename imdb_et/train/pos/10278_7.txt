"House of Games" is definitely not without its drawbacks - plot holes, rigid operations, final scenes, but they do little to damage the thriller's viewing, which is so head-shattered methodically. "The House of Games" does almost everything a good thriller should do. Of course, this is not a huge performance, given the fact that we are dealing with the world of men and trust. So it makes sense that we never know what's going on, even though we think we're doing it. But it makes the movie useful for gamers; a movie whose repeated viewing is indispensable instead. <br /> <br /> It has a certain Hitchcock slope. The film is based on a similar theme that found its 1964 effort "Marnie", which was considered unsuccessful at the time of liberation, but which is now considered one of the Masters' more thought-provoking. Lindsay Crouse's idea can easily be considered as Tipp Hedrin ... ten years later. Both are strong individuals, both are forced to behave, forcing them to walk too close to the shark pool. As Crouse's repressed, tense character says, "What is life without adventure?" Put your reality control low and enjoy swimming with sharks!
