It came as a surprise. . the effect and resolution of this film was in my automatic way responsive to people and situations. The most obvious was mixing the anger of emotion. Similar to how a corrupted child would be if he did not react. . . pull if you want. Thinking that this anger was hidden from others, was a more ridiculous farce for everyone. What did it cost me? Soooo much love. . .oo many blessings. Now I am present when the incredible humbing feels like and has constant gratitude for life. . What is happening nowadays, without the hopes of living in my nature being certain ways, then how do I think life or people should be. This film has contributed to the freedom I feel to contact others, without limitations and expectations. . .and create true love. . without fear of loss. . .To first love and accept what love is given.
