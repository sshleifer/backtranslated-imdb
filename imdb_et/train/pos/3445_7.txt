First, it was BRAVE film. I've seen irreversible and understand the comparisons. But I can't understand the people who have thrown this movie in the trash. I see how the end may be extreme, but I would lie if I did not want to say that I want every man who has ever forced a woman to have sex exactly what Jared got. On the contrary, it did not solve anything and did nothing better, and the fact that the film does not pretend is what made me evaluate it. <br /> <br /> The above mentioned comment called the film pathetic and claimed that no adult would stick. Certainly I did and deliberately. I'm 24 years old. The way the movie drags it makes me realistic. People have become so accustomed that they show that candies and fast paced shows that if you ask them to focus on too long a brick on the foundation of the film, not only will they lose interest, they will demolish everything that is built and called rubbish. In reality, there is a lack of patience and understanding that needs fine tuning and not a creative product like Talia Lugacy. <br /> <br /> Rosario Dawson showed his destruction flawlessly. I think he portrayed Maya's pre-and post-attack very easily and the transition between the two is an act I rarely see well. Often, as the "teenage films" mentioned in the previous commentary, the effects of rape have been shown to be very manic and impulsive or terribly depressed, isolated and lifeless. In my opinion, Dawson succeeds in fulfilling a balancing factor so that many survivors can fall victim to drone-like existence during wakefulness, doing some dead jobs to survive (and disrupt), and then turning over to lose themselves. with. <br /> <br /> I thought this film was telling the truth and I appreciated that I finally showed the other side of rape to people. So many people at the end of this movie promised the middle and the beginning ... I believe Maya's face was an end to the act ... not the act ... not revenge or the meaning behind it ... just her face ... > <br /> Thank you
