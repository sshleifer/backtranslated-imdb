I got it a few weeks ago and love it! It's modern, light, but full of real life's complexity. Questions and Answers, like other Eytan Fox movies. This is my favorite with Jossi & Jagger. These images are much more, universally than the bubbles we live in. You don't have to enjoy it as Jewish or homosexual - I'm not, but the film goes straight to my ten films. At first it seems to be pure entertainment, but it makes you think. The relationships we have to live in are superficial, meaningful, deep, deadly, you call it. You don't know what's coming, and you're not sure where the story is going to be for the first time. It is worth checking many times. Fox films contain great bonus material - there is a great music video and "making" (including an explanation of the title, interviewing Lior Ashknenaz, who plays himself in the film and the Arabs doubt the lifestyles of Israel).
