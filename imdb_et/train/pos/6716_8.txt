The late, high-grade Z car driver par excellence Al Adamson pulls himself against this brilliantly horrible sci-fi soft core of musical comedy that delves deeply into a depressing and brilliant deep into celluloid stupidity and jaw-dropping stupidity. In the gloomy totalitarian future of 2047, the Big Brother-like impotent bumbling idiot is believed to be a controller (fun to silly Erwin Fuller) sexual. But sweet'n'sexy Cinderella (radiant blonde cutie at Catherine Erhardt) has decided to make things better. Her feminine Fairy Godfather (flamboyantly campy Jay B. Larson) assists Cinderella's large gala ball with a specific plan to attract the beautiful stud Tom Prince (dorky Vaughn Armstrong) and teaching everyone that love is a positive, pleasant and perfectly acceptable action. <br /> <br /> Adamson directs this ridiculous yarn with his usual imperfect incompetence, staging unbelievably horrific song and dance sequences that have a completely lack of skill and elegance. The amazingly frightening "We all need love" number with people with an absurd animal costume is awkwardly awful over the forest. Equally terrible "Mechnical Man" routines that include a host of clumsy cavorting robots. Louis Horvarth crude oil, static cinematography, sticky plastic furniture, Sparky Sugerman's amazing disco score, abundant free nudity (sharp brunette hottie Sherri Coyle is particularly proud of this department) particularly irritating) and evenly awful (Renee Harmon's amazingly toothed Cinderella from the divine supernatural lady who fights here for the grand prizes) will further enhance the astonishingly rich joy in this pleasantly awful cozy.
