After reading this movie commentary and watching the mixed comments, I decided to add my ten cents, which I think I thought was a great film, not just for visual beauty, writing, music score, exhibition and management. but Joseph Smith and the journey where he lived through the difficulties and persecution gave faith in God, how he knew and knew his way. I am really very pleased that I had a small part in telling the story of this remarkable person. I recommend everyone to see it when the opportunity is, no matter what religious path he can walk on, but it makes more and more decisions to live the life we ​​should have the true values ​​of love and forgiveness, as the Savior taught us.
