Alongside the blocks, let me just say that I am a big zombie fan so I don't make the above statements lightly. Secondly, let me say that this is an Italian zombie movie and Fulci it only 15 minutes before the Bruno (Rats, Terror Night) Matte handover. It's not Dawn of dead people. <br /> <br /> This is just one of the most fun zombie films I've ever seen. The script is wonderfully terrible. Just look at two scientists trying to find an antidote ("Let's try to put the two molecules together"). <br /> <br /> Zombies are all varieties. From spider shufflers to using maniacs to birds! Gore is a lot. The legs are bitten, the weapons are amputated, the snakes are broken. <br /> <br /> Speed ​​is fast, flying from one zombie attack to the next. <br /> <br /> Then there is a head in the refrigerator. Oh head in the fridge! One of the biggest moments of horror, as Ash got hold of, was Evil Dead 2. <br /> <br /> You should already know if you are such a person who likes this movie. Get some companions and beers and be a fun night. <br /> <br /> Did I mention the head in the refrigerator?!?!?
