There has been a lot of Jane Eyre's films and television productions to recommend, but I suspect that this is what people still discover and love for decades. It's just classic (and offers a lot more story than others). Timothy Dalton is completely in his element like Rochester; His performance is astonishingly cheerful and colorful, but never abandons the dark complexity of the character. Zelah Clarke's Jane is more of a brain than a different one, but she makes Dalton a perfect foil (who according to her towers!) The nuances of her performance will come out better at the second look (if you have absorbed Dalton's charisma shock)). There are some technical errors and a few moments if the production values ​​could have been better; although it was a high-end production of quite BBC standards. But it is performances that are a real pleasure. Don't miss it!
