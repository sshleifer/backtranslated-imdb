There are moments in the film that are so terrible as your teeth are falling. But knowing that only a few weeks left before the code, the films made it safe and horrible, Paramount rushed it out before production and style. Vanities is so frightening that it is delicious. As Kitty Carlisle sings, women are shown a price tag that offends the Bronx whore. They appear in boxes (nudge, nudge, eye, eye) in the positions of absolute play. Victims of the law, so stupid that they can't find the door, can look for their skirts and sniff. Bare-breasted choir girls sit uncomfortably in gigantic cacti (can they be a source of hallucinogens?) When we listen to "sweet marijuana" and see how the blood falls on the chorus. <br /> <br /> Of course, Carl Brisson studied his lines phonetically and didn't seem to have a clue what he was talking about. But it's all worth it if Norma steals the show if nobody is looking for it. Look at this member of the NOW Charter and prepare for the entire Hollywood body to move. <br /> <br /> Toby Wing, by the way, is icing on the cake. And Duke Ellington doesn't hurt either. <br /> <br /> Must walk under Memory Lane.
