When Lion King was the Hamlet Disney version, Lion King 3: Hakuna Matata is the Guildenster Disney version and Rosencrantz is dead. Like Tom Stoppard's worshiping film, we look from the perspective of a double original character: Timon, a hat that is sure to break a break hat, and Pumbaa, flatulence with flatulence. Following our story - not Simba - we understand why all the animals worshiped when Simba was released from Pride Rock. We'll find out what Timon and Pumbaa decided to go back to Simba to Pride Rock to fight Scar. And we'll know how they're dealing with hyena in recent times. Nathan Lane when Timon gets most of the best jokes, but Ernie Sabella supports Pumbaa. It is also good to hear Matthew Broderick and Whoopi Goldberg, who repeat their role. Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller give their special voice to two new characters: Timon's mother and uncle. The only downside is the constant stop-start-rewind, which does not always help the story go on. Having said this, there is a brilliant zoom near the beginning of the film. More laughing than any other Disney series-third movie, Hakuna Matata is worth seeing - just a hot tub scene that is still funny, though it is a little predictable.
