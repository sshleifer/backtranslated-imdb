After a short prologue that showed a disguised man pursuing the burning of older gentlemen in desert, in the district, a century-old Australian street, we meet Julie (Rebecca Gibney) and Peter (John Adam) when they leave the hunting house. They are able to get a loan to a fixer-top spot on Sydney Street, but it turns out that physical failure is not the only problem with their new home. It can be just haunting. <br /> <br /> 13 Gantry Row combines a memorable, somewhat clich√© story with Catherine Millar in a good and medium direction just above the average shocker. <br /> <br /> The biggest bugs are partly due to the budget, but are not completely excusable for this barrier. An important problem is at the beginning of the movie. The open "thriller scene" contains some surprising edits. Freeze frames and photos are used to cover the lack of action. Excitement should be created from the production, not the fancy "fix it". Landscape, lighting, fog, and the scene have a great ambience in the scene, but the camera should slowly kill and follow the victim, cutting back and forth when we watch the street, showing their increasing closeness. Tracking and cuts must be slow. The attack had to be longer, clearer and better. In its present form, the scene is strong "made for television" and it is a low budget. <br /> <br /> After this scene we move now and the movie stream will improve significantly. The story is much like Amityville Horror (1979), although the budget makes for a much more subtle approach. Millar and screenwriter Tony Morphett effectively create a lot of terrifying scenarios that are often dramatic, such as a mysterious man arriving at the removal of old iron plates attached to a secret wall, rather than a special effect. <br /> <br /> For some horror fans, the first part of the movie may be small in real drama. At least in the first half of the year, the film is mostly from Julie and Peter, who are trying to arrange the financing of the house and then try to settle down. But Morphett writes fine, intelligent dialogue. The material is done well enough that it is often as tense as the more traditional thriller aspects that arise later - especially if you have tried similar tricks when buying your house. <br /> <br /> When they get things started to change, although special effects often leave much to be desired, ideas are good. Performances help to create tension. There is not much death and destruction in the film - there are more nightmares for home repairs. But no danger is really a thing. <br /> <br /> It's human relationships. There are several interesting character cards. The house is more of a metaphor and a catalyst for the stress of a romantic relationship that can change sour and possibly destroy it. Because it is in a cozy neighborhood and the relationship is between two successful yuppies, it shows that these problems do not only affect those who may blame some external troubles, such as money or health problems. Peter's character develops from an aspiring corporate employee to a "normal" work-based friendship relationship with someone who has more despair when he becomes subversive to achieve something more liberating and meaningful. At the same time, we learn how low these professional friendships can be. Julie passes almost literal nerve damage, but eventually finds her release when she gets rid of her failed romantic relationships. It's pretty good, with great ambitions. Anyone who has bowed to the house movies, psychophiles or fear / thrillers a little more with metaphoric depth, should find a lot to enjoy. It's definitely not worth spending $ 30 on a DVD (this was the price my local PBS station asked for a copy of the movie after they showed it (sending and handling), but it's worth renting and it's definitely worth it watch for free.
