Yes, it is one of the great musical films I grew up with such big entertainers as Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, not to mention the petit and famous voices of Kathryn Grayson. Music and dance are great. I realize Frank took Kelly's lessons; and Kelly is dancing with Jerry Mouse, which is quite unique for this time. Betty Garrett is playing for a Sinatra-loving speaker. He is one of Hollywood's big underrated stars. I saw it again on A&E TV, and that was on my old VCR tape. Never get tired of these old music. What happened to Hollywood?
