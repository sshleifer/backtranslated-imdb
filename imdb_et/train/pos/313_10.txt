I'm Black American and I loved this soap opera. I watched it in Telemund, Spanish, almost 5-7 years ago. The story was a real story of a black slave who is in love with a white commander who led her to leadership and honest, vivid lifestyle. <br /> <br /> Many of us could learn a lot about XICA. He took something he had and saw his opportunities. Many say he sold himself, but he tried to secure his future and the future of future children. <br /> <br /> It was such a wonderful soap opera that I thought it would be released on DVD, but it wouldn't be released. This soap opera was the best soap opera EVER. We need to have it published on DVD or broadcast again on television. It is currently playing at Azteca America, which is only available in Mexico or the US with pay cable. We need it again for Telemund.
