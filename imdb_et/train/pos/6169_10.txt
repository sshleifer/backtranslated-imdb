Rohinton Mistry's multilayered novel seemed impossible to customize the screen, but the resulting film is full of passion, emotion, humor, and sin. The story moves somewhat slowly, but there is always something on the screen to attract the audience. The movie gets exactly the exact time and place exactly. All the actors are Indians - a few, if known to the "western" audience, but they have seen joy, especially a little girl who is acting very convincingly. Don't miss the headline and plot summary - this is a movie to be seen on the big screen. We have a lot to learn from this.
