I'm really surprised that this movie didn't get a higher rating for IMDB. It's one of those movies that anyone can easily get, but for romantic comedy, "Moonstruck" is really in the classroom. This is the setting and the ethnic charm that people seem to take for granted. Just pouring makes it an almost perfect film. Few films in the 1980s were as good as "Moonstruck" and it is also funny. **** at the end *****
