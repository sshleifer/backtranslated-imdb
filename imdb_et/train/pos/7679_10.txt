I chose human trafficking for my Humanities Quarter project. After some research on the internet, I found this DVD and ordered it. I just stopped watching it and still think. All I can say is "Wow". This is such a convincing story of a 12-year-old Vietnamese girl named Holly and an American man named Patric who is trying to save her. The end leaves you breathless, and although it has failed after the end, it is very realistic. It's amazing and recommend it to anyone! You really interact with Holly and Patric, and your heart breaks for him and what happens to him. I loved it so much and now I want to know what happens next!
