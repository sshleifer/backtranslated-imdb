Last night I was ready to watch "Jane Eyre" (1983), the BBC mini-series, adapted from Charlotte Bronte's Gothic romantic novel, which is worthy of classic English literature with Timothy Dalton (my favorite James Bond), Mr. Edward Rochester and Zelah Clarke , poor orphaned 18 year old girl, Jane Eyre, Mr. Rochester legacy, Thornfield. "Jane Eyre" has been one of my most loved books because I was an 11-year-old girl and my friend gave it to me with the words "This book is amazing" and so it was and I've read it tens of times and I'm still tired. His beautiful language, refined, fragrant and surprisingly fresh, the dialogues and above all the two main characters, and the story of their impossible love have attracted many filmmakers. "Jane Eyre" has been adapted to the TV and the large screen on several occasions, 18 according to IMDb. Participants who are famous and wonderful, such as Joan Fontaine and Orson Welles, William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg, George C. Scott and Susannah York, Ciar√°n Hinds and Samantha Morton, have played a couple that have crossed society, laws, religion, hundreds of obstacles . age, background, experience and fatal mistakes that would have been hunting for years. Of all those films I've only seen in a 300-minute BBC version since 1983, followed by a novel and where Timothy Dalton, who often plays dark, whimsical characters, didn't just play Edward Rochester perfectly and class, he was Mr. Rochester - sardonic , lively, natural power, powerful, passionate, sexy and tortured captain of Thornfield. Zelah Clarke was also a convincing, sweet, gentle, intelligent and strong Jane, who is deep and full of passion, blended with clear reasoning and quiet but firm will. <br /> <br /> Added on September 17, 2007: Over the past two weeks I've seen 5 "Jane Eyre" movies and it was a great experience. Every "Jane Eyre" adaptation has something to admire even if not all of them are successful. This version is still my favorite movie Jane Eyre.
