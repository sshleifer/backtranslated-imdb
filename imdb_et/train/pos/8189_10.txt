It was a great 2-part episode, although I had never seen my parents, I never thought the doctor would be a superior, of course an extreme but not paranormal. <br /> <br /> The episode brings us the most frightening things, and how we humans, in a futuristic time, would fight and win true living evil when most contradictions say it would be impossible. <br /> <br /> Being a family movie I am surprised that they brought some things like fear and faith, especially if it is going to entertain the American audience. But who cares about what Yanks says, we rock! Doctor Who has become one of the episodes of the episode since the new series in 2005, first of all as harmless from the horrible, fun, light to dark. I hope many old fans will say one day soon: "The old doctor who has come back". <br /> <br /> Of the 10 in 10
