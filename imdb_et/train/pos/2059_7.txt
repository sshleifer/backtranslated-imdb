What a fun b-movie! Shepis is absolutely beautiful and the scarecrow is clear and original. He brought me back to the 80s monsters. The budget is obviously low and not everything is behind Pacino behind the lens, but it doesn't matter because it never takes it seriously. It's really a b-movie gem from the trailer's trash to the high-flying martial arts movements. Grab some snacks, snacks and a couple of friends and let go and relax. I enjoyed this movie so much that I went out of all 3 Scarecrow movies. Of course, they are not for everyone, but for everyone. Sometimes you just have to put down the cap of thinking and smile.
