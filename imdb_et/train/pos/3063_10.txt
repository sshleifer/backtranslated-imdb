The first-time director (Bromell) has gathered a small but powerful parish to watch the middle-aged, middle-class, depressed striker and his fight against his father. This film, which is in less than 90 minutes, is an amazingly interesting contrast to human nature. David Dorfman as William H. Macy's 6-year-old son is the most refreshing little actor I've ever seen. Macy is brilliant in what seems to be almost her own torture, trying to break her father's and her business clothes. It is always good to see Donald Sutherland and here he is wonderful as Macy's father. The alternative soundtrack of the film is worth hearing about how the director explains how he chose the movie, places and film. The basic sound of the Dolby 2 channel is sufficient and well-recorded for this movie. Cinematography creates a mood with very fine music. Every movie buffer or human creator observer enjoys this especially when he is a fan of contradiction.
