This 1986 Italian-French transformation of the same name from the film of 1946 raises the heat early and prevents us from coming into the air. The story is for a high school student (Federico Pitzalis) who is unable to keep an eye on a mysteriously beautiful young woman (played by the Dutch phenomenon Maruschka Detmers) who lives next to the school. One day he follows him and his persistence pays off. There is only one problem: he has been dealing with a sketchy character (Riccardo De Torrebruna), who may not have committed a terrible crime, and if he repents, he is likely to be released on the wrist. Also, the young woman is a little funny, and this is confirmed when we discover that she has seen a boy's father who is a psychiatrist. Giulia's emotional instability is only equal to her strange sexual desires. Hot, hot, hot, direct, beautiful leaders, and Detmer's bomb result playing us like yo-yo (like his boyfriend) from scene to scene, enough to guess us. until - and even after - the end. Available in R and X (!) Rated versions.
