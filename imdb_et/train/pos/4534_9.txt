Freely designed D.W. Griffith's intolerance, three ages, was Buster Keaton's first attempt at full-length comedy. The only similarity with intolerance is the opening of the "book" scene and the fact that similar stories through the ages are being edited together into a complete movie. The reason for Keaton's acceptance of this style was that if it fails as a feature film, it can be reduced by three double reelers. Fortunately, in three ages, comedy is perfect and includes some of the funniest practices I've seen in Keaton's movies. The story is nothing unique or courageous. They are simple boy-girls, boy-losing girls, boy-girl-girls, but periods of satire are calm and set the standard for future work on Mel Brooks and all the films in this genre. But I don't think anyone has ever exalted this comedy. No one can play a lovable hand like Keaton and the tricks of this movie are some of his best. In addition, Wallace Beery, as Keaton's rival, adds a complaint to this film. Anyone who thinks that the 1920s comedy can't be judged by today's audience has to watch this movie.
