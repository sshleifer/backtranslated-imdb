I watched this movie years ago and I have never been looking for it, although I find it very raw that it is very educative, what I will feel in the future, and I enjoyed it very much nowadays for all those who disagree, but the movie must always be evaluated by everyone and in my opinion, this is a big thank you to all the cloning and test tube babies that are going on today to decide on this movie, it can be a dramatic event that is getting there, but you go there. All of today's horrors have been pulled up to laugh, but it thinks of me and it scares me as a mother when I was desperate, after watching this movie I think twice, but I love the movie that I love the movie. Don't look at the movie - just know the story and ask yourself how far would you go with the child?
