I think this movie has a lot to suggest, especially David Morse's particularly embarrassing performance and more than a satisfactory performance that is always worthy of Mr. Foxx. Although the plot has many holes and in some cases the motivation is very difficult to follow, it usually makes a nice time in front of the pipe.
