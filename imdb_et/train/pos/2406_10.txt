this is the best example of what I think Jesus really was. most movies show that Jesus is feminine, lobotomized or tortured. this jesus laughed, played and was serious when it was needed. this is the kind of Jesus who can be attracted, not usually the Hollywood version. <br /> <br /> The film took liberties trying to "fill the voids". but the fillers did not seem impossible or even unlikely. one thing I could argue was that he never explained what the novels had about Jesus (the film depicted that the novels were the main engine of Jesus' death, not that the Jewish authorities opposed the idea). <br /> <br /> The film seemed to be well researched. one example was a teenage boy who was a "brand". it is believed that the sign (or john-sign) was the boy referred to in the Gotemane Garden, whose hidden piece was pulled out and ran naked (Mark 14:51). I feel like they were trying to make the movie as accurate (even in spirit) as possible.
