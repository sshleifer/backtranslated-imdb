Running Man is not a great movie, actually it's pretty stupid. But it offers what you want in Arnie's movie and it's an activity and entertainment. I don't see how anyone can enjoy this picture, it's so stupid and uplifting that it's almost fun. By the way, this is probably one of the most quoted Arnie movies.
