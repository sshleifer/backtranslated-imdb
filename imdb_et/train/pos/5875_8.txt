These are one of the movies that don't need brain or thinking, it's a very funny passage that you forgot the next hour. I was really surprised when John Abraham was acting when he usually played a gangster like a character with an emotional face, so playing it up to a complete reversal and playing it successfully, leading comic geniuses like Paresh Rawal and Akshaye Kumar. I was also quite surprised by Akshaye 3 girls because roles do not require a lot of talents, but mainly from Akshaye dissapearents (for other girls) because I was surprised because they managed to create and the real personality and you can distinguish them, which is a good thing, most of them the songs are good, it's colorful and fun, so dull on a Sunday night it will ease your mood.
