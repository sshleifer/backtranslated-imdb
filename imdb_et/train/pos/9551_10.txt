I have to say that I was surprised at the quality of the film. It was much better than I expected. The scenario and action is pretty good. The director also did a good job. While some scenes are a bit clumsy, it is usually a decent film. The idea was definitely brilliant and the truth did not reveal itself to the end. The atmosphere of the mental hospital was quite good. The plot was clear, consistent and well thought out. Some people find it a bit boring because because the story is very focused and they take the time to develop their character and story. The story of morality, this is a decent film for your genre and it is amazingly good.
