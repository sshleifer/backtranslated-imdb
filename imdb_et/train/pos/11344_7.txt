Pufnstuf is what it is. I saw it in a 4-year-old cinema and I have a very pleasant and lively memory of it. Looking at it as an adult, it can be that we get referrals from the target group leaders, such as where Jimmy's gray witch's wig is ripped and Witch Hazel (Cass) sneers "I KNEW had brown roots!" This is, of course, heavily influenced by the time of the floral culture and in some ways quite progressive. For example, the "Different" trail sends a clear message to the young viewers about being themselves, working with the package, and what is different about yourself. It may be an anthem for the gay community, it should be a great trail. <br /> <br /> Martha Raye, Cass Elliot and Billie Hayes are all big witches and Living Island cast gives her everything limited to their characteristic suits (including Billy Barty, Felix Bridge and other famous names). There's a lot more in this movie - there's really nothing to do with it, and if little Jack Wild has to live up to his concerns about the inhabitants of a living island, it's really little to scream. It is a drama and comedy that is distributed by simulation. Although I think - I never stood for flute. <br /> <br /> I love the soundtrack, especially the above mentioned Various, but also the If I Could on Zap The World, Pufnstuf and even Jack Wild. What's more, it is now on a CD that is loved by El Records in London. See more here: www.cherryred.co.uk/el/artists/pufnstuf.htm
