My peoples thing is a wonderful movie about relationships - first and foremost an adult son and his father, but also this son with his wife, sister and mother. Paul Reiser has written a semi-autobiographical film about his relationship with his father. The film is funny, terrible and thoughtful. This made me reassess my relationship with both the now dead father and my adult son. Peter Falk is great for Paul's father - his role could not be better poured. I hope that both Mr Falk and Mr Reiser will be recognized for their efforts in the next year's film awards - Falk for their actions and Reiser for their script.
