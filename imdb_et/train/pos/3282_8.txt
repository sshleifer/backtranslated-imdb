I didn't know what the movie was, out of the video store, and after that I saw it. Few seen by several genres flick director Bernard Rose (Candyman, Immortal Beloved). Great story and characters. As a fan of Glenne Healdy, I was surprised by her British accent. The only exception to this movie was the end. However, it is worth renting.
