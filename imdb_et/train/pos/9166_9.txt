If the more masterful adjustments even existed, you don't have to look for it; In the almost perfect presentation of the Charlotte Brontë masterpiece you will find more. <br /> <br /> I've rarely seen a movie that would invite me to read the novel on which it is based, but I confess it here. Although I have not read Jane Eyre, I am convinced that I have little to do with dialogue and plot or intensity and emotion. I just want to explore the novel because of the huge curiosity and emotion that this masterpiece interferes with. <br /> <br /> I don't have to give anything out here. Let me just say: if you are not sure if you should watch or read the beautiful story of Jane Eyre, please do not hesitate to ask! This movie has successfully captured every atom of power and magic that has brought Jane Eyre into the popular classics of English literature. <br /> <br /> What Brontë himself did not bring, Clarke and Dalton were able to translate into enormous intensity in ramp lighting. The success of the film is undoubtedly due to the small parts of their ability to act. <br /> <br /> I love Jane Eyre or hate her, but I appreciate the story of wealth, vitality, truth; love symbols; love actors; everything just like you would love what's in the cinema.
