"Come on Undone" seems to have generated a lot of opinions among the participants in the forum. This is a film that promises to take a homosexual life, as most of the viewers expect, and somehow renounces that promise to the young man's soul. The film has the opportunity to stay with us even when it's over. This is a character study of how a young man engages in a love relationship with someone who is so different from what eventually ends up Mathieu being confused, sick and depressed when things don't go according to what he hoped for relationships <br /> < If you haven't seen the movie, maybe you would like to stop reading. <br /> <br /> Sebastien Lifshitz, film director, has spoken about his story about Mathieu. Most viewers are uncomfortable with different times of the movie, but there are tips that are not obvious as seen retroactively. The story is said to have setbacks that may add to how some people watch the movie. This is the story of the love that Mathieu knew for Cedric and their final division of life. <br /> <br /> First of all, Cedric, a beautiful young local, will continue with Mathieut until she can convince her to love her. Mathieu also feels Cedric's appeal. We understand how different both young men are, how Cedric tells Mathieu's family how he feels the school is not for him. On the other hand, Mathieu, who wants to be an architect, finds beauty in an abandoned place where Cedric has taken her. We look at how Mathieu, reading the book, wants Cedric's attention. <br /> <br /> When Mathieu leaves for her mother, she wisely tells her about the importance of continuing her career. He also points out what the future of both would be, which is true. Mathieu seems to have learned his lesson. She continues her life with Cedric and tries to live her life. We look at him in the hospital, talking to a psychiatrist who has treated his wounded soul. <br /> <br /> The end may be confusing for most viewers, but there is a moment in the movie when Mathieu is working at the bar where we see him washing the glasses and watching Pierre, the young man who frequent the bar. Because Mathieu is looking for Pierre in his house, it seems difficult to imagine. However, we have seen Mathieu obviously interested in Pierre. The scene on the last beach, where Pierre and Mathieu have been in the sand, is a promising sign that things are better between them when they look at a little boy, probably disappeared, but then close to his father. <Br>> <br /> Jeremie Elkaim makes Mathieu one of the most complicated characters in recent films. This is a young man who is difficult to understand on a simple level. Mathieu has suffered a lot, first by separating his parents, then by his depressed mother and by losing Cedric. Stephan Rideau, who has been seen in other important French films, is equally good as low Cedric. <br /> <br /> While "Come Undone" shares opinions, the film's sophistication and care are worthy of Sebastien Lifshitz.
