This music is decisively blended and none of these elements fit together, but it is mostly enjoyable. The plot has some elements of Wodehouse's novel, but none of its virtues, although he wrote the script together. Songs, though charming, are in no way related to this film and are unusually cracked on the plot even before Oklahoma's pre-standards. Burns and Allen do their usual shticki quite competently, but with about 40 IQ points they will be inadequate for the rest of the film. Reginald Gardiner does a good job when he remembers that it is talkative and ends with a silent actor. And there are some writings that could only have been written by Wodehouse, although most of the film looks like one of Hollywood's meetings, which he later parallel.
