OK, so for 10 2 1/2-star films you ask? ... see it and maybe it makes more sense .. Hitchcock never mixed the scenes better .... The film shoots the scenes from the very beginning, and yet you don't get the scattered feeling you sometimes send when the movie runs through many of the signs he is trying to develop. You feel the characters show you something unusual, and then they won't disappoint you when they do. Script / Producer Phil Hay's surreal story about life, blended with an absolutely excellent soundtrack, makes you think more than a 6-degree separation as the movie's title ... I'm looking for more good things from this manufacturer for the future.
