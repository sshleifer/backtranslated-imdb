The film is more Pony than Gray Owl. This also applies to Aborigines, Canadian, English, Gray Owl and North Bay Nugget. Great story. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie, rather a book that raises interesting questions about cultural identity and values. The main scene is Gray Owl, who admits his holy pony and his reaction. <br /> <br /> Some observations about user ratings. Note that user ratings are biopolar clusters at 5 and 7; it is not for everyone, but it is strong. This film has been underestimated and overlooked, but has been observed for years. Few women have also watched the film, but they appreciate it more than men. Was it marketed properly? <br /> <br />
