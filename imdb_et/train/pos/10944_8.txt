Sarah Silverman's program is ... better than the others. No laughs, no fun jokes, but a program. Sarah Silverman's program. If you're like me, and you love comedy, it's probably for you. A mixture of different styles that makes your own. <br /> <br /> This program is not something you want to compare to war, seeing how it has nothing to do with it (other exhibitions). This exhibition is its essence, and I think most of the comedy heads like it just fine. <br /> <br /> Go look and see.
