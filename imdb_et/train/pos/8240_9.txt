I was also at the premiere in Toronto. This movie was a kind of comfort when I thought I couldn't see my first choice. Well, I was completely out. By the time I got to the theater, I couldn't remember a little other than the movie's main piece (yes, I forgot who it was.) All the terrible performances of the production. Carrie-Anne Moss was a real departure from her days as the Trinity. As for Billy Connolly, I think that because Chaplin has an actor who played so brilliantly, with no line of things. The children were also big. Be sure to check it out when you get the opportunity. <br /> <br /> And by the way, I saw my first choice - and that was better.
