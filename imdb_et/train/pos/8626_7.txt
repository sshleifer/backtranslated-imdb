"Der Todesking" is not just a movie that makes you happy? Jörg Buttgereit's second cult memorial, which is actually much better than the infamous "Nekromantik", has seven short episodes? one for every day of the week? suicide of independent people. Between these already very disturbing episodes, Buttgereit adds really terrifying images of a strongly decaying male body. Episodes are not all equally powerful, but as a whole, Der Todesking is quite high on the list of the most frustrating feature films of all time. Especially on Wednesday episodes concerning a man who explains his sexual disappointment to strangers in the park and on Sunday, focusing on a younger man who suffers himself, is extremely intense and destructive. The added value of this movie or any other similar surprise is debatable, and I'm not even sure if Buttgereit had any type of message here. There is a vague reference to the letter of the failed chain, which encourages its readers to commit suicide, but most often we do not know the motivation of these people to end their lives so dramatically. Unlike I thought "Der Todesking" is neither exploitative nor reluctantly graphic! On the contrary, I would never have hoped that Buttgere would be so subtle and thoughtful about the portrayal of human misery. The Thursday episode is a perfect example of this, as it shows the different views of a stylishly known German bridge, while the names, ages, and occupations of jumped people appear on the screen. Production values ​​are inevitably poor, and editing is often lacking in professionalism, but this is not the type of movie. The subject is strong and forces us to think less joyful? but also imperative? areas of life. Also great use of tragic music!
