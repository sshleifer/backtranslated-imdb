I don't see how this show is like OC. OC first spin around teenagers and parents trying to survive. North Shore is about hotel staff who are trying to manage the hotel and social life at the same time. Second, OC is in California. North Shore is in Hawaii. <br /> <br /> And why should Fox show like one of his other examples on the same network? I think this is a big show with good participants mostly. It has a good story and a plot. I like events and how people care and work for them. The last episode was surprising how the story worked out. It was not predictable like most of the stories in most of the stories. I hope Fox keeps it in the air.
