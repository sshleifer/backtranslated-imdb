<br /> <br /> What can I say? This is one of the most perfect movies. It's a setback for the silver, ridiculous romantic comedies of the 1940s, but with a modern touch. The scenario breaks with spirit, charm, humor and tenderness, cinematography is breathtaking (NYC never seemed so beautiful) and of course cast! Dudley Moore turns his career as a Loveable, drunk Arthur Bach. He is also a poor and real ... one of the best features of the film is his poignant "Not everyone who drink is a poet ... some of us drink because we are not poets." The great Sir John Gielgud won a lot of earned Oscars with an excellent performance, such as Hobson, Arthur's lie and caregiver. Although he thought it was "taking money and leading a role", he brings character to all talents, experiences and courage. expert tragidian and clever comedian. This world, from Geraldine Fitzgerald's bitter grandmother Bach to Stephen Elliott's bombastic mafioso, is also a supportive cast. <br /> <br /> The result is also very memorable and praises the movie perfectly. The only real problem with the film is the sick result he created.
