Not so many people like Bertrand's blier movies just because they don't understand them. Just because they are different types of people. <br /> <br /> If you have not lived in a deep despair that is intertwined with great personal hope, you may find it difficult to enjoy the humor shown here. <br /> <br /> And the Blin movie can not be easily categorized as black comedy or cult, such as cellulose fiction, etc. Because there is a delicacy that North American audiences often do not know. <br /> <br /> When I looked at these two hooligan meals with Jeanne Moreau at the seafood restaurant, I felt they were more delicate than any gentleman. <br /> <br /> The desire to love wildly is a normal reaction that we feel under the unnecessary pressure that a career symbolizes suddenly in Carrefour. <br /> <br /> SO, les valseuses is a much better name than it goes. To dance, you need to be elegant but go to places you don't.
