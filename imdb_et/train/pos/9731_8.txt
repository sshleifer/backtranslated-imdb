Sidney Young (Pegg) moves from England to New York to work on a popular magazine, Sharpe, to live a lifestyle of his dreams, but tries to make a lasting impression. <br /> <br /> Based on Toby Young's book on survival in American business, this comedy drama received different opinions from critics. To lose friends seemed insecurely funny, but the charm of the actors seemed to be losing their friends from the fish farm pond, but that is not the case. <br /> <br /> Image works because of its participants and a simple but sharp story. We start in the past, at this time, and are working our way to see how Young made his mark in an American magazine. <br /> <br /> Pegg (Hot Fuzz) is too pleasant for words. Whether it captures zombies with a cricket or demonstrates the essence of its sidekick law, the English actor brings charm and light to each scene. Here, when scripting is good, but far from its own standards, it brings a lot of energy to the picture and is worth it alone. His funny "Babe 3" is unforgivable, just breathtaking things, as well as his exuberant dancing, but he pulls it out great. <br /> <br /> Bridges and Anderson are doing well with stereotypical journalists, where Dunst fits nicely in the confused love of love. Megan Fox, who has stolen the transformers, reminds everyone that he will be able to act here with a funny hyperbole of a stereotype movie star. The fact that his character Sophie Myles is starring at Teresa's mother's picture is just as ridiculous as her character in the pool. To emphasize the point, a dog and Pegg rounds this with a real British style comedy with a very small twist. <br /> <br /> Although the British film is an adaptation of the American way of life to a young man when he tries to fit in and we see a different approach. Young wants the right-handed dirty to contrast with American professionalism. The inclusion of today's tabloid characters will soon change this film, but the concept of using movie stars gives it an edge. <br /> <br /> Weide's first picture is not perfect. Concentration is out of date, because the plot becomes too soap with an uncomfortable twist and too many signs are needed. Physical comedy can also be superfluous. As a side note, the DVD has some of the best that you will ever see, which is almost half an hour long. <br /> <br /> This comedy drama is another approach to Simon Pegg's shiny form and collective approach and sharp comedy, worth watching.
