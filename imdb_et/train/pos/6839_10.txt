What must be one of the most haunting films, the transvestite kills people in New York and the answer to everyone may not be what people suspect. You can see how Brian DePalma takes some of Hitchcock's influence on the corners and things of the camera. Michael Caine plays the most thoughtful character, while Angie Dickinson is basically a boring rich woman with a bad hair. Keith Gordon (who later played "Christine") is probably the most interesting character of the movie. But you can't really understand this movie unless you see it. And after you see it, you may never know who you trust. Nancy Allen and Dennis Franz also play.
