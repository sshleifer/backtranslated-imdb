I loved this example of first aeration, and I've always been waiting for every episode to watch every week. The plot, characters, writing, special influences were unfulfilled! Then the sci-fi channel spun again and canceled a very fun and well-written exhibition. I say back, I know that all the participants will come back. I recommend buying DVDs, I have. I hope that the leaders of sci-fi channels will get the word from these comments and understand that they have to deal with their viewers more. I'm currently looking at only one channel on this channel, (Ghost Hunters), but I'm pretty sure they'll cancel it soon.
