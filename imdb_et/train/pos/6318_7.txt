I was trying to rent it on several occasions, but I was always with a girlfriend who, as a rule, usually rejects comedies and ensembles with commentary "Uhm ... looks good, but I'm not in the mood for this movie." So "Almighty Solo Movie Enters Night! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I found a welcome movie to Welcome To Collinwood. Although ultimately forgotten, they have fun moments and some laugh out loud. I didn't feel it was a remake, and generally watch movies that try to ignore that fact and look at them on their own. George Clooney puts a humorous and short place on a cracked cracking wheel, which mostly cast doubt on two things ... 1. Wouldn't every comedy be better than Mr. Clooney putting on a strange 5-minute coming? and 2. How do they make fake tattoos that look old and faded and how easy they are to wash? Cast, all great actors on their own, did a great job, and you get the impression that they had a good time working together, which is quite important in such a movie. Needless to say, everyone in this movie does not go as planned or humorously as planned, but it made me look at the peculiarities and consider looking at the original, so I find it successful! Rent it in time, maybe grab some friends and pizza. You have a good time. <br /> <br /> *** 7/10 *** <br /> <br /> With a lateral note, the soundtrack is remarkable. It is nice to hear what far-fetched Paolo Conte used, and it left me tricks long after the credit.
