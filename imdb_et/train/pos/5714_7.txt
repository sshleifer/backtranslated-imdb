I was so excited to see this movie because I always heard it was very scary. <br /> <br /> What's interesting about this is the Japanese movie they decided to bring to America, but they actually filmed it in Japan with their original team! I think it made the movie ... more Japanese (this is probably why it managed to be quite successful, unlike most Japanese-American horror movies), but it also made the American audience a bit inaccessible. The difference between intimidating Japanese culture and intimidating American culture seemed all over the film. It worked well in moments when they had to struggle with the nervous fear of the protagonist: a scared fish with a big, busy, stranger in the Tokyo Pond. <br /> <br /> It was also confusing. In a typical Japanese way, it is very complicated and confusing. The beginning of the movie is actually a story in the middle, and we are constantly moving back and forth until we see the end and the beginning of the whole story at the end of the movie. This constant turn of time was very confusing for me. Also, I didn't think some things were so well explained and I had to ask my friend to explain them to me (he had already seen it, and a sequel that probably shows more story). <br /> In general, the American audience has a lot of love, tons of amazing shapes and macabre details that represent a whole splash of jumps.
