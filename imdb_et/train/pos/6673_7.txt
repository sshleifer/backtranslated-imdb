Many of the user comments I saw on IMDB about this movie aren't really fair. First, let me say that this movie is not taken seriously. It should be a fun, but stupid movie that does not require thinking but to enjoy it. If you watch this movie with a view to seeing masterpieces in filmmaking or humor, then you are very disappointed. But if you just want to watch some nice movies with some talented actors and actors, you enjoy it.
