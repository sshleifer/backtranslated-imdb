After playing an excellent animated intro, it started slowly as the director had a number of symbols and school environments. When the bet is turned on, the speed of the movie is taken because it is a race with time to see if a certain number of worms can be eaten at 19:00. We had a good opportunity to go home to discuss some things with our son: bullying, helping others, mood, if you don't want to do anything. <br /> <br /> The girl who played Erica (Erk): Hallie Kate Eisenberg is especially noteworthy. The director strikes him unexpectedly and when he is on the screen he is enchanting. He's one of those "Hey, he looks familiar", and then I remembered he was a little girl to whom Pepsi was about 8 years ago. He was also "Paulie", the parrot of the movie, trying to find his way home. <br /> <br /> ms. Eisenberg did many of the "9900" TV and movie shows, but it wasn't seen in the coming years. She is now 14 years old and grows up into a beautiful woman. His smile heats the screen. If he can get more good roles, he may have the same good career (or better?) As Haley Joel Osment, another three named kid actresses, but hopefully with some problems that Osment has recently had. Anywhozitz, according to my 8-a-son, who just finished reading the story, it seemed that the movie did not follow the book well, but was still fun. At the end of the movie, there seemed to be a big order for some of the after-effects (How to cook a cooked hunger? Escargot Kid's Style?), Which may not be so bad. It was nice to take the family to the movie and not have to worry about language, violence or sexual scenes. <br /> <br /> Another good aspect of the movie was respect / fear caused by Prime Minister Burdock (Boilerplate). Today, films tend to show adult power figures in the form of buffalo. Although he has one particular funny scene, he dominated the school with a firm hand. It was also nice to see Andrea Martin got a job.
