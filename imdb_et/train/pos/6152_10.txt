Fabulous, fantastic, probably Disney's best musical adventure. I've loved this movie for over 35 years because it's so imaginative, smart and fun. Even in spite of the foolish "flying" scene, other scenes and dialogues are magical and funny. Would they have chosen someone better than Angela Lansbury to play Eglantine? I can't think of anyone who would better fit this role. The reopening of this classic would be just as stupid as the reprocessing of Mary Poppins. <br /> <br /> David Tomlinson, though he had few high-quality film roles, is absolutely in this adventure. He was a comic genius who is often forgotten today. Blustering, prim and the right Englishman - nobody could really hit and pull it as hard as he did. It would be tragic to do this film because Tomlinson is dead for a couple of years and no one could step into their shoes and make their character fair. <br /> <br /> Dancing nightgowns and armor are the magical aura of other witch movies that would not just stick. I especially enjoy those parts where the Germans are attacking the Eglantine house, and he must protect it in every way. <br /> <br /> Hitting the beautiful green sea. Richard and Robert Sherman gave up musical numbers. All these are fantastic and worth remembering, Portobello Road is one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> A great movie that still exists today!
