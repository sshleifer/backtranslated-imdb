Have you heard the story of the reluctant heroes the king hired to kill the dragon? Oh, you got? Was it set in a world that consisted entirely of small islands floating above the clouds, and did the heroes have to make dangerous jumps from one island to another during their journey? Was the water flowing and the remains of the big cities on the horizon? I didn't think so. <br /> <br /> I stumbled upon this film at random and I'm really glad I did! It's one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. Like Pixar movies, this is an animated art computer that could only be available in today's world. Animators have invested in thinking about everything that is displayed on the screen, and this attention to detail is amazing (a scene where mushrooms are in the green smoke while the characters are unforgettable in the background). Monsters are also fully realized and wonderful to look at. <br /> <br /> Although the plot may not be completely unique, the film has enough charm to make sure you look. Our protagonists are pleasant and interesting, making it almost impossible for the audience to reach the end of the world and destroy the dragon that would otherwise eat everything out of its way. Of course, Hector is the character most fall in love with. A little blue creature with a crazy grin and a tendency to talk about a useless and English mix, Hector offers a comedy relief like Jar Jar Binks only dreams. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I would recommend looking at dragon hunters if you have the opportunity. Take a look at this incredible animation, scenes of a breath-taking battle, and glimpse into a world that is different from what you've seen on a cinema or TV screen. At least, it's a fun way to spend an hour and a half - regardless of whether you are nine or twenty-nine (which really is)!
