This movie is one of my all-time favorites. Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen, and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Not to mention Sam Jaffe as Gunga Dinist. Drama, action, adventure and comedy all rolled together. The final battle scene, which is still today, gives me chills and always ends up tearing me. If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it.
