Bizarre, trippy, forgotten-story-and-full-steam-pre-low budget sci-fi about Williams family living in California desert. They are witnessing a number of events that increase at their strange level; they are probably caught in a time-space thread where the past, the present and the future collide. <br /> <br /> This is an excuse for a very fun special effects parade - constant light and sound, dinosaur creatures that are one with each other, friendly and small little EN enchanting the granddaughter and so on. This image shows a little imagination if nothing else. <br /> <br /> Very good music from Richard Band, including special effects from similar works by David Allen, Randall William Cook and Peter Khan, and more importantly, a pleasant family is the main asset. This creates a feeling of amazement for children; it may be very good that it is a child (or many of us) who is able to illuminate any errors of narrative or presentation. <br /> <br /> I found it hard to resist; it is a short and sweet (80 minutes) deviation and decent credit for Director John "Bud" Cardos ("Spiders Kingdom of Fiders") and CEO of Charles Band. <br /> <br /> 7/10
