It starts with a bet between Edgar Allen Poe and the journalist ... The store bets the man can't spend the night in a horrible castle. Well, of course he will, but will he come out? It's hard to say to all those strange people who shouldn't be there, including the icy Barbara Steele. This is a rather strange film because the presentation is in French as well as English and switches back and forth a few times. Maybe this is because the bits of the dialogue were gone? It is also quite dark and claustrophobic, being that a person does not see much beyond the small circle of light that candles and such are creating, plus there is fear and threatening death. This version (in Synapse) is also uncensored and I thought that what can be censored in the 1964 movie until I saw the topless scene, I think it may be. In general, it's pretty good and gloomy black and white. Barbara Steele is sure to make a movie. 8 out of 10.
