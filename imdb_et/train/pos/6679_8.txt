I am just one excuse for this film: there are many, far, far-reaching close-ups, and if they irritate you for long-lastingness, it's fair enough. They drove ME in the first ten minutes. But after that, I made a truce with terrifying cinematography; and long before the end of the movie, I was missing out on care. This is too big a comedy to be destroyed so easily. It's fun, it's witty, ALL cast comic supplies are flawless, but many of Usher's characters interact through the cold fish-eye glass - he may not care for them - he'll be able to heat them. "Mystery Men" is actually not only funny, not only smarter, but also deeper than anyone seems to have given this credit. Jokes in Austin Power's movies, as well as less fun than jokes, are also many toothpicks. The "Mystery Men" satire bites when there is something worth biting and gently, if not. It doesn't just look at any older thing. That's why, contrary to what some (I think they are unnoticed) critics have never run out of ideas. <br /> <br /> The super heroes are an attractive bunch. Of course, they are secondary, but they are not just another rate. For example, Blue Rajah does nothing but throws the cutlery on people, and she's not good for her. On the other hand, neither is malicious. He is better than most people in his limited field, and he is practicing carefully. He's not a bottle that makes him much more fun than he would. When Superman is in Christ, the Mystery Men are all the small demigods at the foot of Mount Olympus, at their neck. A lot of funny; also much more love.
