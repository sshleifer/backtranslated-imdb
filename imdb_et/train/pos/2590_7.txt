People who are bad about this movie are the ones who don't understand the movie. These are people who love filmmakers and are unfavorable to films that are not Leonardo DiCaprio's star. Wilder Napalm is a clean little film that may seem peculiar and maybe even silly, but what it lacked is more than just a matter of substance. <br /> <br /> One thing about the film I had was the impressive use of music that plays a big part. These film music students note the importance of music in the life and background of both Vida and Wilder. The theme of Wilder, the theme of Vida and Wallace's theme is to hear the opening queue, and it's funny how some lyrics are playing. For example, in a scene where men sing "Duke of Earl", Vida Wilder, when men sing something like "She is my girl", and then she goes to Wallace to give her something when the men sing lyrical "She's mine girl "showing tension between both brothers. There are so many small complexities inside the movie, and while it may seem like a flop outside, the movie's real student will notice how good this film is.
