"The Groove Tube" was one of two Ken Shapiro films, the other was "modern problems". It's just a TV parody. In addition to Shapiro, who apparently did nothing after "modern problems", the film also includes Richard Belzer, the cousin of Chevy Chase and Henry Winkler. Three cast members (plus some other people in smaller roles) appear in different skits. One of the funniest is Chase with a Geritol scam, where he describes the drug as his wife's strips and ends with humping. There is also an epic story of a pornographic news program, an irritating cooking show and some drug dealers. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the whole thing is just a real boost. In my opinion, these are the three best television junkies, "Tunnelvision" and "Kentucky Fried Movie" (although I could also include "The Truman Show"). Really funny. <br /> <br /> I don't know what Ken Shapiro ever did.
