Ghost Story is a terrible horror story. It dates back to the early 1970s and the series of fear. The beginning and end of each story is spoken by Sebastian Cabot. Remember him from the early 1960s, a family family? This particular story is Barbara Parkins and David Birney as the main actors and main characters of the story. I saw it recently, and I was so scared! is terrible, no gore or curse words, but very scary. Barbara Parkins played a young bride. David Birney played with his wife. Both participants were very good in their parts. If you like a scary, fun and terrible ghost story, you'll love this little pearl. I gave it a high rating. I highly recommend this story.
