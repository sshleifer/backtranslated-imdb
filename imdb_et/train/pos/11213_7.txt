This second film is as interesting as the previous one except that there is no relationship. We know what he is going to do and what will happen before he even hints on the screen. Then the joy comes only from how the different tricks happen and their succession. We know that there is a dynamite in the car, that it loses the wheel, that the car is crashing, just talking about the car. And that happens. Now there are details and details to help you discover them in the movie. It is clear that he can feed some foolish women, and it must come, but we know that he has already seen him and that he knows he is trapped. How can he get out of it? You need to discover it yourself. And don't worry that he will become the main human trafficker, but how is the other story. The speedboat is not suited to our powerful beaver river. We also know when he gets wounded. They didn't know which bulletproof jackets were these days. It is true that it has recently been discovered that some geographical indications did not have such equipment in Iraq. But what is the meaning of such a movie? This is the requirement to trade with traffickers and the darkness that doesn't see it as a problem that creates a problem. But the film is a constant and perfect example of the lack of any value that can forever be in this moral crusade against the forces of evil. Why not just legalize these goods so that they can be properly monitored and monitored? If something is not illegal or is not rejected, it is less fun to use. It is forbidden or limited, which is attractive. <br /> <br /> Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine, University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University of Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
