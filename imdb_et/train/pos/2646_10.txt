I think most people don't see the right idea for the movie, at least that's my opinion. I'm not sure this is a drug abuse film; rather, this film is about the minds of these genius brothers, drugs are side effects, something marginal. Again, this is not a commercial movie you see every day and if the author wants it, it certainly failed because most people think it is one of many drug-related films. However, I think there is something else. As in many films depicting different cultures, the audience usually understands films that represent their culture, i.e. something they have grown up with and who they are familiar with. This movie shows what these "genius" people often think and what problems they face. The reason they behave like this is because they are bored of their senses. They have to meet people who do mediocre things and accept things as if they were on a daily flight. They start a fairly hard job and look like time. They feel like I went to work, did nothing, I still made twice as good as men around me when they were all my project, what I should do now with my spare time. And even more boring? If you can predict the behavior of yourself not because you are a psychologist, but because you have seen this pattern in the past. So for them, on one side, it is a difficult job that is sometimes quite boring, and on the other hand they start thinking about people's behavior. This is a great big boredom recipe. And the most unpleasant things are usually done to get out of this country. They had previously said that their biggest problem is that they try to find out life by logic (mathematics describes logic), while life is not really a logical thing, it is actually quite right.
