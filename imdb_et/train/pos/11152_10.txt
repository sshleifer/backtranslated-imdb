Watching Midnight Cowboy is like making a master class / managing / cinematography / editing / writing. I was too young to be released at first, and I saw it for the first time a few years ago, but it has been an absolute test of time and I've been watching it several times. <br /> <br /> All this movie is brilliant, from the amazing performances of Voight and Hoffman (although I know this movie well, I still find myself well when Voight flashes innocently painfully, or Hoffman coughs his sick and malicious tea) between stunning cinematography and superbly edited dreams. <br /> <br /> It is a shame that more of our modern filmmakers are not prepared to risk making movies that are both visually and phonetically interesting as this. A daily cowboy should be required in all film schools. <br /> <br /> 10/10
