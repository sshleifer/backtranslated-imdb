I don't have much to add to my summary, this movie is up with Gun, one of the most fun movies ever made. I don't think it should be looked at seriously if it is viewed because it is very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> I don't think it will bring Christopher Walken's reputation even if his reputation was weak. . It took Pulp Fiction to wake him from the dream he had turned on. For Michael Ironside, he's been a little funny, but he didn't try to be serious. Total recall, Top Gun. I think it's the amazing budget that this movie was. Scenes and actors, explosions, etc. are quite amazing, so apparently someone liked him a lot and was willing to risk a lot of money. Whoever I like, because I love this movie! <br /> <br /> If anyone reads this information about McBain (and I doubt there is too much), just know that it's a fun movie and you have to look at it with a smile!
