This is the first of the 10 out of 10 I have given. What made this movie so good for me? Permanent activity - there is no slow part, great action, smart writing. I also liked the style of filming where shaking and different angles seemed like a scene. Finally, I see an action film that does not try to satisfy all sectors of the people (ie there is no forced romance). <br /> <br /> I liked the first two Bourne movies, but I loved it. <br /> <br /> Warning - after watching this movie you are full of adrenaline and you can get some peace of mind before driving!
