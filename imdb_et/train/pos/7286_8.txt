I watched this picture look and was surprised by its erudite features. First of all, the film is undoubtedly made cheap from its carton, limited settings and creative scientific raw materials. The action extends from the very poor (the two strippers), the barely professional (the leader of Herb Evers), the Gothic overpowerment (Leslie Daniels as assistant to Kurt) to Virginia Leith's first-rate position as a halt to the victim who lives against his will for science and his passionate passion for science. However, scripting is very good and the dialogue is fantastic for this movie. The questions are ample about the role of science and medicine in our lives and what their boundaries should be. This film is a film of thinking in many ways. However, its true intention must not be too deceptive. This is a stupid story about a man who is attached to his fitness in medical science, who wants to blend his dead girlfriend with a perfect body, thereby creating the perfect woman for the body and soul in the best way. Another very bright side of the film is the scissor music that resonates strongly every time the doctor beautifies the city.
