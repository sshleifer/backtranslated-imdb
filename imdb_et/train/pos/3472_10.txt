Very light spoiler <br /> <br /> This film (even though it's only on TV) is absolutely great. I didn't pay attention to differences in appearance or accent, so I can't really comment on it. It was so good that I had to shut myself and say, "Remember, it's just a movie, it's DIDN's really happy." When I sat down and listened to Harris and Quinn, I knew that what John and Paul would say would have been if they had actually done that meeting. John's remarks and burns were of his nature (especially in the restaurant!), As did his depression, while Paul was very simple and rejected. Both sides did a great job and I was happy to see this movie. It's an evil experience for any Beatles fan. And prepare some surprises!
