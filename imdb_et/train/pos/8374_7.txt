OK, this movie was cool. I don't think it was the best movie ever made, but it was definitely fun. My brother and I are still in action, and from time to time we gave the movie out of the closet, blowing dust and putting it in. Fun to the end, but a great concept. This is a movie that has to forget criticism all together and just enjoy it. The judgment is a victory for Robot Jox.
