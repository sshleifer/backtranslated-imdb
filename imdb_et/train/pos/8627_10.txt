My God! Buttgereit's masterpiece is one of the best films I've ever seen. It's closer to Peter Greenaway and Jean-Luc Godard's films, but it's really annoying, but not as tough as Necromant. All the small stories have a deep philosophical interest and directing is completely inventive, despite the lack of money (see "bridge" sketch). Highly recommended!
