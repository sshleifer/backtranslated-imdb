I had seen this movie when it appeared, and when I was 12 years old :) And I still remember the wonderful wonderful scenes how the hero / heroine flees every time he is in danger :) And the best feature of the movie was villain! I think many so-called action movies copied a lot of "escape scenes" from this movie !! And not just impressed me when I see such copying, it always increases my appreciation for this masterpiece! :) Leading actors have done great things. The slow and realistic evolution of hero and hero chemistry b / w was extremely natural and marvelous. As a child, we felt that the love they had developed was very natural :) The way they encounter and transcend all their trials and tribulations was what could even understand the value of true love, sacrifice, and caring for children. I recommend that every person see this movie whenever possible! - Vijay.
