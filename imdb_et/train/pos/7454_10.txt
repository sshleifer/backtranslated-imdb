** Warning - This post may contain a spoiler ** <br /> <br /> I had only Gamecube in September 2005 and the first two games I bought were James Bond games, a decent agent under fire and a boring Goldeneye Rogue Agent . The next game I was going to get was everything or something because my friend told me it was better than the two games I already had. I have to say he was right. <br /> <br /> I bought it as a Tenner in DHW, and when I got home I cut it into my Cube and played it for hours. It was much better than my other two games, and there was a much better and more interesting story. The graphics were some of the best I've seen (but now that the XBOX 360 has come out, Farcry Instincts Predator has some of the best graphics people know). The story was smart; The crazy man (Willem Dafoe, named Nikolai Diavolo) and the beautiful henchwoman (Heidi Klum, named Katya Nadanova), are trying to destroy the world with small nanobots that at the beginning of the game, James Bond, must destroy the train. The bad thing is that one of them is hidden in Katya's breasts. Then you must prevent your plans and save the world. <br /> <br /> The big thing about this game is that it has characters expressing characters like Cleese's pronunciation Q. There are 27 levels, some of them short and some of them pretty long and complex. <br /> <br /> Gameplay - 10/10 Graphics - 9/10 Sound - 9/10 Replay Value - 7/10 Multiplayer - 8/10 <br /> <br /> Total 90%
