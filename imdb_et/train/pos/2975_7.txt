Trey Parker and Matt Stone, creators of the South Park exhibition, will return to something completely different. They create a new sport that combines baseball and basketball. This sport is known as baseketball. It's like basketball, except that baseball rules are involved and the title is another letter. Here's how you play: these two men are trying to squeeze you out of the stroke. The words are simple. it will soon become a big success on the streets. Who would have known that two immature friends could invent such a successful sport? <br /> <br /> My opinion <br /> <br /> 'Baseketball' is a very coarse and silly junk that is full of many violent violence, but it really makes a laugh and a lot of fun. A definite recommendation for those who love slapstick and rude humor.
