As a child, I was quite a fan of the series and since then it has always been one of my most memorable cartoons that changed in the early 80s compared to the previous animated series (Heidi, Barbapapa, Il Etait's sleep Fois l "Tomorrow ..., most of which I love"). I find that other similar Japanese cartoons that are later released are not suitable for Mazinger Z because they began to repeat the same scheme forever. <br /> <br /> This thing, novelty, may be one of the best yet another good one. the idea is its ingenuity, so many extravagant monsters, strange devices and strange signs, in fact we were eager to see every new installment to find out what new generation or evil machine is waiting for us!
