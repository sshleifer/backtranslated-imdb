When the plague erupts in New Orleans, it is Richard Widmark's "Panic in the Streets" to rescue, one of Elia Kazan's one of the less marked films. His partner keeps up the pace and has a lot of wonderful touches - Widmark and Barbara Bel Geddes scenes, playing their wife and police station, show family life and working life, and middle-aged relationships that are in sharp contrast to the lives of low lives and relationships with dangerous Jack Palance, his weak yes man, Zero Mostel, Tommy Cook and Louis Charles. There are also some interesting visions - Palance has a couple of scenes with actresses that look at the knees. <br /> <br /> The actor is wonderful and the dialogue is sharp if the story is not up to the direction and the performances. It has some questionable aspects that the viewer looks at quite easily. This omission is worth a look. Kazan was a masterful director.
