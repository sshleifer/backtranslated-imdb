Gung Ho is one of those movies I never see. Michael Keaton has always been my favorite and he is completely fun in this movie. Gedde Watanabe is stepping on her step. They work great together. Although this film is a comedy, I also like how it shows Hunt (Keaton) & Kazihiro (Watanabe) who are fighting for their group leaders. They both try to keep it so calm, and then they end up fighting (which is hysterical to look at). First, they are both on the floor. Then Hunt jumps on the chair. Kazihiro jumps on the table. The wolf jumps with him on the table. Then the fight against the office wins the factory. I love the fact that after the employees have separated them, you can say that they both feel bad, allowing things to get their hands off. There is also a scene where you can see how Hunt had an impact on Kazihir. She is in her house and her boss comes from Japan and says she wants to visit the factory tomorrow: <br /> <br /> Kazihiro: Tomorrow is not a good day. Sakamoto: Why not? Kazihiro: The factory is locked and we can't find the key. <br /> <br /> Tell me you can't say something like Michael Keaton! <br /> <br /> I think this movie really likes it because it is really funny and also shows how radically different people can not only learn from each other, but also become good friends.
