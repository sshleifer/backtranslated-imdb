This movie doesn't fit well with some, but it's a black view. I am glad that someone finally came up with a discussion on how African-American couples worked to make a name in communities and how many of them felt they were trying to stay there when "other" African Americans moved. <br /> <br /> (Small spoilers) <br /> <br /> This little Showtime movie is almost like Spike Lee ... you have an African-American man (Danny Glover) who worked his way through the HARD traditionally white professions. 1970s. Like any American, he moved his family up to his mobile, but forgot he still had a lot of problems. The only African Americans in the neighborhood were the servants. One has a home? Wow. <br /> <br /> Then the mixing started. His wife (Whoopi Goldberg) is said to "participate" so he does what all the other neighboring women do. And just when a man thinks he and his family are "in", another Afro-American comes in, who got in because they won the "lotto" (Mo'nique) and his eyes and he doesn't want them because he does not want the neighborhood to think they are the same. He is, of course, a better caliber, his new neighbor is a "ghetto" and shouldn't be there! Who has the problem now? <br /> <br /> This movie shows what great pains a family needs and how they lose in the process. It puts you in doubt where racism begins and ends ... and with whom. This shows how you can turn off the real world and help the people around you, no matter what color you are and how much money you have. It also shows how the African-American children, when they "mix" with the neighborhoods, belong to make them fit into culture (with blond hair and blue eyes, remember!). They laugh with jokes, not knowing they're joking and don't know ... but generally this movie is "about people." No matter what race you are, this movie will get how frightening you can be to your neighbor and against each other ... all to install ... because you feel you have more money than others so it automatically makes you Better - and you forget your own and the battles behind you. <br /> <br /> Never for everyone. But look and meet for yourself. <br /> <br />
