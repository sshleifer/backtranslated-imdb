One of the last great 60's musicals. I was 7 years old when I first saw this movie, and it has always been a favorite since then. The musical number is all memorable. In the 1960s, people who were cast in musicals were actually a musical talent (as opposed to the CERTAIN Academy Award, which is currently nominated in a major city center city). All the main roles were beautifully cast ... Ron Moody shines like Fagin, just like Shani Wallis like Nancy. Oliver Reed was threatening Bill Sikes (who luckily doesn't have musical numbers, lol) and Mark Lester Oliver and Jack Wild, like Dodger, were great. Mark Lester comes over innocent, which Dickens was about to write when writing a book! Then of course there are dozens of dancers who perform "think of myself", "I'd like to do something" "who buy" and "be back soon", many who were kids! This is a great show for the whole family.
