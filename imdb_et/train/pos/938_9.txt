Although George C. Scott is the only participant in this version of the ACC without British accent, he does more than Ebenezer's Scrooge's overall and greater interpretation of life. <br /> <br It is especially effective when he meets Bob Cratchit in his office at the end of the movie. When Scott stands in front of a large window, the sunlight shines on his glowing coat; everything you see is his silhouette. Scott's voice increased the meaningless exhaustion, the effect is galvanizing ... like Marlon Brando's first scene in APOCALYPSE NOW. "Fear," indeed! <br /> <br /> But as they say, what works for you can also work for you. Since Scott shows such a poor rage during the film, it is infectious. In other words, "before" Scrooget is almost as charismatic as "after", although it shouldn't be. This is what you might call the "Doctor Smith" effect because Jonathan Harris used a very similar approach to playing this role and many other difficulties (both stage and screen). <br /> <br /> In fact, I don't do it myself, consider Scott to be responsible. But other "Christmas Choruses" purists could. Watch the movie and meet for yourself.
