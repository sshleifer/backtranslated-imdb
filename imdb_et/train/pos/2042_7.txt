ATTENTION: ***** Unmissable **** Very good *** Okay ** You can go out instead of eating * Avoid all costs <br /> <br /> The Kate (Franka Potente) Career Path to London Underground to reach the train to meet George Clooney. But after a busy day, she stumbled and woke up to find her alone on an abandoned platform. When he runs out of a situation that leads him from one terrifying meeting to the next, he learns a lot worse and the evil who is waiting for him there. <br /> <br /> The film industry is really alone on its own, especially in the horror thriller, where movies like Creep and success are coming 28 days later (with some strong echo). Creep makes a clever insular and intense fear (especially in the beginning). It is a smart work time (though I inadvertently suspect) to honor some of these 70's pioneer high-profile horror films based on shocks and fear, without actually dealing too much with the development of character and consequently some weaknesses are somewhat predictable, but they really fail to make it more frightening or more effective in some way. I'm not sure if the end was meant to come out of some sort of moral game, and it's not exactly perfect, but it is definitely very effective and serves its main function very well. ***
