Surprisingly, it is not terrible and well animated to throw one Disney straight into the video. Like the previous sequel (Lion King 2), I was delighted that Disney brought most of the original vocal artists back, making it a great difference and maintaining a good level of traditional animation. The plot is going around for a while, but we are confused by the endless lines of fun that go from fun to eternity. Separating the segregated plot and jokes, they gave us some foolish musical sequences that resemble jokes, ranging from entertainment to a quick trip to the fridge. Most of the time, MST3K-like moments are strange and full of untapped potential and really do not add much to the movie than to act as a one-hour kickback. The new characters are at least pleasant and old characters don't do that, so I can't blame them there. Generally, this movie is not bad and it makes a nice frivolous filler between the more serious Lion King titles.
