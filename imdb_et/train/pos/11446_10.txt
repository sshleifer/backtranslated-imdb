Right now I'm watching this movie for the second time (on television) and the second time I ran into it for an hour (I think I saw it for another 2 minutes) This movie is really impressive how Goldsworthy looks at nature, changes nature What you wouldn't think of is really amazing. This whole film gives you a warm feeling by seeing him in such love with the world around him. Or I can only see my hand, covered with dirt and broken nails, it just touches you.
