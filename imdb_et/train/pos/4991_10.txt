It's a shame that this movie is so hard to get in the US. I found it through a rare video dealer and it was definitely worth it. This is undoubtedly the best code made during pre-codes and the best film of the 1930s. The masterly director Frank Borzage made great films about depression and created a fairy-tale era with MAN LASKEG. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young and Spencer Tracy have great chemistry between them and help make this movie a wonderful romance. Youngi Trina is sweet and hopeful while Tracy's Bill is terrible and closed. Character dynamics creates one of the most difficult, but ultimately, pay-for-pay ratios. <br /> <br /> MAN'S CASTLE is the softest-looking pre-code movie I've seen. Borzage uses a blurry and dreamy technique to turn the squat village where Bill and Trina live in the palace. The difficulties of depression have never been ignored, in fact they are an integral part of the film. But because Borzage deals with the film as a soft focus fairy tale, love makes the characters less tough between them. This makes the film warm and affectionate. <br /> <br /> MAN'S CASTLE is a pre-coding timeout. If only more people would see it.
