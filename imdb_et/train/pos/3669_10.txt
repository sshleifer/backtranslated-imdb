This film strikes the absurd nature of an overwhelming American patriotic actor who believes that his work (and politics) is as important to the American people as the president's own. Alan Bates perfectly catches this mindset with Michael Baytes and remembers immortally Bates as such. It's a Canadian and American movie. It is a valuable cinema that is able to show its audience through the magic of making a movie and show how easy it is for the producer and director to lose control over the makers and countless external forces. The wonderful thing is that "Hollywood North" does not suffer from what he is depicting: Peter O'Brian is leading exactly and completely and directs the serious "back" part of the film as well as the film-in-film, "flight to Bogota" with clarity and comprehensibility. If you are interested in the wisdom and strength of the Canadian cinema, the Hollywood North is a great place to start.
