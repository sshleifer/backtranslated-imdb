This movie is just brilliant. Cinematography is good, the actor's great and the story is amazing. This is the story of the white South African Donald Woods who found himself liberal until he discovered the reality of apartheid. Kevin Kline is absolutely convincing - so much that Donald Woods himself appeared on television a few years later, he knew he was depicting Kline. Denzel Washington is also becoming more masterful than ever before. <br /> <br /> I ask you to look at it. It's long, but patience is worth it because it tells such an incredible story. Remember, people, it really happened.
