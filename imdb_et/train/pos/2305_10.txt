I thought it was a very good movie. It would have been nice to see a little more about about 2 siblings who knew every boy was before he was killed. I'm sure if the movie was done, it would have had a very different ending, so it changed that good movie. It shows that whatever happens to your brothers and sisters in your life, you can always do it and that if it is 2 siblings dealing with a boy (the same boy), dealing with pain and sickness makes things better and easier between the two to work. It is nice to see the love stories that are terrible in someone's life so you can get even closer. I really enjoyed watching this movie and I'm doing it right now. It seems to me that I look at it every time it comes. It would have been nice if there had been a second part for this film, maybe an older sister, to come and come to her child, it would indeed have made a very good finish because she was dead. he's alive, though he's dead.
