As Peckinpah did with STRAW DOGS and Kubrick CLOCKWORK ORANGE, director John Boorman gives an effective film about the violent side of a person in DELIVERANCE, which is arguably the ultimate horror film of the 1970s. Burt Reynolds, Jon Voight, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox depict four Atlanta businessmen who decide to take canoeing along the natural Cahulawassee River in northern Georgia before attacking what Reynolds calls "one great dead lake". /> <br /> However, the local mountainman takes their white towns carefully with their white forests. The next day, Beatty and Voight continue to stick along the river and sexually attack (the infamous "SQUEAL!" Order) with two malicious mountain men (Bill McKinney, Herbert "Cowboy" Coward). So, what started as nothing more than a sneak through the apples, now has become a horror, where our four main characters come to see a thin line between what we think of as civilization and what we think of as barbarism. / / <br /> James Dickey adapted the scenario from his best-selling book and the result is often a shocking and disturbing shock. Often known for its "SQUEAL!" and "Dueling Banjos" sequences, DELIVERANCE is also a rather pulsating challenge where four leading men are excellent in their role, and McKinney and Coward make the two most terrifying of all time. Black and black film for those who want to take the opportunity.
