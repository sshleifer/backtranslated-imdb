The King of Masks (Bian Lian in China) is a surprisingly beautiful and deeply touching film. 16 prize laureates from around the world, this film is based on a real story in the middle of Wang Bianlian, street performer of the 1930s in China, who is growing older but has no heir to convey his art to face-change opera. He has a unique talent for fast-changing masks in the performance, and no one knows how he does it. He has a longing desire for his grandchild, because his art is a family legacy that can only be passed on to the heir of men. Then we go to the streets and see that people sell their children because they can't afford to take care of them: some have even prayed for their daughters for free because the daughters are not worth it in this society. The story of Wang Bianliani continues there. <br /> <br /> The film was so amazingly good that it was amazing and the questions were so compelling and well addressed. There is gender inequality and the frustrating fact that at this time and place no one wants a girl. It is also interesting to note that the famous opera player, who always plays a woman and is known as the Bodhisattva in life, is a man dressed as a woman, and although she is famous and respected, she considers herself a low, half female. Approaching the film, people face the problems of slave trade and its demand, and thus the lack of a possible solution, the brutality and corruption of the military and the police, and the lack of power and power that everyone gets. This is certainly one of the best films I've ever seen in my life and actor, who plays Wang Bianlian, Xu Zhu presents another beautiful performance.
