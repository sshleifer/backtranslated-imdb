Some movies just shouldn't be rebuilt. This is one of them. Even this is not a bad film. But it does not capture the taste and fear of the 1963 film of the same title. Liam Neeson was great as he always is, and most are cast except Owen Wilson, who just didn't get the right feeling for Luke's character. But the main mistake of this version is that it was too far away from Shirley Jackson's story of trying to be grandiose and losing some of the excitement of the earlier movie by deducting snazzier special effects. Again, I say, it is not a bad film in itself. But you will enjoy much more fear of fear in the older version.
