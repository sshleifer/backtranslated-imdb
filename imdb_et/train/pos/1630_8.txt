I may have one of those few who really adhered to this movie. I also saw this movie when it came out and I agree with the last post that Up The Acedemy was ahead of its time. The film's own humor is the pure MAD magazine. I don't understand why MAD behind this feature. It was also one of the few 80's films that had a killer with a bunker and new wave sticks that were created by L.A at that time. I have a soundtrack and I play it all the way to this day. What can I say? There are definitely the worst movies. I do not consider Porky as funny as Up The Academy, the whole movie has some very good laughs and jokes fall into either stereotypes or putting on. Listen, no one said it was a Malta Falcon.
