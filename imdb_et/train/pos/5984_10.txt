This is a great movie when viewed in the right context - it was supposed to be a teen-horror-fuck-worship movie parody (and in the 80s I saw many)! I saw this movie when it first came out, and immediately enjoyed it. Being a big fan of KISS, it was good to see Geen in the movie. There is nothing wrong with OZZY as a metal hate preacher! Fastway was also my favorite, so it was good to hear them on the sound track. <br /> <br /> The original VHS (pre-DVD) cover for Trick or Treat, which showed Sami kneeling, playing his guitar around the fire, watching a "demon". It was a special order and the price of a VHS copy at that time (ca 1987) was $ 90! I really wanted a movie, but not that ridiculous price. The OZZY-Gene cover was created to release only $ 5. The company who released it thought Gene and OZZY were the only recognizable people in the movie, so they had put it on the cover! The same thing with the original "Little Horrors Shop" - Jack Nicholson was in all five minutes, but now he's on the cover as if he were a star. <br /> <br /> I have a "Trick Or Treat" website and it is surprising how many people believe Sammi Curr was a real person! Fastway helped keep this myth by dedicating his soundtrack album to Sammi Curr. <br /> <br /> All-in-all, it was just a good time for a rock-n-roll movie. Be sure not to take it too seriously but just liked it!
