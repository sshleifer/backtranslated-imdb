With this fine series of stunning episode. This is the best in television. The story takes place in 1968, and is a beautifully black-and-white film, with almost no film style, with deep shadows and harsh images. This is the story of two men who fall in love, but I don't want to ruin it. This is a rare presentation of what homosexuals in the United States are facing in the 1960s. We write great Tom Pettit, led by the great Jeannot Szwarc, to live our lives, love each other and their tragedy. Taking such a sensitive issue makes this episode even more stunning. Our emotions are as torn as the edges like characters. Chills struck my back when they played Bob Dylan's proud, "Ah, but I was so much older, I'm younger than now," as Byrds sang. It goes far beyond ten and up to the stars. Beautiful.
