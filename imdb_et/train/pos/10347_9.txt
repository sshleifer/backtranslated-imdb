A happy little movie, juggling comedy and detective, romance and drama genres, such as Kenny Williams (Melvyn Douglas), are balancing their commitment to their girlfriend Maxine Carroll (Joan Blondell) and her commitment to power like ace detective. <br /> This hodge-podge may not turn to all viewers today, but on that day he had something to offer to every member of the movie, and the resolution for a rather tired feeling-resistance plot is original and refreshing and worth waiting for. <br /> <br /> "Amazing Mr Williams" includes what must be the most embarrassing blind days in the history of films and its vivid comic repertoire. Melvyn Douglas bravely frocked some of the best features: "I went down the main track with a Turkish towel before I let the women check their lives!" And the effervescent Joan Blondell lets his barbs fly with a typical aplomb: "Good mourning! You look like my aunt Nellie!" <br /> <br /> Crime solving is the usual price here, although the fine cast of character actors helps to materialize. <br /> <br /> From today's point of view, "The Amazing Mr. Williams" is perhaps the most interesting of your insightful commentary sex as a socially defined construction, the more mallable its seemingly rigid boundaries. While much of the gender commentary is a superficial struggle for sex, sometimes it is so subtle and penetrating, playing not only some of the finer details of the film, but also in the battle of genres that reaches its culmination in the last scene.
