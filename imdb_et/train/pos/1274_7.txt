Note that everyone who did not like and enjoyed this movie noted that it was not as good as the book or that it was different from the book. <br /> <br /> I don't understand this type of criticism. Books and movies are different media. When books have lessons and lessons to develop characters and stories, the films are about 120 minutes long. But the film has the advantage of stimulating several senses: visual, sound, and imagination. I don't care if the film is just as good or is actually similar to the book on which it is based. Who cares? I appreciate it for what it is. <br /> <br /> This TV movie was charming. The old and often seen story, the tendency to clich√©s, can easily be embarrassing. But Riffen and Reeves pull it out. One reviewer found Riffen far into the old. I would never have thought he was 40 years old when making this film. His credit as an actor played amazingly well for 23-24 years. I think it's the best thing Reeves ever did. The story could have been stronger and I agree that screen display could have been used to "tighten". However, it is worth looking at; Obviously not a powerful love story, but a charming romance that leaves you happy that love is a strong emotion and good, exceeds evil. And it's nice to see a "love story" without a mandatory f # $% word, naked buttocks or a spit. "Finally, the musical result is great.
