I wanted to see Valentine because I saw Denise Richards and Marley Shelton were in it because they had played on some of my favorite films. When I looked at Valentine, I was amazed at how much this story really was. It kills me to see that it's low because it wasn't terrible at all. The actors and actors played the parts perfectly and the way it ended was so brilliant and cunning. Some scenes were a bit incredible and poor and I admit to some small parts that it was just a bit boring, but in general it was endless entertaining and relaxed. It had a thought-provoking story that made you think all the way, and it doesn't deserve all this nonsense. I recommend watching this movie any time, but especially on Valentine's Day, because it gives you a lot of chills. Oh, and don't even pay attention to the trailer OR RATE, please, DO NOT ...
