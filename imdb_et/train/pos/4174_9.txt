... if this movie proves so well that they are really unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Although it was a few lines, this movie was very unknown to see this movie in an unknown language. One of my friends sent VHS, a few pieces of paper, all of which were translated into English. next to my translation, I started to look at this story (this is indeed a story), and when I was opening credits for the first stories of the quiz melody, I was stuck. Colors that are minimal (in most cases), absurd comedy, shockproof, thoughtful, beautiful ... with another movie (Paris, Texas and Nenette to Boni), it is able to speak to someone's heart - without words. If you have a chance, look at it. Whatever you do - don't miss it. It's once in life. Oh, that's great, the soundtrack is brilliant, the story is simple and was told a thousand times before - but rarely (never) like that.
