It's one of my two or three favorite Stooges short pants and no doubt Christine McIntyre's trio is the best result. She is good in many other shorts, but here she is brilliant. His song is not funny at all, it is really pretty, but the plot is built so that singing increases humor, not deviating from it. We hear McIntyre, who sings the whole voice at least three times in the spring, but never gets old, partly because we don't speak our voice, and partly because it fits so well with Stooges antiques. The use of the operatic soprano in comedy resembles the role of Kitty Carlisle in Marx Brothers' "Night Opera", but singing here is much more comedy than "Opera" and McIntyre (maybe more) in other performances than here) never did. The Stooges Bull Master, the McIntyre song and the well-built plot of land combine five of the five stars.
