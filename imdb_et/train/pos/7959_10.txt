This is really a cool movie! I remember it for the first time when I was really young and I was always looking at it like once a week ... Shadow was my favorite film. Homeward Bound is really funny and it's really cool how they do these animals. Some of the film is sad (like a cat, Sassy, ​​falls under the waterfall and when Shadow falls into the hole at the end). I've seen another Homeward Bound, but I have to say it's not as good as the first. Shadow is smart, Sassy is, well, Sassy and Chance is a funny idiot. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves comedies or talk about animals. This is one of my ten favorite films!
