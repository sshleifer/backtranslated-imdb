This aspiration builds on the real story of Jim Morris, a high school science teacher / baseball coach, inspired by his players to try out profiles and fulfill his lifetime dream of playing in major companies. Dennis Quaid, who is not a stranger to sports movies, plays Morrist with enough conviction to do some work, and the manufacturers are working hard to revive real events that brought Morris into short breaks as Tampa Bay Devil Rays. In the first half of the film, with its cloaked bunch of high school baseball players (who all look too old to be in high school), it's less effective and probably a bit too long. In general, the film suffers from some tempo issues and some additional sub-blocks that we probably could have done. But it is still quite an engaging film with an inspiring theme that proves once again that baseball is a national pastime. GRADE: B-
