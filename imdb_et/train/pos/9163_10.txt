When my up-to-date daughter was in pre-school age, these mini devices appeared to A&E every morning 8-9. My neighbor and I made a pact that we wouldn't miss Jane Eyre for a minute, and our kids were late every week for a week before school. Good choice. <br /> <br /> I forgot how much I loved this movie until I recently got my old VHS copy. Timothy Dalton is very beautiful, but still perfect as Rochester. The blind, harsh faces, the wonderful sense of humor and the gentle behavior were on the pages of the book. Although Dalton eats a little landscape, I couldn't sit in front of adaptability to William Hurt or the terrible Ciaran Hinds. The magic here is that women love Dalton and get into romance. <br /> <br /> I would like to know what has become of Zelah Clarke. He's dead like Jane, quiet, formal, just saying the volume. Her eye glow gives viewers a glimpse of Christmas and sensual nature, which helped Jane survive the ill-treatment she suffered in her youth. The criticism of his results as "wood" has been misplaced. A proper English household employee should have kept this behavior, but he is passionate about overcoming emotions. Unlike many other Janese screens, he seems to be beautiful enough to be Jane, but beautiful enough for the audience to buy Rochester's attraction. <br /> <br /> The Bronte dialog is a big part of why a book does not touch the script much of it. Dalton and Clarke quietly and quietly interact with Jane and Rochester. Though Jane looks like a regular and sweet like vanilla pudding, she refuses in the dark, pink Rochester. Two lines play beautifully with each other. <br /> <br /> This is the best fit for the novel's novel.
