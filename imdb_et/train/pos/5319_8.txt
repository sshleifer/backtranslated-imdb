Forget it is a "B" movie. Forget that it's outdated in many ways. Instead, give writer-director Ida Lupino a much-earned prize for dealing with the topic that was taboo at Hollywood at that time (1950). To my knowledge, this was the first film about rape and the emotional and mental impact it has on victims of crime. <br /> <br /> While much of the cast actress is a pedestrian at best, Mala Powers, who was eighteen or nineteen at that time, gives a great result as a traumatized young woman, Ann, trying to "shame." Based on his work in the film, I am surprised that he did not have a more successful actor career. Tod Andrews also has some exciting moments when the minister helps him. <br /> <br /> Mrs Lupino, who apparently works in a limited budget, was still able to create some memorable scenes, such as struggling streets and alleys leading to rape, and the ensuing police composition. And he created the end of the bittersweet that left me wondering if Ann could ever have a normal life.
