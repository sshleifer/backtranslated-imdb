I lived in Rawlin when this film was made and I managed to work on it. Special effects with both additional and Eddie Surkin. It was fun to see all the behind the scene operations, from Barbedwire coming alive Electric chairs up through the guards office floor. It was also fun to meet all the actors, from Viggo to Tinyin. Also called "Gateway to Disney", a movie that was cut into a movie jail is still on the local side. If anyone is interested and is ever in Rawlins, most movies are still in place and can be seen in self-study. It was a lot of joy to work with R. Harlin and wanted me to be able to do it again.
