Now I have always been a fan of Full Moon's work. But I have to say that Robot Jox is one of the best projects. Yeah, you heard me. The story works great, the atmosphere really works, and the actors do a first-rate job. Gary Graham, who really shows on his TV brand ALIEN NATION SERIES and STAR TREK ENTERPRISE, shows that he can be an action star that starts ass and takes the name. The stopping effects could have been a little better. The color was wrong, they see me as plastic rather than metal they think. But this is a small complaint compared to the whole Robot Jox, if you like Gary Graham or other Full Moon movies, you like this movie. 9 ATTENTION 10.
