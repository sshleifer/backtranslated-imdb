Far from my second favorite movie Spielberg made after Animaniac. Even if the ratings were low, so what I enjoyed and loved was so funny and I adored it, wow Jess Harnell and Tress Macne were there and were just fantastic, the whole cast was great, especially legendary Frank Welker. <br /> <br /> I love to see this picture again, both awesome and fun. I also remember the fun moment you came in this brain, you hear his voice and played the PATB theme instrumental, it was just fantastic, I love it on the cartoons when you came in. I wish this cartoon and Animaniacs came back, I loved them
