Broadway music big splashy movie. Nathan (Frank Sinatra) loves to roll the dice and organize illegal attacks. Blonde loving Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) wants to marry her when she gives up. He decides on one of the last games played by Big Masters (Marlon Brando!) In the city. He puts in heaven that he cannot go to missionary Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons) with him in Havana. It may seem like a strange plot summary, but so is the film! <br /> <br /> This is a real mixed pot - here are some wonderful things. The songs are all good and the dance is incredible. The actual show cap is at the end of the game. Brando is also pretty good here - it may seem strange to think he's singing and dancing, but he's pulling it away. I have to admit that the big, bulky Brando pulls out some heavy dances that were great fun! Also, Sinatra is pretty good and Blaine is just as great as her longtime girlfriend. His song and dance numbers are certain here. <br /> <br /> Jean Simmons is a wonderful actor for bad parts, but he is stuck in color and can't do much. The length of the film is 150 minutes - the scenes between Brando and Simmons really shrink and should have been shortened. Most of the characters speak very accurately in English - contractions are never used. Maybe it's trying to be out of the mouth of the gangsters, but I found this jarring and it kept me out of the movie. <br /> <br /> It is worth catching songs and dances, but the length will not reach you after a while. I'll give her 7.
