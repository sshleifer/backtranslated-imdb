Poor DVD video quality is the only reason I gave it to 9 instead of 10. It could have been so much better, this film deserves it. <br /> <br /> It's really a movie that covers multiple topics at the same time. If you do not like the movies of successive killers, but are fascinated by the astonishing bureaucratic culture of the former Soviet Union, this film is still mandatory. <br /> <br /> I can't compare it to "Silence Lamb" for several reasons. The way in which the serial killer is portrayed is much better than X in the citizen. You can see the various details of your private life because you "travel" with the killer, giving you some insight into its source of constant anger and sexual disappointment. <br /> <br /> The only other film I've ever seen is as realistic as it was, "Henry's sequel portrait." If you are spooky about the movie, you must definitely watch Citizen X.
