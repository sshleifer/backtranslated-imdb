When I heard that movie came out at Halloween night, I was very excited. When I found out that it was a book written in 1978, I had to read it before watching the movie. I'm sure the movie would be a lot different for me if I hadn't read the book. Writers actually did a good job of naturally leaving small differences in the book's mainland. I think what was most disappointing about the movie was Boyle, who played a colleague's role, I'm not a big fan of Boyle, and it seems that whatever mood it is during the movie, he always tries to use him - pumped lips and dark makeup eyes make you feel super sexy. Indeed, I think the film was held against the real fear of the house. My favorite sub-block was the Sheehan family (which is so strange b / c that the son was killed in Iraq and in current events Casey Sheehan, whose mother went to a huge Iraqi raft). In the book, the war was obviously not Iraq, but Vietnam, and when the house turned to a son in the helicopter, I was really slipping. Overall, I was impressed by the film because it was very good at the book.
