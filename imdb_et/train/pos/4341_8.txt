Who has no outstanding issues with parents? And which parents have unresolved issues? <br /> <br /> I know it sounds difficult. But it is played for the film's laughing, making the comedy better and drama better. I've always liked Paul Reiser and Peter Falk, and although I was a little worried that their star qualities might be too big for a small movie, I was fascinated by the first scene. <br /> <br /> It was especially fun to discover what the son is doing for his father as a human. And Peter Falki's monologue, standing in a hard-working, father-spouse sacrifice, was the perfect balancing point. Without this scene, the film would have been much less nuanced and the character is much less interesting. <br /> <br /> Very well done, Paul and Peter!
