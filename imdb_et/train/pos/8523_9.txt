I was already a fan of the book from the third grade, so of course I was watching the movie, reading it, and then watching TV shows. It was a good show in itself, and now, as an adult, I enjoy this show. My only real problem was that it didn't follow the book. The first time I saw it, I was so disappointed that I turned it off. But it comes from a girl with the first addition of a book. But after a while, I decided to try again and ignore this book (like what you have to do with Harry Potter movies). I found a series of wonderful! It was a clean cut and something that everyone could enjoy, just the right amount of comedy to make everyone go. It's truly enjoyable! Clean and wonderful!
