Sex Bender is having sex for x-files. This episode has an interesting premise, a good story, but an end that desires. Gender Bender is also the debut of actor Nicholas Lea, better known as Alex Krycek. In this episode he plays Michael, a man attacked by one of The Kindred. You just have to look at this episode to see Nic Lea's less than remarkable start. An interesting thing about the "seduction" of tribes. When Marty does it to her victims, they turn to her. But when Andrew, like Scully, he just because he was uncomfortable and tempting and Andrew was not interested. Perhaps this is because Marty has more experience than Andrew. This episode reminds me why sometimes filming in British Columbia would be unhappy. Throughout the episode, it's wet, hard and muddy, it wouldn't have been so fun. Despite the disappointment, Gender Bender is still a good episode to watch.
