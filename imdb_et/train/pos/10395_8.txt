A fantastic arabic adventure. Former King Ahmad and his best friend, Abu Thief (played by Sabu of Black Narcissus), were looking for an interest in Ahmad's love that had been stolen by the new King Jaffar (Conrad Veidt). It's hardly down here. It always offers heroes new adventures. Personally, I found Ahmad and his princess a bit bored (there is no need to ask why John Justin, who plays Ahmad, is on the fourth list). Conrad Veidt, who is always a fun actor, makes a big cable and Sabu is a fun prince who at one point finds a bottle of a gene. I also loved Miles Malleson as the princess's father, Basra Sultan. He collects great toys from all over the world. Jaffar asks him about his daughter with a mechanical flying horse. This is probably considered to be a great children's film of all time, but today special effects are dreadfully dated. Children will surely bring out overlapping images when Abu and genie are on the screen together. And the huge spider scene looks especially awful. Although most of the younger generation probably thinks King Kong looks bad at this moment, Willis O'Brien's stop-motion animation is a thousand times better than a doll's string, which doesn't even look like a spider. 8/10
