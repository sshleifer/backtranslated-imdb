There are no people like "Show People" by Marion Davies (like Peggy Pepper) and William Haines (Billy Boone). My introduction to Mrs Davies was the "clip" of this movie; admirable, where he lowers the scarf to reveal different emotions. My introduction to Mr. Haines was now watching this movie; but it is possible that I have seen him in a less memorable role. Haines makes an incredible impression when he joins Davies for a commercial meal by putting his hat on a ring with some great bits on the dining table. Indeed, Haines and Davies offer great comics. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Dell Henderson (Colonel Pepper), who directs daughter Davies to Hollywood, confident that he will become Tinseltown's latest cognition. Indeed, Davies and the already arrived Haines are receiving comedy stars. But Davies wants to become a real queen of drama. Davies leaves Haines and partners with a stunningly dramatic Paul Rally. But viewers prefer Davies in comic roles; Maybe the director, King Vidor, offers things that imitate life art? <br /> <br /> The perfect Hollywood location material, both on the device and outside. Perfect for big "cameos"; Davies Douglas Fairbanks and William S. Hart are sitting on a studio dinner at the desk. But the best "little" player is Charlie Chaplin, who has enough nerves to ask Davies for his autograph! While the cameos are fun, they and episodic sequences help to "show people" become a less important film and a more important historical document. <br /> <br /> ******** Show People (11/11/28) King Vidor ~ Marion Davies, William Haines, Dell Henderson
