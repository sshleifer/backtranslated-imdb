Although there were some rough spots and some plot lines that were not realistic, it was a classic H: LOTS. The characters next to Mike Giardello (Giancarlo Esposito) were real, and the scenes between the reunion of Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) were as deep and well-functioning as ever before to fall in love with a small screen. /> <br /> "Homicide: The Movie" or "Life Everlasting" is a fan-shot, but stands for both itself and the 2-hour series. Fontana, Overmeyer, and Yoshimura did an excellent job of pulling open ends from 7 seasons and every member of the larger "television better fucking" show that NBC never wanted to give it. The true form of "killing" was not a happy ending, it is life. That's what has always shown this example, except for the pointless cookie-cutter show left on television. Weaving for writers and casting to create something over the series and the film that challenged both television viewers and producers. <br /> <br /> ** I call myself a "homicidal maniac" if not for any other reason to keep your collaborators from working together. **
