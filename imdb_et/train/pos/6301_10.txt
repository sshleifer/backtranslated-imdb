I participate in the filmmaker's symposium and this film was shown after we had not seen such a big movie and participated in a 40-minute discussion. Although it was incredibly late and we were tired, it really enjoyed the whole audience. <br /> <br /> Personally, I thought the movie was fun in all the right places, and I loved the peculiar characters. They really grow in the movie.
