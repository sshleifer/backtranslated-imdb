As another reviewer, Hanna says the war is a remarkable film of a prominent person, Hanna "Anniko" Senesh, who gets a Jewish Joan Of Arc. Unfortunately, there is a difference of opinion that you do not agree that Miss Detmers as a leader is too beautiful to take it seriously. In fact, his beauty has not been opposed to his performance, but makes it even tougher by the sadistic brutality as resistance. The performance of Maruschka Detmers is bold, terrible, affectionate, or understandable and completely credible. In other words, for me, "Zone." opening credit. If you want to learn about someone else's suffering, something they believe and impressively entertain, try Hanna's War with Maruschka Detmers. My hat is also for Ellen Burstyn as Hanna's mother, a well-known and famous actor who could have made an effort to go to the movie. There are perhaps two actor teamwork, but not the All About Eve situation.
