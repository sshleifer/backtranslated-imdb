I've seen this movie many times and I never get tired of it. It's classic in every sense. The film is hysterically funny and still quite touching. For those of you who are not "subtitles" or a fan of a foreign film, open your mind. It's a great movie for a "beginner" because the story is so fun. Don't do it wrong, it's 100% Japanese (and that's what it does), but everyone gets something out of it (even if it's just a big laugh to one of Mr Aoki's main names) one of the funniest signs I've ever seen!) < br /> <br /> I can't even think of this movie without a smile! I love it ... and I think most people.
