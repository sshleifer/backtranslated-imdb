I really enjoyed it as an adult. I watched it with my two grandchildren and the 3-year-old was fascinated by the 15-month-old giggled mice. <br /> <br /> Music is fun and the animation is great. This sequel does what Return to Neverland did not achieve. Cinderella's story is a good follow-up; but what about Drusilla? Another sequel? I hope!
