I can only agree with a taximeter that it is a fantastic movie and should be viewed by a wide audience. The imagination, the visual interpretation of the script, the humor is constantly surprising. Two lines are great and really carry the movie. My advice would be not just looking at a trailer, but renting a movie and watching expectations. I rented the band so it is easily available in Brisbane, not everyone can enjoy it, but I think most people are in the opinion and it's always good if it's not just "it was stupid". I loved this movie, you just can't see such a legacy every day. It should become a cult favorite. Try it, you can just feel the same as me.
