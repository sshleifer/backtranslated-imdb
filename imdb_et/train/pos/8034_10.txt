There are a few movies that seem to be both entertainment and realistic. If you've ever thought about the role of snipers in today's war, look at it. <br /> <br /> I just loved the scene where hundreds of soldiers shot in the jungle, nobody was sure where it was shot? <br /> <br /> And they put one scene into a private Ryan so that the scene must have a certain value. <br /> <br />
