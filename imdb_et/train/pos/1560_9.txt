It's a reunion, a team, and a great trial episode. From hesitation to resolution, Clark has made an important leap from a worried teenager who was afraid of a controlled fate, Superman, who, like a green arrow, sets his emotions aside with his little loved ones and is ready to rescue the whole planet. It's not just an exciting story about teamwork, loyalty, and friendship; it is also a decision that is more important in life, a lesson for Clark. I don't want the series to end, but I hope that the following episodes will be strictly adhered to what justice shows without pressing backwards and puts a small end and a small start for Superman. <br /> <br /> In this episode we would have had more contrasts between Lex and the team. Nine stars should give him enough credit.
