She sees it here and there and then goes to her bedroom and gets the picture - 'Ah! another girl? it's a double baddie and yes, indeed, its two timings, but it's this time GUY. And I say "Brilliant!" <br /> <br /> END OF SPOILERS (The scene above is not really a spoiler, but it was for me that I didn't want to take it) <br /> <br /> When asked how this movie was, I replied friend "oh, it's just a P3 for people" that made me believe that watching a stupid movie, if nothing more. When I went to the theater, I thought to myself that I could get a better pen and paper to mark the bad things in this movie, but I was totally wrong? and then some because I could only collect the goods. This movie was great. Excellent, not because it is an amazing and non-commercial movie like a storyline, but the intelligence of the scenario and its film tells you how to make the movie look great, which could have been an empty and pointless movie in the wrong hands. Konkona Sen Sharma is a grace. She is so damn beautiful, who has been playing her role perfectly as if she was born to play that part. One of the charming actors I've ever seen. But this is not the only performance that is good in the movie, there are Sandhya Mridul, Boman Irani and Atul Kulkarni. Especially Sandhya Mrid, who just burns the screen. (And don't even guess what Tara Sharma usually talks about) <br /> <br /> Films denote film industry et al. the movie is about. And about half an hour through the movie you will feel almost the same. But then the movie speeds up to grab a good story and never let it go. Even Boman Irani agrees with this statement? "That was a good story, Madhvi." (Thanks). The big thing is that it deals with the question of how stupid these people are and are not doing it and also dealing with social problems and not making them boring. Ultimately, all the skateboarders and Madhvi will tell us that just for all these people, just smiling. That's why I love watching movies. Ecstatic Film Making. The scenario is beautiful, smart and smart.
