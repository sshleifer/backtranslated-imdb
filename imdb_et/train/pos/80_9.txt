I really enjoyed reunion! I would have rated it for 10 if they had had "Hassie" and "Little Luke". It is not even mentioned where they are today or why they did not participate in the reunion. They were very popular characters and I think it was a mistake not to give an explanation for their lack of appearance. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I was glad TNN ran the series again! For years I had been looking for episodes and joy to record the whole series (I can skip some episodes). Jenny Hanahan
