New York has never been so good! And there is no one in this movie. Although the script is a bit light, you cannot like such a movie or any of its characters. You almost want such people to really exist. The participants' complaint is what is really being overthrown (John Ritter, Colleen Camp and late Dorothy Stratten are particularly good.) Go ahead and rent or buy the movie you are happy about.
