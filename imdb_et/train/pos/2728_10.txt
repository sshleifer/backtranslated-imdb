Just one of the best! Richard Brooks Truman Capote's fictional novel is a truly artistic achievement. Stunning black and white cinematography (which could have been won by the Oscar), the haunting Quincy Jones score and the tremendously matched killers of Robert Blake and Scott Wilson. This film was at Academy Awards 0 and 4, not even the best picture when Dr. Doolittle was. Get your finger off! <br /> <br /> Although you are not familiar with both the troublesome family and the book, it was a good decision to focus more on Perry and Dick and their sons. below. John Forsythe is also impressive as Alvin Dewey. There are simply no mistakes. 10 out of 10 Best performance = Scott Wilson with R. Blake close second. Highly recommended!
