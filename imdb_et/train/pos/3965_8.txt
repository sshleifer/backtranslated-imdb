The movie is very good and Jimmy Stewart is great as Chip Hardesty, with well-made contests by Vera Miles and Murray Hamilton. However, the film led by legendary director Mervyn Leroy was constantly monitored and the script was approved and all aspects of the film were watched and inspected by J. Edgar Hoover. Not that Edgar Hoover wasn't proud of anything. His management office since 1924 until his death crated on the best research services in the world. But in 1959, Hoover began to worry about forced expulsion and already began to gather files on powerful people to secure and protect his small kingdom. And he decided to make sure that no film saw any warts on the office. The films only show the continuing successes and glitches that have occurred in the early 1950s and the role of the office. Enjoy the story, but the tongue firmly in the cheek.
