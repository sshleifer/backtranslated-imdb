I have to say I have loved the movie completely. It was funny moments, some heart-warming parts, just everywhere. I personally liked the film because it could eventually be related to my childhood. In my opinion, this film is more directed at young homosexuals. This shows how a young gay boy is treated during growth. All scary, naming and not aware is something I, like most other young female boys, always remember, and now finally a movie that shows how difficult it really is to grow gay. So I would definitely see this movie. It should probably not be seen until the person is old and mature enough to understand it
