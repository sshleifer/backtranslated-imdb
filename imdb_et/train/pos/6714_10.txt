Why did I enjoy the show for the last episode? The true talent of Melissa Joan Hart and her supportive lie had to prove that whip, comedy, frivolous humor and deep thinking can actually exist. What I liked most was that I could go home and smile ... I was inspired ... and why? It was an inspiration to watch because this magical person was helping others so happy. <br /> <br /> Sabrina was, in my opinion, a hero ... although he was vulnerable in a way that was not as different as ours ... very different; he had his own fingertips, desires, and command powers that could be used for good or bad, which can only exist in many of our imaginations. Most of what we see, own, know, own or even want ... can be used for good or bad and how we decide to define it, the person we are. <br /> <br /> He traveled with the world and other areas with their constant and universal ideas ... to learn, live, laugh, and love. He always learned how to improve his skills for the benefit of all; He made mistakes when he lived a life, underwent a growth of different paths, because he, his aunts and Salem (undervalued but imperfect hero) did well to prove that even through mistakes you can still be noble, talented and wonderful. He also showed many selfless, learning, and loving acts as he went his way. If this is not a good reason for 10 stars for this war-torn world, where people are so hostile to each other, they don't understand how the differences are more of a spice of life than a reason to kill ... then I don't know what is. This exhibition was definitely a trip to a better world, as well as an inspiration to be a better self and a gift aimed at breaking the smile on our bark ... I have heard from a doctor that all I mentioned above leads to the whole "charter" ... and is it not what do we all need? :)
