NYC model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) rents space in an old brown stone, where she meets some strange neighbors and experiences some horrible hallucinations. As lawyer boy Michael Lerman (Chris Sarandon) makes inquiries on his behalf, he tries to maintain his peace of mind (not to mention the will to live) because his experiences suffer from his physical, mental and emotional health. /> <br /> I don't want to ruin the better moments of this psychological horror for those who don't know it. The story is interesting and entertaining, but the film does not really offer real fear. Or for that, any atmosphere. It's kind of quietly dirty, but it's not like a traditional horror movie. This is more of a story of a problematic woman's attempt to deal with the growing unreality in her life. It works at this level, but it's not quite powerful enough. <br /> <br /> What The Sentinel * offers * is some eye-catching pieces (especially exciting, fabulous scary tip and there is a scene with Beverly D'Angelo to believe). There are also some gore, but not very many. Gil Melle's threatening music score adds to the danger. <br /> <br /> Reviewing this movie wouldn't be complete without the filmmakers' assessment of collecting such great actors for their ensemble. Some of them can't do too much, but everyone sees them together impressively. Eli Wallach and Burgess Meredith give the most impression, like a hard-nosed detective and a neighbor. Other legendary names include Jose Ferrer, Arthur Kennedy and Ava Gardner. Future stars such as D'Angelo, Christopher Walken, Tom Berenger, Jeff Goldblum perform shortly and other familiar faces are Jerry Orbach, Sylvia Miles, William Hickey and Martin Balsam. Anyone who was the director of this film deserves a prize. <br /> <br /> Written by director Michael Winner, probably the best-known "Death Wish" series he made with Charles Bronson, Jeffrey Konvitz novel. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't consider it to be a really terrific horror thriller, but it has moments and it's reasonably fun. <br /> <br /> 7/10
