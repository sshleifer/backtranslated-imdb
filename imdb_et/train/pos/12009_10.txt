I really thought they did a * great * job, nothing was wrong, I don't know how the first commentator could have said it was terrible, it took me to tears (I think it moved to all tears) but I didn't try to shout in the movie because it is embarrassing but it got me. It was SOOO good! I hope they release it on a DVD because I definitely buy a copy! It seems to me that it renews my faith and gave me hope that I can't explain it, it made me want to be a better person, they went through so much and we take it for granted. Compared to this, I feel that our own research is nothing. Well, nothing but they hardly fit with what they were supposed to go through. I love it. Who played Emma?!
