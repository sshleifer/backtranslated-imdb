Those who already work with the film camera at the beginning of the century must have discovered their potential very early. This is a good story about a playboy who needs money and inadvertently sells his soul to Satan for a lot of money. Unfortunately, the soul is double of him and he has to face him often to leave his life. There are some wonderful scenes where people disappear and of course scenes when two are on stage. The middle part is a bit boring, but Faust's story is always in the mind of the viewer. One thing I have to mention is the overall discomfort of the film's people. They also did quite a lot of activities that would have given at least life to life. First I knew about this movie about 25 years ago and finally I could see it. I was not disappointed.
