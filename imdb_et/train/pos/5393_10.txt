I was probably one of the few Australians who didn't watch this series on the air. I have to say that when William McInnes first appeared, this is one funny actor! But as the series continued, he gave his production a tone and I loved him completely. He was such a rude man, but he made me laugh. I watched the show to see Hugo Speers (Heart and Bones, The Full Monty) and Tom Long (SeaChange, Two Hands). It was interesting to see Speers playing a nice, quiet man and even more interesting looking at Tom Long's splitting muscles! Sigh ... Seriously, Long's performance was a complete shock and really brilliant. He stole the exhibition. Martin Sacks also played a small role and the leading actor created fun results. I recommend this program if you enjoy stories with twists and watch Tom Long walks without a shirt ...
