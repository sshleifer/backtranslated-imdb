Although it is not as wild and a way out as some of Takashi Miike's later films, it is a very good crime drama. <br /> <br /> The main story is the story of a Japanese policeman policeman trying to step down with Chinese parents. The complicated thing is that his younger brother acts as a villain and his gang lawyer. The film is actually much more complicated than many complications that keep things interesting and disturb things from the central narrative. This is the complication and loss of the way about an hour of film that makes it less than a great movie. (This is very good) It's definitely worth it, especially if you don't mind any frantic pace. /> <br /> Warning, violence when it happens is explosive and nasty. There are also poetic examples of gay sex. If this is not your dish, proceed with caution. <br /> <br /> 7 or 8 out of 10.
