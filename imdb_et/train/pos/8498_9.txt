This is a great movie with fun, smart story and dynamics of cultural differences, and the life-critical theme makes it a very underrated movie. Don't let the cynics of the world stop you. Keaton has wonderful moments and I don't know that comedy has never been appreciated because actors like Keaton make it very easy to look at humor in serious bits. Great movie everywhere!
