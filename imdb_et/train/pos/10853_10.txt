This film is huge for spirits. <br /> <br /> Every time I watch it, I see and hear some funny little things that I didn't miss before. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is incredible. Mick Jones (alien) and Chris Difford (Squeeze) put together the songs, making Strange Fruit the best that ever hit the music scene today. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, strange fruits are strictly fictitious, washed from 60s to 70s. a band that was never good from the start because of drug use and internal struggle. One wonders what could have been listening to their fanatic soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Fruit inspiration is Rolling Stones, Deep Purple, David Bowie and The Who. <br /> <br /> Each member of Fruit is quite memorable. The stars of Stephen Rea, like Tony Costello, who are dead and dead, who the festival promoter wants to reunite with his band, are hoping to get financial benefits. Costello approaches the former journey of Karen Knowles, played by Juliet Aubrey, to help her revive the long past of dreams. <br /> <br /> Juliet collects bitter Jimmy's nails (Les Wickes) by beating Timothy Spall (David 'Beano' Baggot) and extremely glamorous Ray Simms (Bill Nighy). Tumbling is another ex-roadie, Hippie-Toker-Jester Hughie (Billy Connolly), who will never let the flame out. <br /> <br /> When Juliet looks for the last member of the membership band, Brian Lovell, the hard-to-understand guitarist and songwriter (played by Bruce Robinson), reunited members like the old times, fighting each other's rusty talent. <br /> <br /> The band will then be given the chance to make a small tour of the Netherlands to prepare for the festival. Luke Shand (Hans Matheson) like Young Hendrix, who came to Lovell, will hit the team. Sparks fly as your memories, threatening to burn your unfinished goals ... <br /> <br /> Be ready to laugh, sing, rejoice and cry because these memorable characters will eat back in your heart. .
