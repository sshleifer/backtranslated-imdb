Talk about opening an explosion, "Trampa Infernal" with the coolest opening results! Musical tones inspired somewhat by the legendary "Friday 13" (Tsh-Tsh-Tsh-Ha-Ha-Ha), the names of leading players divided into huge syllables appear on the screen. The promising intro is a completely hidden Mexican slasher / backwoods survival thriller and it only gets cooler every minute that passes. Two extremely competitive and testosterone overwhelmed enemies of paintball challenge each other in a very lively bar. According to a newspaper article, there are cool bears in nearby forests, and it has killed several hunters who tried to catch it. The challenge is that anyone who kills the bear is declared to be the greatest ball set of the ultimate maso-hero. On arrival, however, it becomes clear that they are not against the bear, but overwhelmed and completely manic war veteran with their arsenal of hidden weapons and numerous victory sticks on their sleeves. After a decade of taming and slashers from the Americans, the beginning of the 90s sees Mexico's effort as refreshing and lively. The formula is simplified but effective, lead characters are sufficiently reliable and the emergence of sadistic killer confrontation is reasonably suspicious. Mania must be a fan of Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers, because he also uses his own gloves made of sharp knives and a white mask covering his face. The murderers are pleasantly disgusting and barbaric, which I really hoped for from the surprisingly mentioned opening sequences and wasting a whole lot of free blood. The forestry environment and especially the ridiculous traps are cheerfully remarkable. "Trampa Internal" is a Mexican slasher / survival sleeping bag that is warmly recommended for genre fans.
