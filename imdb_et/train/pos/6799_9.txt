This episode is a bit confusing. Some people say you have to start from the start, but I have to say that I was a little confused from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Clark hits the head and wakes up the Fairview Mental Institution and is fun to believe he is a superhero. Clark is told that the life he knew was all his head. Delusional. He also found something unusual: Marta is married to Lionel; Lex is involved in a wheelchair whose limbs have been disrupted after the bridge; and Lana is dedicated to Clark. But he finds one familiar; someone else dedicated to Clark: Chloe. He also finds that the spiritual patient is also known from the Smallville world. And the doctor is out of Phantom Zone. <br /> <br /> This episode reminds me of the Buffy episode, called "Normal Again", where Buffy begins to dream of a living day in a spiritual refuge. The doctor tried to convince him that everything he knew was his imagination and that he was really crazy. Her parents were still married, they still lived in LA, her friends didn't exist, Angel was never her boyfriend and she had no sister named Dawn. Demons and vampires also did not exist. Both episodes are a little sad because doctors don't just tell the characters that it's all his imagination, but tells us what it really is: fiction and it brings us back to reality. However, it is nice to sometimes understand reality, but let's look at these exhibitions to escape the reality. This is nice again, because the characters have to overcome the new challenges.
