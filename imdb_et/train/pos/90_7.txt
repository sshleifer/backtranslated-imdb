A poster is a pretty horrible job. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was OK ... something really spectacular ... I just hoped he would be a hardcore drug and totally trash <br /> <br /> Ahh, but it might not rich children now happen? Not a wealthy businessman who has a big ballroom party and has a nice manicured lawn in front of a mini-manor house. . After all, who's driving a brand new SUV and going to the Faculty of Law? <br /> <br /> Ah, poor little wealthy children ... in their marvelous beautiful house, where they have ivy schools, very clean homes and social parties ... what does the world do without them? I hope they all depend on drugs, lose their lives and arrive in jail ... so maybe we'll see movies that don't move around the poor little rich boys and girls in the surreal world.
