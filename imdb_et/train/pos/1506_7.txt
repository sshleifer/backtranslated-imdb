Before movies such as "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", "Suspiria" and "Halloween", horror views were changed forever, with more Goths and much less violence. Movies such as Hammer Horror and Rosemary's Baby were terrifying and exciting during the 1960s and 1970s. I can't tell you how many times I borrowed this movie in my childhood, but I did because there was something. I didn't want to limit myself to films from the 70s and 80s and zombies, and a movie like the famous, but unfortunately long gone Amicus film company was a good start. <br /> <br /> Pros: Great, terrible music score. Strong performances from the stars. Brilliant cinematography. Many good old-fashioned excitement and chills, especially in the first and last vignettes. Some haunting moments and pictures. Moves slowly but vigorously. The house is one spooky and oppressive dwelling. Excellent production design and interior design, giving the film a true old Gothic horror feeling. Depends more on mood and bloodless chills than gore and free nudity it's excitement. <br /> <br /> Cons: Some pace issues in the first half. In addition to The Cloak, the rest of the stories are talked about as before. There are many clich√©s. The second story, "Waxworks", has fine operations and moments, but it is the weakest of the four in fear and intercourse. Low budget really shows sometimes. <br /> <br /> Final Thoughts: After seeing the movie for the first time in years, I see why I rented it so often. It is in no way a masterpiece, but it is a good example of a time when horror films were made with style and class. See if the lights are off. <br /> <br /> My Rating: 3.5 / 5
