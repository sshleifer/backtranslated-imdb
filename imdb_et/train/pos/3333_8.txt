I saw it last week on NZ and wondered how it would measure both the UK movie and the book. I have to say I had a good impression. If something that fanatical joining with Red Sox has worked for years, it will work even better than the initial commitment to Arsenal FC, which has successfully passed over the years. Britina was also interested in not having to understand baseball to get what's going on. One question comes to mind - was the manuscript written as a team with Sox even before they finally broke the Bambino curse? Or was there another team in the frame? Like the Red Sox fan himself (strange I know, the British who understands baseball) I have to say that it added to pleasure.
