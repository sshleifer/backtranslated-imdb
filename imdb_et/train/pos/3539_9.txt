Good: Cinema capture, great presentation, vehicles are really fun to drive, quite appealing to multi-player, loyal to the movie and the list goes on. <br /> <br /> Bad: The main missions are a bit short. <Br /> <br /> This game defines what a "good" third-person shooter (not necessarily a spy game) has. The big firearms continue this story and make you ready for every single mission and open all the real bonuses that the game offers. Hype this game was, had lived up, and I personally think you should buy it, and hook it up with a couple of friends and play it. Fun fun. <br /> <br /> The sound in this game is a rip-roaring achievement of some of the earlier bond games and shooting really seems like shooting a gun. It relates to the aspect that you are a deadly and ruthless spy. <br /> <br /> All in all, this game will make you exciting and contented after you've done it, and some multiplayers competing with standards for the masterful James Bond "Nightfire" game for gamecube.
