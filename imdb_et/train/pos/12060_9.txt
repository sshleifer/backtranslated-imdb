I really have good old fashion production of Spooky movies. If Ismail's merchant and James Ivory had been given the task of producing such a film, it might have been except for the lack of internationally known top drawer casting. This is one of those movies that you look at alone on a dark night with a pizza and some popcorn, and you don't even have to do the dishes until morning because you just want to hide under the lid. Bravo's director Herbert Wise, writers Susan Hill and Nigel Kneale, top production project by Jon Bunker, John Ralph's artistic direction and a great example that makes me tremble and so isolated, even though I live in one of the most populated cities in the world at the beginning of the 21st century. I gave her "10" to "10" because they really made a big show because of television production and budget constraints.
