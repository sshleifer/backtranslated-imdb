This movie is one of the sleepers of all time. I gave her 10 ratings. The story is famous for "Bushwhackers" from Missouri who fought south of the country during the war. The clothes they wore were authentic, history and why they fought are very accurate and well researched. There was actually one of the battles that didn't happen when they depicted ... but not bad for Hollywood. The actors were well cast and were either the most prominent actors or the director really can make the best of them. I suspect that it was a combination of great leadership, superpower to find the right people and the great results of the actors. Not just one or two ... this movie is really pampered! It has action, romance, intercourse, good guys and bad guys (sometimes depending on your individual perspective) and history is all rolled into one movie. Even the future is Spiderman and Jewel. And he's good!
