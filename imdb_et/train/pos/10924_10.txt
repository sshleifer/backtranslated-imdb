I saw this kung fu movie when I was a kid, and I thought it was so cool! Now I'm 26 years old and my friend is on DVD! <br /> <br /> We have a brewing case and we watched this classics! It lost something from its original kung fu coolness! If you are a fan of kung fu / karate movies, it must be ... DVD is available. I believe this movie is also called "Choose Your Poison". <br /> <br /> See it soon!
