I found memorable quotes looking for video clips; they forgot one of my favorites ... <br /> <br /> Old man 1: You know, I remember the first time they did this thing. <br /> <br /> Old Man 2: You remember pterodactic. <br /> <br /> Old man 1: And I remember you fell for that, hook and sinker. <br /> <br /> Old Man 2: Oh, I didn't. <br /> <br /> Old Lady: You did it. You put a big bucket on your head and took with them the army soldiers to fight the Marques. <br /> <br /> Old Man 2: Have you not died yet?
