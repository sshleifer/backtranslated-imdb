If any movie is very different from acting, it's probably one. I've never seen the talk so harshly, but with a strong feeling. The film was disturbing at moments. However, the film was terrible in editing. The film tries to go commercial with the addition of commercial and song, but they feel inappropriate. As Karisma starts to beat and at the same time fights the SRK with the police. Ishq Kamina's song was very inappropriate. In addition, the film is too glossy at first. This direction was not bad, but certainly nothing can be said. <br /> <br /> I have to say that the actors were chosen very wisely. Without them, this film would have no effect. Karisma Kapoor has given his best role to date, and it looks great as his record after Zubeida and Fiza. She looks pretty pretty in the first half and I've never seen an actor or emotion and anger. What is most ironic is probably its weakest written role. Nana Patekar was great for her father-father. There is not much to say about him, besides, he has a role to play. Deepti Naval, as her mother, was great, especially in her last scene. Although he has little to say, his facial expressions and body language were good. Another good result was a little boy. He was divine and confident that the eyes of the viewer are tears. The movie was probably desperately saved. Sanjay Kapoor was fine, but he didn't have much to do. Shahrukh Khan was wasted in his bad boy-type role. One thing that brought the audience to the theater was Ishq Kamina. Singing and dancing a song is the perfect song for coarse words. And boy Aish is angry. The song, however, belonged to another movie only because it came at the worst. People could come to Aish, but they don't talk too much about it. Hum Tum Miley was well busy, but it seemed like dragging when the whole film was left in the mood. Damroo Bhaje was bored and nothing to rob. Dil Ne Pukara is a song boring to get the movie's mood. In spite of poor editing, performances alone have to see it.
