I only saw this movie after hearing it for years. Needless to say, the actual experience turned out to be small. However, Alec Guiness leads energetically to the grandiose when it is more or less the same as the Second World War England. <br /> <br /> This is a familiar story about inventing the best everyday product. Remember the car that works in the water? Remember the promise of nuclear power? In this case, it is a fabric that doesn't wear, wrinkle, or even dirty! Of course, fabric manufacturers and their employees are reluctant to give up the business out of the prospect and so the plot is a bit thick. <br /> <br /> Guiness makes the whole company valuable and looks at it The factory research lab is still a blast! (These Britons ... always a rigid top lip under fire.) The film can be dragged just like Guinness's nude-shaped invention, but it's a good ride.
