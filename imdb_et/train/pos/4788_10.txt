This is one of the biggest movies I've ever seen. Music and cinematography were spelled when there was little on the screen. The slow pace was determined by driving mode (lawnmower with a large trailer) and was retained by the background marks and sounds and the slow pace of other characters. <br /> <br /> The story really happened; Alvin Straight died in 1996 at the age of 76. everything was quite real, as the actors actually became characters. Sissy Spacek gave her a lovingly disabled daughter, who had suffered a lot but wanted to do so, always wanting to do it right. Richard Farnsworth was perfectly cast and he became beautifully Alvin Straight, a stubborn but loving elderly man who travels across Iowa to visit his stranger brother, Lyle, who has had a stroke. Alvin had learned a lot of wisdom during his lifetime and seemed to bring out the best people he'd walked through. <br /> <br /> The film highlights the importance of the family for this person and hopefully for all of us. I look forward to seeing it again and again. Director David Lynch proves that these films prove his leadership skills. Farnsworth was nominated for the best actress in the Academy Award; at 79, he was the oldest candidate ever to receive this award.
