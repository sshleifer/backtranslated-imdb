The first two thirds of this fetish model Betty's Page 1 biopsy is very interesting. Betty, as depicted by the enormous sincerity of Gretchen Mol, comes as a pleasing type of girl who did not see what she was doing (and was certainly not wrong with it). Directed by Mary Harron, who also made "I Shot Andy Warhol" and "American Psycho", Betty America re-creates a mix of old black and white stock footage with a new, degraded, black-and-white film. When Betty is in Florida and starts working with Bunny Yeager, the color is introduced. Betty's fame was mainly the result of her work with Paula and Irving Klaw (Lili Taylor, at an excellent stage and Chris Bauer), as well as John Willie (Jared Harris). The scenes in which Harron rediscovers Betty's enslavement photography sessions are exciting and perfectly executed. The early supplier of fetish material is not too harsh and we understand that these people were part of narrow communities. Betty never had too much of a problem because of her problems, although I get the impression that her reputation hindered her in the straightforward world of legitimacy. Since the third act of the film is practically non-existent, we have the impression that we have viewed a feature-length documentary from the Betty page rather than a structured drama. Deficiencies are missing, this is a film that is worth catching and represents another fine feather in the cap of Christine Vachon.
