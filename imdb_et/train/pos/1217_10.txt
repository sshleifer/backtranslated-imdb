I was worried that my daughter might get the wrong idea. I think the character of "Dark-Heart" is a bit harsh and I don't like how he shifts the "middle" frog, fox, out? I was wrong, this film was made for my child, not for me. He "gets it" when my head (down?) Went. Of course I can't. This is not one of the new children's movies that adults can enjoy. It is easy for young people and the team knew what they were doing. There is no political junket. There is no magic key to save the world from itself, who has no right to excessive access and not all at all times satisfied. And if there is a side benefit, no one! russwill.
