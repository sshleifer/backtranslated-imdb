I first saw this movie in the early 90s when it first appeared. The view was just out. Enchanted April had so much to offer! I found it to be much more real and earthy. At the end of the film, I felt the same thing I did when I first saw BBC Pride and Prejudice's output, I missed the characters finding what they were looking for, whether it was isolation, peace, freedom or love. You have the idea that Italy is so far away from anything they have ever known that they are so dangerous that they take risks and leave everything that is terrible and restrictive. In the spring of April, however, everyone's life gets loose and loose (in line with Victorian corsets) and is slowly restored to everyone's satisfaction. Which movie is pretty small! How is it no longer known?
