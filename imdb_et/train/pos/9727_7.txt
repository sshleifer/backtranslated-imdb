Simon Pegg plays a rude crude oil and is often checked by a celebrity journalist who has been presented in England on behalf of a great American magazine. Of course, his winning ways create all sorts of complications. Fun, fact-based comedies that celebrate Kristen Dunst (rather grown up), Danny Huston and Jeff Bridges. It works mainly because we like Simon Pegg despite his bad behavior. We fully understand why Kristen Dunst continues to talk to him despite frequent screwing. I liked the movie. It is not all and finish all but it was a nice way to close the evening sitting on the couch watching the movies. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
