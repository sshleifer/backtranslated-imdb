This man is not amazing. You really feel that you would have lived your life with them during all these tragic events and cry with your family eventually. He was so passionate about his interests, not only for himself, but also for others who would survive him not to go through this evil pain. I watch this video every time I have a bad or "down" day, and I always manage to see a great and brighter life, as Jonny did, even with his unbearable pains. My only regret has never been known to Jonny before, because I visited England twice in my lifetime and I could have said I met him. It is comforting to know that Jonny is sitting on his cloud, pain free! Rest in peace, dear Jonny. You deserve it!
