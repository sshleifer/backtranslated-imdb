Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper can still turn their smiles into the world. The combined talent of these two wonderful stars will make the combination of revival / new film work. Look at this and look forward to sixty beating! Mary violates the youth-oriented society with spirit and charm. The drama adds 2000 realism. The follow-up of TV series would expand new characters and give us the opportunity to see Lou Grant, Phyllis, Sue Ann, Murray and Georgette!
