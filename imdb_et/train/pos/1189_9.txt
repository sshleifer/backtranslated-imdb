Last Hunt is one of the few westerners who ever made Buffalo a hunt for both sport and business, as well as Indian flat levels. Before the white man was on the other side of Mississippi, the plains of the American Bison were large and some of our biggest cities. For the period when the last wolf was set up, the buffaloes were all left out. In the 20th century, due to the efforts of nature conservationists, the population of the species was revived, but not as it once was. <br /> <br /> Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger take part in the second movie together and it's much better than all the brothers were Valiant. Here Stewart Granger is a good guy, a tired buffalo hunter of the world, who has to return for the financial considerations he hates. Forgetting for a moment, Taylor, I doubt if it was ever more nonsense, a nastierem soul than Charlie Gilsen, who represents Taylor. In Devil's Doorway he was an American Indian who fought against the prejudices posed by racists by Louis Calhern. In the last wolf he is racist here. He kills both buffalo and Indians for pure joy. He kills one Indian family when they steal mules and take one prisoner. Like a barbarian conqueror, he also looks forward to the delight of Debra Paget's sexual preferences. He's really angry when Paget doesn't see that. <br /> <br /> No matter how often they refer to Russ Tamblyn as half-days, I was never really convinced that he was part of India. This is the only weakness I found in the last wolf. <br /> <br /> But Lloyd Nolan, a great old buffalo Taylor and Granger, is just great. Nolan steals every scene with which he is cast. <br /> <br /> For those who love their western nations who want to see Robert Taylor, never seen on the screen and who don't like cheap heroes, the last hunt is ideal.
