This film was classic. I have to say that this film hit the best working man studying his mistakes. if we could all get together and learn how everyone participated in this movie. It was an important part of showing how the family is an important part of life, and if pride can lose something important in life, if we can't find "BIG THROAT" and swallow it with pride.
