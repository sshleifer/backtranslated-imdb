I love this example and my 11 year old daughter and I love watching it together. It teaches good old-fashioned values ​​in a fun, adventurous and entertaining way (albeit most of the time). It's also fun to entertain ... the message, rewind and place your dialogue instead of the actors. <br /> <br /> I have my DVR set to record all episodes and I happened to catch the episode tail (just before the next start ... so I don't know what episode it was), but there was an absolutely TERRIBLE sequencing error ! Adam had handed Sheriff Coffee a small "leather" color that broke some legal coat when he tried his escape, I think. <br /> <br /> Put it on the table and put it right where it was torn. Swatch was exactly rectangular ... what I think would be skin skin (Naugahyde of the 1950s? Yes, skin? I don't think) almost impossible to tear. Well, the trolley rose well and the mystery was solved. <br /> <br /> Not 10 seconds later on the scene, we will once again see the coat that is still on Roy's desk. But this time, this color is similar to the North Carolina shape and is now in a completely different place on the coat (but still completely in line with the coat hole) and the seam (which is in the middle of the WAS) swatch is now ... like a seam in a coat. My daughter laughed when we played a short scene over and over again! This is the main thing on youtube, I say ya! <br /> <br /> We still love this example and the sequencing errors make it fun!
