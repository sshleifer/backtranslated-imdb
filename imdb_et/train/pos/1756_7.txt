'' 40-year-old virgin '' made me laugh. I don't care if it is considered a very sexual comedy, I just enjoyed a lot of jokes and scenes in the movie. Steve Carell is perfect as a virgin nerd Andy Stitzer and I think that the scene where Andy has removed her chest by wax is one of the coolest, especially since it's real. Many of the actors and actors in this movie are well known or famous. <br /> <br /> Andy Stitzer has a peaceful life. She is a bit strange and collects a lot of toys, but it looks harmless. One day, when they play poker with their friends, they discover that Andy is actually ... virgin! And he's already 40 years old! After this surprising revelation, all her friends with Andy's wife are trying to sleep ... the problem is the confusion in which Andy enters, especially now that she really is like Trish, the woman she bought in the DVD shop in the shop she works for.
