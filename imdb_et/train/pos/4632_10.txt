Eytan Fox, director and editor, writer / highly acclaimed director of the 2002 mini-function "Yossi & Jagger" (2002). This comparative epic, 1 hour after 53 minutes, is another good romantic drama in which we have to deal with the tragedy and celebrate the beauty and joy of life. Westerners, especially like myself, like homosexual men, need to be moved outside our danger zone and be aware of the real life and death struggle elsewhere so that we can truly love. <br /> <br /> "Yossi & Jagger" A couple of gay lovers focused on closed Israeli military service, "Ha Buah" focuses on a civilian group of friends, both straight and gay, who share an Israeli unit generally gay-friendly, but not always gay-friendly, the capital of Tel Aviv. <br /> <br /> "Ha Buah" opens with a dramatic border checkpoint where Noam (Ohad Knoller? Yossi & Yags & Jagger) first meets the beautiful young Arabian Ashraf (Yousef Sweid). Romance will soon flourish? but for the political climate to be swiftly or completely eliminated, the complex interplay between citizens' members and lovers and the inevitable impact of Ashraf's very conservative family will come here. If you closely follow the dialogue with this movie, you have no reason to end the disappointment. <br /> <br /> The "Ha Buah" soundtrack is lively and the visuals are as beautiful as the harsh ones? that means real life in the Middle East. <br /> <br /> English subtitles are very easy to follow and you can quickly relax and appreciate the best of the world cinema.
