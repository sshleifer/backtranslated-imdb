It must be the best adaptation I see it to be my favorite, and I think it is very close to the book. What really does this is to see if there are two main actors. The wonderful Timothy Dalton is the best Rochester I has seen on the screen clotting and tragic, while Zelah Clarke is the perfect combination of strength, courage, shyness and gentleness like Jane. The story (as I'm sure most people know) is that young and ordinary Jane Eyre is a teacher of charity school for girls from the 19th century who advertises her services as newspapers. Governor of the Great House of Thornfield Hall instructor Adele, the young congregation of the hall, the mysterious and respected owner, Mr. Rochester. As the months go by, she falls in love with Jane and applies some situations to try and see if Jane is just as mad with her. But there is a secret that awaits the discovery of Thornfield Hall and its impact is devastating. It is a moving and well-functioning drama with nice places and gorgeous costumes plus as I mentioned before, I worked particularly well in Zelah and Timothy.
