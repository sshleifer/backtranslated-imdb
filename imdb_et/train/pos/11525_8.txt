This movie is fantastic for three main reasons. It's aesthetically beautiful. I loved it completely. The whole theme of the movie is with extraordinary costumes and scenic sets. A photo that looks very expensive (and probably not) will complement the look. I always enjoy these stories from the misfits / groups of individuals who come together and become families. Sometimes they get into clich√©s, but it is not. This group of participants really represents bad, but extremely pleasant signs. Alan Larkin is the best (between him, the van and the movie theme, I couldn't help but remember last year's favorite movie Little Miss Sunshine ??). I discovered Fabrizio Bentivoglio, a very interesting actor, and just bothered a little bit of Til Schweiger's performance at times. Open the scene, all the scenes in which they interrupt their tricks are very funny. The film has all the humor and emotions. I like the end a lot. And, of course, it's all about magic. A good magician will make the audience where he wants an illusion. What happens exactly what the film director does and why they call it a film magic.
