I have to admit that this film is totally shocked. For one, I was going to see it waiting for something mediocre, but the most shocking thing about it was that it was a populist cinema at all. It's British comedy at its finest - dark, peculiar and funny, so American movies will never be. However, I have to stop to recommend it to everyone; I went to see it with a lot of people, some English, some Europeans, and some American, and although some of us loved it (mostly from the first two groups), some hated it and found it worthless. If you think you've got into such things, go. If not, don't. 10/10.
