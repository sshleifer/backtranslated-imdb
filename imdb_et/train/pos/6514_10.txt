I thought the children of the exhibition did a great job. I especially liked filling Emma's character. Well done! The tricks were pretty good for a small budget exhibition. I was able to watch the movie and enjoy it without my watch every 5 minutes. I enjoyed scenes with a tooth fairy and his burning. The ghostly manifestation of the souls of the children being released was also good. Another good movie point is that he moved on. There were not many slow scenes. Adult managers were also credible and thus helped show entertainment. All in all, it is an enjoyable nightlife.
