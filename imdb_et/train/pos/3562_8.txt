Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) is the leader of New York's longest-running floating craps game and needs $ 1,000 to secure a new location. In terms of his contributions, he trusts the highest roll of the city, Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando), that he is not going to be a cheerful missionary Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons). "Boys and Dolls (1955)" is such a great musical as it blends into the contrasting style of film and stage. During the dazzling opening sequence, the number of pedestrians will move in the rhythm, stop and start as if they had responded to the back. Even the foot movements themselves are stylized and angled, between walking and dancing. The City of Mankiewicz New York is a brilliant excitement of art deco color and motion, a fantasy world that is so completely removed from reality that even underground gambling and criminal relationships seem to be completely brilliant. <br /> <br /> As I write this review, I just got the word Jean Simmons has been at the age of 80. It was incredibly first when I saw her in the movie, but she dazzled me from the beginning. His idealistic and sexually repressed Sarah comes out of his shell after the alcohol in Havana, allowing himself to play If I Were A Bell. Although both Simmons and Brando were non-singers, Sam Goldwyn decided not to duplicate his vocals, claiming that "maybe you don't sound as good, but at least it is you." Despite Goldwyn's confidence, the couple are doing so well that they carry the entire musical number. Simmons suggests the same kind of resemblance to children that Audrey Hepburn could bring, and Brando expresses such confidence and charisma that it is not important that her singing voice does not exist.
