The latest film by Spanish director Agusti Villaronga is a study of how children who experience violence and isolation in their distant community will become worrying young adults who need some psychic means to cope with their hidden mental weakness. Whether these tools are a religion that follows a fanatical level, cared for others, or simply puts a maso image into men's prostitute, Villaronga is building a successful investigation into how these gardens affect three teenagers living in France, France. Three witnesses are a disturbing double death or their friends before they are teenagers and then embarrassing emotions they feel with their peers' weak bodies until they meet once again in hospitals suffering from tuberculosis. <br /> <br /> The kinematic style of the text is typically visual, as expected by the Spanish author, and is reminiscent of the work of the Spaniards Pedro Almodovar with sexual desire, both heterosexual and homosexual. There is a different element between the two directors that Villaronga favors a supernatural alatone combined with claustrophobic and sharp realism, which contradicts the use of Almodov's surrealism, although both styles are similar. <br /> <br /> The piece gives an overview of the difficulties of the young psyche and contains disruptive violence and sexual scenes. I highly recommend watching this movie because it contains elements that will remain in the audience a lot of time after viewing.
