This is another film I've seen from East Lupine as a director after the 53rd tournament. I think it was a better film than that. It has a girl who is married and then sexually assaulted and doesn't like everyone who is looking for her and speaks, so she runs away and the family takes it. I think Leonard Maltin's review is just right to give it 2 and 1/2 stars.
