Passionate, dramatic, riveting like Flamenco himself, the film is just amazing. It is placed on the immortal music of Bizet. Original music is written and performed by one of the greatest classical guitars, Paco de Lucia, a supporter of contemporary flamenco style, who plays the same name musician. Legendary Flamenco dancer and choreographer Antonio Gades wrote the script and choreographed this fabulous version of Georges Bizet / Prosper Mérimée's short story / opera. He plays the famous dancer / choreographer main character Antonio, who deals with the story of Carmen in a flamenco style that combines dances with singing and rhythmic hands, and has a very high level of dynamism that observers enormously like. /> <br /> Excellent and graceful Cristina Hoyos, whose technical excellence meets the elegant artistry of her dance, seems to have a supporting role. Hoyos was the first dancer of Gades for twenty years (1968-1988) and he was the protagonist of three films made by Carlos Saura at Gades' three major exhibitions: "Bodas de Sangre" (1978), "Carmen" (1983) and "El Amor Brujo" (1985). The magnificent Laura del Sol is a young dancer named Carmen, whom Antony sees from the first perspective another Carmen, who was killed by two Frenchmen, the writer Prosper Mérimée in his most famous novel in 1846, inspired by George Bizet's world-famous Opéra-Comique version since 1875. <br /> <br /> Like the opera and the short story, Carmen Saura is a desirable and deadly movie, the ultimate femme fatale who must be free. He could not tolerate any man's overwhelming love and would prefer death. There's a story and opera on about 50 movie customization screens and as different as they are, they all have a common tragic ending. The Saura / Gades film is unique as the most sensitive and truly Spanish language. I loved it for the first time when I saw it more than twenty years ago and it's so special and beautiful today as it was. Highly recommended.
