I liked this movie, mainly because I enjoy seeing Sean Connery's act and have an extra bonus for Ed Harris and Lawrence Fishburne. The story is a grandmother who is looking for Connery's help because her grandchild is in jail and she says she has been wrongly convicted. At first it seems that the racist aspects of the case may be, but later it turns out that the case leader was black, and he seems to have done some bad things to force him out of the hour. Well, the boy is trying to bring to another killer who is locked in the same prison that is dying. He is also a very disgusting person because he takes the joy he made by writing the relatives of his victims and trying to post people. Many turns where some are somewhat unexpected. I just enjoyed the character of Sean Connery, trying to understand the whole challenge. The film also made me hate in the areas, especially when you find out what finally happened. There is a very good interaction between Connery and Harris and Connery and Fishburne because they all look pretty good here. Ultimately, it's a pretty good stop / thriller.
