The masses ignore the message of the world on the brink of war; Everytown's mythical city in 1940 represents England in general, but it can be as good for every nation in the world. When the war finally comes, it will not be a destruction for five years, but until 1966, when Everytown has been completely destroyed. Adding humanity to destruction and taxation is a "wandering disease," a pest that lasts four years. <br /> <br /> "Things to Come" balances both fatalistic and futuristic worldviews, where science stays in the hope of revived civilization. The "Wings Over the World" concept plays a bit dirty, though its spokesman Cabal (Raymond Massey) is steadfast in his mission and committed to his problem. If he fails, others will follow. This message has been constantly strengthened throughout the film, convincingly ending the end of Massey's film call. The insatiable need of a person to test the boundaries of knowledge and achievement requires a "whole universe or something" mindset. <br /> <br /> The film's automation and machine image on the other side resembles a large silent movie "Metropolis". Since Everytown has been rebuilt and redesigned by 2036, a resonant chord is struck by the city's rebirth, as today's urban architecture shows that the film's profoundly prophetic vision is coming. If sixty-seven years later the film gets wrong, the man's first mission is a month, but in 1936 the one hundred-year schedule probably seemed more justifiable than 1969. which makes you think. In which side do you get down, forces to move ahead of uncertainty or maintain the status quo? This is not a convenient question because both options offer inherent hazards and unknown results. Those who decide to be bystanders can take away the forces that are out of control.
