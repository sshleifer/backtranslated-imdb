If the marriage kills, I think it is very touching and sort of heartbreaking about the consequences of anorexic or bulimia. Whenever Lexi (Katie Wright) or Jennifer (Marley Shelton) threw up, I wanted to vomit myself. It's hard to explain why. If you asked me, they would have had to work more together. But I enjoyed seeing them doing things together and getting lectures from their parents. Before I write it down, I would like to say, "If you ask me, HOW IS QUESTION, it really shows how anorexia or bulimic affect the human body." has not seen it. You're having a tear and a good time, so the next time it's on TV, hit back with a friend and see it.
