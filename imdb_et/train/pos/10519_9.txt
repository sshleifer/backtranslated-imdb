I'm a big fan of Jane Austen and after a full-length movie (a real fan wants to see as little left as possible and can only be achieved in the mini-series), it was really great. Gwyneth Paltrow really strikes a little failed but good-willed rich girl and Jeremy Northam, who is Mr Knightly's boyfriend and nobility. I was not happy with Ewan McGregor, although I like him as a very actress, but I didn't feel that it was a movie at all. As I said, as a fan of Jane Austen, I would have liked to see that it would not be, but it would have made it much longer than the allowed length film and as I felt they really did. I've seen all the adjustments in this book and I felt it was the best!
