This is a very good Spanish film, but I'm worried that many of them are missing out because many people in the world don't know what the Spanish Civil War was like or when it was. Being a history teacher, I had a great advantage, but I can easily see how the film can cause confusion until you get all the pieces together. I doubt whether this would be a big problem in Spain, where the film was made, but for other audiences it may be confusing for the film later. <br /> <br /> The film begins with 12-year-old Carol and her mother returned to her mother's hometown. Years have passed and you collect that they come to Spain from New York. Despite the oddity, Carol speaks a relatively good Spanish language and much of the film is about how he adapts. Why she and her mother are alone, I will leave it now for those who are not talking about Carol's father fighting on the Republican side in the war (who eventually lost that very bloody conflict)). <br /> <br /> The movie has extraordinary characters for beautiful work and music. A relatively slow and striking pace is not a bad thing if you are someone who receives movies in this way. I've seen many other Spanish films about this war and it compares them quite well - not better or worse - just a decent movie about those who are behind, as well as a nice age flick. PS - If you do not know what the side is, then the Republicans were mostly socialists, and they were supported by the Soviet Union and Mexico, and volunteers from many countries (including the USA). The national parties were led by Franco and supported by Portugal and the fascist countries of Germany and Italy.
