"Zu: Magical Hill Warriors" was and is an impressive classic! Using the special effects of Tsui Hark was very creative and inventive. (He continued this trilogy of Chinese Ghost Story and later productions.) Even today, it can measure the genre of others. "Legend of Zu" is linked to "Zu" warriors from a magical hill "! This movie does not need to be understood to understand this movie. The plot is a bit difficult to follow. It's all about action and adventure! I always wondered what Tsui Hark is doing, when she got her hands on the CGI, now we know she made this movie, beautiful that I'm not going to be critical about it. There's so much on the screen, you just don't think so! this movie is not shown here in the theaters of the Netherlands. The movie is screaming from the time of the screen in cinemas! This movie can easily fight big budget Hollywood productions like "Superman Returns" or Xmen 3. The only thing I have to mention is a sense of humor, fantasy, martial arts and humor, somehow it is not missing in this movie, these little questions. "Let's Zu" give the action the most beautiful special effects.
