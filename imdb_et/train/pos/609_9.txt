A very enjoyable, very imaginative and cinematic fairy tale all rolled into one, Stardust tells us that a young man who lives outside the fantasy world goes in to recover a little fallen star to find a star, young and beautiful. The king, whose king is going to die, told the king to unleash his multi-son contest to see who can become the king of ruby ​​first, while the trio of sorcerers wants the star to cut and use them to keep the young. These three plots of yarn weave in complexity throughout the picture, mixed with good, dazzling special effects, and some strong feelings and humor. Stardust is a fun movie and he has fun performances from Claire Danes' similar stars, because star (I looked at him for some time), playing with terrible witch Robert Denir, playing the horny witch Robert Denir, played a terrifying witch. Charlie Cox, as head of Tristan, is good and trustworthy, and we get a very good job from a group of pups playing sons to be kings who try to kill each other consistently and consistently. Mark Strong, Jason Flemyng and Ruppert Everett play their role in both life and death (they also loved it all). Peter O'Toole plays the father of a deadly killer and watches the funny guy Ricky Gervais, who made me laugh more than anything in the movie in his short five minutes (nice foot). But the real power of the film is Neil Gaiman's novel and a script made of his creative and fruitful mind. Stardust creates mythology and my world and it works.
