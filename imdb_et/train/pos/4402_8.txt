After seeing Jesse James, Quantrill, jayhawkers, etc. in the fifties, it is quite exciting to see this film with a new angle from director Ang Lee. Lawrence (Kansas) attack scene is fantastic. The romantic relationship between Jewel and Toby Mcguire is one of the best parts and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is a prominent man. All the time this film makes you feel the fear of war and the desperate situation of the main characters who don't know if they are going to survive the next hour. Definitely worth seeing.
