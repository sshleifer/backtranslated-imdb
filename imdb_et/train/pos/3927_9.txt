OK, first correcting the tag posted on the main page of this movie. Abe Lincoln did not go with her sister in the movie or finish her sister's grave. This person is Ann Rutledge, who was a very close friend of Lincoln in his New Salem days. Some say Ann was actually a Lincoln girlfriend, but there is no evidence to support it. <br /> <br /> This film now has preparations and fiction. Hollywood has always taken a dramatic license under the sun and "Young Mr. Lincoln" is no exception. The court case incident in the film is based on a real event: William's "Duff" accusation of Armstrong's murder, and while this film is largely in fiction with a lot of name changes, it still has the viewers cursed: the screen. This is the Hollywood golden age, the drama is the best, and Henry Fonda gives the best possible Lincoln to everyone playing.
