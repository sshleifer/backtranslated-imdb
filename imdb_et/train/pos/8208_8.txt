I liked almost all the movies in the Dirty Harry series, except what I think is called "Enforcer". "Deadpool" was also a bit weak in the regions, but I still enjoyed it. This is one of my favorites if nothing more than "Continue my day". It also contains an interesting plot if someone kills those who have done wrong. Just think of "Magnum Force", which has fewer secrets about who's behind the killings and you have your own plot. In this case, it is a bit more than a very nice final showdown in the amusement park. It also has Dirty Harry, who gives the bulldog a gift, and it pulls Sandra Locke into a rather humorous scene. The only question that remains is why Clint Eastwood had to have so mediocre actor Sandra Locke in so many films. He will drop the score every time, even if the film is enjoyable for me. He's not bad here, but someone else could have been so much better. Another problem with this movie and other Dirty Harry movies, sometimes they seem to be almost arms ads. I like weapons as much as the next person, but do we really need his scenes to explain all the different strengths of his latest weapon and how many bullets? However, a very nice entry into the Dirty Harry movie series.
