I saw this movie with my family and it was great! This movie is more than just a documentary (which does not offer more than cold facts) with long mono / dagger and many charts ... The full "power" of this movie comes from impressive images that are filmed under water, by watching this movie to learn more about our planet as reading a book, it shows that we are a hidden living environment. This movie is not just for "environmental fanatics", although people who want to watch a good movie with the message should watch it. This film taught me that we are not just living on earth ... we live together and through the earth, and all plants and animals grow and die with us.
