For some reason this film seems to be a bad criticism. Probably just by mass. Anyway, this is actually a very interesting movie. The film is a budgeted sci-fi movie that actually works because of an interesting story and well done scenes. <br /> <br /> This movie may not be for everyone. If any Sci-Fi fan reads it, I recommend this movie if you like good oil literature. The film has crazy ideas. This includes countries that are fighting with GIGANTIC machines, which the entire country invests all! The world is divided into regions. Anyone can challenge someone from the war or rather from the "robot duel". The method of warfare is cleaner than the nuclear war because now all these are wearing a breathing mask. Define a movie that makes you think. Intelligent, well-written and good effects on a crazy budget. <br /> <br /> I tend to like movies that have small budgets and are actually working.
