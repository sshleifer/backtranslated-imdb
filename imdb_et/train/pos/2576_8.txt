I'm from "Christopher Reeve's generation" that it is fair to say that he was still the best actor to play Superman, but it doesn't stop me from enjoying the roles of other players, and George Reeves makes a good deal at the top of Chris, although he just barely stays. It doesn't stop me from enjoying this movie, it's a lot of it. It has everything the film needs, a plot at the beginning, middle, and end, and all these parts are intelligently written. The film is nervous both at exhibitions and on stage, with a movie-noir, but with tights. The story is so exciting and meaningful, it's a movie whose message isn't too preaching. I'm still surprised that it was shot for more than 12 days, Oh Hollywood Award Days, when we didn't have to wait 5 years to see if the movie would go into development hell ... The film is polished and expertly done, directed by Lee "Roll'em" Sholem, best known for both speed and efficiency. It does not allow the technology constraints to slow down, in fact, some creative things that have been done to create the effects of flights, including lifting the camera onto the truck and seeing high-speed shooting and high-speed driving so that it looks out of Superman's perspective, also some of George's close-ups in process work and longtime animated film Superman. <br /> <br /> It is now available on DVD in the first season of George Reeves TV series. Including a DVD that has its own ownership right in the original as a whole is icing on the cake. <br /> <br /> Bless your blood today with God!
